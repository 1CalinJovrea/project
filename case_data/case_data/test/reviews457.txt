Only soars on Denzel Washington's fantastic performance

Flight is the kind of movie that studio marketing departments seem to
hate. Watching the trailer, it gives the feeling of a lighter film,
dramatic, with some suspense. It does not, however, indicate that this
is an incredibly dark film about the depths and perils of addiction.
The trailer gives a completely different idea of what this movie is
going to be about, but with Denzel Washington's "Whip" Whitaker doing
cocaine about thirty seconds into the runtime, one can safely throw
away any thoughts they may have had about it.Mr. Washington stars as Captain Whitaker, piloting a flight from
Florida to Georgia; a relatively short flight, but when something goes
wrong at 30,000 feet, the quick-thinking and talented Whip rolls the
plane to pull it out of its dive and ends up crash-landing, saving the
lives of all but six people on-board the plane. The namesake sequence
of the film is probably its best, filled with amazing tension and some
stellar effects.Washington absolutely shines in this role, and being an actor of
immeasurable talent, there is no question why he is up for an Academy
Award for best actor. His acting is the kind of amazing that doesn't
even require words- near the end of the film, his performance is
absolutely heartbreaking, and Denzel Washington wears it in his face.
Sadly, the rest of the film (outside of scene-stealing performances
from John Goodman and James Badge Dale) isn't really up to par. The
film follows Whip's self-destructive alcoholism as he is caught up in
an investigation into the cause of the plane crash; friends try to help
him and are spurned, he is alienated from his family, and he finds
fleeting comfort in strangers such as Nicole (Kelly Reilly).This is where the film runs into problems, however. It wastes far too
much screen time developing Nicole's character only to drop her off the
face of the Earth. She enters Whip's life as a common ally, someone
battling her own demons and addictions, but she is seeking help. She
then vanishes from it just as quickly. Her character isn't all that
interesting to begin with, and the same can be said for most of the
rest of the characters and the story in the film; they only serve as a
backdrop, a mirror through which Whip's many, many demons are
reflected.Flight is, unfortunately, a film without much of a sense of direction.
Robert Zemeckis seems to be all over the place, pouring multitudes of
attention into Nicole's character, the plane crash, and Whip battling
his demons, and it never seems to make up its mind as to what it's
about. The film never, for a moment, questions whether Whip is actually
at fault for the plane crash, and in fact it was his actions that saved
many lives. Maybe it is Washington's poise and gravitas in the scene,
but it never feels like Whip isn't in control. True that he is drunk
and on drugs, and has many serious, serious problems, but saving the
lives of ninety-six people (himself included) wasn't one of them. So
while the plane crash story is certainly interesting, there's never any
doubt about exactly how it is going to play out.Flight could have been a better film if it had capitalized on the
success of the tension it so well displayed early during the plane
crash. Whip's story, his battles with his numerous demons- and
ultimately, his freedom from them- are moving and wonderful to watch.
If Zemeckis hadn't tried to shoehorn in this ridiculous investigation
plot that never really merits any attention, it would have been that
much better. Washington gives a five-star performance, but the rest of
Flight lands at a dismal Three and a half out of Five Stars.Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!
