Alien tech means logic is no longer needed...

How stupid do the script writers think the viewing audience is?If the movie were made for four year olds, it would be an insult to
their intelligence....Great first 10 minutes or so then we are expected to leave logic and
believability behind...Making no sense doesn't seem to bother the director and producers...The sphere can set up a planet to teach all other civilizations how to
defend against the bad aliens...and it's credentials for doing so?
Their planet got wiped out by said aliens and even the lower
intelligence earthlings, using replicated, imitated weapons ripped from
the bad aliens can shoot it down over the moon...yeah...great teachers
they'll be...The Queen can survive a fusion bomb blast but her shield falls under
minor weapon fires...The Queen can control all the alien ships but yeah, let the two hero's
craft shoot at her for fun before taking over control...And having all her fighters surround her...I guess to offer her
protection...but they just kept flying round and round like an
amusement park ride when the two rogue fighters decide to attack her...An ex president's daughter who no longer flies can just commandeer a
fighter...to fly alongside her father, who couldn't walk properly in
the beginning of the film but can still fly a new age jet...all the air
forces around the world obviously overdoing their pilot screening a
tad...The list goes on and on...I can't be bothered to write them all down or
I might be writing an entire new script or story line...I want my time and money back...as well as compensation for ruining my
fond memory of the first film...
