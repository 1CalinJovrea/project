Ehhh... seriously?

I was honestly expecting a lot more, given the multiple nominations for
awards. I really thought this movie was overdone and could have been
pared down by at least 45 minutes. In the end, it was just a glorified
"we killed bin laden" pseudo-documentary. The character relationships
never developed and seemed empty. And I didn't really find the main
actress very believable or that great. Scenes of shooting dead bodies
also were probably a bit too much -- overall this movie seemed overly
nationalistic and simplistic without delivering much in the way of
content. I thought Hurt Locker was a significantly better movie. Again,
I am somewhat surprised at the number of award nominations this movie
received.
