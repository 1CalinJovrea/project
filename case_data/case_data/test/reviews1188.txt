A brilliant character study, that blends a powerful story with great humor

I really liked this film, as unorthodox as it was. The first hour was
uproariously funny, before becoming a deep, and poignant study of the
millions of lives of Americans who are living on the fringes of
society, just barely surviving day to day. There is a shocking lack of
cinema devoted to this underclass, and seeing this small film, was
refreshing, enlightening, and surprising, and a refreshing contrast to
the plutocracy we see all around us today. The performances were outstanding. I am not sure where Bria Vinaite has
been hiding, but she was astonishing as the mom, Hailey. Her daughter
and all of the other kids were great, and their interactions, behavior,
dialogue and play was hysterical. Then it kind of morphed into a more
serious story, that was credible, and powerful. Willem Dafoe was his
usual masterful self, and played a very real, very likable guy. A tough
guy with a heart of gold. I highly recommend this film. Not for everyone. Several people walked
out during the film. My presumption was that they either thought the
film focused too much time on the kids, or they were living in a state
of denial, like so many Americans these days, pretending that this huge
underclass does not exist. Regardless, it felt like a story that needed
to be told. And it was told very well. Kudos to the filmmakers.
