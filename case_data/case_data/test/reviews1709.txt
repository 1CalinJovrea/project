Exceptional movie!!!

I had the honor and privilege of seeing The Promise at the TIFF and
have to honestly say that this movie was exceptional on many fronts. It
is a must see for anyone that loves historical epic movies. The movie
is beautifully written, directed, produced and all of the actors did a
fabulous job taking the audience through their trials and tribulations
of the characters that they were portraying. It depicts a charming love
story whilst also shining a light on human rights, dignity and freedom
that was denied to over 1.5 million Armenians during the Armenian
Genocide in the year 1915. I encourage everyone to go and see this
movie when it comes out in theatres as they too will be moved as much
as I was and hopefully the take away message will be that factual
history cannot be denied and should teach all of humanity to never let
it happen again.
