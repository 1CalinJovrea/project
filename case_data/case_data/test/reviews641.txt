Try The New and Improved"Hercules"! Now Completely 'Mythology' Free!

If you're a fan of the Mythology of Hercules in any way, shape or form
and expect to see it in this film, you will be sorely disappointed.
This film has pulled a complete "World-War-Z" and left absolutely
EVERYTHING about the original mythology out except for the fact that it
is called "Hercules". But what about all that awesome trailer footage? You know, of Hercules
and his amazing feats of heroism? Surprise! Nothing but trailer fodder
that is all over in the first 2 minutes of the film. The main focus and
theme of the film is how Hercules is NOT the Hercules from myth and
legend. So right off the bat the trailer has straight up lied to you. But don't worry, what they leave out from the actual mythology of
Hercules they more than make up for in plot points that are VERY
BLATANTLY stolen from every other medieval/ancient era epic film made
in the last 20 years. Everything from beginning the film with the ever
popular "you think you know the story of Hercules? Here's the REAL
story of Hercules" narrative, to timeless clich√© classics like
"sidekick leaves due to differing views but returns during climactic
battle to save the day". Even if you aren't looking for a true-to-its-roots Hercules movie, this
movie is so completely generic you could substitute just about any
other epic of the same genre and you'd swear it was the same movie.
Right down to the costumes and battle sequences. The story is painfully
predictable, the jokes are hammy and don't fit the tone of the genre,
the characters are stock, wooden and forgettable, the fight scenes are
boring, the action is unsatisfying.Bottom line, if you aren't a Hercules fan looking for actual Hercules
action then you'll be less disappointed than I, but I would still
recommend skipping it and saving your money by simply watching
Troy/Braveheart/Kingdom of Heaven/Beowulf/Robin Hood/300 instead; the
experience will be the same, I promise. However, if you have ever
enjoyed the mythology of Hercules and want to see some of it brought to
life then this is not the film for you. It is the cinematic equivalent
of biting into a chocolate chip cookie only to find out they're
actually raisins.
