A bloody good time.

The Belko Experiment is a messed up film and it's wildly entertaining.The Belko Experiment is an indie film that's essentially about a office
building that gets shut down and the people inside are forced to kill
each other.Here's the good.The story in this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat practically
the whole run time of the movie. It's a physiological horror film that
really asks the audience, "What would you do in this situation?". I was
lucky enough to be at a screening of the film with writer/producer
James Gunn and the director Greg McLean and most of the cast. They
talked a lot about how there was no villain in this movie, which is
something I loved. The people in this movie were all acting for
themselves, doing what they need to do for their family or for
survival. The story in the beginning and the middle is very interesting
and will keep the audience entertained well after the movie is over.The acting is this movie is, for the most part, believable and good.
Tony Goldwyn, John Gallagher Jr., and Sean Gunn were the standouts of
this movie. Tony was terrifying, and just as he talked about during the
Q and A at the screening, his character wasn't a villain. His character
was doing what he had to do to make sure he could come home to his
family again, even if is terrible. John Gallagher Jr. does a fantastic
job as the main character. He displays a wide variety of emotions
perfectly and pulls off a really really good performance, surpassing
his acting in 12 Cloverfield Lane. The real standout of this movie is
Sean Gunn who did a fantastic job with his character. He has some of
the best and most memorable lines in the whole film. It's amazing to
see how far Sean Gunn has gone in his acting ability when compared to
his role in James Gunn's Super. Everyone in the movie, including the
extras, pulled off great performances.The technical parts of this movie are very well done. I have tons of
respect for this movie's use of practical effects which added a lot of
horror to the movie's tone. The cinematography in this movie was
impressive, keeping a lot of shots close to give off a claustrophobic
feeling. The lighting in this movie is used perfectly. Towards the
latter half of the movie, many action sequences were lit uniquely. A
action scene lit by a neon light and fire or a flickering light,
whatever the case, it built the suspense. Here's the bad.The ending of this film is different. It didn't really set up the
ending all that well and left the audience wanting something a bit
more. It didn't ruin the fun of the movie but with a better ending it
could have been a lot better. For a movie to me great it needs to have
an ending that leaves the audience satisfied and this movie has trouble
doing that. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a thrill ride. When the action and
horror and suspense hits, it hits hard. The acting from everyone is
entertaining and believable, many performances being especially good.
The lighting and cinematography add a lot to the overall tone of the
film which makes it a lot more effective. While the ending leaves you
wanting more, you'll still be thinking about this movie for days to
come.
