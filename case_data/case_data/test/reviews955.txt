Great romantic movie about a brilliant man, ironically very little science

But it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal
struggle with his illness that's very uplifting.The story of Stephen Hawking and his then wife Jane, apparently based
on a book she wrote about it, which probability explains why there was
not much science in the movie, not that I'm complaining, as it was a
well played film about a difficult relationship.I didn't known Stephen and his wife actually met around the same time
as he began to suffer from Lou Gehrig's Disease. Makes the whole
concept that Hawking has three kids with this woman more interesting
(something was working). Felicity Jones did a great job playing such a
strong, patient, and compassionate woman, all well narrated in this
movie. The difficulty Jane Hawking had being with a man getting trapped
in his own body, played by Eddie Redmayne.I have herd of Hawking's
surprisingly positive personality, not because of his condition, but
because I expected his condition would make it hard to express any
emotion. Redmayne did his research to express the struggle of Hawking
on camera nicely (I keep forgetting The Hawking is a Brit).This movie turned out to be a great one about the time span of a
relationship. Done more romantically than borderline soft-core flicks
like Blue is the warmest color and 9 songs, and it was not as
depressing as Blue Valentine. it was just a true take on a complex
relationship taking it's toll, well performed by some brilliant actors.If your looking to watch this movie to hear some science talk, that's
not what the movie is really about, unless ironically convincing the
world of his theories on time was really as easy as the movie makes it
out for Hawking. Overall very enjoyable.
