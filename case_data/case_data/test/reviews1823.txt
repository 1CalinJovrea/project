fascinating, typical, excellent performances, unique subject matter, OK production

Professor Marston & the Wonder Women is an example where the subject
matter surpasses the quality of the filmmaking. There's absolutely
nothing *wrong* with Angela Robinson's direction here (her script is a
little better, at least in the first half, at creating a specific time
and place which is the academia of the late 20's and early 1930's), but
there's also nothing that distinguishes it from other movies, or with
the kind of musical score that chimes in at just the right cues and
markers for emotional punch. What distinguishes it, however, is its
story and that in the three leads - Evans, Hall and Heathcote -
Robinson finds actors who are game to dig into some juicy melodrama
with a deliciously sexual bent... or rather, that's not totally true.
This is showing that what was deemed as sexual deviancy and even
criminal behavior for a time (being homosexual or bi-sexual or what
have you) was as normal as everyday love and heterosexual-monogamous
sex. It's everyone else's reactions - the neighbors and
Child-Psychologist woman that makes up the framing device for the story
- that gives the wrong perceptions.I don't know if this is true to life really, but then what is exactly
(I'd put this right in the same league as, say, Hidden Figures, and I'd
doubt that to be so true to life across the board); what matters is if
a certain spirit of the time and period can be captured, and at the
very least Robinson does that. A lot of the character development and
interactions between William and Elizabeth and Olive at its most
compelling reminded me of the (underrated/underseen) Showtime series
Masters of Sex, which was also about the clashes with intellectuals and
sex and what the limits are and how to go past them. Of course that was
just the surface of that show, but much of what went on there with
Masters and Johnson I found reflected here, that style of dialog and
interactions where these distinct personalities come up against one
another and how... well, love comes into play.Ironic that one of Marston's granddaughters denounced the film saying
that it was completely inaccurate, since one of the things that comes
up in the story is what it means to have a private relationship (or, in
the case of Marston and his wife and Olivia, relationships plural, a
true triangle where everyone loved everybody), and that a society that
often prides itself on being private will break that and be
condescending and even (in the case of their kids) violent if it comes
down to it. I also liked how Robinson shot the sexual pieces, which are
few or even only a couple of times, but distinct for the music choices
(very bluesy, nothing at all modern, refreshing in that sense), and
when Olivia somehow via the, uh, bondage store owner comes into the
Wonder Woman costume... and then Marston takes it a step further with
the ropes and bondage and so on.This isn't a groundbreaking document relating to Wonder Woman, however,
and in fact despite this device (ala Social Network and countless other
biopics) that has William in the hot-seat under threat of the comic
being cancelled, Diana Prince doesn't come into it until the second
half of the movie. I liked that though; there's plenty of time to get
to know these three people (and, briefly, Olivia's fianc√©e), and then
showing the use of the lie detector in its earliest incarnation, which
Marston also created (but didn't patent, I think the movie tells us?)
When it loses its footing for me is actually in the second half, though
only a little, since the focus in the first seemed to be equally the
three leads - with Hall being the stand-out, in part since Elizabeth is
written as someone who can't not be the inspiration in some way for
Wonder Woman - whereas in the second it's more on William, until the
last couple of scenes.Those final moments do bring some strong pathos for us, and it gives
the movie closure as far as it being more about this trio and how
strong their love was. Again, who knows if it's true at all or a lot of
BS. Does it work as a movie though? Mostly it does, and I think it
serves as not only a companion piece to Masters of Sex but to other,
er, idiosyncratic movies that dance with light and dark themes of sex
like Gyllenhall in Hysteria some years back. or to a lessor extent
Kinsey. Even, or especially, the scenes where the three are
lie-detcting one another have a sensual, ethereal quality that Robinson
can grasp, not to mention Heathcote could get more work from this role
if she's seen by the right people. If only she was more distinctive as
a visual stylist.
