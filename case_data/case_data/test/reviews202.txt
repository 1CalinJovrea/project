Had potential but fell short

The first half of this movie was great - the premise was great, and the
diverse cast set it apart from other "afterlife" type films. However,
moving into the second half, things got very muddled. It seems that the
director didn't know exactly which direction to go in, so he went in
all of them. It was very anti-climatic, and also relied on cheap jump-
scares to drive the film. Quite disappointing as it had great
potential.
