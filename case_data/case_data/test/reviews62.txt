A rare, but effective blend of genre's.

My Rating: 7.5/10 A rock-solid western in the beginning, Bone Tomahawk transforms midway
to become one of the most gruesome horror movies this year. It's not an
unlikely combination. There have been a few titles in the past that
falls under the western-horror category, but not many of them delivered
so well.Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie has a smart and
tight screenplay. Zahler's story is unflinching and he never dilutes
the intensity of what is shown on-screen. He succeeds in maintaining an
air of unpredictability throughout the whole feature, and yes Zahler's
name is definitely something to look out for in the future.The story is set in the American old west, maybe during the end of
1800's. Four men are on a mission to rescue a few kidnapped people from
a tribe of inbred man-eating savages. The quartet includes The Sheriff
of the town Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell), an injured Cowboy Arthur O'
Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) whose wife Samantha O' Dwyer (Lili Simmons) is
one among the captives, an armed gentleman John Brooder (Matthew Fox)
and the Backup Deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins).The casting is okay but not great. The veteran actors Kurt Russell and
Richard Jenkins give their best. Russell gives a fine performance as
the Sheriff, making the whole premise believable. Jenkins' character
Chicory might be the most likable of all and his role feels so natural
and belonged in the whole plot. Patrick Wilson does a commendable
effort, and so does Mathew Fox. The only character that appears to be
misplaced is the town doctor Samantha O' Dwyer played by Lili Simmons.
Her performance doesn't seem to blend in the 1800's period.The cannibals were nightmarishly original. And their savagery is not
just spoken of; rather it is shown in detail. The camera doesn't shift
around much when it comes to the bloody violence. The eerie atmosphere
together with the unpredictably quick turnarounds makes the feature
quite effective. A major plus of this movie is that it sticks to being
as realistic as possible. Be it the dialogues, the situations, the
acting or even the gut-wrenching violence and gore, Bone Tomahawk is
realism to the bone.Recommended watch, if you can sit through a good old, slow paced,
formal talked western in the former half and all the bloody gore in the
later half, but ultimately the movie pays off.
