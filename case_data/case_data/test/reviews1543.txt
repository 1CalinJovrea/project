Stunning

This is a very tender , passionate tale of young love that I found
fascinating . The three hours will simply fly by as you follow the life
of Adele who falls in love with an arty student . The lead actress is
stunning in both looks and believability , and you are swept along with
her on her journey . This is acting on the edge...powerful and
dramatic...worthy of many awards . The story rattles along at pace ,
and hardly has time to fully explore all the issues that are on show .
Adeles family and friends for example simply disappear after a while ,
which was odd , as they were an important part of the anti-lesbian
feeling present early on in the film . Nonetheless , its almost
impossible to find fault . I didn't shed a tear at any stage (but came
close a few times ) . The now infamous sex scenes were in my opinion
incredibly moving and central to the plot (however they were rather
long...men will be used more to a "Wham Bam 30 seconds approach " ! )
You should all go to see this ...male and female alike...though perhaps
don't take your Mother !
