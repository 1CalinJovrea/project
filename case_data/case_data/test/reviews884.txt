Outstanding movie about important themes.

This movie is wonderful. It contains all the elements of a great movie.
It has a strong script, excellent acting, compelling themes and
terrific cinematography. This movie contains what is probably Matthew
McConaughey's best performance. He carries the movie. He is in just
about every scene. The movie deals with several themes - AIDS, terminal
illness, government regulations, response to crisis, change of life
issues, homosexuality, promiscuity, personal responsibility, and
capitalism. All these themes are treated forthrightly.After watching
this movie, one should come away with a better understanding and
appreciation of the issues raised. But although the movie touches on
themes that have political implications, it is first and foremost a
drama. Although the movie takes some literary license, such as frank
depictions of sickness and drug abuse, none of it is gratuitous. That
is, it adds to the story.
