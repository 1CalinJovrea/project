Incredible Film

Washington gives what is nothing less than a performance of a lifetime
in this tension filled film dealing with a pilot wrestling with inner
demons. The aviation sequences are stunning and the crash one of the
most breathtaking ever filmed. The director is highly gifted and his
skill and passion are clearly evident. The script is superb, with
intelligent plotting and sharp dialog that captures reality. It is,
once again, Washington who shines here above all else. His power as an
actor is what truly gives this movies its fire. His portrayal of a
substance abusing addict/alcoholic is painful to watch because of the
humanity he brings to the part. It is a tremendous accomplishment and
one of the finest studies of addiction ever filmed.
