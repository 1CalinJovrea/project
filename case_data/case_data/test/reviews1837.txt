Critics Got This Wrong

My wife and I went to see this movie last night. This is probably the
only review I've done in the past 30 years and that's because I believe
this was "UNFAIRLY REVIEWED BY CRITICS", so I'm hoping you'll give this
movie a shot after reading what I have to say. I almost didn't go because the movie review in USA Today newspaper only
gave it one star. Some of the user reviews here didn't seem very
enthusiastic about the movie either. I'm 67, retired, and a King fan
(I've red The Dark Tower books). My wife is 70, retired and not a King
fan (she hasn't read any of the Dark Tower books). Just to provide some
additional perspective some of the movies we've seen so far this year
and how we rated (in chronological order) The Founder 5, A Dog's
Purpose 5, John Wick Chapter 2 5, Logan 6, Kong; Skull Island 7, Beauty
and the Beast 7, Power Rangers 5, The Fate of the Furious 8, Guardians
of the Galaxy 2nd Vol 8, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Wonder Woman 9,
The Mummy 5, Spider Man 6, War for the Planet of the Apes 8, and The
Dark Tower 8.I was worried standing in line to see the movie so when the previous
show got out I started asking people (must have been close to 20) if
the liked the show. (Would have asked more except my wife was feeling a
little embarrassed.) Everyone said a hearty "Yes" except for one couple
who shook their heads and said, "It wasn't like the books" and gave it
a thumbs down. After that I was encouraged and looked forward to seeing
the movie. I figured most of the critics were slamming it because it
didn't follow the books closely. Frankly, from what I've seen, King
books have always had a tough time being translated to the big screen. Although this movie didn't follow the books "right on" the main gist of
the plot and characters were there so I wasn't disappointed. Contrary
to what some other critical and user reviews have said, the plot was
cohesive, well thought out, and had similarities to the book. The
acting was very well done all around, the action was excellent and was
not jittery or blurry. It's easy to connect to the characters and the
emotional points of the plot.I started with a list of movies we've seen and how we rated so you can
compare how similar, or not, your ratings were to put in perspective
how likely you'd be to enjoy this movie. I wonder if critics and some
users go to movies for reasons different from ours. We just want to see
fun, entertaining, well acted movies that have been filmed and directed
by good professionals. The ONLY ding we could give this movie was that
it wasn't done in a manner similar to "Lord of the Rings" where it's
carried out over 3 films with greater detail and depth. That might have
been better, but maybe not. Regardless, I wish critics would at least
rate movies like this with 2 stars as long as they're fun, well done
and entertaining. There's no way this was a one-star film.Unless you really need the movie to follow all the outline and plot of
the books, I'm extremely confident you'll enjoy this movie. It's well
worth going to the show to see. You'll like it!
