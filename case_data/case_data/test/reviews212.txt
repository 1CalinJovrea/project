Love letter for action genre written by bold bloody hallmark, and a pencil.

If there's an equivalent of classical orchestra for untamed
unapologetically brutal carnage, there's no doubt it'd be John Wick.
Dancing through hail of bullets, horde of assassins straight from video
game, oozing noir style from each drop of blood, John Wick: Chapter 2
is nothing short of an artistic spectacle.John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns to the killing business begrudgingly
as one of his old acquaintances asks for a morbid favor. The
cloak-and-dagger scheme soon flies into multiple directions, partially
towards the back of few characters and the rest goes straight to the
chest. There's an air of familiarity as the movie visits previous
characters while introducing an array of new ludicrous ones.It keeps the formula nearly identical, adding more to its melee and
shootout fun. There's everything one loved from the first, now pouring
abundantly. Combat is arguably the best action choreography one could
possibly ask for. Punches, kicks, submission holds, and even dirty
pokes are delivered with sheer primal vexation and the finesse of
ballet performance.Both the anti-hero and his rivals press forward in locomotive of
mayhem, any fans of action movies and combat sports will be gleefully
entertained. In fact, such simple concept of "one versus many" is
ageless and universal, it worked since Bruce Lee's time and now told by
razor-sharp spectacular visual, John Wick is the finest action of
modern time.
