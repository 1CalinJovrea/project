Not Bad just Bland

100% standard by the numbers buddy flick that wasted the talents of a
great actor (Washington) and a very good actor (Walhberg),I couldn't
help but think they both counted how much they got paid to read each
word of this oh so predictable script.If you want to see chemistry in a
buddy flick rent 48 hrs and watch Nolte and Murphy because other than
the forced banter in the flat line reading of the script you will not
find any in this film.I have to agree with reviewers who said the lame
story line was just an excuse to link ridiculous action sequences
together.I really can't recall the last time I saw Mr. Washington give
such a disinterested and bored performance but Mr Walhberg seemed to be
just as bored though I can't blame him.Because of the two stars I had
high hopes for this movie but it was not so much bad as it was bland
and boring and when it comes to Denzel Washington the last thing I
expect is bland and boring.I would have given it a five since it was so
100% average,predictable and vanilla but I subtracted a point for the
waste of such good talent.
