A powerful adaptation to a beautiful novel

I was lucky enough to get last-minute tickets for this film at the
Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre was packed and we were
thrilled to see it although we did not entirely know what to expect. I
had read a part of the book but never found time to finish it.The very opening of the film is mesmerizing and sets pace for all that
is to follow. Six stories are intertwined to create one magical ride
through time and space, as all stories move forward as one. To those
who haven't read the book, I expect you might find the movie confusing
at first. It seems unclear at the beginning (and for most of the first
hour and a half at least) what all these characters have to do with one
another. The end ties it up quite well, but for a three hour film, you
might find you've spent a bit too long grasping at straws. Just let it
go and enjoy what's before you; It will all come together in the end.An important aspect of the film is that actors play different
characters throughout the film, finding themselves in different stories
and eras. Often it works. The futuristic plot with Jim Sturgess is one
I particularly enjoy. But sometimes, it feels like they're incorporated
just a tad bit much. Tom Hanks' role in the editor's story seemed huge
and important and first but it seemed we were supposed to forget about
it. As I walked out of the theatre, I felt I had seen not only Cloud
Atlas as a whole but a series of other films as well. I think maybe for a film such as this one, actors who weren't as known
would have been better. It may have been easier to believe in all their
different characters and forget who they were. But as far as their
performances went, well they were great. Tom Hanks shines from the
opening sequence to the very end. Halle Berry was adequate for the
journalist and Hugh Grant... actually it seems he's playing himself in
this one too. But the true star as always is Hugo Weaving. He steals
the screen whenever he appears and is mesmerizing both as the devil or
a regular assassin. The costumes and make up went from absolutely stunning (it may take you
a few minutes to recognize actors sometimes) to somewhat distracting.
Changing the race and age of an actor has got to be challenging but
it's still hard to forget who they are. I expect the film will get an
Oscar for this however, as I don't think anyone will beat them in this
category before winter comes. The score was also incredibly powerful
and beautiful and helped set the tone for the movie greatly.Cloud Atlas will take you anywhere and everywhere. It may surprise you
by its sudden burst of violence, sometimes exaggerated and almost
funny, sometimes cold and raw. You might cry at times, as the
characters make choices and sacrifices. One story is particularly funny
and had the theatre laughing quite often. All in all, Cloud Atlas is no ordinary film. It's a voyage that will
take you to places you didn't expect. Don't try to understand it, just
let yourself go and you'll find you understood what it was all about.
If you're looking for a linear plot, then this film isn't for you. But
if you want to experience something different, then by all means, buy a
ticket for Cloud Atlas when it comes out. I know I'll be seeing it
again.
