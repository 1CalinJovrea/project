Entertaining, slightly farcical, tale of dark deeds and friendship

21 March 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - The Grand Budapest
Hotel. I really had no idea what this film was about, having seen only
one trailer which in the event, bore no relation to the plot
whatsoever. However, my interest was piqued so this evening found me
watching a splendid little film packed to the rafters with stars. This
was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The
Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a
mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy.
This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting.
There were some completely ridiculous moments which were quite
refreshing and several, what I like to call Guffaw moments where
several members of the audience emit a loud blast of laughter followed
by slightly hysterical giggling that you find yourself joining in with.
As I said a host of stars in this film ranging from Ralph Fiennes, Jeff
Goldblum, Jude Law and Bill Murray to Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson and
Harvey Keitel to name a few, but one of the outstanding performances
must go to Tony Revolori, a relatively unknown young actor who plays
Zero, who is In almost every scene. An entertaining film, worth
watching.
