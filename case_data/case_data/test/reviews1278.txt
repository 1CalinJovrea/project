I'm very glad I watched this

I'm a huge fan of Arnold but the reviews prepared me for very bad. Once
again I have found the you cannot believe what you read. This was WAY
better than I was led to believe. I really liked the Last Stand and in
some ways liked this even more. Yeah, lots of blood and guts but that
doesn't phase me if it adds to the story. There was never one minute
where I wasn't enthralled with what was going on. I started out giving
this about a 5 because of preconceived notions but as it went on kept
racketing up that rating. I gave it an 8 but really liked it better
than that. I've only seen two of Arnold's movies since he came back and
plan on seeing all of them. I read his book and just love this guy.
What I really really like in these two movies is that he for once seems
real! I love how he looks old, how he has those short shots with no
dialog where he just has that look of WTF. This was a really good
movie. Keep them coming for as long as you can!
