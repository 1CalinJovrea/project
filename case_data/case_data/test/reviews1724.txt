A big let down for me.

As a big fan of the Resident Evil films, I was looking forward to
seeing this even though the series has slowly been going down hill for
the last few movies.Some good action here and there but I felt like the film never really
gets going. It all seemed a bit "forced", for want of a better word. A
disappointing end to the saga for me personally.I really hope they don't make any more of them in the future.
