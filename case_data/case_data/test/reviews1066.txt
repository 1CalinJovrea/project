This One's For Paul...

I watched this movie first day, first show. It started with a bang and
ended with a bang, and in a way that would have crumbled even hearts of
steel.This has everything one might need in a blockbuster movie. There were
smoking hot chicks, electrifying dialogs, fantastic humor, awe
inspiring stunts, and a menacing addition - Jason Statham.This is a movie which you dare not miss, because if you miss this one
you are never going to see another. Be prepared for one last lovely
beautiful and thrilling ride ahead of you, that's well worth your time
and memories.In terms of cast and crew, Vin Diesel proves to be the man of the
series aided by brilliant performances by Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese
Gibson, Jordana Brewster, and Dwayne Johnson. And finally the
unforgettable Paul Walker. Walk into the sunset, walk through the
rain... Walk straight into our hearts, and never abandon our memories
again. For Paul... May your soul rest in Peace.
