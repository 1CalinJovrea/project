contrived, tedious, and unoriginal

Firstly I should say that none of the blame for this movie should be
with the child actors here. They all did a good job, especially the kid
in the main role. Hopefully he'll end up in something better than this
in future.Krampus...Anyone saying this is a great film or proclaiming that it'll
be a future cult movie needs to be slapped in the face with a wet
turkey. This is an utterly run of the mill, clich√©d attempt at a
family-friendly 'horror', with cardboard characters (the adults that
is, as I mentioned the kids are fairly believable) and hackneyed script
and storyline. It gets very boring very quickly as you realise the film
will never improve, and in fact gets drastically worse when the power
goes out. Loads of screaming, wailing, and shouting with stuff whirling
about, and snow. Some of the special FX are decent. That's it. This
film has been made a million times before, and it will carry on being
made.
