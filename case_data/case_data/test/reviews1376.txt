Hilarious After-Taste

I have never in my life watched a horror movie that audience left the
cinemas with hysterical laughs... I myself laughed my ass off when the credits rolled up.You can't imagine how stupid the movie is, until you watch it.towards the end of the movie, i wished i had the virus so someone would
kill me before watching the credits roll up.Although there is nothing to spoil, but rules are rules.a total of 10 characters (including the dog) 4 of which die after a 3
seconds of appearing on screen. The dog dies after new barks and a trip
to the woods. The credits roll up, leaving you waiting for the horror,
suspense, action, drama... even comedy!!The looks on the faces of the audience will make you laugh for an hour.
