Now is the time for the DM franchise to call it a day, it's not that
there aren't some funny bits in this movie there just isn't enough of
them. The few limited laughs occur when the minions are involved (this
does not mean we need another Minions movie) and most of these are
because of the mental minion language. Sorry guys but it is time for
this franchise to go into retirement.
