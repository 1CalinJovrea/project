One of the better ones lately

The fact that this movie gets as many bad reviews and ratings as it
does absolutely astonishes me, I'm very critical when it comes to
movies with a "environmental message" like this, but I had no problem
with it, it was delivered in a fun laid-back tone, and Clooney's
performance was very sarcastic and cynical, I loved this movie for that
reason. I don't watch Clooney often, but I'm happy he was in this.It simply tells a great story revealing "secrets" of the great minds of
previous generations, and gives us plenty of back story and interesting
laws that apply to "Tomorrowland" 5/7 would watch again.
