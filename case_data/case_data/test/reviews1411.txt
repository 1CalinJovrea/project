A Masterpiece, a must-see

Amazing movie! Marion Cotillard is just breathtaking. I still can't
believe how beautiful this movie is. The cinematography is just
stunning and the score is beautiful. The performances are incredibly
powerful and real. Marion Cotillard is able to speak without saying a
word and that something extremely rare! She is so expressive you can
feel her pain. I think it really touched me because the movie is really
real, this story seems to be able to happened to anybody and that's
Audiard force. His writing skills are just amazing. Marion should get
an Oscar for a performance of this magnitude.I believe she will soon
become Hollywood favorite. The way she invest herself in each role she
takes is an example for any actress.
