Hardy excels in a dual role of some right historical bad 'uns

Tom Hardy is a strange fish as an actor. Famous for being almost
incomprehensible in "The Dark Night Rises" and almost equally
incomprehensible in his co-starring role in "The Revenant", it's
sometimes really difficult to get a sense of his true abilities. Here
in "Legend" he gets to show what he's made of. Twice! Hardy plays both
roles in the story of Reggie and Ronnie Kray, the infamous gangsters
who ruled across large parts of London in the 1960's.The film tells the story of the rise of the duo, focusing in particular
on the wooing by Reggie of Frances (Emily Browning), the local girl who
fell in love with and then married the hoodlum. Reggie and Ronnie 
whilst both undisputed 'bad uns'  were as different as chalk and
cheese. Reggie was all for semi-legitimizing the business, running
deals through his socialite-heavy clubs, and gaining higher-level cover
by inveigling his way into control of political contacts such as Lord
Boothby (a delightfully oily John Sessions).In contrast, Ronnie was an out-and-out psychopath with a malfunctioning
'off' button and no button at all marked 'self-control'. An open
homosexual  something far more shocking in the '60s than it is today 
Ronnie was a medicated loose cannon that even Reggie had trouble
controlling. Gathering a posse of 'boys' around him (including
Kingsman's Taron Egerton) Ronnie blazes a trail of bloody violence
against rival gangs with little regard to the consequences. On the side of the law was Nipper Read ("Dr Who" re-booter Christopher
Ecclestone) as the dogged detective trying to find something  anything
 to pin on the brothers.Hardy manages to convey each brothers' idiosyncrasies so well that you
quickly forget that this is the same actor playing both roles. It is
only in some of the more interactive scenes (such as a fight between
the two of them) that the illusion fails apart somewhat and where
acting twins would have made for more convincing footage (unfortunately
Jedward were unavailable!).What makes Hardy's performance as Reggie particularly memorable is that
for much of the film - and against your better judgment - you end up
rooting for Reggie and wishing him to 'succeed'. (This is more by way
of comparison against Ronnie's truly abhorrent behavior than against
any absolute measure of 'good').Browning is also compelling as the love-lost Frances, getting deeper
and deeper into a world she has no control over and having to act to
extremes of both love and fear. Also worthy of mention is the portrayal
by David Thewlis (Lupin from the Potter films) of the Kray's financial
adviser Leslie Payne: a man who knows he has the financial respect of
the twins (at least Reggie) but is always sailing a dangerous course
between kowtowing to them and criticizing their actions. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland ("Payback"), this is an
intelligent British thriller, reflecting a visceral view of the
criminal underworld of London in the '60's. Overall, its an enjoyable
watch that perhaps - Hardy aside - doesn't quite live up to its
potential. A note however for the sensitive viewer: this is a very
(very) violent film in places, and a couple of the scenes in particular
are hard to watch. (Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this
