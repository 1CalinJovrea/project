A Trailer Park Ocean's Eleven

Logan Lucky is a black comedy heist film written by Rebecca Blunt and
directed by Steven Soderbergh of Ocean's Eleven (2001), Traffic (2000),
and Erin Brockovich (2000) fame. "Rebecca Blunt" is an unknown British
screenwriter, which has led some to speculate the name is a pseudonym.
Whatever the case, it's a fun movie with the same fast-paced and clever
film making as the Ocean's series.When Jimmy Logan's (Channing Tatum) ex-wife, Bobbie Jo Chapman (Katie
Holmes), plans to take their daughter, Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie), from
West Virginia to North Carolina with her new husband, Moody Chapman
(David Denman), two Appalachian families rob the Charlotte Motor
Speedway during the Coca-Cola 600 to pay for a lawyer to contest the
move. The threat of the "Logan family curse" hangs ominously over the
operation.Jimmy is aided by his one-handed brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), their
sister, Mellie (Riley Keough), and Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) and his
brothers Fish (Jack Quaid) and Sam (Brian Gleeson). Together, this crew
of eccentric misfits pulls off the heist and each lives happily ever
after, or so it seems. In the final scene, we see a FBI agent played by
Hilary Swank carefully watching them under cover.The song "Take Me Home, Country Roads" by John Denver, a nostalgic
tribute to West Virginia, frames the movie. As it opens, we see Jimmy
Logan and his daughter fixing a truck while listening to the song. Near
the end, Sadie gives an unpracticed but heartfelt rendition of the song
during the talent portion of a beauty contest, winning over the
audience and judges.In Logan Lucky, everyone seems to get what they want, except Jimmy
Logan himself. Sadie wins the beauty contest, Joe Bang replaces the
money his wife stole, Clyde gets a mechanical hand, Sylvia Harrison
(Katherine Waterston) receives a large donation for her mobile free
clinic, and even the Charlotte Motor Speedway gets a huge insurance
payout after the robbery. But Jimmy's original purpose for stealing the
money goes unfulfilled.Because Logan Lucky was deliberately crafted as a "poor man's Ocean's
Eleven," it's difficult to evaluate one without the other. Both are
entertaining, fast-paced, smart, and a little subversive, but Logan
Lucky fails in areas where Ocean's Eleven succeeded, particularly in
the realm of character development.With such an ensemble cast, it was difficult to follow all the
characters' motivations. In Oceans Eleven it was easy because they were
all thieves and their motivation was obvious, to get rich and pull off
the most daring heist in historyÂ–to do something no criminal has ever
done before.In Logan Lucky, Jimmy Logan's motivation is explained, but most of his
accomplices are just average people who are trying to put past
transgressions behind them. His sister, Mellie, seems to be just going
along with the scheme for no reason at all. No one even really tries to
talk him out of it.The characters in Ocean's Eleven are likable and have fully-developed
personalities. Despite being criminals, we want to spend time with
those characters and hope they succeed. In contrast, personality quirks
substitute for genuine personalities in Logan Lucky, and we never feel
animus for the Charlotte Motor Speedway like we did for casino owner
Terry Benedict.Joe Bang likes to eat boiled eggs. Clyde Logan has one hand and
obsesses over the Logan family curse. Fish and Sam "got right with the
Lord" and enjoy hanging out at the carnival. Mellie is a hair stylist.
Beyond repetition of these character traits, they are just weird and
gross people.Moody Chapman, in contrast, seems like an upstanding guy, despite a
questionable approach to parenting (his sons, played by Boden and
Sutton Johnston, are hilarious). Despite Bobbie Jo having full custody
of Sadie, he has no problem with Jimmy Logan spending time with his
daughter and tries to treat both Jimmy and Mellie as family. For his
efforts, they make fun of him, reject his overtures, and even trash his
sports car. The audience is supposed to sympathize with these jerks?Despite these shortcomings, Logan Lucky is a well-made and entertaining
film that's fun to watch and keeps the audience on its toes. It plays
on Southern stereotypes but not in a condescending or demeaning way. It
continues the tradition of "white trash" comedies including Raising
Arizona (1987) and O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and is a welcome
departure from the other lazy, poorly written and acted comedies
released this year.
