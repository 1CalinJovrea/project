So many great moments

Actually just one of them would make me want to give this a 10/10 and
it is very close in my eyes. The scene I'm talking about involves a
helicopter and a song that really got under my skin. If you don't feel
a thing during that scene ... well I don't know what to say. The whole
thing is build upon feelings and dreams. Obviously breaking out of them
and making some of it reality (not the ones that can not be achieved
obviously, like flying or other stuff) is the ultimate goal.Ben Stiller might be known for one thing, but we can see with this
movie he has a wider range. And the visual/virtual effects he uses help
support his vision. A vision of a novel that I haven't read, but sounds
more than intriguing even after you've watched the movie. Which cannot
be said about most of novels/movies that have been made this way. This
is not your typical movie, even though it might hit some familiar notes
and go ways that are to be expected. Take the journey and fly with it
