Fantastic!

This movie was, without doubt,the best movie to ever hit the big
screen. The characters were so real, so alive, that you could nearly
feel their presence in the salon. The conflicts were deep and mirrored
a perfect reflection of life as we know it. I was very touched by the
emotional drama that took place, and moved to tears by the
inspirational ending. I have never before been this affected by a film,
and I truly believe that it is God who speaks to us through this movie.
