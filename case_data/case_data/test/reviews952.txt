Before We Call Him...

Director America, is that it?Who could know? Another Teenage(wet)dream actor, shows himself as a
quite decent director! (Yeah, that's racist!) Jokes apart, I really enjoyed the work developed by Chris Evans in this
project! It's clear that this is a homage to Linklater's Before
Trilogy, a very good one, but that doesn't take away any credit of the
movie. Actually, this is a dangerous genre of movie, a chemically
instable, and a simple line can ruin a whole movie. Congrats Mr. Evans,
you mastered the potion!I can say good stuff about the directing through the whole night, but
that is unnecessary. I really like that simple shots, when the whole
panorama is the only thing that matters and the protagonists are just a
fraction of it. Also the awesome feeling that they didn't closed any of
the locations and they rolled the whole movie outside the studios, it's
just awesome (They might have closed all the locations and filmed all
the inside scenes in the studios, but don't feel like it in neither of
the cases for me!) Personally, I loved the shots in the Grand Central
and at the subway train.About Alice and Chris. What a lovely couple of any Rom-com imaginable!
But why waste such talented actors in a random Rom-Com, that people
will forget as soon as they leave the theater? Both Alice Eve and Chris
Evans shown their talent, beyond their beauty, mostly in recent years,
and they delivered in Before We Go a mature, deep and really emotional
performances. But there's no good leading acting without good
supporting acting! Despite their short appearances, Emma Fitzpatrick
(Hannah), John Cullum (Harry) and Mark Kassen (Danny), really fill,
perfectly, their places, in the mostly pleasant way possible.About the writing. Some people say that this is Before the Sunrise in
NYC. It could be. But it isn't... Before the Sunrise is about two young
tourists, who decide to enjoy the night in a city (Zurich?), before
they take the morning train. It's love, flirting, and "I'm up all night
to get lucky"... Before We Go, on the other hand, is about two late
twenties, early thirties, in a very introspective day, for both of
them, and a day that everything (or just a couple stuff) goes wrong!
And they try, together, to survive that awful (or not that bad) day...
The formula is pretty much the same of Linklater's Before Trilogy, but
is not Before the Sunrise NY! The script was well written. Many good
lines, a couple clichés here and there (but they're clichés for a
reason), but mostly of all, I liked how the movie is plausible. How the
story has this vein of truth.I had my share of nights walking around the city, without a way home...
And some of those nights had their share of characters. Some ended in a
good one night stand, some with a buzz-kill rejection, a couple with
just a good talk and a couple others ended with a life-long friendship
of one night.This movie hit the right vein, for me. If you get the ingredients that
you love, assemble them in a plausible recipe, you WILL have something
you like for dinner! The formula, the actors, the plot, the way that
was shot plus the good execution... I could only love it!P.S.: How awesome was "My Funny Valentine"? Did they two really
performed the song? If yes... Claps to both of them! If don't... Claps
to who performed!
