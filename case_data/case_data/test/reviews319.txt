Riveting! Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance.

The great director who's not afraid to tackle matters of war,
conspiracy and controversial American political issues, has returned.
Only this time, Oliver Stone has upgraded his latest film's look and
tone to make it seem more digitally advanced, which is fine because it
fits the story of Edward Snowden and we're living in this day and age
where every millennial's favorite series happens to be "Mr. Robot."
SNOWDEN, as you've guessed it, is a thriller about the whistleblower
and former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden, played in this film
by the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt. "Divergent" star, Shailene
Woodley plays his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, who stays by his side
through his ordeals of working for the government due to his patriotism
while at the same time feeling conflicted about how the government runs
its methods in the name of national security. This film dramatizes the
events that led Snowden to becoming one of the most wanted men in the
world.First, I have to give praises to Joseph Gordon-Levitt who I think went
above and beyond in not only capturing Edward Snowden's mannerism and
the way he speaks but my goodness, Gordon-Levitt's performance in this
film is so calculating and precise, you can see his brains constantly
work itself out, just by looking at him. And Shailene Woodley gives her
most mature performance yet, because this film is more than just about
the whole surveillance controversy, it's also about how that negatively
affects Snowden & Mills relationship and I think it's fairly handled,
both aspects don't take away or diminish each other's importance in the
process.When it comes to the film's dramatizing the U.S. and British global
surveillance program, I'm sure there'll be questions as to how
authentic the portrayal is, as far as the headquarters are concerned,
for example, some may see it as a bit too much like a Bond villain's
secret lair, but you'll be entertained by some of the visual effects
that the film applies to showcase hacking and how one person can
connect to another person and to another person and what's most
fascinating about it is that there's a programmer watching the whole
thing the entire time.So SNOWDEN is essentially part conspiracy thriller, part relationship
drama, and to a certain extent, part heist. Overall, I think it's a
riveting film that keeps you engaged and more importantly gets you
thinking, which I think is the goal of Oliver Stone's movies. Does the
film lean one way in that it paints Edward Snowden as a hero? I think
so, but not in a way that intentionally judges those who at the end
still think of him as a traitor. SNOWDEN might cause audiences to
become more paranoid or it might cause audiences to start supporting
any effort to hold our government accountable. The jury's still out.-- Rama's Screen --
