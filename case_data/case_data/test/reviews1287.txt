A Dreadful Performance by Kristen Stewart

Spectacular special effects don't overcome an underwritten relationship
between the title characters and a hopelessly miscast Kristen Stewart
as Snow White. A scenery-chewing Charlize Theron and a late-in-the-game
appearance by the seven dwarfs add some life to the tedium until
Stewart - lacking the charm, innocence, and spirituality that the part
cries out for - sucks it out again.The film recalls "The Matrix" in which an interesting premise is dealt
a severe blow by a woefully uncharismatic actor portraying a character
who the universe of the film needs to rally around in order to survive.
But whereas "The Matrix" had enough going for it to overcome the vacuum
that is Keanu Reeves, "Snow White and the Huntsman" grinds to a
plodding halt when Stewart weakly attempts a "Henry V"-like oration to
stir up the troops. And when the seven dwarfs (which offer some
delightful cameos by actors like Bob Hoskins and Ian McShane) sagely
proclaim that Snow White is The One who can save the kingdom, one looks
at Stewart's blank gaze and wonders how they reached that conclusion.Chris Hemsworth provides a perfectly unobjectionable generic beefcake
presence as the huntsman of the title, but the script fails to evolve
the relationship between the two in any way and the end of the film
depicts Hemsworth standing anonymously in the crowd as the crown is
inevitably placed on Snow White's head. Then, we are treated to the
sight of the new queen standing uncomfortably in front of her subjects
in awkward silence, as though no one gave any thought to what might
happen next. But the same thing could be said of the screenwriters
after typing the words "Act One, Scene One."
