Movie that gave me the FEEL!

This movie is truly a piece of art. It has so many materials. I didn't
know that it was possible for a movie to have so many materials. What
doesn't this movie have??? The story is marvelous. I really liked the
way this movie showed the meaning of life. At many point of my life I
also wanted to change some moments that occurred in my life. That's why
I liked the movie very much. It just didn't show some lame romantic or
comedy that show in many movies these days. It's a complete
masterpiece. It gave the most realistic scene that any movie can show.Beside the romance I liked the part that showed the relationship
between the father and the son. It matches my moments when I spend with
my father.If you haven't watched the movie yet. I highly recommend you to watch
it. You won't regret it. IT'S A MASTERPIECE.
