If you'r looking for a good thriller to spent the evening ... this is the one.

I really don't know why this movie is rated 6 + something. This movie
has all it takes for a very good thriller. It has stars from the first
row. It has a lot of good action scenes. It provides a very meticulous
plot. With many surprises and twists. It keeps you alert through and
all along the movie. I really liked this movie more then many other
successful thrillers. And yes, it lacks a sense of humor. It may even
have a little too serious attitude. All in all, this is a really
meticulous film with no dull moments at all. I had fun, hope you will
as well.
