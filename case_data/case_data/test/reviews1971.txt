Gritty and well acted

For me this film was beautifully tragic; by this I mean it was a
fantastically acted film and gripping; but I'm disgusted and mortified
that it actually happened.It was good that the film focused on how the conspiracy into the abuse
was covered up; for me it was a preference than focusing on the victims
and bringing any more agony to them. It brought a tear to my eye to
know the depths that this went on (and probably still does) and the
number of victims that were involved. As someone who has a criminology
degree with a focus on child abuse this film was particularly poignant.
I was appalled at the end to see that the cardinal for Boston was moved
to a high ranked job in the Vatican; when it was clear from scenes and
evidence brought up in the film that he was aware. The end provides a
list of places where it has been uncovered; this is heartbreaking. Mark Ruffalo was fantastic in this film, however, for me the stand it
performance was from Michael Keaton as the 'Spotlight' team editor. For me it was first 10/10 of the year (2016)
