worth seeing

If you expect a voyeuristic documentary about female wetlands you are
in for a surprise. One part is about gross phantasies with similar
appeal like splatter movies, but the other part is an interesting
portrait of a divorce-child with dysfunctional parents. Those bits not
only explain the psychological motivations very well, together with the
fun parts of her weird doings wrapping this movie, it is a light
approach to such a heavy topic. I really liked the subtle affects the movie played with. It was able to
develop some erotic just to destroy it immediately. And I wasn't always
sure if she was to be considered a sane persona. But again, all very
playful and light.All in all a relevant piece of contemporary cinema, with outstanding
action and production values.
