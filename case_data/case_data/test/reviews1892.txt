All hype, sh*tty movie *spoilers*

People were obviously paid to positively review this film. Do not waste
your time. Nothing about this film is scary or gory. The writing was
horrible. The acting is horrible. Completely unrealistic film.
*spoilers* no version of a medical school, doctor or veterinarian would
allow a continued hazing ritual or the continued wear of extremely
dirty clothing. No true vegan would allow themselves to eat meat,
hazing or not. No gay man would just convert to sleeping with a woman.
The goriest part was the main character eating an obvious rubber
finger. Anyone who walked out or vomited from this movie did so because
it sucked. Not from gore. Any awards this movie won, were paid for.
Don't believe the hype. This movie is just trash with no rhyme or
reason for anything in it.
