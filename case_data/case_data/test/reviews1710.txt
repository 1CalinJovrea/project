Hilarious! This could be the surprise hit of 2015

Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what
the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper
class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind
of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film
that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I
had that feeling during the watching of a film like "this movie just
does everything right" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to
MY taste). Compared to this film, every James Bond movie released after 'Licence
to Kill' looks like a snore-fest. This is such a kick-ass, "balls
against the wall" crazy ride that I had to shake my head several times
in disbelief during the screening I was invited to. And I actually knew
what I was in for. I've seen every film by Matthew Vaughn, but I was
not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one. Thought
'Kick-Ass' was pretty crazy? Wait till you see this.One of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors. The well known
stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal.
Remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies
like 'Bridget Jones'? He just won an Oscar for playing the stuttering
King of England, and as you will see in 'Kingsman', that Oscar was well
deserved: that dude (Colin Firth) can play anything! He's more bad-ass
in this than Bond ever was!A word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or
the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy.
And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch
this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In
Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into
serious films or family friendly comedies. As for me, I had a (bloody)
good time.
