Enjoyed the fantasy!

Enjoyed the "Hollywood" fantasy. Sure, it's a little far fetched, but
that movie making, not reality TV. Enjoy the ride. Don't be too
critical. Some good acting. A good story. Some interesting techniques
I'd not seen before or maybe just not remember seeing. I just let it
roll, having an open mind for what was unfolding. Just enjoy the movie.
Action.
