Dreadful

This was beyond terrible. It's a total rip off of the 90's movie "She's
All That." That was a terrible movie too, but if you'd like worse,
waste your time on this one. It's phenomenally annoying when producers
use actors 25+ to play high school student. You spend the whole movie
hoping or character development that never happens. Follow up sub par
acting when a UN-inspiring make over. This movie highlights the onset
of social media and You Tube in everyday teen life. I had no idea what
they choose to watch, produce and share could be that bad. I'm scared
for the world at this point. My expectation was closer to "Mean Girls."
This made "Drop Dead Fred" look Academy Award winning. Save yourself
the time.
