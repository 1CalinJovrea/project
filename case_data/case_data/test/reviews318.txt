Riveting production despite its pat view of history

We go to the movies to be gripped by powerful narratives presented with
good scripts and moving imagery. This film has all of it, most
especially a riveting performance by Gary Oldman. The subject matter will clearly divide audiences thanks to its pat view
of history: UK as the righteous hero and everyone else as inept --
Italians and French losers, Germans the evil fascists, US completely
unmentioned, Canada the quiet prairie for monarchs to escape to -- in
the still-somewhat- mysterious Dunkirk incident where Hitler could
easily have tightened the noose and pushed UK over the edge of what was
evidently a crushing defeat, but somehow allowed them the leeway to
escape by civilian boats. There's next to no mention of the French army
that stood its ground and valiantly sacrificed itself to win a couple
of days for the Brits on the beach. All that said, as a film, this is a gripping narrative with just the
kind of insouciant wit you'd expect from Churchill. While movies such
as "The Gathering Storm" with Albert Finney were more considered,
Darkest Hour is the kind of production that wows awards juries and
audiences. Worthy watch when it comes to a theater near you. I feel
Nolan's "Dunkirk" would be richer if you saw it *after* Darkest Hour.
