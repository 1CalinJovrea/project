Trilogy?!?....just simply turning a quick buck. A con-movie.

To me it seems they borrowed a plot from another movie/script and
replaced the characters with the ones from hangover 1..to get It's
purely trying to milk out the characters for as much of our money as
possible. Realising they have run out of ideas for a similar hangover
movie. They just borrowed a script somewhere and try to cash in on its
famous predecessors. A quick heists before people realize what the
movie actually is. A con movie.The funniest bit is the Giraffe sequence...but thats only at the
start...not even part of the actual movie. Simply an amuse bouche.The rest of the movie doesn't have any hangovers in it or really any
comedic moments. Just a straight crime-caper trying to be funny.Sad sad end and showing the true colors of the makers and participants
of this movie.
