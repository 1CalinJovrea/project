Brilliant & genius making from biography crime genre !

At first i thought this movie will be boring as hell because of
biography and crime genre, many movie with similar genre failed to
bring the movie to success. I think it will be hard to make this kind
of movie but Doug Liman as the director and Tom Cruise as the main
character (Barry Seal) make this movie to the top of their best !The story telling is good and makes the audience can follow it easily.
Its not too complex, but not plain too. Many humour inside it and Tom
Cruise acting really makes it real ! And because this movie based on
true story, and has reveal one of many dark secret on USA government,
it makes this movie more interesting ! I cant believe this movie can be
one of my favourite and be the one of top on my list. So recommended
for the audience who love crime story with comedy, just try it !
