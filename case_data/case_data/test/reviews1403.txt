Wasted time for me

I am giving it 3 stars because the acting is great. Other than that,
the story really didn't appeal to me. Being from a large family, I
think the story actually sucks. Perhaps it is because I don't have a
psychopath for a sibling. I do agree we humans are too many and are
destroying the planet. And that will happen until nature wins, because
we forget but we do need it to survive. The solution provided in this
movie is too horrific (characters don't know what really happens until
closer to the end). But basically you have a sweet grandparent that
goes beyond efforts to keep his 7 granddaughters safe in a world where
one child per couple is allowed. They grow as team, being stronger when
working together. In the outside world they share the same persona so
they are not discovered.There is too much fighting and visual, which seems to be in fashion
this days.Now for the MAJOR SPOILER... Don't read ahead if you don't want to:One of the sisters falls in love and gets pregnant, hiding it from her
other sisters. Onde day she disappears. All sisters work together to
find and save her, 4 dying along the journey and one being brutally
stolen an eye.What we find out is that the first sister to disappear basically
condemned her 6 sisters to being aggressively persecuted, like I said,
most die, only she could have her happily ever after with the man she
loves and her unborn children. To me, that woman is a psychopath. Even though the surviving two
sisters understand her choice and are set to take care of their nephews
(all OK in the taking care of the nephews, but what their sister did
has no excuse in my opinion).
