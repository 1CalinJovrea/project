A perfect Waste of Time

This is one of the dumbest movies about a father wanting to marry his
daughter because his wife will not carry out her wifely duties. The
premise is stupid, the epic sweeping of the tale told in chapters is
also insulting to the viewer. Not sure what the director was so
entranced with the script/story about. Guy Pearce played a reverend who
must have been special ops in Sweden and was perfect for pursuing his
poor daughter. The ironic tale is plain dumb and tries to pass itself
off as artistic but miserably fails. The resolution made me regret
watching this stupid tepid movie. I can see the point the movie was
trying to make about the absence of women's rights back in the day but
it was more of a showboating technique with no real depth. If the mute
woman knew of the treachery of her father then why would she attend a
church he was the pastor of with her family. Why would she not tell her
husband about the stuff this dude did before? This movie questions the
intelligence of the viewer and tries to sensationalize the absurd!
