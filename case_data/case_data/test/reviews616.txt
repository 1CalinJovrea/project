Another fantastic film from Wes Anderson

Here we are with Wes Anderson's latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel,
which once again excels in everything Anderson knows best by delivering
another kind of film. This movie combines early comedy slapstick and
hijinks with that Anderson dry humor and melancholy along with the
requisite great cast, performances, and set design to make this one of
his best films easily.Good: I love the whole cast. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing and he
is one of the best lead roles in an Anderson movie to date. Newcomer
Tony Revolori easily keeps up with Fiennes doing a fantastic job.
Everyone else from Norton to Ronan are fantastic. The set design and
cinematography are magnificent as usual with great scenery and cool
children book style backgrounds. The comedy hits every time and it even
packs some surprises to with a great murder mystery that gels with a
road film. There's even some sweetness underneath the zaniness giving
it some surprising depth to it.Overall, it's definitely one of my favorites of his movies and further
cementing him as a great voice in movies today.
