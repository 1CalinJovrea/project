Why did I watch this Hollywood movie?

The characters: Mostly douches with bad lines.The story: Aliens invade, their ships are clumsy and weird and jump on
water. America (and to a lesser, lesser extent Japan saves the world).
There are moments when you wish you could unsee the tacky ways they
(the movie makers) try to make heroes and bad-asses of certain people.
Most notably the old sailors on the USS Missouri which are posed (yes,
really posed!) everywhere, high and low in an awkward way that just
makes you wanna squirm and throw up a little bit. The aliens: At first you think: "This alien race seems really noble."
Second thought: "I hope the aliens win, I hate the characters in this
movie so much!" Third thought: "Huh, so the aliens aren't noble,
they're just stupid. And they seem a bit evil according to the
unoriginal flashback John Carter got but... I'm still rooting for the
aliens! Go aliens, exterminate this movie-verse!!"The sum: Why did I watch this movie with awkward characters, unlikable
at best. Silly plot with horribly pushed tie-ins to the battleship
game. Plain dumb aliens. In-your-face product placement (Cola Zero, LG,
Subway and probably some more). Why? I was really, really bored. And
now I've lost faith in Hollywood movie making. It's not better then
Transformers, It's just as bad.If your over 10 years old: Don't watch this. If you 10 or younger:
Don't watch this.Hollywood needs to learn that they can't push this crap from the toilet
to the big screen anymore!
