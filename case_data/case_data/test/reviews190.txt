The movie delivers much more than i expected and  i expected a lot.

After watching this movie, i remembered last year's Now You See Me,
which was an unexpected and entertaining movie.This is very well paced and executed film. Tom Cruise seriously fits
the character. I know the main character in the Japanese novel is a
young man, but man i'm glad they cast Tom Cruise in this. I'm not a fan
of Tom but to me he always give 120% in every film. If Hollywood wanted
it to follow the original material, they would cast some pretty face
teenagers that would have the same personality as the rest typical
teenagers characters (Stupid, ignorant, selfish, arrogant for no
reason). Thank God they didn't do that.The story is excellent and it is nowhere similar to Groundhog Day
except for the day loops. it is action packed and there are plenty of
funny moments. You may expect the looping days would be boring after a
while, but you'd be wrong.I cannot comment on the CGI, because i think there is too much good CGI
in every movies nowadays that i am not impressed anymore. But it does
not mean the CGI int he movie is bad or anything. On the contrary it
felt pretty real to me.My recommendation : GO SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it.P/S : The only bad experience when i was watching this movie in cinema
was the guy beside me who constantly open his brightly lit phone and
even answered a call. another is a group of stupid teenagers behind me
who keep commenting loudly on every scene, thinking they were funny. SO
PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE OR TALK LOUDLY IN THE CINEMA DURING A
MOVIE SCREENING. Thank you.
