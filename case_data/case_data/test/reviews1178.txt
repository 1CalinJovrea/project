Completely Forgettable and Rehashed

I went into this film with low expectations. Having never read any of
James Dashner's books, I cannot tell with any certainty if the
screenwriters were true to the novel, or if the book makes a better
effort than the film to distinguish itself from the multitude of
superior films it meekly attempts to imitate. What I know is that I
left the theater laughing. And not in a good way.What should have been an exciting and visceral tale of survival and
intrigue ended up stealing two hours of my life by conning me into
thinking I would see something original. Instead of suspense and
excitement, MAZE RUNNER laid out an entourage of familiar tropes,
paper-thin characters, and contrived situations. The 'villainous'
antagonist of the film was as one-dimensional and irrationally-plot
serving as any character I've ever seen. The character was so silly and
unbelievable I actually chuckled at him several times when the film
begged me to be serious. The screenplay was a crash-course in heavy-handed exposition. It was
jammed with stock lines: bland, insinuating lines that were supposed to
put me on the edge of my seat but instead left me thinking, 'Okay, when
are we going to get to the POINT of this movie?' We got to see the
intimidating-jerk-who-doesn't-listen-to-reason character, the
hardened-guy-who-will-later-be-reduced-to-a-weak-state-to-show-us
how-shaken-up-the-best-of-us-can-get character, the arbitrary female
(although, thankfully, fewer movies today are marginalizing women), the
amnesiac/s, and the innocent-character-we-can-get-away-with-killing.
The pacing of the film, if not the events, were completely predictable
and the ending (which I came to the theater curious for in the first
place) came off as stale and forced, like the rest of the ponderous
placeholder scenes that served as a plot. If you've seen movies such as
HUNGER GAMES, CABIN IN THE WOODS, or PANDORUM, you have already
witnessed better characters, better reveals, and more assured examples
of plot development.Hollywood has developed a very convenient formula to keep theaters full
of impressionable teen audiences. We have an outsider who needs to find
a part of the group to cling to. They meet a variety of similar
sympathetic characters. They act impulsively, which is usually a good
thing. They are almost always rebellious and independent by nature, but
they need to avoid arousing the wrath of whatever all-powerful
conglomerate is hell-bent on keeping them down. Until, of course, the
time comes to overthrow them using the various talents that the group
possesses. Along with a healthy dose of courage, resolve... and luck.
Buckets of ludicrous, gratuitous, convenient, plot-serving luck.There is no reason that this film should have made the money it has.
After six days, it has recouped its budget threefold. Every ticket you
buy gives them more ammunition for a brain-numbing cookie-cutter
sequel. I'm not saying the film is the worst I've ever seen. But for God's
sake, we don't need any more movies like this. Here's to a better
future.
