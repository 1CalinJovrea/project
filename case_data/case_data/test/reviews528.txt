Telegraphed, and I loved every moment!

To say this is a guilty pleasure would be putting it mildly. Since the
first time I saw 'The Fast and The Furious' 12 years ago, I knew I
found my car/mayhem fix. Although I never thought it would last to see
iteration #6, I was more eager this time around than for the first. No
surprises, besides the unpredictable nature of Owen Shaw. The only real
curveball was the substantiation of an Internet rumor that Jason
Statham joined 'Fast 6'. Well, sorta -- end credits. After the audience
"ooooohh's" at Statham's revealing, I couldn't wait, yet again, for the
7th! Fun factoid: This movie marked the reuniting of 2 'Lock Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels' characters. Jason Statham (Bacon) and Stephen Marcus
(Nick the Greek) playing the CCTV supervisor opposite Lucas Hobbs. :)
