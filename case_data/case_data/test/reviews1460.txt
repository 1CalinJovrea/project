He yells a lot. Sooo he must be a great chef/coach/teacher/captain...

There are a lot of movies out there where the leader of a team,
talented, strict and know-it-all, tries to discipline his group, in the
background of a match or a contest of some sort. Music, sports, army,
classes, even spelling contests and of course ...haute cuisine.Common factor in all these movies: The leader ...yells a lot! And he is
mean to his pupils. And he doesn't forgive the tinniest of mistakes.
And he has enemies. Or rivals. And an old teacher who was mean to him
like he is now mean to them. And there is a purpose. A trophy. And a
love subject.Pretty much this summarize Burnt too. So, the premise is not so
original but in the end it's all about the execution and the fun and
the interest.Well, I think in this department 'Burnt' succeeds. The plot has some
clever twists. The pace of the film is right and there are some great
natural performances especially from the chameleon actress Sienna
Miller and the always serious Daniel "Nikki Lauda" Brühl.You wont get any cuisine lessons with this movie though. I know this is
not the point, but other movies leave you with some knowledge and an
increased interest about the special craft. What is that haute cuisine
all about? We only get a glimpse of that. Something about 'Culinary
Orgasms' but we never get to understand what this could actually be.Overall: Not boring. Good Pace. Miller's and Brühl's performances are
very good. Plus the movie itself is not ...fattening! (unless you eat a
lot of popcorn!) So, What else do you need?
