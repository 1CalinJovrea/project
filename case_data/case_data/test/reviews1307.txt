Do NOT Waste Your Time!

Right, like one reviewer also said I did the same thing - register for
the first time on IMDb just to vent my rage at those who gave this
movie 10/10 rating and convinced me to waste my valuable time watching
this movie. The fact that those who are rating it 10/10 seem outraged
at those who have given it negative reviews should be warning enough -
they and only they seem to find this movie the best thing since sliced
bread. We all know some friends and family of cast and crew often do
this. In any case, if it was a normal movie, you should have roughly
fair to average reviews the most, ie the difference between neg and pos
reviews shouldn't be as extreme as in this case where most people are
giving it 2 stars or less while a few insistent ones are rating it
10/10. The timeline is confusing as hell so it will take you halfway
through the movie to understand who did what when. The plot holes are
so huge they look like black holes. It leaves more questions than
answers at the end and even before that you feel like punching some
characters through the screen (or the director for making the
characters look and act so dumb). Ignore the 10/10 reviewers who're
baying that you watch it. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! (As I was but didn't
heed hence my first ever review)
