Story lacks but give it a shot!

If you are a David Ayer fan (Training Day, Harsh Times, Street Kings)
then you will not be disappointed. Also, if you love guns and a bit of
street violence, then this is for you.Amazing cast (though they could have been used a bit better, story
lacks). as a Veteran, the team look very accurate in my eyes. The way
everyone in the team carries themselves reminds me of my days in the
Army.Yes it has harsh language, yes it has meat-head/testosterone/dumb humor
and yes there are some VERY graphic scenes, but it is rated R. There is
great firearm action for you gun guys out there.I've been an Arnie fan growing up and honestly his role in this movie
is great, and he's still able to pull off a "leader" role. Give
Sabotage a shot, I'm disappointed at all the negative reviews for such
a great cast, but I understand where most reviews users come from: The
weakened story.
