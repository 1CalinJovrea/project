a sick bunch gathers to mourn a family member

"August: Osage County" is a stunning, powerful play written by Tracy
Letts - it rocked Broadway and won the Pulitzer Prize. And it's going
to rock a movie theater near you. This isn't a movie for everyone. It's
exhausting, it's full of really despicable people, and it's mighty
depressing. But the acting is so terrific, the roles so strong, that
you don't want to miss it.It's the story of the Weston family: Violet, a drug-addicted cancer
patient (Meryl Streep); her husband Beverley, a well-known poet (Sam
Shepard); their daughters Barbara (Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette
Lewis), and Ivy (Julianne Nicholson); Violet's sister Minnie Fae Aiken
(Margo Martindale), her husband Charles (Chris Cooper), and their son,
known as Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch).When Beverley commits suicide, the family gathers and it's wretched
from the beginning. Violet is totally drugged, Barbara and her husband
(Ewan McGregor) are in the process of breaking up, Ivy has a secret
boyfriend and, though she stayed behind and has been caring for her
mother, she's ready to leave for New York, and Karen arrives with her
fianc√©e (Dermot Mulroney) who has been married three times and seems a
little too interested in Barbara's 14-year-old daughter. When Little
Charles arrives on a later bus than he was supposed to take, his mother
belittles him in front of everyone. Little Charles is considered a not
so little loser, and is the only likable one in the film.Each daughter has reacted differently to having parents like Violet and
Beverley. Barbara is hard and tough like her mother, Ivy keeps her
feelings and desires to herself, and Karen is a dingbat looking for
love, probably in all the wrong places. The Aiken dynamic - obviously
Violet and Minnie were forced to grow up to be as tough and mean as
possible in order to survive; Charles is quiet with a fury underneath,
and Little Charles looks like he's going to break in two any minute. He
shares the same secret as Ivy: they're in love and planning to go away
together.This is a grueling story of the destructive force of addiction, the
danger of anger, the hurt of betrayal, and the pain caused by keeping
secrets.I was not fortunate enough to see the Broadway play so I can't compare
the performances. I thought Meryl Streep was terrific - it's the kind
of role actresses love, a sort of Martha in Virgina Woolf gone
completely haywire, and except for Helen Mirren and Judy Dench, there's
no one better to tackle it than Streep. Julia Roberts gives what is
probably her best performance. She's not a favorite of mine, and I
don't find her a particularly good actress, but she almost pulls this
off, probably because of the talent surrounding her. Margo Martindale
as the caustic and bitter Minnie, who reminds her niece that she's not
just her "fat old aunt" is sensational. Violet, Barbara and Minnie have
the showiest roles.In the male roles, Sam Shepard, though his role is small, is elegant
and sympathetic, and Chris Cooper doesn't have much to do until a
showdown with Minnie, which is galvanizing. And Benedict Cumberbatch -
what can I say - I adore the man. He's a nasty villain in Star Trek and
here, an insecure young man who hates himself for his tardiness and
inability to keep a job. He's heartbreaking. He can do anything and he
proves it here as he sings -- yes, sings! -- to Ivy.Your family, no matter the problems, will look like Leave it to Beaver
after you see this film. See it - enjoy the fabulous acting and be
grateful that you're not going home to anything like it. I hope.
