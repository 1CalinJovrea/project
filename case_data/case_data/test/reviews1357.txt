Krampus (7/10)

Christmas usually a time of cheerfulness and presents thanks to the
jolly Santa is flipped upside down when Krampus comes to town. The
events follow an obnoxious family, who are crude in their comedy, and
have poor decision making. Funny man Adam Scott and horror vet Toni
Collette make a unique couple but are relied upon heavily being the
only serious roles written for the film. There is an appropriate blend
of comedy and horror, which is seen in the absurdity of characters,
evil gingerbread men, and killer toys, not so much the written
dialogue. Once Krampus is seen fully his appearance is pretty cool
looking like an old decrepit vile Santa. The ending was rather a
letdown but overall it was a decent fun horror flick. It would be best
to watch Krampus during Christmas time because it does have a great
holiday feel to it, worthy of a watch for sure.
