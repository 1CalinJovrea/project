Not Just a High School Movie

Went to an advance screening expecting your usual "shy kid in high
school learns to stick up for himself" sort of feel-good drama. This
movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature
themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and
alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the
Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional
aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared
about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story
never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this
movie!
