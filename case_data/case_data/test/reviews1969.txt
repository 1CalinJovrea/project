Thor 2

"Thor: The Dark World" is just another cash grab for Marvel Studios.
Its totally unoriginal, boring, bland, predictable, convoluted, and
stupid. I don't understand why studios pour millions of dollars into CG
effects that look so fake, when practical effects are much cheaper to
achieve and cost effective, and actually have conviction and a sense of
authenticity to them. Plus it takes forever for a movie to get released
when you go for CGI because of the months it takes to polish up the
effects work....At least the first couple Spiderman and XMEN movies
felt like real films, this and Iron Man 3 were lifeless and robotic. I
like the way Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph put it... (Thor 2) feels
entirely made by committeeÂ—the definition of house style, without a
personal stamp in sight."........Why does the world and the whole
universe have to be at stake in every movie nowadays? and the humor in
this movie was very weak and lame, that hipster chick was so annoying
too.....Its an entertaining enough product for most people I'm sure,
Natalie Portman's easy on the eyes, and there are a few decent scenes,
but overall its the same crap we've seen a million times before.
