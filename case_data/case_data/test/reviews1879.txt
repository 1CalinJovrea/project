Should have been buried with the other corpses

The only scary thing about this "horror" movie is how bad it is. It
should have been buried in a tomb full of mercury and sealed up for
eternity. Without Tom Cruise stumbling over it as a Lara Croft/Indiana
Jones wannabe literally dropped from the sky right into the middle of
the key to the riddle, the one that other poor suckers have been
searching for during thousands of years. Lucky him? Hold on, it gets
worse. Ole' Nick finds himself neck-deep in a quagmire, not so much of
ancient artifacts and killer zombie-inducing spiders (deary me, who
comes up with all this rubbish?), but of incoherent and random movie
ideas, CGI-arrhoea, stupidly recycled themes, and plot holes bigger
than the giant-*ss one he repels down into at the beginning of the
movie. And, of course, the obligatory sequel-connecting non-ending,
petering out in a sea of greed and ringing tills. It's all for the
money, and you gotta wonder why Tom Cruise is immersing himself into
this garbage pit of Hollow-wood waste. But then again, it's expensive
to be a Scientologist, somebody's gotta pay the Dianetics bills. Too
bad it happened to be me this time.
