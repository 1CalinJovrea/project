Locked in the car.

Here's a well respected writer director giving Cinema a bad name. If
you like dialogue driven movies this is for you. If you like books on
tape this is for you. "Locke" is a one man play being passed off as a
movie.You spend what seems to be real time with a guy that takes and makes
phone calls while driving to London.He is one of those guys that doesn't want to disappoint anyone and
disappoints everyone. Why did he need to tell his wife on the phone?
Why did he need to tell the girlfriend he didn't care but wanted to do
the right thing? Contrived. Why doesn't the key guy check the rebar
sooner? Why do you want to sit through his in car therapy as he works
things out with his father? If that isn't enough give him a bad cold,
something always welcome at a hospital.The only thing moving in this movie was his car and his lips. Perhaps
in the sequel Mr. Locke will drive back and play the radio. There is no
need to see this in a theater. It will play just as well on a cel
phone.
