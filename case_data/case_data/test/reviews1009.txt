No need to read any more reviews, just go watch the damn thing.. it is so recommended.

I just can't believe i'v waited this long to watch this masterpiece, it
is definitely without a doubt one of the best movies i'v watched in the
year 2016/2017 and absolutely on the top 5 Spanish movies.The Plot is just so strong and the thrill is congested in each and
every minute of it,, the timeline separation style (where the movie
jumps back and forth between two timelines like the present event and
the story in the past using flashbacks) is not a new style , but here
the execution was so precise and flawless , there was no time to breath
and the events kept on elevating with more tense with so many versions
where you can't decide who's the killer and what really happened will
at least not until the end where all is revealed.The script is amazing no disagreement in here, but what surpassed my
expectation is the directing !!! i mean WOW, for a 42 young man from
Barcelona Oriol Paulo excelled by doing both at once ... i watched his
other movie "El cuerpo" and man you know this guy is something special.As for the cast, Mario Casas is one talented man, his face expressions
just drags you so deep into the scene , same goes for Ana Wagener ...
the flashbacks were pivotal in the movie but the one to one dialogue
between these two was just suspenseful.Also not to forget the genius soundtracks and the music composing, each
and every scene had this perfect tune that made it look even more
thrilling.Lastly, you just stop reading reviews and go watch the "damn" thing
because it is "damn" worth every minute of your time.
