Ruby Sparks...3.5 out of 4 Skittles

What do you do if you're a struggling actress searching for the right
part that will help separate you from the hungry pack of millions of
other starving wannabes? Wellyou write one for yourself of course. Zoe
Kazan, who has made a living with smaller supporting roles in a variety
of films, (Revolutionary Road, Happythankyoumoreplease, It's
Complicated) writes and stars as the title character in Ruby Sparks, a
role that is bound to officially put her on the map. She doesn't allow
you to take your eyes off her, and has loads of fun playing with the
mass amount of emotions that come from being the figment of a possible
crazy person's imagination.Ruby Sparks is creative, original, highly entertaining and one of the
best films of the year. Directors, Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris,
team up for the first time since 2006's breakout film, Little Miss
Sunshine, and provide the same zeal and love that made it a huge
success.The rest of the cast is nothing short of phenomenal. Paul Dano (Cowboys
& Aliens, There Will Be Blood) continues to build on his reputation as
one of the strongest actors of his generation. Great actors make great
choices with their role selection, and Paul once again shows he has
fantastic taste. Chris Messina, who seems to appear everywhere
(FilmJulie & Julia, Greenberg, Away We Go, Devil, Like Crazy, TVThe
Newsroom, Damages) is strong as the side man once again, and is more
than ready to be major star. Acting legends Annette Bening, Antonio
Banderas and Elliot Gould jump in for short periods of time making huge
waves and leaving long lasting impressions.Unlike most romantic type movies, Ruby Sparks doesn't feel like a
retread Kate HudsonSandra BullockKatherine Heigl cheese fest, and is
filled with a fun, creative energy that is too often missed in
rom-com's. Ruby Sparks is superb on all fronts, and as a movie of the
year candidate shouldn't be missed.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com
