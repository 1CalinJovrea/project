Outside of some effects - just bad.

Dialogue & acting - repackaged as old English (18th century) by
Hollywood for it's lyrical movieness (and to fit Hollywood
stereotyping). Acting was daytime soap TV level. Characters - noncreative, plug and play characters e.g. gladiators (one
black & soon to become friends with adversary - been done before);
other gladiator sees parents die at Roman hands and is now old enough
for revenge - also been done before; really bad Romans acting badly;
aristocratic pretty daughter (still has 21st century make up, eye
liner, etc.) falls for slave gladiator (of course). Action scenes - good gladiators defeat dozens of Romans as brunch (I
was waiting for one hand tied behind the back and blindfolded but the
writers copped out). CGI - flashes of CGI volcano every 5 to 10 minutes to remind us of what
the movie is about. Familiar scenes of water rushing over the city -
already used in many tsunami movies and is getting old. Looked like the
same wave used in several Indian Ocean tsunami films recently, but not
as well done as say in "The Impossible". Fireballs came off as comical
fireworks effects.
