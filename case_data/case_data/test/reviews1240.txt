Pure redneck entertainment!

This film was better (and much different) than I expected. At first the
pace seemed very slow and the story predictable and seen-it-before. But
then the pace picked up and you really get into the characters (of
which every single one was cast and played their role perfectly) and
the story (which overall was very well written - especially the
ending). The ending had an obscure twist forming, but right at the very
end, it comes together for a grand finale! Very enjoyable and I'm
definitely watching this one again. It's a 9/10 from me.
