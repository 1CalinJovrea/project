How I Felt During and  After "Anna Karenina"

Closed in and Claustrophobic: I felt I could breathe only when the
scenes escaped outside of the theater stage and onto the snow covered
train depot or the green fields where Levin was sowing grass, or where
love was a lazy-day picnic on the greenest of grasses, but only briefly
and only disappointingly, after again finding myself cramped and
stifled in a hot sweltering and old 19th century theater. The ball room scene was excruciating. The dances and dancers themselves
reminded me of a mix of street dance, country and western, and some
invented Tim Burtonesque "Danse Macabre" for the purposes of being
unique, strange, and possibly "histrionic". The moves were stiff and
unflattering and I was embarrassed to watch Anna and Vronsky clumsily
make there way through the physical distortions that made their clothes
appear ill-fitting and as though they both had two left feet. I could not feel the same passionate love between Anna and Vronsky in
this movie adaptation as I'd previously felt in reading the novel. The
emphasis on cinematic style and surrealism kept interrupting my wish to
re-live and enjoy the story. Further, contradictory to the memories of
my mind's eye of the handsome and manly Vronsky in the novel, I came to
see him in the movie as bit effeminate-looking, weak, and depicted as a
vulnerable little mommy's boy. I paid my ticket expectant and hopeful but at the end and as I exited
the theater I found myself confused, disappointed, and ripped-off. Anna Karenina will always be one of the greatest experiences in
literature I've had the pleasure of. But next time, as surely there
will be yet a "next time", I'll simply pass on the movie. I simply cannot bear the risk of seeing Vronsky look like that again.
