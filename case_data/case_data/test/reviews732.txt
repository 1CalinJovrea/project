Good but could be better

The film is really good its has plenty of action adventure and humour.
The budget was $200 million and the Box office was over billion which
shows the success of the film.The film beings with a flashback on one New Year's Eve Tony Starks
humiliates Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce. Years later explosions
happen in America which leaves Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who was
Starks body guard and directed Iron Man 1 and 2,in a coma, Tony
threatens the people behind it, which then leads to his home being
destroyed, he then finds the people who are responsible after taking
him and Pepper Potts hostage. All he has to fight with is his new
prototype MK42.The director of Iron Man is Shane Black who is known for his films
based on Christmas, and started the film on New Years Eve which is
around Christmas time. One good thing about this film are the Visual effects. Also, the humour
used in the film keeps the film entertaining. The tension created also
contributes to making this film worth to watch. And relationship with
Harley, who was the young boy, shows emotional side of Stark which
helps us understand the character more.One bad thing about this film is the uncovering of the Madrian because
some of the audience may be expecting a real villain. Also before the
film came out the teasers shown people dying and more action but didn't
happen as much in the film. The ending of the film is disappointing as
it ended and resolved itself quickly.
