Same old clich√© stuff

I wonder when people will understand that they are watching the same
movies over and over again with only different heroes... Even without
watching the movie an 8 year old can write a summary of it and it would
be 90% accurate. Bla bla bla good guys come together bla bla bla they
start up pretty good bla bla bla they argue bla bla bla they reunite
and kick the villain's ass. How original(!) And this thing applies for
99% of the Marvel movies and about 80% for DC. And there are major
logic mistakes also like captain America can protect himself from
enemies with a shield not bigger than a large plate. I know it's a
super hero movie but, really?It's like bad guys are not even trying. No
need to talk about Black Widow... Use your minds people!
