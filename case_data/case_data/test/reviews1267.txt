Chloe Grace Moretz's Best Performance Yet

Normally I completely agree with meta critic but this is the one time
that I do not agree. I went in with low expectations but I was
completely wrong.I do not normally give out ratings without thinking
about it first. If I stay is one movie that I believe is 10 out of 10.Chloe Grace Moretz performance in this movie was amazing. She is always
referred to as a future great actress of the industry but I felt that
she has not completely proved herself yet until I saw this film. Moretz
plays Mia Hall so well and so believable. I think she portrays the love
and the actions of a teenage girl in love with great accuracy. Her on
scree chemistry with Jaime Blackley was on point. He also performed
great. I did not expect much from him but he along with everyone else
in the film performed great.This movie has a little bit of everything. It makes you smile, it has
music, a strong story, great acting and a lot of emotion. The film does
not center around her out of body experience but centers around Mia's
love for Adam. The film skips back and forth from her out of body
experience to her memories with Adam and her family. This was done well
and allows us to understand the love and bond that they have because it
skips back to different points in their history. The story is not about
god or the afterlife but simply about a choice that she has. Does she
leave with her family or does she stay and continue fighting through
life with Adam by her side?I honestly really enjoyed this movie and thought multiple times during
it that this movie is really good. I never think about movies much
afterward but with this one has been on mind. The ending was perfect
especially with the gasps and reactions of the audience. Best movie of
the summer by far.
