An absolute drag of a "date" movie - avoid at all costs

Viciously afraid of women, horribly written, and apparently phoned in
by the cast over a weekend or two, this flick tries to satisfy both men
and women in the audience through hackneyed appeals to gender
stereotypes and ends up being the loudest snooze you'll ever
experience. Men are choked by other men against abandoned strip-club poles (like,
gross, Broseph!), makeup-slathered bodies of both sexes are bared in
drab, sexless settings, and the main female character is so unappealing
as to almost deserve her forced role as a stand-in for the eternal
love-hate of two creepy men . . . for each other. (She doesn't actually
deserve her mistreatment, of course, any more than the audience does
theirs for deciding to watch this trash.) I'm not kidding about the male-male romance, by the way. The real love
story here is between the two male characters. I'm not talking
"bromance", either - these men are absolutely obsessed with each other,
so much so that they forgo pursuing the girl to cuddle up and watch
their hidden-camera movies of her together, late into the night. It's
almost sweet, in a frighteningly repressed way.All of that still makes this movie sound much more exciting and sexy
than it actually is. If it helps, "This Means War" is rated PG-13, and
that's for gross-out humor, not any sort of nudity. The super-spy plot
is an afterthought and merits maybe one-sixth to one-seventh of the on
screen "action". Mostly, you'll see Chris Pine and Tom Hardy whining at
each other as the camera flies wildly to the left and right.I could go on and on about its faults, but this movie doesn't deserve
it. Mr. Pine must have signed onto this signature-McG travesty before
he landed a gig for life as the new nerd-worshiped Captain Kirk, or at
least I hope so. He has no excuses now, not with a ticket on that gravy
train.3 out of 10 stars, because as far as I could tell, they didn't
accidentally film a boom mike during an action scene or something. Skip
this one entirely.
