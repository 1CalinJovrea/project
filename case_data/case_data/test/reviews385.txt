I pity anyone who paid cinema prices for this absurd turkey

Possibly Ron Howard's worst film with one contrived situation after
another in this convoluted mess of a Da Vinci Code spin off.While the basic premise isn't bad, in fact it was a steal from the Bond
film On Her Majesty's Secret Service where a mad scientist wants to
kill off half the world's population. What made it as hokey as a
Mission Impossible script was one absurd action scene after another
where the hero played by Tom Hanks can't seem to shake off people
looking for him.The big shocker is when his apparent savior former star of Chalet Girl,
Felicity Jones turns out to be another of his enemies.Overall as silly
as many low budget B movies.
