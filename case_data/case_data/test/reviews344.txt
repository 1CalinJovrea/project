A well done combo of light and dark

I had no idea what to expect when I started watching this movie. It
drew me in right away. Its a very real coming of age movie. Real not only because it is based
on a true story but also because the characters have different shades
to them. They are not one dimensional. The bad guy is also misguided
and means well. The girl is not just an innocent victim but also makes
some bad choices. And so though I want to express I am not OK with
abuse (!) what I am trying to say is there is some gray in this story.
This movie very correctly shows us that life is hardly ever black and
white.Its a touching story and its very easy to feel sympathy for this girl.
I found myself very engaged and curious about where and how it would
end.My only comment is that some of the script is a bit jumbled to me.
Missed flow, I cannot explain it better then that.Overall very well done so I recommend you give it a go.
