Horrible Mess!

It's a musical, based on a Broadway play (no really, it's a musical). A
misrepresented boring film, how the movie could have received a green
light, just shows how little fresh ideas Hollywood has. Okay, am I
being too harsh, I'm sure there will be some enjoyable tunes,
interesting sets, adorable characters or some interesting twists on
stories that really is en vogue at this time. No, No, No, and No! Not one memorable song, how is that possible Stephen Sondheim! Okay
maybe it's not his fault, apparently Disney took a PG-13 to R rated
play and tried to recreate the movie as a family picture. Where is the millions of dollars in production values? drab, dark sets
with deficiency of most color. I wouldn't want to say that the movie
has horrible special effects, more an absence of them. A majority of the actors are miscast, it is literally impossible to
care about any character. The philandering prince and baker's wife are
certainly people, I would want my kids too aspire to be. By the end of
the movie, where you have dedicated over two hours of your time, you
start imagining how, if all of the characters die, maybe the movie
would make sense. Just stick with televisions, "Once Upon a Time", for interesting twists
on your favorite fairy tales.
