Close, but no pan flute

Pan has all the foundation to make a fantastic prequel for the Peter
Pan story, sadly the foundation doesn't have much on it and what's
there is shaky.The main issue I had with this film is that it seemed like it couldn't
make up it's mind on whether it wanted to cater to children with goofy
and antic like behavior from the characters, or offer up serious and
gritty story telling for the adults. It flip flops from one to the
other from scene to scene and it's very noticeable. The incredibly
cringe-worthy use of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in the Neverland
introduction scene represents my point the best.I wondered all throughout the movie why they had given James Hook an
American Accent, I have seen other reviews say that it seemed like the
Director/Writer wanted Garret Hedlund to channel some Indiana Jones for
this role. They are right, but I am baffled as to why the Production
wanted him too. It makes no sense for what we know he will eventually
become.This movie isn't ALL bad, however. Levi Miller as Pan is a lot better
than I ever expected him to be, the kid has some talent and it's going
to be interesting to see how he develops as an actor if he sticks with
it. Rooney Mara puts in a great effort as Tiger Lily too. Hugh Jackman
tries REALLY hard to lift this movie. He is easily the top performance
with his Blackbeard and it was easy to see that he enjoyed the freedom
of the character. In fact, they should get Jackman to play Hook in the
next movie. He'd be brilliant.Shout out to Adeel Akhtar as Mr. Smee. Outside of Jackman he gets the
most laughs in the film and was a great casting choice.If you have kids then take them to see it, they will like it but be
prepared because you probably won't.
