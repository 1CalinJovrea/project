Paper Towns

Let me start out by saying I never read the book, so I can't possibly
have any beef in that area. I also didn't see TFIOS previous to this,
so I can't compare. However, I was extremely unimpressed by this movie
overall.I was impressed when the anti-climax came, and Margo basically just
told Quentin, "Hey, you're crazy for coming all this way. Nothing I did
actually was meant for you in any way." At this point, I was thinking,
that's pretty ballsy for them to lead all the way up to this nihilistic
shattering of idealism for Quentin.And then they just half-assed it.I was disappointed when the ending came and they tried to sort of flip
it around, like, "Wait, no, it DOES have meaning, see? They had fun!"
If they had stuck to the tone of that scene with Margo and Quentin in
the parking lot, I would've given this a 6 or a 7 out of 10, even
though the rest was just average.I liked some of the other characters' small changes and the flirting
with the idea that they're all going away to college to never see each
other, but Quentin's character arc was simply not there. He started as
just a spectator, and ended as just a spectator.Overall, I give this a 5/10 for just being a mediocre movie overall,
and the pacing feeling a bit strange sometimes.
