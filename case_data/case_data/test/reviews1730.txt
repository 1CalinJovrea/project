More style than substance?

At the outset, i should make it clear that i don't think this is a bad
film, but i felt the need to add a dissenting voice to the collection
of positive reviews that i've read so far.The film is an amalgamation of elements that should work beautifully,
but ultimately resembles one of the sterile offerings to be found in
Susan's gallery. The acting is superb throughout, and the nuanced
performances of Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal are worthy of their
reputations. The subtle transitions from dead and lifeless to young and
vibrant, exhibited by the former at various stages of the film, is one
of the most striking features of the piece. The film is beautifully
shot and well directed, and there are some truly moving scenes in
parts. However, as one reviewer has already alluded to, the film feels
like it is desperate to say something, but ultimately says very little.
Perhaps i just didn't get it at all.The problem i had was with a lack of emotional connection to either of
the main protagonists. It's interesting to find out what happens to
both as the film builds, but ultimately i didn't care either way.My partner and i spent some time examining the film on the way home,
discussing the parallels between the story at the heart of the film,
and the realities that continue around it, but despite our rudimentary
analysis of what each one meant for the other, and an understanding
that there are some clever parallels, what remained was the underlying
sense of "so what?".
