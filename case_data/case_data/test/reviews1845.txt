Completely Rubbish!

The story was simple, with not much thought gone into it, with one-
dimensional characters, again no thought even gone into the characters.
Lazy writing everywhere. Also, every Japanese Man is made to look like
a bad guy, including the grandfather, while the Japanese women are
perfect.The father tries to kill his daughter and then the grandfather
who was suppose to be the good guy in the beginning of the movie
becomes the big pathetic crazy villain of the movie at the end. Oh yea,
and her fiancé is evil too. Couldn't the director see how stupid this
is, that the hero is a white guy and the rest of the non-white guys are
villains. As if white guys are perfect for Japanese women or something.The relationship with Wolverine and the Japanese woman is so empty and
forced. Don't directors know anything about friendship and love, and
how to portray that in a movie by slowing building that up. It's funny
how they made her fiancé look bad for cheating on her when she did it
herself with Wolverine, and Wolverine being a hypocrite gives him a
moral lesson lol what a joke. Even Wolverine himself was completely
one-dimensional compared to the animation cartoon I remember watching
as a kid. They tried to show that he had learnt something by the end of
the film and changed but what exactly did he learn, where was the
character development?? Lazy writing.Oh yea, and the part about him cutting himself open and going into his
heart area was so stupid. He screams out in pain in every other scene,
even when his claws get cut off but not in this scene especially when
he's weakened due to the poison.Another point, he's supposed to be wise, experienced especially in war
tactics but he uses none of that in the whole movie, especially at the
end when he battles those ninjas. They just show him like a dumb brute
guy.So many small pointless bits you can take out as well, like the viper
lady shedding her skin for no reason. The list can go on but I'll stop here.
