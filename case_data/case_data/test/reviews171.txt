Spit in the face of spider man fans

Spoilers and review coming from a Spider-Man fan. I want to say if I
knew nothing about Spider-Man, this movie was good. But sadly I loved
him and grew up with spidey. The movie was a typical marvel movie and
funny at parts. But the rest, they hurt my inner child ruining spidey. Tom Holland was a great Peter Parker and Spider-Man. But the producers
and creative team behind this, ruined Spider-Man. I don't know how Stan
lee could could happy with this. My god. They ruined Spider-Man.
Spider-Man never needed a high tech suit, with all the gadgets and a
damn voice helping him like batman and iron man. They made him look
pathetic and took away his intelligence. Spider man relied on his
abilities, not tech. This movie made iron man look responsible for the
creation and power behind Spider-Man. Any kid could have been
potentially Spider-Man with iron mans help then. Other than sticking to
walls according to this movie. No spidey sense and no further
explanation on his abilities. Next, the flash. My god what were they thinking with him? A small
Indian kid, smaller than tom Holland even?? Not a jock and hardly
intimidating. That's not flash. He's suppose to be a dumb jock and
bully. Not a hardly noticeable nerd bully on a math team picking on
Peter. Aunt may. What...why they make her a hot mom figure. She's suppose to
be old, not long luscious hair and sexy. People hitting on her all the
time. Why?? Spider-Mans webbing was lame and made him look oblivious to using it.
He barely created it, tony did all the work. Other than a moment in
class we saw him making some and the end where he used his old webbing. His love interest was lame and they made the vulture her dad??? Really?
And then end put a nail in the coffin. The Michelle random
character....calling herself MJ. Please no. She cannot be or replace
Mary Jane. And can't even nod to Gwen Stacy. There was so much political correct crap in this. I don't mind changing
the characters into other races, but doing it just for the sake of
doing it was lame. Making flash Indian, making his friend who also
could be the hobgoblin Asian, and probably maybe getting rid of Mary
Jane as Michelle who is black. Does Hollywood have something against
red heads?? Every girl or hero who has red hair in the comics is never
ginger. The shocker was terrible. No custom and lame. And they needed two of
him too? Stupid. Just everything about this movie killed my inner child and spat in my
face for making comic book and cartoons of my beloved Spider-Man a
waste of time. Oh and people figured out who Spider-Man was quickly. The vulture, his
friend, iron man obviously, and drum roll....his aunt may. Already aunt
may?? Unless they make another movie and add a dumb excuse like, oh I
just like the costume and I made one. How stupid. I'm sorry to tom Holland for being involved in this. This was not a
true version of Spider- Man. If you know nothing of Spider-Man then
you'll probably enjoy this movie. But if you know anything about him,
his story and who he is, Hollywood shat on it. RIP spidey in the movies. They can't get a simple concept down of him.
They have to add a bunch of garbage. This is my one big review of a movie and I never bothered to make one
this in depth, but I couldn't keep it in. Plus the post credit scene
was even lamer at the very end. To add to that, they brought back the
ugliest captain America costume that made him look like a joke in the
first avengers.
