Talky Film

Michael Fassbender stars in this theatrical play-formatted movie
written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Doyle entitled "Steve
Jobs".This film is based on Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of
Steve Jobs.Kate Winslet co-stars in it.This movie takes us into three acts. The first act is during the time
that Steve Jobs and Apple Computer introduces a new product known as
Macintosh.The second act is during the time when Steve Jobs and his new
company NeXT Computer introduces a new product known as Cube.The final
act is during that the time when Jobs is back as the CEO of Apple and
the new computer known as iMac is introduced.No question that this film is definitely talky.The story progresses in
the words spoken by the characters rather than actions and scenes in
the movie.One must listen carefully to the dialogues.Despite having
great performances particularly from both Fassbender and Winslet,the
talky film could still turn you off.If you do,just go to other films
that tells the story of the late Apple CEO.But if not,expect to learn a
lot about Jobs and what a determined person he is for success.
