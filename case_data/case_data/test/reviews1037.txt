Workmanlike and well-played but an unremarkable film

Let me say this off the bat. I saw this film primarily because of Jake
Gyllenhaal and the rave reviews he's gotten in portraying Jeff Bauman,
the young man who lost his legs in the '13 Boston Marathon bombing and
became a symbol of hope. Not because I think the bombing itself has not
gotten enough attention and analysis from all quarters imaginable. The
film is less about the day of the bombing than about Bauman's long road
back afterward. On paper, this didn't look exceptionally enticing, but
the rousing reviews drew me in. A well-received film with an actor of
Gyllenhaal's caliber is tough to pass up.There is enough narrative flow and great performances from Gyllenhaal
and Tatiana Maslany as his transient girlfriend and Miranda Richardson
as his hard-drinking, boisterous mother to make this film worth seeing.
And the depiction of the bombing itself is well-executed and flashback
scenes to Bauman's ravaged condition in the seconds and minutes
immediately following the blast are gritty and powerful. The depiction
of the family's insensitivity to Bauman's personal hardship is a
worthwhile theme here. A scene in which his friends and family are
blithely watching a Red Sox game while he has a painful collapse in the
bathroom is one of the film's more genuine moments. Maslany captures
the girlfriend wonderfully, though I'm tempted to argue her prominence
in the film has been overstated in the reviews.But make no mistake. I've seen this kind of film many, many, many times
before. It does not stand out as far as doing anything ground-breaking.
It's a simple blue collar tale of struggle and recovery through sheer
heart and will power, the kind of story that has been told through the
ages. That's what's disingenuous about the reviews. They led me to
believe this was something more than conventional. It's as tried and
true as they come. Everything from Hollywood's fixation on the feisty
Boston persona to the moment of a tempestuous argument between two
loved ones to the bar fight with the token idiot who spouts his
nonsense. And there is also that moment in the spotlight with one of
your favorite sports teams while masking deep personal turmoil. You
have it all here in spades. I give David Gordon Green credit in making
hay with a formula that has been done before, seemingly since the
earliest of days. Recommended for the great performances.
