good movie for res fans

is it a movie for film snobs? nope. is it for people who watch a film a
week?. nope. what is this film? it's a cgi filled video game on wheels.what gets me is all the negative reviews of this movie. what did you
expect? an award winner? a picture that leaves a deep feeling of "wow
what a thought provoking piece of art"? this is a video game put to the
really big screen.this is a movie to watch for big 'splosions and huge action.the best
part of this movie is that people won't like it. are you a res fan?
check. do you like movies that just entertain without pretense? check.
like a movie that just kills a couple hours and makes you happy? check.lets let the nature of this movie stand. it is what it is it's not high
art, but f*** it 'splosions are awesome!
