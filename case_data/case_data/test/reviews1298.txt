Smart black women, white assholes and Kevin Costner

It's 1961, and NASA is engaged in an all-out space race. Just like the
title says, there are three kinds of people working there. The black
women do all the dirty routine of numeric calculations, the white
assholes act all snobby and superior, and Kevin Costner supervises all
that hodgepodge with a tired face. Things begin to change when the
black women manage to make themselves indispensable and start
complaining. Little by little, some white assholes become slightly
apologetic, and some black women get promoted. Kevin Costner even takes
down a "colored ladies bathroom" sign with a huge crowbar. But even
then, the black women keep doing all the dirty routine work.I'll be honest, this film has made me feel angry. But not because of
the glaringly racist behavior of the white characters towards the black
ones. That is probably rooted in reality of the 60's segregated
Virginia, and it's been made clear multiple times that even the
relatively good people become abusive jerks when they are put inside
the broken down system that condones such abuse.The true source of my anger about Hidden Figures is that it uses that
racism theme, sometimes intentionally hyperbolized, to cover (or even
promote) its own shallowness and laziness. To excuse the unrealistic
bullshit like a black female computer (yes, that was a person, not a
machine) who calculates trigonometry on the fly in her mind with a
six-digit precision, solely to impress the big brass on an important
meeting. To justify a full lack of logic when a person is being
reassigned to the aerodynamics division and, in order to get to her
workplace, must pass through the aerodynamic tube seconds before a
potentially deadly experiment commences. To make us skip the fact that
a person from a completely different field may learn how to program a
mainframe computer solely by reading a book the size of Alice in
Wonderland taken from a two-bit local all-white library, while the
dedicated engineers IBM sent to set up the machine are walking around
helpless, unable to even plug it in properly. To make us believe that
the space flight math is so complicated, but at the same time show us
the moments like a think-tank head explaining the orbital trajectory to
his colleagues as if they were demented 7-year olds.And it's not just the technical stuff. It's even the romantic line
between the characters of Taraji P. Henson and Mahershala Ali, who
basically spend just a few minutes of screen time together before he
suddenly proposes. If only all the weak moments of this film were a
result of some abrupt and forced development - then I could've said
that maybe it's the brutal editing to blame. But, with more than two
hours of running time and with so many details messed up, it's not the
editing. It's very lazy writing.As we know, a year ago the black community of the US felt offended by
the lack of colored people nominated for the Oscars. They threw a big
fit and complained. So, I guess, the numerous high-profile films
centering on the black people's issues, past and present, are a
response to those complaints. However, despite having gotten their wins
and nominations, the people behind these films seem to forget one
simple truth the capitalist societies are built on: that only through
fair competition the highest quality results are achieved. But if you
can win or get nominated simply because you're black or you're telling
these whimsical and ridiculous stories about white-collar females at
NASA who have to run half a mile simply to find a colored bathroom...
Well, that's far from fair. And that's why 12 Years a Slave is a truly
epic film, rightfully in the IMDb Top 250, and the likes of Moonlight
will be buried and forgotten once the hype lies down.Come think of it, there's a reason Kevin Costner looks so tired in this
film. Being the only white American allowed to be decent in a black
power/white guilt flick and being constantly put between the hammer and
the anvil of these two extreme opposites is a heavy load indeed.
