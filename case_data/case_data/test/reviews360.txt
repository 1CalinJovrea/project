Beautiful Atmosphere and an Interesting Mystery Help Blade Runner 2049 Continue a Classic Story

I've only seen the original Blade Runner once and it was a long time
ago. I liked it but I just haven't got around to revisiting it. I
mention this because even though I'm not a die-hard fan of Blade
Runner, I still found the plot of 2049 engrossing. It's a well put
together mystery, I found that they constantly took the plot in
unexpected directions and other than the trailer spoiling the return of
Deckard, I was always excited about what was going to happen next. The
movie pulls an excellent bait and switch at the end that really
surprised me. They made the right decision to not repeat the formula of
the first one and take the story to a new place. They also create some
compelling subplots which is something that few movies get right.The biggest star of this movie is the cinematography and the excellent
work of Roger Deakins. The original was noteworthy with the special
environment that Ridley Scott and his creative team brought to the
screen. That was continued here if not improved upon. The look of L.A.
in 2049 they decided to go with isn't completely distinct but it was a
little more understated (I'd compare it to the 2017 Ghost in the Shell
but less fantastical). My favourite scene might have been a shootout in
a defunct club where the lighting and the background show are turning
on and off. I don't hesitate to praise when a movie looks good but this
is an exemplary example of using visuals and atmosphere to help build
on a strong story.Blade Runner 2049 returns very few of the characters from the original
film but they manage to breathe life into this movie through the new
ones they created. Officer K isn't the most lively protagonist but he
gets an eye-opening character arc that kept me involved. Deckard
doesn't appear till later in the movie but he remains interesting and
what they decide to do with him makes his appearance worthwhile. I also
really liked some of the smaller supporting characters. Sapper really
helps kick off the movie, what Joi represents is extremely emotional
and Mariette is so mysterious that her involvement brings up more and
more questions. Add in that Niander Wallace and Luv make for pretty
menacing villains and you have a pretty well-rounded and fascinating
script.I don't think that the actors/actresses will be the focal point of the
awards attention that this movie will get but that doesn't mean there
aren't exemplary performances. Gosling is good as K, he's deliberately
robotic and he accomplishes a lot through his subtlety. Harrison Ford
isn't in the movie as much as I wanted him to be (he's still one of my
all-time favourite actors) but he holds up his end. He works with
Gosling well and they have a solid rapport. Surprisingly, I really
liked Sylvia Hoeks. She stole a lot of her scenes and I thought she was
great even acting against a stacked cast. Dave Bautista showed he has a
lot more range than people give him credit for. Jared Leto is in a very
Jared Leto role (deliberately weird and hard to understand) but he does
it well and although he might be a little creepy, the guy is still a
great actor. I also want to credit Ana de Armas, she was distinctly
warm and she showed a lot more emotion than I had seen from her
previously.There were points in this movie I could have rated this a 9/10 but some
small things that I had to dock the movie for. Even with a compelling
story, the movie has such a long run time that it couldn't help but
drag. There are certain scenes where the movie wants you to really
drink in the environment but they could have edited it a little
tighter. They also couldn't help but lose me at points through how much
artistic flair the utilize. Villenueve is an authority in this area and
while I appreciate an artistic approach to this science fiction tale,
for me they overdid it a little.I was surprised how much I ended up liking Blade Runner 2049. I think
if you're a big fan of the original, you'll love this to bits. This is
successful in bringing in the uninitiated but I think fans will enjoy
this even more. I haven't been on board for all of Villenueve's films
but this is a good combination of his artistic style with enough of a
commercial element for the masses. I'd give this somewhere between an
8-9 but with the extremely long run time, I'll give this an 8/10.
