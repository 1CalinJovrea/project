Just a horrible, lame film

One!!! Yes one.I put it one because I can't put it below zero.once you
reach a point where you say "enough", pulling a red line and no longer
tolerate the slightest. the Â«Wrath of the TitansÂ» do NOT qualify to
cross the path you! There are "bad" movies that were betrayed by a lack
of budget or technical resources, other than lack of talent in front
and back from the camera, others so miserable that they became cult or
simply must-see and shoot the other doomed simply because the outer
error messages contained. Yes, there are many ways to "bent" and a
movie, and most can be understood and respected. But in the case of
Â«WrathÂ» there are no mitigating.The authors built a stupid,
pointless, ridiculous, insulting, annoying, unsightly, historically
ignorant, rambling, anencephaly, childish, slipshod, awful and deadly
dull movie.There is absolutely nothing positive I can suggest (and I
after a quiet my conscience).Perhaps the only thing I can credit to
authors of this sad sequel is that they managed what seemed impossible
until recently: To make it worse than The clash!!! 0/10
