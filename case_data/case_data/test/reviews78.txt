Ridicoulous, stupid, offensive and dreadful..... would watch again!

Despite the movie is a over the top comedy that is ridiculous and
sometimes straight out offensive and disgusting, the movie makes you
laugh. I haven't laughed like this for a good while, so it does however
do its job as a comedy. if you are however looking for a calm comedy
that takes itself a little bit serious..... stay away XD It contains
offensive jokes, foul language (often from the small ones)
over-dramatic scenes with plot twists, scrap that! there is plot twists
everywhere, but the movie is for some reason able to keep you
entertained as you try to pick up all the popcorn you dropped on the
floor after laughing hysterically from a really bad line that just
turns even more awkward as the other character replies back. A must
watch mess for the ones that needs a good laugh, and bring a friend. It
makes the movie 10 time better when a cheap but funny line comes up and
both of you can relate XD
