Hidden Gem

I saw this on live TV either the year it came out or the following
year. This one moved me. Unlike any other film I have ever seen. Only
negative is it left me wanting more. Masterfully filmed, written and
the acting is top notch. This is a powerful story of female vampires or
revenant beings who do not age. What I loved about this film is how it
felt like watching two films side by side one that takes place
centuries ago in the past and another in modern day. I was fascinated
by the unique approach the creators chose to explain how a revenant is
made.
