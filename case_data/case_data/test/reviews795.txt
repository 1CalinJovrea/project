Marshall: The Movie

This movie was a breath of fresh air for me because it's about time a
movie that's not watered down with lies and faked. I enjoyed this film
because it talks about how he climbed the ladder from an early
interesting case. Chadwick Bozeman as a young Thurgood Marshall, civil
rights attorney who became the first African-American Supreme Court
justice. I enjoyed Kate Hudson for her impeccable performance and I
have to commend the music especially the song, Stand Up for Something
by Common and written by Diane Warren. An Oscar worthy song for all
generations to come.
