Insane, beautiful, terrorizing, epic, puzzling, intoxicating, gross, masterful. (Spoilers)

First, I must laugh at all the reviews of people who had no idea what
they were watching. We must all realize that all films are not written
for all people who watch. Just as I usually do not go see cartoon
films, others should give good thought before seeing such an 'artsy'
film as Mother!. Hey, if you didn't like Black Swan, think more than
twice on this one.Observation: There is a fire. Woman's face burning up. When cut to Javier holding a
crystal. He places the crystal on a metal stand and we watch the house
start healing itself, starting at that crystal. We cut to other parts
of the house, as it heals, from fire back to normal. Eventually we cut
to a bedroom where we see the bed healing itself and someone under the
covers. She arises and it is Mother, played by Jennifer. Odd names for
a film, right, but the names are never said in the film. We learn that
Him is an accomplished poet, but it seems like he is going through some
type of writer's block. Mother's mission is to refinish the house. A
lot has been done, but there is always more work to do. A man played by Ed Harris knocks at the door and Him greets the man and
allows him to enter, almost happy someone else is in the house. The man
is a doctor, but he smokes and drinks which causes him getting sick,
fairly easily. It doesn't bother Him, but Mother is quite concerned.Soon someone else arrives, a woman played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Turns
out the woman is the man's wife. She's a feisty one played convincingly
by Pfeiffer. Mother seems confused why Him allows these strangers to
stay in their house. The woman doesn't hold anything back when she has
a conversation with Mother. The woman asks why they don't have a baby?
Mother is pretty taken back by how forward the woman is. This does not
bother the drunk woman.The man & woman seem to find a fascination with the crystal. Mother
tells them not to touch it, but eventually they sneak in the room and
break it into 100's of pieces. Him becomes enraged! Mother wants the
man and woman to leave, but they don't and it's seems Mother is
powerless. Mother goes to their room and they are having sex so she
leaves. Even though Him is very upset he does not ask them to leave.
Are you putting the pieces together? 2 more guests, 2 sons arrive. They
fight, one becomes badly hurt & Him, the man & woman take him to the
hospital, but Him comes back and tells Mother he died. Soon people
start showing up, apparently for the funeral for the son and as more
arrive things become chaotic. Every person seems to represent something
different. The house becomes a disaster as everyone starts stealing
everything! After everyone leaves Him & Mother have a fight which turns into sex.
After Mother says she is pregnant. Him then becomes inspired to write a
new poem. He gives it to Mother to read. She cries and tells Him it is
magnificent. People start showing up again to praise Him for his poem. It is at this
point things start to become totally chaotic. Let's just say lots of
people show up and Aronofsky puts things in overdrive! The insanity on
the screen is brilliant and here is why I believe thisÂ… Interpretation: The film is basically an allegory our entire existence, and then some.
Him is G*d. Mother is Mother Nature or as Him calls her, home. Him
creates man and woman as Mother Nature creates everything around them.
The Poem is the Bible. The house is the world. The man is Adam, the
woman Eve. The sons Cain & Abel. We then basically witness an insane,
quick review from Christ to present time (about 20 minutes), and then
the demise of mankind. The film's use of the crystal represents the
'Apple'.Conclusion: When we look at this film in its entirety, taking 2 steps back, we see
the film summarizes man's existence. The beginning of the film shows he
tried before, but failed. Our existence, most of the film, also fails.
At the end, we see Him try once again. G*d's dilemma is free will. Him
only leads by verse (the Bible), but man's interpretation is what
creates conflict, as everyone has their own interpretation, thus
anarchy eventually occurs & eventually obliteration. Eden gets a
restart, over & over again.I find the film to be amazing in scope, like Cloud Atlas or A's The
Fountain. Like I said earlier, if you don't appreciate films like
these, or even Black Swan don't bother. It's simply not your brand. I
feel the film is an amazing encapsulation of our existence performed in
very unique fashion. The message here is strong. I prefer the
avant-garde probably because I've seen so many films. I need to view
films that present something new, and this one certainly does. For me,
it is a masterpiece. Aren't artists allowed to target their audience?
They all can't have happy endings. My 1000 words worth.
