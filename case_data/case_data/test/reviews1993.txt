Worth watching even if you have seen the story before

Last year I watched the excellent Anthropoid which deals with the same
subject matter. So I was wondering why there were 2 similar movies.
This new movie has a broader scope showing Heydrich from the Navy to
the Nazi party via his wife (a well suited Rosamund Pike). It also
shows him as a father and family man. Jason Clarke does a good job and
although he looks like a Nazi he actually doesn't look like Heydrich
who had a long thin face. It doesn't matter though.This story is so well suited to the screen it's still a very
interesting movie to watch even though it has been done so many times -
Operation Daybreak, Anthropoid and now this movie. The scope is broader
than Anthropoid showing lots of brutality in Poland, what Heydrich was
responsible for and later reprisals in Lidice. But Anthropoid handled
the church gun battle in a more exciting action movie way so I
recommend watching both movies. It's still one of the most exciting and
tragic stories of WWII and is very suited to screen treatment.The other cast members are quite A list like Jack O'Connell and Jack
Reynor play the heroic fighters quite effectively. Mia Wasikowska is
quite suited to the love interest resistance girlfriend of one of them.Well made and worth watching even if you think you think you may have
seen the story before.
