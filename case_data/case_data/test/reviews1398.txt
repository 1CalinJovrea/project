Awesome!!!!! i actually love this film. Its funny, exciting and very well done. :)

Woudld watch this film over because I love it! its got a hilarious
story and from what i have seen there are few plot holes. My opinion in
a nutshell? I love this film but must say it is not for everybody. good
fun and a laugh so its good for a quick film and provides plenty of
laughs for all your mates :) Good: funny and exciting Bad: characters
don't really fit in as much as id hoped overall a definite 8 or 9 out
of ten? My conclusion for this film is that it is great for a good
laugh and i personally like i but i do not think it is everyones type
of film. I like the story although it is a short one. difficult to find
a film as funny as this. Thanks y'all! happy reviewing! :D By Sam
