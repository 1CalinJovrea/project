This is the Mission Impossible format: Intro. Tom Cruise in the middle
of a mission in some far away country fighting bad guys while doing
unbelievable physical feats. 2. Tom Cruise receives a new mission he
always accepts, 3. He then gets attacked by bad guys or framed by the
organization who wants to destroy the world, 4. He meets hot
interracial girl who always tries to kill him but he ends falling in
love for her, 5. He sets up a team to find out the bad guy and usually
to get what bad guy needs, 6. He trespasses some impossible place were
humans cannot access and finds a way to get what the bad guy wants. 6.
He finds bad guy with what he needs and never gives it to him and gets
tortured in exchange(he can also get tortured at the beginning mission
too). 7. He beats bad guy. 8. Team is happy and end of story.Facts Tom Cruise never dies and never gets badly injured. He always
disables self destructing devices at the last millisecond. He is a
genius who can crack any code, memorize anything and figure out any
puzzle. He never rides motorcycles with a helmet. At least once in
every MI movie he disguises as the bad guy or semi-bad guy.
