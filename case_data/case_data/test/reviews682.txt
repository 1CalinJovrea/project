Unbelievably juvenile. Ridiculous story.

Not even sure what to say about this one. Kong was 950 feet tall. And
sweet. So sweet. Unless you threatened him or made him angry. Which
they managed to do. I think pretty much anything that Samuel Jackson is
in these days, must be avoided like the Bird flu. He is a compromised
actor of extreme proportions, and will literally do anything for a
buck. He is so tired. His routine is so old. Here he plays an army
officer, who of course has no respect for nature, animals, or the
earth. Hence the environmental statement. It is a statement that feels
like it was written by a 5 year old. Hollywood being the nearly
culturally bankrupt institution it is, seems to be incapable of a
balance, nuanced, elegant statement of any sort. So, they keep
producing this kind on inane garbage.Why did 14 helicopter pilots, when faced with a 950 foot tall Kong, who
has a wing span the size of several football fields, fly within swat
range of this beast? Was it not possible they could have done any
better than that? Does Hollywood really need to continue to insult us
at every possible opportunity? The only redeeming quality this movie had was John C. Reilly. His comic
touch was all that kept me from walking out on this turkey. Hollywood, you can do better than this. You need to stop catering to
Chinese teenagers. This movie was terrible.
