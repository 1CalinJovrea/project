Federalized Propaganda Machine of Hollywood - Get Off the Plantation!

I'm no fan of the police, and I know first hand that police officers
can be nasty and abuse their power, but the way "Straight Outta
Compton" portrays the LAPD is about as realistic as an X-Men villain.
Oh the big bad police keep picking on these low-lifes who make money
off exploiting their own people and promoting the spread of violence
within black communities... I like NWA, and I liked them all as solo
artists, so believe me when I say that this isn't an indictment on
their musical talent, but still this movie really annoyed me less than
halfway into it. As I've gotten older, I've learned how to think a
little more critically.NWA should not be glorified, those who control our society want you to
put these idiots on a pedestal, but don't do it! NWA was not some
rebellious voice that black people could rally around in an effort to
improve their lives... No, it was the opposite of that... NWA and
gangster rap in general is there to KEEP YOU ON THE PLANTATION! To fill
your head with criminal and immoral nonsense in an effort to keep you
stupid, keep you physically incarcerated, and keep you mentally
enslaved... That way nothing will ever change, and you will continue to
destroy yourself and your community. And that's the real........
