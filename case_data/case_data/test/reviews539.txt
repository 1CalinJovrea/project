Was decent.....

this movie is so riddled with plot holes, flaws, horrible cgi and
horrible jokes its ridiculous the more i think about this film the
worse it gets and initially i loved it but man some of the stuff in
this film can just not be excused from the horrible villain, the weak
plot and character motivations i could go on and on all day. after how
great the winter soldier was i thought this next cap would be next
level especially with the russos at the helm and wow did it let me down
A lot. just not a good film at allokay all of zemos plans made no sense think about it how would zemos
plan even work if falcon never told tony where they went? how and why
was there a random camera in the middle of an isolated road in the tree
line pointing directly across the road at more trees exactly where
bucky killed tonys parents like come on? also bucky broke free of those
restraints when he was getting interrogated by zemo why didn't he just
cover his ears so he couldn't hear the trigger words? also how did zemo
even get in there its a top secret government location not a nightclub
a fake id isn't going to cut it the avengers and the government did no
extra investigation into the sokovia accords bombing and just ordered a
shoot to kill order off of a fake picture? . thats pretty weak for the
avengers and the government. zemo is a flaw to me he is only used as a
plot device no development what so ever and he is the key to everything
happening he could've been great!! the cgi for spidey is horrible man
but thats not a big deal to me but spidey ant man and hawk eye are so
shoehorned in especially the 2 non avengers like think about it why are
they even there? its just for the spectacle but makes no sense you're
going to bring a brand new superhero who's 15 years old to a "war"
(which it wasn't) and he didn't even need to be there. there's more and
more i can keep going on about but they are all overshadowed and
clouded by the action and jokes. it was a good film its just not as
flawless as everyone is saying it has great action set pieces 10/10 but
as a film story etc it isn't that good. i don't want to seem
overcritical but thats how everyone was with BvS except i can explain
their plot holes no one can explain mine yetï»¿that being said I'm very excited for the black panther movie directed
by coogler so that looks like its going to be great because the
character has great potential that goes for spidey too they just need
to fix his CGI it was horrible in this film and he is one of my
favorite character in pop culture period so i hope they do him justice
