Miraculously unkillable elves fight endlessly with badly CGI-d orcs

A large proportion of the film is over-taken with elf-orc fight scenes:
two elves that aren't even in the book manage to heroically slaughter
hundreds of orcs in scenes that aren't in the book.The ridiculous 'not in the book' love interest between the female
not-in-book elf and dwarf culminates in her healing him from a wound
that didn't happen in the book, which separates him from the others
(again, not in book) using magical powers that it is really unlikely
she would have even if she did exist as only a tiny number of elves
have that power.Then at the end, in more 'not from the book' drama, it would seem that
hiding behind a sliver of stone will shield people completely from
nearby dragon-fire. DRAGON FIRE which apparently doesn't get you if you
turn the corner or jump off the cliff in the nick of time.This lies at the heart of what is wrong with this film, it is trying to
turn the Hobbit into an action movie complete with totally unbelievable
escapes from danger. This is (theoretically) based on a children's
book, it should be more Narnia and less LOTR. Just because they are in
the same world should not make this a prequel to LOTR.Also, all of this inserted stuff really grates and is mostly boring as
it has no substance. I don't believe films have to slavishly follow the
book but any changes should be justified and these most definitely are
not.Finally, the new bits are given precedence over the actual story and
original content. How can they turn a single book into three films and
yet cut-down or skip or rush through loads of really good bits from the
book? How can they expand the fake characters at length and yet the
real characters are barely used? Only a couple of the dwarfs are even
distinguishable from each other.No real attempt has been made to dramatise or flesh out the Hobbit book
at all. This is a completely different film. And not even a good one.
