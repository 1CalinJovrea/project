Yet another young adult film

I have not read the book and certainly will not after seeing the movie.
Basically it felt like a mash up of several recent films, combining the
futuristic and oppressive world where people are not allowed to feel,
the rules that are "for the good of the people" and where people are
being assigned their roles in life, where everything is iPhone white
and boring gray and where there are some young adolescent heroes that
are willing to change the world. The movie ends with a horrible deus ex
machina that makes everything work out fine, despite any reasonable
expectation.Now, I rate this film an average because people acted well, the film
was reasonably well directed and at no moment in time did I feel like
there was any attempt to do anything more than what was on the screen.
So the film does not fail as a cinematic endeavor. It does fail
personally, for me, as it made me feel nothing except "oh, this is
taken from Divergent! Oh, this is from Equilibrium! Look, they couldn't
afford Tom Cruise, so they cast his ex wife".Bottom line: nice looking and boring, just like the future society the
main character fought against. The imagery and emotional content was as
heavy handed as a woodsman's axe, the ideas unoriginal, the story
uninspiring. Another Apple movie (yes, I know it's red!)
