Genuinely Terrible

I will preface this by saying that I have not read the books. I did see
the first movie and actually enjoyed it. I usually watch movies such as
this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasn't bad. This movie,
however, was terrible. (Heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to
follow)I've heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book.
If that's the case, I can't speak for the book but the movie script
looks to have been written by a high-schooler, at best. The movie is riddled with clichés: Main character with a dark inner
battle raging due to prior decisions made (boring!). People (and
armies) showing up just at the perfect time (forgivable once, not
around the 5th time). Bad guys who couldn't hit a target 20 feet in
front of them while shooting an automatic weapon (man those guys suck).
And the ultimate "faked death with poison/paralysis" scene (wow that
whole scene was bad). Throughout the whole movie the main character (the annoying tom-boy
girl), Tris, keeps being painted as "tough" and "deadly". She is
neither of these. In fact, she is quite laughably the opposite. Could
her personal trainers not put her through some weight-training classes?
(Her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she
just stepped out of a Hollywood salon right after the scene where she
cut her OWN hair with a pair of rusty scissors....) It looks like she
couldn't even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving
people falling over ledges with ease. But she looks like a huge wuss!
Her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing
"action" made me bust out laughing. And the scene where she breaks
through the glass is meant to be bad-ass and instead just left me
hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back (man, I
wanted to laugh so bad). And probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how
POINTLESS everything was. Examples: They fight the faction-less on the
train, killing several and doing serious damage to many more (not
really sure how because Tris fights like a sissy girl). Then the main
character, Four, says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds
through bloodied teeth is like, "Oh we cool bro. Never mind you just
head-butted me in the face and killed my friends." (the Hell??) (Oh and
Tris's brother is a huge pussy). They continue to fight hard and kill
people to narrowly escape the perfectly- uniformed drone guards of the
"capital" so that they can go in to hiding. Then the main character
just gives herself up. I think it was because the villain was
threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices
(never seen that before), but it doesn't really matter. Then she's
given the chance to escape by her double- double crossing 'friend'
(didn't see that coming) and yet she chooses to stay to open the
mystery divergent box. Well what was the point of anything if you
wanted to open it anyway??! I was DYING to contain my frustration.
(also, how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built
divergent-box-opening proprietary chamber system, complete with
bulletproof glass and mystery-box holding pedestal, just already set
up? Does no one question this stuff???)And to top it all off, the super-secret, must-be-preserved-at-all-
costs message in the box, (the ENTIRE point of the movie): "Divergents
are cool, don't ostracize them. Oh, and the rest of humanity is living
outside the wall. Cheers." What? No one has bothered to check this
whole time?????? Gag.Enough roasting. To conclude, lots of movies, even good ones, have
clichés and information that you are just supposed to assume. But this
movie was genuinely terrible. Maybe all the people reviewing this with
an 7/10+ saw a different movie than I did.
