Difficult sitting through this when nothing happens in this boredom of a horror movie.

Wish Upon is something that you wish it was not made or wished that you
did not see the film in the first place. It's a supernatural horror
movie that does not have any scares, thrills, or a movie worth
remembering. It slightly reminds me that it feels like a Final
Destination movies, were some supernatural occurrences involve people
getting killed by accidents. But the film is about a Chinese music box
that gives anyone seven wishes to make. 17 year old Clare ((Joey King)
was given the box after her father (Ryan Phillippe) picked it up from a
dumpster. Clare makes her first wish after an encounter with a bully in
high school. The wish comes true and involves the bully getting rotten.
Therefore, she makes another wish to help her and her dad financially.
And it goes on from there. Every wish she makes has a repercussion to
others. And once she reaches the seventh wish, she will have to pay the
price with her life. Which she was unaware of. But her friend was able
to figure this all out and warn her about the consequences of this box. The plot was just stupid and cliché. Even after Clare makes the first
wish and realizes how evil this box is. She continues to use it for her
own selfish reasons. It does make it difficult to even care for her.
Especially, when her own friends are getting killed or neighbors are
dying. It took almost ¾ of the movie and several body counts until she
realizes the box is evil and she needs to get rid of it. There was no scares or thrills. The film was very dull and boring. Like
it was difficult to pay attention to the screen when nothing was
happening throughout the whole movie. The script was tedious.
Characters did not have any emotional connection too. Even for Clare,
who lost her mother at a young age. And it is still difficult to care
for her, when she is getting picked on by bullies and her ignorance
when she finds this mysterious box. No offense to Joey King. She is a sweet actress. But this film is
definitely not worth checking out. If you seen Final Destinations, than
you saw the better version of thrills on seeing people getting caught
in deadly accidents. Wish Upon is a horrible film. There were no scares. The plot was cliché
and stupid. The direction and script was very boring and terrible
writing. The acting was terrible. I rate the film 1 out of 5 stars. I do not recommend the film unless
its on TV. Otherwise, I ll pass on this one.
