Though I remember enjoying the previous Matt Damon-Bourne movies, they weren't fresh enough to keep me from enjoying The Bourne Legacy as well

While I had previously seen the Matt Damon-Bourne movies and remember
enjoying them, I had watched them once when they came out and therefore
can't remember specific details. So it was in seeing this new one with
Jeremy Renner as the lead but as a different character from Damon's
that I approached this one with a fresh perspective in following what
was going on and why. So on that note, I enjoyed this one just as much
as the others maybe even a little more since this one doesn't have the
shaky-cam the others had. And I also liked Rachel Weisz as the doctor
who escaped from her lab after an associate of hers was killing the
other lab partners. And I loved seeing Renner and her together just
running to survive whether through Maryland (which is where I'm
currently vacationing right now) or the Philippines which is where my
mom and late dad originally came from and my sisters had visited when
they were little but I and my brother have yet to go to. It's possible
I might have been a little more critical of this movie if I, like many
reviewers on this site, had nearly perfect memory of those previous
Bourne movies but as it is now, I highly enjoyed The Bourne Legacy.
