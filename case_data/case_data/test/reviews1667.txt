Just telling my experience.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is an amazing experience. It's
thrilling, it's romantic, it's hilarious, and actioned pack!! I love
love love this movie. The humor is depicted to the audience in a form
that doesn't dumb down the dialogue. It's was brilliant and the cast
was fluid. Extremely worth watching. The setting is perfect for the
world our protagonist live in. The lore is tolerable. I personally
distrust zombie movies however I enjoyed every second. Would recommend
it to anyone looking to loose themselves in this wild piece of work.
Truly a roller-coaster of fun. Please watch with an open mind and leave
that pride and prejudice at home you zombie! #PPZ movie!!!!
