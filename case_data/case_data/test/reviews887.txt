An Enjoyable new generation of teen comedy

I never herd the term Duff before and I don't know if it exist in real
culture, but it made for a humorous movie. Bianca Piper is The Duff (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Though it sounds
very cruel when spelled out, abbreviated it just means your not as cool
or as hot as the friends you hang around, and if your a teenage girl
who was made aware of this by your idiot jock next store neighbor
without previous knowledge that you were different from your herd, that
could put you on a downward spiral.This movie is just more proof that teenagers don't change (technology
does and social media plays a very large part in this movie), which is
why the movie seems formulated. I would not spoil anything if I told
you how it ends so long as you have seen a teen comedy before.I find the topic of the Duff fascinating. The character itself has been
seen in every teen movie ever. It's always the main protagonist, the
semi-cooler kid that wants the protagonist to party and the third
wheel, that now has a name. For the first time in teen comedy history(I
think) that third wheel got it's own flick and it turns out the Duff is
funnier than the one liners we had it say over the course of time.Mae Whitman played the character with amusing results.I totally recommended seeing this film. highly enjoyable
