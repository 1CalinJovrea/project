Just does not do anything

It may have a lot of good reviews but this film does fall flat on its
story. I think that if you have a large gang of armed skinheads that
are out to kill you and there are only two of you left unarmed there is
no way that a girl with a Stanley knife is going to save the day. The
film had a good story line at the start but just seemed to be rushed at
the end and then making its mistakes even though it had a real good
cast of actors. Don't get me wrong it is a enjoyable film but its the
type of film that once you visit you would not return to watch it
again. But if you like your serving of realistic blood and gore then
this film would not disappoint you.
