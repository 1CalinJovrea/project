Not impressed at all

Narrow in scope, this movies attempts to stereotype Asian culture using
the history of the 47 Ronin as a lose reference.Another one of Hollywood's poor attempt to draw on the appeal of
eastern culture for western viewers. With the clich√© of the central
"Caucasian" character immersed in an "oriental backdrop". Not
convincing enough as either fantasy or action/ adventure. Tragic waste of acting talent and cinematography, as it was trumped by
the weak,dull, far too predictable plot and dialog.Suitable for those who enjoy shallow representations of "foreign
culture".
