Worst cinematography Ever!

Jason Bourne hurt my eyes.I had to look away from the action sequences because the blurred
confusion of light and colour gave me a headache. The almost steady
establishing shots were way too brief, and were gone before you had a
chance to marvel at the city of Rome or Athens laid out before you.I've rated it awful because it is the only movie I've thought about
asking for my money back - the camera work is really that bad.The same old story is getting very old. Surely the CIA would have
brought Bourne in by now, instead of wasting all their time, energy and
agents, trying to kill him?Does the CIA have external enemies, or does this series of movies
suggest it is a self perpetuating entity that spends all its resources
fighting among itself?As for the way the agency can see and hear everything, that too is
getting old. The fog of war is real, and should play a part in the
story. If only Uber drivers could get to you as fast as the agency can
get to Bourne, in the middle of a city, during rush hour, it would be
amazing.This tired old horse of a movie series died from flogging quite a few
movies back. It is time for Bourne to move on, and with a much better
cinematography director.
