A peace a sh**t STINKER garbage!

*MAJOR SPOILERS* This is absolutely garbage STINKER the worst horror movie sequel ever
made! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was always the worst horror
franchise and the sequels are absolutely the worst horror films! Texas
Chainsaw 3D is a peace a sh**t garbage f***ing movie! It is so bad
material film that everyone in this movie is awful, the acting is
sh**t, the writing is lazy the direction is terrible. Everyone from the
actors and actresses in this movie are asshole and a scumbag they are
not likable. I did not care about any of the characters and I did not
had any mourn for leatherface at all. I hate this franchise and I blame
Marilyn Burns for this disappointment failure! Who wrote this crap
anyway? Why did Marilyn Burns return after 38 years in a cameo role to play the
villain on the end of the film? She played a heroine in 1974 Sally
Hardesty a likable beautiful character a hero and a soul survivor that
everyone loved including me. But suddenly she played an aunt of
leatherface on the end of the movie in a cameo role she played
accomplice to a villain psycho serial killer! Just why? She sold her
soul only to get a gab cash to get a paycheck. She was awful and she
lost a respect by me because of this movie. She had a cameo role in
Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation why? Only to get a
paycheck I guess. I hate this franchise and I hate the actress for
making a cameo role to play a villain to a serial killer leatherface.
Did Heather Langenkamp return in A Nightmare on Elm Street sequels to
play a villain? No. Did Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween return to play
a villain in any of the Halloween sequels? no. Did Amy Steel from
Friday the 13th Part 2 return to play in any Friday the 13th sequels to
play accomplice to a serial killer, no. Did Lar Park-Lincoln from
Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood return to play the accomplice
to a serial killer in the sequel's no. Did Lisa Wilcox from a Nightmare
on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master return in any of the sequels to play
a cameo role a villain? No! No one of the actresses who played a
heroine returned in a sh**ty cameo role but Marilyn Burns did that,
that is why she lost my respect.This movie sucks a dick, should it suppose to be a family horror film
or something? I did not cheer or mourn for any of the characters in
this movie they were all assholes and unlikable! This movie turn in to
a lead character Heather (Alexandra Daddario) from a shi**less victim,
from a heroine to a villain in this film! Heather's friends are
brutally murdered by Leatherface, whom she discovers to be her cousin,
she feels sorry for him and loves him because he's "family?! It's not
even like he's a close relative. She doesn't even know him. One minute
she's scared sh**less of him and the next she loves him AND helps him
kill a couple more people?? Are we supposed to believe that her thought
process was: "Oh, hey Cuz, you just knocked me out in the kitchen,
almost cut me up with a chainsaw in a coffin, tried killing me by
flipping our van, chased me through a carnival with a chainsaw forcing
me to hang on to a Ferris Wheel for my life AND killed all of my
friends. But that's all okay.. I forgive you because we're family. Now
I'm going to help you kill people and take care of you for the rest of
my life." All I could say was... Seriously... wtf just happened. She
stabs a guy with a working tool fork trampled him and than she throw a
chainsaw to Leatherface helped him to kill more people wtf! Her friends were all assholes the black guy who played Heather's
boyfriend was cheating her with her best friend Nikki (Tania Raymonde).
Her best friend Nikki is a junkie addicted to drugs we see her smoking
a pot, that guy who played Darryl was a user and a thief he was
stealing from the Sawyer house and he let leatherface out because of
him people died. Alexandra Daddario stinks! She is the worst awful
horrible shi*** actress in the movie business ever and Scott Eastwood
is also horrible in this STINKER movie ever. F 1/10 F**K this movie! The original was a classic and a perfect good film. The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre 2 sucks too only Dennis Hopper was good in it. Leatherface:
Texas Chainsaw Massacre III in my opinion is the best sequel movie I
like. We at least have likable characters we have young Viggo
Mortensen, Ken Foree from Dawn of the Dead (1978) and of course Kate
Hodge better actress and heroine than ugly Alexandra Daddario - her
acting was horrible in this movie! The 2003 remake was awesome it was
my first film of the TCM I saw and Jessica Biel was awesome bad ass and
likable heroine she was Miles way better than sh**ty Alexandra
Daddario. I did not see Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation or
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning yet and I never will!
