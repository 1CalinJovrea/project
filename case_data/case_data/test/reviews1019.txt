Very Chilling Film With An Excellent Dark Tone

One my my favorite horror films of the last decade was 2015's "The
Witch", I loved how the movie set a dark tone that continued to get
darker and darker as the movie progressed. I don't mind horror films
that are a little lighthearted or even a bit humorous, however I really
love when a horror film decides to just be dark & dreary as possible
without ever really making you feel like things are going to get
better. "February" does not quite pack the punch the The Witch had but
it is still a very interesting film with a pitch black tone. The film follows Kat and Rose, two girls at an all female boarding
school who are left alone at the school when their parents fail to pick
them up for break. From there things take a bit to really get going,
the film moves at a very slow pace however I thought that worked and
matched the tone well. There really isn't much action or shock scenes,
but for me that just made the shock scenes even better when they
finally did happen. There was one scene in particular that kind of just
pops out of nowhere and actually gave me chills a bit. I honestly don't have a lot to say about this film, but at the same
time I really felt the need to write review because this is one that
stuck with me and had me still thinking about it a few days after
viewing it. It's not perfect, the pacing won't be for everybody and I'm
sure many people will find it too drab and depressing to get any
enjoyment out of it. But I really liked it and think it does a good job
of standing out in a genre that is filled with too many clich√© films. 7/10
