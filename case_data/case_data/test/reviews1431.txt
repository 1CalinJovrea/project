A No Spoiler Review - A Fantastic Unique Thriller

Nightcrawler is slang. I will not ruin or spoil anything in this
review. Jake Gylenhall has never been better. His character must have
been incredibly hard to play, and you will see why. There is a reason
this Thriller & Drama opened on Halloween. His character is ambitious
to a fault & highly intelligent. He interacts most often with Rene
Russo & a man he calls his intern. If you thought Julius Caesar was
ambitious or Alexander the Great, this character must have the same
motivation to succeed minus the goal of conquering the world. Needless
to say he is driven. Russo is also ambitious, so they make a good team.
The difference is how far each is willing to cross the lines of
morality, legality & humanity. The movie is original in every sense. There has never been a movie
similar in the character or the situation, and the movie makes an open
commentary about an important but not political aspect of American
society. To say it was gripping would be literal. I looked down at one
point, and I was clutching my outer thigh. The movie is tense &
intense. Every move seems known to Gylenhall but not to anyone else. If
you like entrepreneurs, this movie will appeal to that in one aspect.
Overall, it is definitely a Thriller full of danger & illegality. It is
Gylenhall versus the world, if he were a diplomat & the world
represented achieving his goals. That's his character around others.
When left unwatched, even for a moment, he devolves into a character
that does whatever it takes. See this movie for the originality. See it if you enjoy thrillers. See
it because he gives the best acting performance of his life in a
character with many sides. See it for fun. See it for a cool fast car.
Or, the fact it is tracking above 8 stars out of 10 which is about as
good as it gets on IMDb, considering that is the average of thousands &
thousands of ratings by people as diverse as patrons watching on a
Washington, D.C theater. From that number you can safely predict it's
very likely you will find it as highly entertaining as the
international average (plus or minus 1 star). In my estimation, I
reserve a 9/10 rating for the best of the best. 10/10 stars are for the
greatest movies. This is easily the best of the best. One friendly tip: If you are on heart, or anxiety medication, take it
as scheduled or if it's as needed, make sure it's within reach. Knox D. Alford, III
