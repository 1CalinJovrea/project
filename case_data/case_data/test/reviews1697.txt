Hotel Transylvania 2 revision and opinions

A sequel to Hotel Transylvania, Hotel Transylvania 2 begins with a slow
zoom-in on the castle itself. Everything is being thrown around and put
together for Jonathan (human) and Mavis's (vampire) wedding. All that
matters to Dracula is that his daughter is happy at the hotel that use
to only allow monsters to stay, until Jonathan found it in the first
movie. Time passes and great news about a baby in the Dracula family is
to be born by Mavis. Excited and motivated, Dracula is determined to
see Dennis, the baby boy, become a great vampire and carry the legacy
of Dracula. The main problem was Dennis didn't have fangs when he was
born and he had until five years old to grow them in so he could stay
at Hotel Transylvania, because Mavis wanted a human to get human
interaction. She thought it wasn't safe with all the monsters around. The story itself is amusing and fun for kids who are into the social
world and know the traditional stories of monsters such as:
Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf, Invisible Man, Mummy and other
monsters. An example of the social world being incorporated into the
monster world was the desk clerk monsters for the hotel were playing
with a picture app on a phone that allows you to disfigure your face or
body. Jonathan was innovating the hotel by getting monsters connected
through computers and phones since they were now allowing humans to
stay at the hotel. There were instances where humans were interacting
with the monsters with no problem. For instance, Dracula was taking
Dennis out so he could scare the fangs into him at Dark Forest
Municipal Park, a place crawling with humans just walking, jogging, or
with their pets. Frankenstein tried to scare two girls that were
jogging and they flipped out, because it was the popular Frankenstein
and they wanted a picture with him. Four-year-old Dennis jumped out
right after and said "boo," but only got a pat on the head instead of
frightening girls. Dracula was also asked by a man driving a car where
him and the girl in the passenger seat could get a "bite" to eat, not
thinking that it was a blood drinking vampire. Werewolf, or Wayne, was
directed to kill something in the forest for food but didn't want to
because there were pop tarts now. I'm a fan of animated films and comedy, which the film did well in
both. A lot of the scenes incorporated humans and monsters and showed
how the dialogue between both was funny. For example, Dracula's new
phone given by Jonathan has a GPS with a deep vampire voice. A scene
also showed how great Invisible man was at teaching his workout class.
The sleeping lullaby that was sung by Dracula was "suffer, suffer,
scream and shout," showed an example of the difference in a human
lullaby and Dracula's. A lot of cool effects were part of the movie as well since there were
monsters. For instance, Dracula could change into a bat and have powers
to freeze people or change objects. Another cool effect was showing the
pack of werewolves, made by Wayne and his wife Wanda, become a wave
that swept through the birthday party decorations and shaving anyone in
their way from hip down. Also, Dracula's dad coming to Dennis's fifth
birthday party showed nice effects by changing the human in a monster
suit to a scary monster with sharp teeth and muscles popping onto the
body to scare the fangs out of Dennis.However, everyone's attempt to scare the fangs into Dennis did not
work. Dracula's dad's vampire minion hurting Winnie, werewolf girl that
Dennis liked, made Dennis's fangs come out. It was followed by a fight
between the Hotel Transylvania family and the bundle of vampire minions
being crushed. In this fight alone, you get to witness Dennis showing
his strength, his bat flying skills, and his ability to freeze people.
In the end, scaring the fangs out of Dennis didn't work. Instead,
Dennis's want to protect Winnie brought out his fangs. Dracula was so
obsessed with Dennis becoming a vampire that he almost forgot he didn't
care if Dennis was going to be a human, a vampire, or a unicorn.
Regardless of what Dennis became, Dracula would adore and love his
grandchild. The grandpa vampire, Vlad, was originally a vampire
conservative type of guy but ended up changing his ways and stopping
his vampire minion from killing Jonathan. The movie ended in a great
way by connecting all the family members together, Jonathan's human
family and Dracula's monster family.The only thing I think the movie could improve on was the jumping back
and forth of scenes. When Mavis went with Jonathan to visit his family
in Santa Cruz, California, it seemed like their stay was brief and the
scenes lasted longer than it should have since the focus was on Dennis
getting his fangs. I can see why they were sent off though, because it
was part of the plan to get the protective mom, Mavis, away so the
scaring could happen. Overall the incorporation of humans and monsters
comfortably in each scene was great and made the movie enjoyable and
family friendly. Some of the animated character's voices were played by Adam Sandler
(Dracula), Andy Samberg (Jonathan), Mavis (Selena Gomez), Frankenstein
(Kevin James), Werewolf Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Invisible Man Griffin
(David Spade), and Mummy Murray (Keegan- Michael Key). The director of
Hotel Transylvania 2 is Genndy Tartakovsky and writing credit were
given to Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel. I can see why the comedy came
so easily since Adam Sandler was in it, and he had some characters who
are in a lot of his other movies as well such as Grown Ups and Just Go
with It ("Biography," IMDb.com). Since the movie was animated, the
monsters and their facial expressions made the jokes come to life.
