Very cool movie

I think people are hating on this movie way more than they should. Yes
it is a horror film and no i was not terrified crying in the corner of
the theater, but to say this movie didn't scare you it just seems like
you think you're this super macho man who isn't scared of anything
because you beat slender-man at 2 am in your parents basement. The
hand-held camera work is still a very cool concept in my opinion and
the filmmakers did an amazing job with this, primarily because they're
actually in the catacombs of Paris! Let alone i thought the actors did
a great job, and it was very believable and it the hand-held camera
work made you feel like one of the characters experiencing the whole
thing. No it was not the scariest movie of all time, no it doesn't have
some deep meaning, but for the 9$ i spent to go see it, i absolutely
loved it. Very cool movie in concept and it was done very well. People
who hate on this movie really just don't appreciate it
