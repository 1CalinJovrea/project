Trailer misleads badly- the movie's not bad at all

OK the trailer said this wasn't the legend we had heard. But the
trailer did showcase mythical creatures and implied we would still see
"The Son of Zeus"And here lies the film's problem. And it isn't really the film's
problem at all - it is the trailers!It simply means that the entire audience start watching the film and
within 5 minute experience a massive downer on the film as it appears
Hercules is a fraud, a common mercenary living off his fake tales.If the trailer was done properly this would not be a problem, because
if you can put the trailer and the marketing out of your mind, what you
actually have is a decent popcorn flick that is by far the most
compelling telling of Hercules on-screen since the animated Disney
tale, and in many respects it surpasses that tale in a much more
satisfying manner.The trailer should NOT have shown any of the mythical elements, which
belong to dream sequences and tales within tales, barely 5 minutes of
the movies running time.Forget the trailer, enjoy the movie for what it is. It is not first
class, but for Brett Ratner it is surprisingly coherent story-telling,
and The Rock and his fellow actors sell the rather predictable twists
with surprising humanity. Much worse is offered at the summer box
office.
