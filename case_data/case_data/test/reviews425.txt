Waste of time

Rian Johnson fiction film (as it contains no science) Looper should be
the line in the sand to say enough. Cinema going has turned into such a
trite state that a film like this could be critically acclaimed and
mass released. In the day and age of no heart films, torture porn and
saccharine dramas we again have to endure the waste of time, resources
and column space that a films like this garners. At a time when other
worthwhile films slip into obscurity of small openings and DVD bargain
bins.Looper commits the most atrocious of cinematic crimes it abuses the
viewers trust in a way that even Von Trier would be embarrassed by in
all his emotion manipulation. Looper's first thirty minutes run by
smoothly. It appears self-assured, paced confidently and even though
the science and exposition is at best first grader and a worst lazy
film- making we can forgive all of this and just go with it. Taking in
the sub-standard portrayal of the future with none of the background
social commentary of other genre films. Apart from some lazy shorthand
referencing Doretha Lang's depression photograph of Mother With Seven
Children replaced with future vagrant mother and child leaving behind
any social cause and effect. Then as Bruce Willis Old Joe meets Joseph Gordon Levitt's Young Joe the
prosthetics take on a comically feel (recalling Pachino's villain in
Dick Tracy). We feel we are getting to the meat of the story instead we
find derivative shoot-outs, chases and uncompelling dialogue. At this
point it all falls apart and the film runs into the dangerous space
that modern cinema is not only touching on but beginning to permanently
occupy. The portrayal of females in the film is typical of the misogynistic
movement in modern America's cinema. Women are passive objects to be
both lusted and tortured. In Lopper all the women portrayed are Whores
or Junkies or have a perverse struggle with motherhood. Emily Blunt's character is given a back-story from a daytime drama. She
shown to have no motivation apart from giving into compulsion. Any
chance at positive female representation is at utter loss when she
makes an-out-of nowhere unconvincing booty call with her child's
adapted frog toy to Young Joe. This scene is complete with ridiculously
out of place romantic piano score. One gets the feeling the film-makers
have misogynist issues that should have been worked out in therapy and
not in celluloid. Before all of this trite we get Bruce Willis's terrible act of killing
a child an act in cinema that Hitchcock in his conversations with
Truffaut remarked is a guaranteed way to lose an audience. It has been
done with a level of respect in films such as Afflecks Gone Baby Gone.
In Looper it is unforgivable not only because of the act, but also in
the way Johnson manipulates the audience and scenario for maximum
effect (making him parallel with pushers of Torture Porn).We are asked to believe that a child straight off a Disney set walks
into the wrong film and towards a pretty suburb home, which is
unguarded, in this state of societal collapse and mass crime. All this
is for effect so when Old Joe shoots him we are more shocked, more
horrified It is one of the more distasteful and undoubtedly
manipulative scenes in recent cinema. At the midway point the films personality splits, and it turns into a
horror film about telekinetic abilities? In what seems like a pinned on
sub-plot brought to the fore because they didn't know how to end the
film. The ending of self-sacrifice was a laughable attempt at
catharsis. This infantile film should be laughed off the screens, especially given
the sub-standard performances, Emily Blunts failure at acting 101 in
the miming smoking scene comes to mind, . Critics drawing positive attention even with the quip that it
entertains should be ashamed. The role of the critic should be to
enlighten. To shine a light towards the possibly unseen both within
popular entertainment films and the unseen films that push the art form
forwards.
