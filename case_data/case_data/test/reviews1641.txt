Worst spiderman movie ever

Seriously the worst Spiderman movie I've watched. The first three
movies in my opinion were the best. In this film Peter Parker is
portrayed as a hyperactive, silly, and immature teenager. They make him
seem very weak and unimportant compared to other avengers. Furthermore
I disagree with the use of gadgets and high tech suit. This is not how
Spiderman should be portrayed and remembered. Honestly Spiderman is my
favourite superhero and I grew up with him, but with the original
Spiderman not this silly version and I'm just sad that people will now
have this view of Spiderman instead of how Spiderman used to be and
SHOULD be.
