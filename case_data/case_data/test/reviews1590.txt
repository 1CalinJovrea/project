Visually compelling - but otherwise imperfect

This is a must-see film for any Van Gogh fanatic or indeed, anyone who
is passionate about art. It is innovative and visually striking, and
the loving time and attention that has been devoted to the art is clear
and obvious throughout.The story itself is not to be repeated here and many people know or
believe that they know the Van Gogh story (thanks to his numerous
letters he is one of the great artists that we can claim to have a
deeper insight into).Where the film struggles is the plot. First of all it's a retelling of
a story that many people know. It's clear that the premise was wanting
to use the art in a particular way - but actually the story line, the
plot, is the secondary consideration.I question how historically accurate the presentation of this story
actually is. I would really like to know how they could reference the
tensions that exist between different characters and the presentation
of different figures. Are they real or imagined for narrative purpose?I get the feeling that the writers wanted to express the dichotomy of
Van Gogh - the gentle, perceptive, altruistic man, and also the fiery,
troubled, confrontational, argumentative soul. So do they project these
perceptions upon their characters - or are these positions anchored in
truth?The movement of the film is actually quite slow. I would say that
someone who didn't have a specific love of Van Gogh might consider it
to be slow and uneventful.Of course the outcome is inevitable and tragic - so the air of
melancholy hangs over the whole presentation. It would have been more
of an achievement to actually present the joy that must have been
present (at least at times) in the soul of this great genius. This
doesn't come across because the film is saturated in sorrow.The dialogue is basic and doesn't ever challenge the actors - but the
presentation is fine, and at times very good (Chris O'Dowd is my
outstanding actor in this film).Bottom line is that this film is saved by the unique presentation - had
it been a 'straight forward' film acted in a standard format, it
wouldn't have got made, it would be too bland. It would be somewhere
between documentary and biography and a little bit dry at that (not for
cinema anyway).As it happens, I'm a huge admirer of Van Gogh and I have taken enough
interest in him to watch several documentaries and to read a number of
accounts of his life. For me this was well worth the wait - and if
you're in the same boat you will enjoy it too. If you're not that
interested in Van Gogh as an individual you might not get the same kick
out of it. It is definitely for a very particular audience.
