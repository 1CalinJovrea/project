chicken burrito and kentucky fried chicken

This is my first ever review on IMDb and after watching this movie a
few hours ago I was compelled to register on IMDb so I could play the
Battleship guessing game with you (similar to the original Battleship,
only that it's not).Q1: How does a radio telescopes work? Do they A - Detect and collect data on radio sources B - Shoot some type of visible light laser beam to another solar system
in the hope to communicate with aliens?Answer: B - It's hard for someone to imagine how a signal is sent. Q2: What would be the best way for an alien ship to travel once on
earth? A - Fly B - Hop on the water (in one direction) like a cross between a water
strider and a frogAnswer: B - Also staying true to their weapons system which only work
line of sight.Q3: Once the alien destruction robots are launched to attack and weaken
the human defense, do they A - Destroy 20 unarmed helicopters B - Ruin a field where kids are playing baseball C - Destroy the only remaining docked Battleship equipped with Harpoon
and Tomahawk missiles D - Attack some concrete pillars holding up a section of a freewayAnswer: A,B,D - Who would ever think that the USS Missouri had a better
chance of attacking the aliens as opposed to a freeway.Q4: Your a bad-ass alien who traveled ten's of light years to take over
another planet, what do you bring as a personal weapon? A - A ray guy than can evaporate anything in sight B - Any other type of projectile weapon C - A knife that looks like a screwdriverAnswer: C - The only weakness being that it takes this weapon 20
seconds to warm up, giving a double leg amputee enough time to walk up
to the armored alien kick-box it in the head and take off it's helmet.Q5: The humans have fired a tomahawk missile at your alien ship. What
do you do? A - Try to shoot it down with your own weapons B - Try to maneuver your ship out of the way C - Have your alien ship hop directly into the missileAnswer: C - Oh yes that's right the alien ship is only equipped with
grenades and it can only move in the direction it is facing. Q6: Your building an alien war ship that will be used to take over a
planet. What material do you use to protect the bridge? A - A type of super strong metal B - GlassAnswer: B - Taking over a planet is not so easy when a few sniper rifle
rounds breaches the hull on the bridge and kills the alien commander. If you got 0% then watch the trailer and save yourself from having your
intelligence insulted.If you got above 1% then steal a chicken burrito, become captain of the
navy in a few years and save the planet from an alien invasion by
taking commands from an officer 20 ranks below you.
