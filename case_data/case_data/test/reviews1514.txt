It's different but it does live up to the first chapter

If you happened to like the first chapter, you will also like the
second even though there are a few differences between both movies. First of all, the second chapter kicks off with a more gripping story
line and a few good scares while the first part took its time to
introduce everybody. As the second movie is based on quite the same
characters as the first movie, there is no need to lose precious
screening time and the movie doesn't. This movie's pace is definitely
faster and quite gripping from the beginning to end.The second movie also has a more complex story line. While the first
movie left us with a few unsolved questions and problems, the second
film resolves them all in a quite logical way. In fact, there are
multiple story lines here that are though easy to digest and to follow
and that all lead to a dramatic ending. We see some scenes that happen
in Josh's past, other things that have happened in the first movie or
just after, a couple of scenes playing in "The Further" and finally the
main story line in the now and here. Some scenes show us the past and
present family life of Josh, others focus on the works of the ghost
busters who try to help them. All in all, the story in here is much
more intelligent and profound than in the first film which is something
I didn't expect. The characters are even more attaching than before and
you are really happy to see some of them again. In addition to this,
the few new characters of good or evil character are really great and
welcome additions to the plot. That's why this movie is one of the rare
really convincing sequels as it lives up to the brilliant first movie.The movie has a few really good scares of course but overall the first
movie was a lot creepier and more disturbing. In fact, you happen to
know what is going on if you have seen the first movie and that's why
you aren't that shocked or surprised anymore. This being said, you
absolutely need to have seen the first film if you want to try out this
one because if you don't know the first chapter, you won't fully
understand the second."Insidious - Chapter 2" has a few very memorable scenes and maybe even
more than the first one. My favourites were the dice play that unveiled
the hidden knife, the creepy but not evil mystery man in the first
scene in "The Further" and the scene with Marilyn and her mother. In
some scenes, you can see that the second chapter is not only influenced
by its own first part but also by several genre classics. The mystery
man recalled me David Lynch's "Lost Highway" while other scenes
reminded me of the evil Bob of "Twin Peaks". The ending of the movie
has many moments that made me think of the legendary "The Shining". I
guess these references are more than just good as so is this movie.In the end, you really should watch this horror film of the year in the
movie theatres but I may give you a few advices to end up my review.
Just avoid going to the movies at popular screening times such as
Friday or Saturday night. I have read and also personally experienced a
lot of noisy people who are talking all the time and laughing out loud
just to calm down and try not to show how afraid they really are. Second, you should keep your feet on the ground and not try to eat or
drink too much during the movie. Some scenes suddenly get very scary
and could lead you to throw away your popcorn and pour some coke on
your clothes or those of your neighbour. If your potential girlfriend
isn't all that much into horror movies or a Gothic, please don't take
her out to witness such a movie. Third, you shouldn't drink or eat too much before watching this film.
The movie has a few uglier scenes than the first one even though they
are not disgusting. The thing is that you have a glimpse at a few
disturbing things but your vivid imagination might think further and
that's where this fantastic movie automatically leads you to a few
nastier thoughts. If you have a weak heart, if you are a very nervous
person or if you are pregnant, please avoid this movie for your own
security.Anyone else, please enjoy this atmospheric contemporary horror
masterpiece.
