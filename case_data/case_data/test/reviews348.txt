OMG What a snorefest

Please save your money. If I could, I would have requested my money
back. When the film ended I heard at least 4 couples saying WTF!!!!
Really boring movie. Not even close to any of the classics. I am
reading all of the reviews that are saying a classic, right up there
with close encounter etc.... NOT EVEN CLOSE. All you want to do is
smack Amy Adams in the first 1/3 of the movie. Not a good character for
her to play. Forrest Whittaker has the funniest accent(i think its
Boston) you have ever heard. Totally goofy and giggle out loud funny. I
love SYFY movies, they don't have to be CGI, wham, bam type movies but
this is a total waste, gives you nothing and leave you with nothing.
People will say , "Man this really gets you thinking", yeah it does, I
was thinking where the freaking nearest exist was 1/2way through the
movie. You are constantly waiting for the movie to get moving. NEVER
happens. Slow, grey, and totally un-moving. It tries to play on the
heart strings a bit but fails dismally. I wont reveal the end but 1. If
you go don't blame me 2. Try not to throw your popcorn at the move
screen at the end, believe me you will have most of it left over.If there was zero stars I would have given it. Total waste of time and
money.
