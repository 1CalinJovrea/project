Why

Even my son was asking throughout then entire 1 hour middle portion of
the movie , "why aren't they racing, is he gonna race Jackson storm
...". I just kept saying yeah son eventually. Then it's the female that
ends up racing in the end and my 5 year old son experience his first
episode of disappointment and fraud. How do you explain to a 5 year old
that it's politics and the moral of the story is no longer innocent
heroic comebacks but now it's about equal opportunity and forcing ideas
on young minds. Kids just want to see a good , animated race movie AS
ADVERTISED!!! Instead it's 10 minutes of racing, and an hour and a half
of training and build up that leaves you asking yourself... did this
have to be nearly two hours long?! Garbage
