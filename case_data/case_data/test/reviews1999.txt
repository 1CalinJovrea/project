Best Movie I've seen in along time.

Please, I won't spoil the movie for you but without a bit of background
before the movie, it would not have made sense. So don't listen to
these people who have no sense of what a great movie is. You know how
sometimes a sequel is not as good as the first movie well, this is not
the case with this release.I loved all of this movie. Great action and special effects. I liked
that they kept true to the humor in the movie as well. I laughed and
sat on the edge of my seat at moments as I was mesmerized by how well
they brought the characters to life.On top of this, I also saw it the old fashioned way at the Drive In
sitting up close with the sound at max. I could not have been any
happier with this production.
