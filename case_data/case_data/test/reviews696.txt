Not worth locating a black hole to drop it into.

It was sad to see a film take such a wonderful subject as the life and
ambitions of Mr. Hawkins and attempt,dismally, to create it for nothing
more than a contender in the awards 'game'. This is the kind of tripe
which is accepted all too readily as biopic material and offers little
or nothing of the person or their skills other than to show off as a
proffered mating ritual. Mr. Redmaynes painstaking efforts are the only
reason I gave it any rating at all. With all the facts and wonder we
have have at our disposal about the man, why is it that there is little
or nothing involving his deep, driving demand for 'the answer' and all
that is entailed in his studies. Rather we are given still another
sexist portrayal of two people battling impossible odds to finally give
in to their bases needs, with others. Not only old fare but out of
place and cheapening to the real story line. I could only try to
dissuade others from subjecting themselves to this demeaning film.
