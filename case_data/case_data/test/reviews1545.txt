Lena Dunham and HBO Called...they want their show back

Not only is this a rip-off of the HBO's "Girls," it's not even a good
one...and I'm not that much of a fan of "Girls." In fact, Adam Driver
from "Girls" is also in this movie! But if you like that show, you
might like this (although I didn't). If you despise "Girls," I can
almost guarantee you won't like this movie. Unlikeable, spoiled
characters throughout, with very little plot. Greta Gerwig is a
disaster as Frances, and I think this is probably the last Noah
Baumbach film I will be subjecting myself to. But because it was so
critically revered, I thought I'd give it a shot.The only good thing about this movie is that it inexplicably got
permission to use David Bowie's "Modern Love" and Hot Chocolate's
"Every 1's a Winner" on the soundtrack.
