This is considered a movie? Hardly.

It's Thomas' (Thomas Mann) 18th birthday and his friend Costa (Oliver
Cooper) has plans to throw him the biggest party ever. With his parents
going out of town for their anniversary, Thomas has the house to
himself. Thomas just wants a small get-together or "enough to be cool"
as he puts it. However Costa wants this to be a party everyone
remembers, one that everyone will be talking about long after it's
over, and one that will change the lives of Thomas, Costa, and their
friend JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown) forever. Not to mention the three of
them finally getting laid. Chronicling the entire spectacle with his
camera is a weird kid from school named Dax (Dax Flame). With his
sights set on nothing but a sea of women and the most epic night he and
his friends could possibly ever have, Project X is what Costa labels
this little filming event.A documentary-style party movie isn't exactly something that anyone
should be excited about. A found-footage The Hangover is all this feels
like going into it and Todd Phillips producing doesn't really help
change that opinion. The end result is mostly exactly what trailers let
on with a conclusion that is extremely predictable with few surprises
in between.Stupid high school humor and crude and raunchy jokes are what bridge
the gap between first being introduced the characters and the party
actually happening. Its immaturity practically becomes overbearing as
the comedy will mostly just make people outside the high school
demographic feel older than they really are. The biggest surprise comes
in the form of a drug dealer named T-Rick (Rick Shapiro). This is where
the mascot for the movie comes in and T-Rick's pursuit of retrieving
that mascot is perhaps the only original aspect of the movie. The line
about him being like The Terminator is the funniest line to come out of
Project X. Nick Nervies and Alexis Knapp play Tyler and Everett who are
hired as security for the party. Tyler has this big bouncer like
attitude and is this teeny tiny little kid while Everett takes his job
a little too seriously. These two, T-Rick, along with the quick montage
of Milo the dog being in a bouncy castle and getting into crazy antics
during the party are the closest things to highlights the movie has to
offer.With that said, nearly everything else plays out exactly as you expect
it to. Losers try to throw a party to change their reputation, that
party finally taking place and being even bigger than they imagined,
and eventually said party getting out of control. There are so many
instances in the movie where an entire song will play while we're shown
various shots of this crazy party and Thomas and his friends enjoying
themselves. If anything ever felt like an extended music video before
it was outdone by Project X. There's barely a story here. Filming an
out of control party doesn't make it a movie. Calling it a movie feels
disrespectful to anything that came before it.There is one small shred of depth Project X offers and it lies within
that one party changing everything mindset. It's as if it offers this
sense of accomplishment while doing something nobody thought you were
capable of. Changing your life with the events that transpire in one
night is something that probably seems strangely liberating, but this
could also be viewed as the movie encouraging this type of behavior
which is just as idiotic as the premise of the movie itself.Project X feels like the combination of Superbad and The Hangover shot
in the same style you saw in Chronicle, but doesn't come anywhere close
to being as good or even as decent as any of those movies. Many people
claimed to be surprised by Project X afterwards and that it was more or
better than they thought it would be. The studio rep told me he found
the movie somewhat inspiring. Unfortunately Project X inspired me to do
nothing more than see something that's actually worthwhile.
