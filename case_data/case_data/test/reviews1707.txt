Enormously Funny And Surprisingly Touching

I know most people who love PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen are
furious about this movie even existing, let alone being successful. But
I actually liked it a lot!I know the original classic fairly well (I'm a former high school
English teacher and a current college librarian) and I was astonished
almost from the very beginning at how much of the dialogue comes direct
from Jane Austen's novel. All of the issues that really matter and the
conflicts that draw the reader into the novel are still very much alive
in the movie. It's just that they are juxtaposed against the horror of
the walking dead. I can't say enough about the good looking young (and not so young) cast
members. I was absolutely blown away by how seriously Lily James and
Sam Riley took the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Both
of them are so skilled at projecting courage and integrity combined
with deep feelings and hidden pain. They never seem silly even when
they're doing very silly things, i.e. cutting each others' clothes to
bits in a sword fight. Bella Heathcote and Douglas Booth as Jane
Bennett and Mr. Bingley are almost as good, and I have to say, visually
they are absolutely perfect as the characters from Jane Austen's novel.
And the supporting players are absolutely outstanding! You just cannot
go wrong with Charles Dance as Mr. Bennett. His performance is exactly
what you would hope for in a serious adaptation. Though that's true of
every actor in the cast, really. Lena Headey is an exquisite Lady
Catherine DeBurgh, though her character is ultimately just a little
more sympathetic towards Elizabeth than she is in the novel. Even Jack
Huston, who has been a hero of mine ever since his epic role as
disfigured World War One veteran Richard Harrow in BOARDWALK EMPIRE, is
an effective villain as Mr. Wickham. Best of all is Matt Smith, who
takes the thankless role of the hateful Mr. Collins and turns it into
an irresistible Peter Sellers style comic explosion. He's that good. Let's face it, a Jane Austen zombie movie is not for everyone. But if
you're willing to be open minded and you enjoy great acting, comedy and
romance, this just might be for you. The sword fights are exciting, the
love scenes (including the arguments) are authentically romantic, and
the blood and guts are never really that gross. Oh, and if you do go
and see the movie, make sure to stay through the closing credits,
because the last joke of the film is really the best!
