I Loved This Cute Movie

In a post-apocalyptic United States of America, the survivors live in a
city surrounded by walls that separate them from the living dead. Their
leader Grigio (John Malkovich) sends a group of teenagers, including
his daughter Julie (Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco)
and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton), to the outside to collect food
and supplies for the population. However, they are surprised by a group
of zombies. Among them, R (Nicholas Hoult), who is a young zombie
without recollections but very introspective.R eats Perry's brain and revives his memories and sensations with
Julie, and he falls in love with her. R saves Julie from the other
zombies and hides her in the plane where he lives. Along the days, they
develop a weird relationship and become friends. When a group of
zombies led by R's friend M (Rob Corddry) finds Julie, R protects her.
Soon the zombies including R change their emotions and are capable to
dream. But the fearful Bonies are seeking out Julie and R to eat them."Warm Bodies" is a movie that combines comedy with romance, horror and
action genres. The story is brainless since the very beginning; for
example, a group of teenagers go to a dangerous environment without any
skilled soldier to help them. But the delightful story in worthwhile;
the zombie with existential crisis is adorable; Julie comparing R with
the cover of Lucio Fulci's "Zombie" in Blu-Ray is cult; and in the end
I loved this cute movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Meu Namorado Ã© um Zumbi" ("My Boyfriend is a Zombie")
