Ruined by Ending

I haven't read the book, but in the forums someone said that the
ending, and through it ultimately the meaning, of the book was quite
different. According to that individual the book ends with Quentin
realising that Margo is not the deep and interesting girl that he
created in his own head. I don't know if such an ending would have been better but it at least
would have been more interesting than the bland ending we got. There
would have been some drama with Quentin seeing his illusions smashed.
Instead he just realises she doesn't like him. And then it ends.Margo was my biggest problem of this film. Besides that, the film was
very enjoyable and funny. You really wanted to spend time with Quentin
and his friends because they felt real. Unlike Margo who just felt like
a character from a children's adventure book.Which brings me back to my original point. Margo starts out as the
Manic Pixie Dream Girl. By the end she could have become human. But she
doesn't. So when you compare her to all the other characters in this
film it's like they come from completely different worlds.Paper Towns is, overall, a good film but the ending completely ruins
the entire story and the themes that it was building.
