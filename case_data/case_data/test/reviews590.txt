No wit. No style. No substance.

What an absolutely terrible film. Gone is the style, the wit, the
intelligence of the first film. This is a paint-by-numbers sequel which
missteps at every point. It glories in violence instead of critiquing
it. The characters are boring caricatures of themselves, the supporting
cast are cartoon characters - literally. Kick-Ass had real people in
ridiculous circumstances - this sequel has ridiculous people doing
ridiculous things for no apparent reason. Hit-Girl's story is a weird
tired high school mean girls clich√© which ends with Hit Girl getting
revenge by making them vomit and poo. Huh? I could go on and on, but
this film is just - weird, and a great big disappointment.
