Do not watch

I don't suggest you watch the movie if you are a huge fan of Death
Note, because it will ruin the whole thing. The actors and actresses
were terrible and just everything was a big disappointment. The movie
had almost nothing to do with the anime. If you have never heard of
Death Note before, watch the anime first and if you are curious to
watch the movie, go ahead..But as I said before, you will be
disappointed.
