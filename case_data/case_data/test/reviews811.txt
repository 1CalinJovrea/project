Christmas tale with cursing

And other rude stuff of course. But you can guess that by seeing not
only the rating this has on its sleeve but also by the cast list.
Having said that, this is an adventure 3 friends go on every year on
Christmas. And as everything that has been done too many times, it
wears out (for them that is, maybe for the viewer too?).You have to like the three main actors or at least not hate them, to
kind of enjoy the movie. There is of course at least one love interest
and a lot of side characters (family), not to mention the clear
connection to the Christmas Carol. But this Carol takes you on a
different kind of a trip .. well you get the pun. If you think this is
funny, then you passed the first test of "Should I watch this?". The
rest is up to you and your mood/feelings towards this type of comedy
