Heart breaking and moving true story.

Based on the memoir by Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander 'A Royal Affair'
Â– who is superb) this is one woman's story of her war. We go back to
1914 before that awful war had begun and find a young and feisty woman
(referred to at the time as a 'blue stocking') who has ambitions of
studying at Oxford and is willing to shun the conventions of finding a
husband din order to realise her dream.She has a brother Edward (played touchingly by Taron Egerton) and he
introduces her to his friend Roland. After a shaky start they realise
they share a passion for poetry, the romantic sort and a friendship
blossoms as indeed do their feelings. Then the war comes and everyone's
intended plans for the future are put on hold to do their duty.What follows is truly heartbreaking, I was moved to tears at one point
and that is very rare. The cinematography is superb, the direction
excellent and all of the actors are completely convincing and bring
their respective roles to full realised life. One of the poems starts
with the words 'life and hope and love and you', and that could be a
pretty good description of what this film is about. The whole thing is
just excellent and is a film that I can not only thoroughly recommend
but would urge people to see.
