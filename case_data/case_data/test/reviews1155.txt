You will NEVER look at a grapefruit the same.

Can I just tell you that I laughed out loud at this movie. All four
actresses did such an amazing job, but I will have to say that Tiffany
Haddish had me gasping and laughing my head off (the grapefruit scene
and the zip-line scene)! Now, the swearing was a bit much so I took 2
stars off. Queen Latifah is a favorite and she did not disappoint (hey
Q!). Jada looked amazing and this movie reminded me what a great
actress she really is.
