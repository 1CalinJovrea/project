Good movie, Great theatre experience

Got the chance to see Everest early in IMAX 3D. I'll start off by
saying this, if you get the chance, definitely see this movie in IMAX.
It adds to the experience and you feel like your on the mountain. That
aside, let's dive into one of my most anticipated films of the year.Everest is chalk full of star power. Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Keira
Knightley, Jake Gyllenhaal, the list goes on. Everyone is believable in
this hostile environment, going from optimistic and adventurous to
mortified and forced to fight for their lives. Each character is given
a back story, some more drawn out and centered than others, and you get
attached to most but not all of them. When the emotional blows hit,
they hit hard for some, but not as much for others.The visuals are, as you might have guessed, stunning. The shots they
get of climbers and the way the camera gives you an an idea of how
dangerous this is are breath taking. The cinematography is definitely
award worthy. IMAX only added to it, putting you in this environment
and taking you along for the ride.This film really did it for me because I have always been fascinated by
Everest and the journey it is to make it up to the top and back. If
there is a Netflix documentary about Everest, I've watched it. I even
watched the one about the story told in this movie. What this film does
so well is it immerses you into the environment as well as gives you
characters to care about. It's all tied in well together.At times, the pace is a bit slower than expected and the tones shifts
from serious to light hearted are a bit messy. But that stuff doesn't
bother you in the moment, your just wrapped up in the intensity of the
story.Overall, Everest gave me exactly what I wanted. It was intense,
emotionally powerful, and the visuals were beautiful. It's not
perfectly structured, but it sure is engaging. As someone who has
studied the mountain, this offers a brutal look into how much time and
energy is out into a trip to Everest, and how quickly things can go
wrong. Definitely worth a trip to the theatre.
