If you like good movies, do yourself a favor and watch a different movie

I have never written a review of a movie before I saw Resident Evil:
The Final Chapter. After watching this piece of zombie dung, I jumped
onto IMDb to see who is responsible for this catastrophe of a movie.
First thing I notice is the movie has a 6.3 rating. Really people? 6.3
to me is ABOVE AVERAGE and if you think this movie is a 6.3, you are
either: high, wasted, age 12, or have an IQ of a zombie with brain
damage. This movie is the literal definition of the word, "garbage." I
felt compelled to tell the world how terrible this movie is... and
calling it terrible is actually being lenient.I could pick out a million different things as regards to why this
movie is awful. Stupid plot, terrible acting, all the characters with
zero character. I will spare you your time and talk about two.First: EDITING. I would LOVE to listen in the editing room talk during
the making of this movie. Good lord it would be hilarious. The average
time taken between camera cuts has got to be a movie record. During
several scenes the camera had to have changed 5 times in the span of
like 2 seconds. I felt like I was being interrogated by the CIA
watching this poop. Halfway through the movie I felt like I would spill
any government secrets if I had any just to make it stop. And when
Alice gets to the last room in the hive, the movie finally gives you a
moment of relief for two minutesÂ… but at that point you're already
dead.Second: JUMP SCARES. There is probably an average of 2-3 jump scares
per setting. It gets hilarious as the movie goes on. Every time the
movie gets quiet, get ready to have your ears blown out by the loudest
noises they could legally include in the movie. If I took a shot for
every jump scare in this movie, I'd be dead in 10 minutes.Best part about this movie: it's over and I'm still alive. Enjoy life
kids, you never know when you may stumble upon a movie such as this.
