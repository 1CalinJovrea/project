More than just a movie. It's insightful.

This movie was exactly what it was titled. "what to expect when you're
expecting" really delves into the pregnancy pedantic and shows all the
scares and thrills about being pregnant. Miscarriages, risks in giving
birth, the troubles and scares of adopting, and the unexpected. most of
what could go wrong, did. although I would have liked to see them go
into detail on the miscarriage as it causes the most emotional turmoil
and often leads to depression. it would have been great if they
emphasized on a message instead of a love story.I think Wendy would most likely resemble nearly every women in
pregnancy. That whole illusion of pregnancy glow is all an
exaggeration. Women don't become more beautiful or glamorous when they
get pregnant, the hard reality is women get fat, stretch marks,
cankles, an uncontrollable bladder and the worst morning sickness. I
think that's why they showed her story line the most. but then, why would they add in Sklyer? A perfect pregnant woman that
fits the image of that exact glow? because there are those who do
become more beautiful and glamorous, have the most wonderful time
during pregnancy and the script writers didn't want to leave that out,
because after all it is a show about what to expect when you're
expecting.
