I went in hopeful and left feeling insulted.

"Now You See Me" has a stellar cast, a fun and intriguing premise and
themes (showdown of rival magicians combined with a heist), delightful
smart-assery and cunning tactics -- especially in those scenes
dominated by Jesse Eisenberg or Woody Harrelson. Oh, and it has quite
dazzling action sequences. All the best parts of this film are
well-packaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer.I took someone I loved to "Now You See Me" and expected the payoff of a
perfect night of entertainment.I'm not impossible to please at the movies and I actively wanted this
to be a good time. I went out for entertainment and leisure and in good
company and high spirits, not at all for the purpose of writing a
critical review.What's more, I'm a big fan of all of the raw ingredients in this film.
I enjoy magic and I could watch Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine in
almost anything (now proved.) I fully enjoyed a much better film called
"The Prestige," which might be regarded by some as a predecessor.But what happened here?After several fun scenes and a promising opening sequence that made me
want to care about the characters, I discovered a film in search of a
plot and utterly lacking intellectual integrity and respect for the
audience. The twists and reversals weren't just surprising, they were
completely unbelievable. You didn't see it coming, but not because of
skillful misdirection (the art of magicians, so often implied.) Rather, you didn't see it coming because the explanations were crooked
and cooked up and merely expedient.Especially, by late in the film when they start tracking backward to
earlier events to show you how you were fooled and what was really
going on the whole time -- the explanations presented are less
convincing than simply believing in real magic.!!!Spoler Alert: Stop reading here if you would like to watch this
movie without knowing anything about the late scenes, reveals, and
reversals!!!For example, the "Four Horsemen" stage the death of one of their own by
perfectly orchestrating a high-speed traffic accident on a crowded
bridge. It's imperative that the car he's apparently driving flips and
tumbles several times and ultimately bursts into flames. But it's equally imperative that the pursuing detective can retrieve a
stack of papers from the wrecked car. He *must* be able to retrieve the
papers but not the body, all while getting away with his own life, or
else the plot begins to unravel. The timing is of course worked out impeccably, and it's carried out
with no other fatalities on the bridge. And somehow the magicians have
stuffed a replacement body from the morgue into an identical car just
before turning it into a time-bomb. The audience knows, emotionally, that the Dave Franco character
shouldn't really be dead (as I heard one person exclaim loudly during
the closing sequence when "Jack Wilder" shows up again,) but the way
his death is apparently faked would defy an unlimited budget and dozens
of trained stunt drivers and coordinators -- unless, of course, you
close the bridge to public traffic. Yet it's just one more miracle that
the Horsemen carry out with aplomb, at a frenetic pace and on-the-fly,
with less than half-a-dozen total team members, empowered by an
unlimited budget and a mystery benefactor.All the while, apparently real traffic zooms along with presumably
untrained and unprepared public going about normal business.We are expected to believe that the way Hollywood makes a high-speed
accident occur without killing anybody can be done by a handful of
highly motivated professional stage magicians (read: amateurs to road
stunts) and somehow this can be accomplished without completely
controlled surroundings.This elaborately and improbably faked high-speed death scene is just
one example of the film jumping into an explanation of "how it really
happened" that seems less probable and less believable than *anything*
you could have guessed before being told.And the plot problems go much deeper than buying into death-defying
scenes that require an elimination of anything random in a busy public
space. I couldn't buy the ultimate reveal about the real identity and
motives of the Mark Ruffalo character, either. It seemed incongruous.
It felt like a cheat. The way he is planted in relation to earlier
events seems like an afterthought. And I couldn't buy that underneath his deliberate blundering and
willful ignorance was someone not only much smarter than he appeared,
but someone so capable of perfect planning as to be damned near
omniscient.The total impression is of a promising film idea that fell on its own
very expensive sword. I don't know what happened, but it looks like it
got battered and morphed around and rewritten by multiple teams of
writers. The total feeling is that the story got killed and
Frankensteined back together multiple times. And it looks like the
final edit came after the director and all concerned were out of steam
and over budget. I felt intellectually raped, to put it bluntly. I felt like the
director was content to dazzle us with action and effects and to take
our money while demanding our total credulity on the plot points, using
the angle provided by magic in a rather disingenuous way.This, instead of providing a coherent narrative that would allow an
adult audience to cheerfully maintain a willing suspension of
disbelief. The storyline turns into a madhouse of improbabilities and then
rationalizes its real business like a pathological liar. What a
travesty to the promising themes of magic and old rivalries, treated so
well in other recent films. And what a waste of a beautiful all-star
cast, so entertaining as individuals in the early scenes.
