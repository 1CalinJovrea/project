A good reason on why you should not trust hype.

I'll be the first to say that I hate hype. Hype to me is pointless and
manipulative. The reason I hate is because where anticipation arises
for the film after they see the trailer, they always found it
disappointing once they saw it. This is the reason why I avoid
trailers. Because I want to be open minded about films. Sometimes great
movies can live up to the hype (See Star Wars 7 and Mad Max: Fury
Road). But while people say that the concept is going to be awesome,
I'm more worried about the execution of the final product than the idea
itself. But sometimes when I see the film that people loved, I usually
get baffled by it. Batman vs Superman is one of those films. Trying to explain the plot would be a nightmare, so because I was
uninvested in the film, I'll instead provide a link to the Wikipedia
synopsis (please be warned, there may be spoilers. So, tread lightly): You done? OK. Now to explain my reasons why I hated the film.#1: No character development. Now, you simple-minded morons might be
saying "Who cares about the story and characters? We want to see Batman
and Superman fight!". I'm going to say "I freaking care about story and
characters". If there is no character development, then it's not a good
film. All of the characters in the film are very underdeveloped and
very boring. Why? Because the audience wants to be invested in the film
and if you have lame, underdeveloped characters, it just turns down the
patience meter to 1. This is why I love the films of Frank Darabont,
David Fincher, Jonathan Demme, Sam Mendes, Quentin Tarantino, etc. they
put more effort into the story and characters and make sure the
audience is invested in them. Speaking of story...#2: Its unfocused narrative. OK, is this Batman vs Superman or Justice
League: The Beginning? It only takes about 2 hours to see Batman and
Superman fight. I wouldn't mind that except if the plot was more
focused. There are so many subplots in the film that it becomes hard to
care about this film. First, it's about Batman wanting revenge on
Superman. But then, we get stuff like The Justice League, Wonder Woman,
Martha Kent, Mark Zuckerberg, The Daily Planet, Lois Lane, General
Zod's dead body. There's way too much to focus on. Good movies like
Seven, Philadelphia and Shawshank have only 1 or 2 subplots (and the
characters were more interesting). BvS has enough to fill a miniseries.
Nothing is focused and the main objective (Batman fighting Superman) is
only 15 minutes out of this bloated 151 minute film.#3: It's.....too................sloooooowwwww. I'm serious, this is the
perfect film for anyone who has no patience whatsoever. Long movies can
be good (Saving Private Ryan was 169 minutes and it was great), as long
as everything else is flawless. Would it kill Zack Snyder to cut out 2
subplots, as well as rewrite the scri...Ah, forget it. No-one cares
characters anymore. They only care about making money and pissing off
the audience. I just was bored by this supposed "action" film. Don't
get me wrong, I like action films. The Terminator films were great
(except for 3, Salvation and Genesis, all piles of crap). But Snyder
however succeeds in making an action film that is boring as hell. I was
so bored that I thought about leaving, but I stayed (because I don't
like leaving while the movie is playing). You could sleep through an
hour and you won't miss a thing.Bottom line, I hate this film. I freaking hate this film. Not to sound
hypocritical, but before the film came out, I predicted that exact same
opinion and I was right. This is an example on why hype should never be
trusted. It's a stupid, monotonous, boring, poorly developed, ADD-
ridden, biggest pile of rubbish I have ever seen. Nothing's
interesting. No-one manages to even save this film, not even Ben
Affleck (How could you, Ben? You were in Gone Girl, for Christ's
sake!). I'm surprised on why people love this film solely because of
Batman and Superman duking it out. Well, to that I say, You're
completely wrong. Just because Batman and Superman duke it out, doesn't
mean that it's a great film. We have to know the characters before they
duke it out.Please, avoid this film. Plain and simple.
