Could well be a best for Sandler & Stiller!

I liked the look of the trailer beforehand as I was quite looking
forward to seeing both Adam Sandler & Ben Stiller together and doing a
drama. by the end, i was saying I actually think that could well be
there best involvement in a film to date or close to that anyway. It
was very relatable and showed how easy families get lost along the way,
Life just becomes life and you live it. Dustin Hoffman made me feel
slightly drained at times just from the character he was portraying so
a thumbs up for him too. All in all a great film with a great cast.
