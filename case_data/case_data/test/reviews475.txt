Two Excellent stories in One

This is an extraordinary film that is almost two features in one. My
wife and I (oldsters, but still in glorious married Love) saw it as a
date film and enjoyed it immensely. It is two stories of enduring Love- one in modern day, the other in the
past (1940s to present), which intertwine through the chance meeting of
Ira Levinsen (Alan Alda) who is in a car crash, with Luke and Sophie
who are on a first date. Their subsequent friendship changes all their
lives. Sophie saves a box of love letters from the crash, the reading
aloud of which provide the narrative (a common Nicholas Sparks theme)
for interweaving the two very different worlds together. The acting was superb, Scott's portrayal of Luke was spot on for rodeo
cowboys - a stoic bunch. Britt Robertson's charming young "Sophie" was
sweet, but tough. Alan Alda was priceless, as usual, but the two who
really stand out are; Oona Chaplin as young Ruth Levinsen, and Jack
Huston as young Ira. The period is amazingly presented and their acting
just makes it sumptuous. Two complaints that some reviewers find wrong with these types of film
are - not enough realism (read overt sex and Violence) and happy
endings. This movie is guilty of both. We left the Theater feeling
emotionally spent and happy. As Christian Slater said in Bed of Roses:
" There's no such thing as too much perfection"
