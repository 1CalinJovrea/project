What happened to the movies? What happened to Hollywood? They used to
be professionals. They used to be able to take the skimpiest of plots
and flesh 'em out at minimum into a watchable film that had some kind
of point. This thing, however, looked like it was drafted on a cocktail
napkin on Tuesday night at the pizza parlor and then assigned to a
series of crew members picked at random from the back of a cereal box. The acting does not 'save' the movie, it shows it for what it really
is. Confused, dreary, maudlin and by the time it resorts to the
precocious little girl to stall for time, ya know you're looking at a
real stinker. I was waiting for ol' Shep the family dog to make an
appearance and eat up another ten minutes. Guess ol' Shep had some
pride though, he didn't show up. Cash the checks, keep your name in front of the audience and the people
who call the shots in Hollywood. Is the last movie you made any good?
No? Well, cash the check and move on to the next project. Who will know
the difference? Cash the check and run. As for us, the paying members of the industry, the ones who get up, go
out on a rainy night to see a movie and expect to be presented with a
coherent storyline, competent acting, good production values and .. the
bottom line.. for our good money.. ENTERTAINMENTÂ… we'll keep the money
next time. Maybe one of the checks will bounce and somebody will wake
up.
