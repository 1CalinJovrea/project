Why so many negative reviews?

My daughter has been a huge ANNIE fan ever since she was 4 and I took
her to see a local theater production. We've watched several versions
of the movie (1982 awesome, the 1995 "A Royal Adventure" not so
awesome) and this 2014 version is definitely a modern adaptation of the
story. My daughter is now 9 and she can relate to the modern changes
(social media, hip versions of the classic Annie songs) so she truly
enjoyed the movie. After reading so many negative reviews I was not
sure I would enjoy it but I LOVED it. Don't go to this movie expecting
a replica of the 1982 movie. This is completely different but still
very entertaining.
