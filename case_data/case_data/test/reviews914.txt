The Past In The Future.

To begin, Looper is a sci-fi film set in the future, dealing with the
implications of time-travel, although it is very much a film about the
past. The film is all about the past, how it affects the present and
the future and how it drives people with the majority of the film
building characters and establishing plot.Anyone looking for an action film will be sorely disappointed because
this is first and foremost a writer's film, focusing on plot, character
and dialogue. As mentioned above, the brunt of the film falls on
development, more so than action set-pieces and CGI. The portions of
the city and the near future Johnson has created, whilst some may see
as unoriginal, I see as tributary. A lawless country split socially in
half, poverty on one side, excess on the other, the world Johnson has
manufactured carries an air similar to that of Alfonso Cuaron's
Children of Men, a comparably important sci-fi film in the struggle to
build the credibility of the genre in the realm of modern cinema.Not only is the film intelligent, it also acts as a courier for
Johnson, a director of hit (Brick) and miss (The Brothers Bloom) repute
following his sophomore outing. If you support intelligent science fiction in the intellectual vein of
Inception and Primer, Looper is a film sitting firmly in the middle of
the two. Break the box office with this film and bring intelligence
back to film-making.
