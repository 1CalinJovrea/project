This is NOT the worst movie of all time.

Some people are saying that this is the wort movie of all time. It is
not. It is merely a really bad movie with no redeeming qualities, and
it insults your intelligence.And, most of the YouTube videos made slamming it are 100s of times
funnier than this movie.Seriously, the movie is just not funny. In fact Batman and Robin
(George Clooney and whoever played Robin) had more humor in it than
this movie does, and that movie was worse than this one--that is how
not funny this movie is. Save your money. Read a cereal box. It will cost less and be funnier.
