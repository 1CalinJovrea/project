Pony Power!

Cartoons have drastically changed over the years, and in many cases not
for the better. However, amidst this new wave of modern art stand a few
series that have soared in popularity enough to acquire mass marketing.
One of these "treasures" is My Little Pony, a collection of toys that
have kept their hooves into the pulse of relevance and captured the
hearts of many ages. This weekend, the series proved popular enough to
warrant a movie, in hopes of keeping the magic strong. Robbie K here,
accompanied with my friends, with another review, hoping to help guide
your viewing pleasures. Let's go!LIKES:Cute: It's a movie about talking ponies, of course it is going to be
cute. This film capitalizes on the big sparkling eyes, high pitched
voices, and snappy one-liners that are all the rage in kid's animation.
But amidst these ear-splitting tactics, the theme of friendship may
also warm your heart and make you say Awwwwwww, much like many of the
young viewers did today. Side note, the cute also coincides with a
family friendly theme as well, so one doesn't have to worry about
mature surprises. Pony Adventure: When TV shows are given a block buster movie, one fears
that it may deviate far from the show, unless you're a kid in which
case you don't care. Good news, this movie feels like an extended My
Little Pony episode, filled with all the adventure like elements that
have made the show fun. The simplistic goals, the musical numbers, the
feel-good atmosphere, and the grandiose villain whose bark is worse
than its bite. It's all packed in the 1.5 hours and amplified with an
atmosphere that feels like a kid's version of lord of the rings. All
this positivity will certainly bring you into the kid mindset and add a
little more joy to your experience, or annoy you depending on your
tolerance to this series. The Animation: One thing I love about Hollywood budgets is the ability
to capitalize on technology. My Little Pony took the technology and ran
with it, crafting an incredible display of cartoon animation to keep me
hooked into the movie. The movements of the heroes are fluid, the
flying in particular impressive to watch as it added excitement to the
mix. The attention to detail to accurately capture lip movements is
also impressive, as it adds that anthropomorphic touch they were going
for. Outside of movements though, this film is a colorful display,
brimming with various hues and shades that brings out the unique
character design even more. DISLIKES:Annoying at times: If you aren't younger than 8, or a die-hard fan of
the series, you will most likely get a little annoyed at times. The
movie goes a little overboard with its gimmicks, primarily with Pinkie
Pie's overzealous energy, that hits that tolerance wall and shatters
it. These elements are to be expected, but when you combine it with
younger audience member's inability to remain quiet it pushes those
buttons even faster. Shallow Elements: I didn't expect much character development as this
was done in the show. However, the elements you are going to base the
story on, I expect there to be more commitment to this. My Little Pony
the movie was able to execute a few characters quite well including
Tempest and her little crony alongside Princess Twilight. The other
characters thoughwell they dropped the ball on their development
pretty hard. Many of the new additions to the universe come in with a
flashy opening, often in the form of an inspiring song that holds
promise for a colorful character. But then that flash fades and the
characters are hastily tossed to the background until the end. The
multiple incidents of glazing over the characters didn't impress me,
and proves again that too many characters in a movie, do not make
quality films. Not Theatrical Special: Despite the shortcomings of the characters, the
story team managed to craft a salvageable story. Unfortunately, it
didn't' feel theater worthy to me. Sure, the animation and voice acting
were incredible and worthy of the bigger budget. Then the predictable
plot hit me and I realized this story didn't stand out enough to be
considered unique. In addition, the movie seemed geared towards the
music instead of the other crucial elements, which only further made me
feel this wasn't the theater worthy masterpiece they wanted. Such a
shame given the groundwork already laid by the shows team. The VERDICT:My Little Pony the Movie should have been, My Little Pony the Extended
5 part special. It is a cute, fun, well-animated adventure perfect for
the younger audience members, but outside of that there isn't much.
While it does capture the feeling of the series, there wasn't enough in
this movie to warrant a theater viewing. Die-hard fans won't mind much
of my dislikes, but for the general audience your money is better spent
on a more balanced movie that won't make you pull your hair out or try
to take a nap. My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0
