Only one way to describe this: Must see!

Mud is one of those movies that come along once in a while and make you
appreciate the art of storytelling, the performances based on simple
but very human characters and the skill of a good writer/director.The IMDb full storyline is good but just baiting really. So, in
addition to it I'll add the following: A friendship ensues from the
encounter and even a bond between Ellis and Mud develops for they are
both romantics, at least Mud so conveys to his young friend. We meet
Tom Blankenship, father figure to Mud, played superbly by Sam Shepard,
as well as Juniper, the supposedly love of Mud's life. To be honest
this is the first performance I truly enjoyed from Reese Witherspoon
who plays Juniper; I'll consider watching her again if she has serious
dark roles.Mud is a wanted man but not such a bad guy. Those who are after him,
including the law are not likable one bit; Joe Don Baker who plays
King, father of the one Mud killed, delivers a terrific performance.
Add the performances of Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson as the parents,
in impending divorce mode, of Ellis as well as Michael Shannon as the
uncle and father figure to Jacob Lofland's character and you have
yourself a really great cast.The two main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Tye Sheridan are so
believable, it's uncanny. Young Tye Sheridan has a great future ahead
of him and McConaughey should make his usual detractors quiet for a bit
with this terrific role, if his performance in Paperboy did not already
do the job.It comes as no surprise to me that critics raved about this movie; had
they not, their credibility would suffer, and better theirs than mine.
Unless you are the type of movie-goer who snaps up only the commercial
productions, you ought to like this movie and I wholeheartedly
recommend it.
