A highly enjoyable ride that unfortunately got rolled over by the Critics.

After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's
most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something
entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was
their disappointment. People need to be aware that this movie is an ADVENTURE/ROMANCE and a
bit SCI-FI. NOT A SCI-FI 2001:SPACE ODYSSEY KIND OF MOVIE.I will start giving my own honest review of this movie. First of all,
The acting in this movie is phenomenal, of course when you get 2 great
actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence you know it would work in
any kind of role, and it's true, the chemistry between both of them
just works flawlessly and it's very gorgeous as they're both very
handsome and it's just nice to see them on screen.Then comes the VISUALS, which i consider to be this year's best ( Along
with Dr.Strange ), The best way to watch this movie is at a theater
with a huge screen and definitely better to catch the 3D version. I
really don't know where to start with the visuals because the whole
movie is just beautifully shot and the CINEMATOGRAPHY of this film is
perfectly done, probably each scene in this movie is Iconic. The Plot wasn't as good as the other factors but still it managed to
keep the pacing of the movie going and I was definitely not bored, even
though the ending wasn't spectacular but again this isn't Christopher
Nolan's Interstellar, this is just a movie about 2 lovers surviving on
a spaceship alone.The best way to describe this film is to say that it's Titanic all over
again but in space and it's beautifully shot, emotional, and overall an
exciting experience.It's really sad that people misunderstood the point of this film and
were going for a complex space/time plot instead of a simple
good-looking love story, but I know that moviegoers will definitely
like this film. Give it a try and if not for the story then just for
Wonderful scenes and for the link between the 2 main charactersConclusion: Great, Simple, Gorgeous and Highly Entertaining are the
four things you'll be saying after watching this movie.
