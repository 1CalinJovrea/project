Unfortunately not a good movie

Plot is boring and repetitive but the worst part is the way main
character plays her role, she might be the weakest chain of this movie.
Also, it is pretty unbelievable that all Romanians speak fluent
English...(no ofence here, this just makes this movie strange to
watch). If you seen more than 5 possession horrors you can skip this
one, there's nothing new.
