Really really bad

One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to
advertise such a disgusting movie. I consider myself fairly
sophisticated, however this is not entertainment .This is not a sign of
being in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting.
This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and I
use the term loosely is worse than porn ,as it advertises itself as a
main stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. This
is the worst I've seen, because former sex torture movies, remained
with the horror genre ,where they belonged. Disgusted is how I felt
about this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it.
