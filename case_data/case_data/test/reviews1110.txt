Big Stars, Black (plot) Holes, a White House

First off, let me say that the movie is a high production Hollywood
film meaning the guns look real, there is ample budget for Apache
helicopters and realistic sets, professionally choreographed fight
scenes, and the requisite amount of explosions and CGI effects.However, looking at this film in terms of realistic plot and character
development, it lacks quite a bit. Without giving anything away, if you
saw the trailer, this shouldn't be a spoiler, we're expected to believe
an outrageous number of defensive failures on the part of several
security organizations -- enough to bring on a not-so-clever or
intriguing attack on the White House. Let's just go with that for a
moment, using our advanced sense of Hollywood suspended disbelief
syndrome and hope that, although the plot is implausible, at least the
characters make it real.Morgan Freeman gives one of his most cardboard, stale acting
appearances ever. The stereotypical military head says to blow things
up, the more reticent advisers say to act cautiously, the President
decries the inhumanity of killing staff members while the body count
from the aforementioned guns and ammo displays and explosions count
easily into the many dozens (hundreds likely, difficult to count). Our
one last hope is Gerard Butler. I must say I like him as an action
hero, and he played his role well here. But he was vaguely a man of
action at the beginning of the movie, albeit at a desk for a few brief
moments about 10 minutes in to 14 minutes into the movie, and he was a
more defined man of action by the end of the movie -- don't look for
any more character development from any character in the movie at any
time. That was it; no development whatsoever. It's like asking for
architectural and civil planning lessons from the suburbs of Detroit.
The phrase "devoid of" comes to mind.Watch this only if you want some mindless action without having to
think at all. And once again you can wave a patriotic American flag at
the end and put another point forward for American exceptionalism.
