Excellent film, befuddling to your average Transformers fan

I'm only really writing this because of the astounding amount of
negative reviews here. And they are all really encompassed by a thing
said by the guy who has the highest rated review.***SPOILERS***"Nothing comes at night. If you read the positive reviews for this
movie they like to pretend you should imagine what would come at night.
I did not pay $13 a ticket to imagine anything." Props to this guy for managing to so succinctly sum up everything that
is wrong about the big movie business brainwashing people enough that
they can't be bothered to imagine anything, enough that they need
everything to be served up on a platter and it preferably being baby
food and it preferably being McDonalds baby food. This film performs quite the amazing job of tightly illustrating the
corruption of one's humanity in a film. Not only that, but said
corruption happening inside a family dynamic.The mysteriousness and lack of clarification of the film serves as the
fundament for building an allegory. This is not a film about an
apocalypse per se, you don't get any nitty gritty details about what
the virus is, where it comes from, how many it has killed, what the
news had to say about it. This is a film about a family having to
withstand a powerful destructive force coming from the outside, and how
they are trying to protect themselves from it. This is the reason why
everything is left vague, for the purpose of generalization, for the
purpose of allegory, for the purpose of allowing the spectator to fill
in the details themselves with their experiences. The vagueness allows
for a much larger array of empathy. Should the film fall short in terms
of execution, then it would indeed fall flat, and the allegory would
dissipate. This film, however, is very carefully calibrated, and it is
the audience that disappoints, not the movie. It disappoints through
unwillingness to process information and sensations by themselves, but
rather being locked into a mode in which they just expect everything to
always be explained to them so as they can be entertained and not use
their brains. The film begins with the execution of the sick grandpa. The following
discussion is about how the 17 year old son should not have to be
exposed to such atrocities. The very first issue in the film is about
protecting the son. However in the night, the son keeps having the
worst nightmares, mostly about corruption in one form or another, about
getting diseased. His first nightmare begins from a painting of
Breugel's, then in another scene we see another painting of Breugel's,
Hunters in the Snow, a painting with a rich history in cinema.
Tarkovsky used it in Solaris as the peak of the sensation of humanity
desired by the astronaut's clone-wife. Lars von Trier burned it in
Melancholia as the humanity in that film was being consumed by disease
as well. The director here uses it knowingly, no doubt, to reinforce
the question of one's humanity. The disease in the film is irrelevant. The disease can be whatever you
want it to be, it's Trump. If you wanna know what comes at night, the
IT, well it's Trump, OK? It's the corrosion and corruption of today's
world in regards to our humanity. The family dynamic is organized in
such a way that what is of utmost importance is to protect the son from
the disease. From the Trump disease. From the terribleness-that-
is-in-this-world disease. The vagueness of it all was not satisfactory
for me either for the majority of the film. When it really clicked,
however, was right at the very end, as the first time that the son
shows that he has the disease is right after his father shoots the
child and the mother. Then he gets a nosebleed. Then he is infected.
This film is quite spectacular for having illustrated this paradox of
organizing your life around protecting your son, only to have that very
organizing be the thing that ultimately corrupts your son. It is a highly potent tragic allegory. One that requires a minimum
amount of thought and effort to feel. Something that is far too
excessive to ask of an audience nowadays apparently. The film offers no
solutions, it just offers the proposal of contemplating this paradox,
one that I am sure most of us are engaged in, in one form or another in
our lives as well. This is why this film is so potent, because if only
you would think for a moment you would realize that this paradox of
protection is universal, and it doesn't need an apocalypse to occur. It
just needs one to be such virtuously illustrated.
