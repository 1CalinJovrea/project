I want to like it more than I did

Seven Psychopaths is a black comedy, and comedy is highly subjective
with black comedy even more so. I was loving this movie as a throwback
to the violent yet humorous crime thrillers of the 1990s, most of which
were written or directly inspired by Tarantino.Seven Psychopaths plays out like a true homage to those classic
Tarantino style flicks with witty dialogue, quick and sudden acts of
violence, and colorful characters you just can't help but like despite
their severe problems. Sam Rockwell is fabulous, Colin Farrell nails
it, and both Woody Harrelson and Christopher Walken are at the top of
their game and combined with a strong first act the movie takes off
from start like a rocket. About halfway through the film, just as everything seems like it's
coming together, the true nature of the script reveals itself and in my
opinion falls apart. What was a fantastic recreation of a classic genre
turned into a parody of the genre, and as the movie progressed it
became increasingly self aware until it was a parody of itself. The
plot and characters became increasingly ridiculous and over the top,
but since the movie is now a comedy you're supposed to be OK with that.
I wasn't, but I wanted to be; I just wasn't feeling the shift in
direction.There aren't seven psychopaths whose stories intertwine to serve a
greater narrative, there are actually only six, with one being a dream
(and boring), the other a marginal character who I would have liked to
have seen more of, and yet another only seen briefly. It's really a
story about 3 psychopaths, and the Colin Farrell screenwriter character
becomes the focus, but he got duller the more I got to know him. Once
the movie slipped into self parody territory, where the characters
joked about genre clichés such as final shoot outs, graphic violence,
and how women are depicted yet did all these things anyway I found
myself bored. I was disappointed for a similar reason I was
disappointed with Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation, where the script was
clearly self aware of filmmaking clichés, so it joked about them only
to end up doing them anyway. I would have preferred Seven Psychopaths
been more sincere to the genre and actually tried to do something
different, or didn't and just further developed its plot and characters
while providing the laughs through witty dialogue and clever staged
violence. I laugh much more watching True Romance and Pulp Fiction.
Perhaps the best joke towards the end of this film was that reading
Noam Chomsky would provide for intelligent conversation.My mixed feelings on this movie remind me of No Country for Old Men,
where I was absolutely glued to the screen for the first half, but
completely turned off by the second half where it became a completely
different movie. I understand that Seven Psychopaths, Adaptation, and
No Country for Old Men are all critical darlings, and I do recommend
you check out this film for what it is, but I'm writing this review for
those who are of like mind - you're not alone.
