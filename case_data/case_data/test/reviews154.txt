Okay, let's begin with the premise of the story. It does not have one
and quite honestly, i am surprised an actress would allow herself to be
humiliated like this in the name of acting. As a previous actor, this
is one of the reasons I got out of the industry is the fact that these
type of films would not be considered over the top but the industry
will censor some crude language???Anyway, back to the porno, er I mean film. If Lars Van Trier wanted to
do a porno he should have done one because in my opinion that's what
this was but sans the titillation. I really do not understand the point
behind the film and the actors all seemed to be in some hazy-type
state. I did not even get through the movie because I was really only
interested to see what all the hype was about. so i cannot elaborate
completely on the premise but from what i saw i passed over most of it
and was thoroughly not impressed. In my opinion, i would urge anyone
who wants to see a film to stay completely away from this. Good luck on
your next project Mr. Van Trier....
