Terrible

This was absolutely atrocious. I really liked the first one so I went
to see this as soon as possible hoping for more but it seems like they
doubled down on all the things people hated about the first movie. The
magic tricks were much more CG heavy, the story-line was absurd and
confusing, and worst of all the tone of the film was completely
different. I love Lizzy Caplan but everything about her in this movie I
hated. Everything about her character enforced the idea that we were no
longer in a realistic movie and everything became slapstick and silly.
The first movie had a "real world" feel. As soon as Woody Harrelson's
'Brother' appeared I pretty much checked out. I cant overstate how much
I hated this.
