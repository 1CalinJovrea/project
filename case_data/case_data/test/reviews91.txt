Why all the bad reviews? Just sit back and enjoy this action/comedy!

I read some reviews that trashed this movie and I'm wondering if these
are the same people that thought that Birdman (worst movie ever) was
the best a couple of years ago. OK...I get it and I understand why
people are hating on this movie. The movie is violent, predictable and
has a script that is full of foul mouth language. But the beauty of the
movie experience is that when you walk into a theater, turn off your
brain and enjoy this movie for what it is. I laughed out loud and
enjoyed this from beginning to end. Yes it is full of unrealistic
stunts, bullet dodging and perfect aim by the "good guys" but that is
what makes it enjoyable. Of course it is it is full of "F" words but
that is what makes this movie fun. Samuel L, Ryan Reynolds and Selma Hayek (who played a surprising role)
are fun to watch. Trust me don't go in thinking that this is some type
of Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan spin off because it's not. Just sit back
and watch it with the intent on being entertained by this funny
action/comedy. There are some references to some old movies so you have
to be keen and recognize them.
