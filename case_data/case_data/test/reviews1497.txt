Nothing special

There seems to be a consistent trend in the movies based on Nicholas
Sparks' romance novels. They all contain sappy clich√©s and a lack of
substance. There are two main elements that are repetitive in these
novels: the relationship between two soul mates and the sickness/death
of a loved one. From what I've heard, the books are exceptional,
however, the movies always fall short.Logan (Zac Efron) is a marine who serves three tours in Iraq. During
the war, he happens to find a photograph of a beautiful girl and "keep
safe" is written on the back. Directly after he picks it up, there is
an explosion right where he had been standing before he found the
picture. Logan asks around, desperately trying to find whose picture it
is, but nobody claims it.Now that he has the picture in his possession, he is invincible and his
luck in the treacherous circumstances of war is incredible. After
surviving his three tours, Logan is determined to find the girl in the
picture to personally thank her for the good luck she brought him. He
recognizes a tower in the picture and walks with his German shepherd,
Zeus, from Colorado all the way to Louisiana.Of course, Logan and the woman, Beth (Taylor Schilling), fall deeply in
love, but struggle through the conflicts that arise. Sadly, most of
this movie is revealed in the trailer, which seems to happen quite
often these days.Zac Efron does a decent job playing the character of Logan, however, he
just can't pull off the tough-guy look that is essential in this film.
He will always be remembered as Troy Bolton from "High School Musical".
In any case, this is a tear-jerking, cheesy movie that most teenage
girls would enjoy. It's not terrible, yet nothing special. I give "The
Lucky One" a 6 out of 10.
