Good Portrayal of Real Life Heroes based on a True Story

"Only the Brave" conveys the true story of the heroic firefighters from
Arizona, known as the Granite Mountain Hotshots. This movie is
definitely relevant and timely, considering the recent disastrous fires
in California. I know that there have been other movies based on
firefighting stories, but none of them have tackled the issue of
fighting and controlling a wildfire in the countryside. "Only the
Brave" does that, which makes it so special and outstanding.Josh Brolin plays the role of the team leader of this brave group of
firefighters. Mr Brolin has definitely given one of the finest, and
perhaps one of the best performances of his career in this movie. Apart
from him, there is the legendary Jeff Bridges ("The Dude") to add to
the star value of this flick. The rest of the star-cast have also given
commendable performances.The director, Mr Kosinski , has done an excellent job to depict this
true story of firefighters on screen. He has delved quite deeply into
the mechanics of firefighting, and viewers will definitely appreciate
and give more respect to firefighters after watching this movie. I
would love to become a story-screenplay writer for movies because
intriguing stories keep developing in my mind all the time. Employers
