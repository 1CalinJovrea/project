Men in a hole

In Escape Plan, Stallone plays Breslin, a former Prosecutor turned
Security consultant who breaks out of prisons to test their flaws.Breslin is offered by the CIA a chance to test out a maximum security
prison run by a shadow private undercover organisation that imprisons
high level terrorist types. Before you can say 'set-up' Breslin agrees
for double his usual fee.The rest of the film is essentially a bottle type of drama as its
contained within the Hi Tech interior prison environment that keeps the
budget down. Breslin finds out that he might be on his own in this
prison with no chance of escape or being rescued. He might have been
double crossed by his business partner (rather foreseeable) and to make
things worse, Arnie is one of the inmates and is trying too hard to be
his friend.Jim Caviezel who previously has come across as a rather bland leading
man, camps it up as Hobbes, the sadistic prison warden who does not
care whether Breslin is innocent. Which begs the question as to how
many other inmates might be there for obscure reasons in this private
consortium prison for the disappeared.Sam Neill appears as a conflicted doctor who is there to provide
minimal medical attention to the prisoners.Fair play to Arnie and Sly for not going for a shoot em up, although
that was done in Expendables 2. It is more thoughtful although you get
some gun toting action at the end.I would be the first to admit I did not understand what Arnie was doing
in this type of prison although I sort of guessed his true identity.
You can imagine there would be Islamic terrorists housed in this
Hi-tech prison, but then you also get white supremacists type, cartel
gangsters and others who should be in a maximum security prison not
housed in a prison for people who could no longer be sent to Guantanamo
Bay.We have Farhan Tahir playing a Muslim who helps Arnie and Sly but is he
a terrorist or a cartel guy? If he is a cartel guy, he should not be in
this prison, something the film never grapples with even though Tahir
is the third hero of the film.Sly and Arnie act their parts well, although there is still too much
mumbling.Plot holes a plenty as no one inside the prison discovers that although
they might be located deep down, they are actually in a ship and no
amount of stabilizers can protect you from heavy seas or even the
humming of the engines in such a big cargo ship. Surely such as a ship
would have to dock for supplies for the prisoners and staff, change of
crew and prison guards.Its fun, maybe too long and has confusing plot elements.
