Why are the critics so unfairly harsh?

This is, by far, the best video game adaptation I have ever seen. I do
not understand why the critics have been putting down this movie with
such violence... Is it because they want to make the filmmakers pay for
the fact that they chose high-caliber talent instead of goofy actors
and an 'obvious' choice of director? Is it because the producers
decided to go with a indie film director whose vision they believed in?
I think the music is amazing (bravo to Justin Kurzel's brother) and the
visuals are extraordinary. All the actors did a fantastic job in this
movie. This is unlike any video game movie I have ever seen, and will
go down in my book as the best adaptation out there today.
