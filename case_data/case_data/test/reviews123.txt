'Hotel Transylvania 2' is hilarious

Wildly funny, bursting with energy and capped off with a sweet touch of
family love 'Hotel Transylvania 2' brings it home for the audience
young and old.Poor Dracula Adam Sandler  voice is very concerned that his grandson
Dennis Asher Blinkoff voice isn't showing any signs of becoming a
vampire. His concern deepens when he also sees the possibility that his
most beloved daughter Mavis Selena Gomez  voice may leave Hotel
Transylvania and move into the world of humans. So Dracula puts
Jonathon through a monster boot camp when his daughter and son in law
take a trip to the human world to visit the human in laws.The entire experience turns into a giant explosive and hilarious event
of one cataclysmic disaster after another. Capping it all off is the
appearance of great granddad and devoted human hater Vlad Mel Brooks 
voice. But in the end Dennis finally shows signs that he is indeed half
human and half vampire and there is a very happy birthday celebration
that brings humans and monsters together at the Hotel Transylvania.This is a fun movie designed mainly for children but when I watched it
I and other adults added significantly to the steady stream of solid
laughter. Kudos to Sony Pictures Animation for giving us this somewhat
silly but totally enjoyable fantasy film right when our real world
seems to be utterly overwhelmed in events and circumstance far more
scary that any that might flow form the Hotel Transylvania. Yes, it is
a great escape and very much enjoyed. Odds are it won't win an Oscar,
but take your kids to see Hotel Transylvania 2 and it will win their
hearts and yours as well.
