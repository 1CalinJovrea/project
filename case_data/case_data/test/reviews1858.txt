See this movie!

Who would have thought that one of the most imaginative films of the
last five years would be a film targeted at children? Tomorrowland was
a pleasant surprise. There were a ton of really amazing scenes and a
grand sense of scale. The cast is magnificent. George Clooney is great
as always. However, it must be mentioned that Raffey Cassidy almost
steals the show. She is definitely one to watch and as long as she
avoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a
very bright future in the acting business.The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding
preachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus
plenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations
of future aesthetic in the same film.In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it
drags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film.
Editing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between
actors to thread things together neatly. As usual, Disney's shot
choices are very good (very textbook actually) and the score suits the
film nicely.Be sure to treat the kid(s) in your life (your children, nieces,
nephews) and or course, yourself to this movie. It's one of the few
modern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages.
Plus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant
architecture.
