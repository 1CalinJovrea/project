Had many good qualities, didn't meet its potential.

I watched this movie because the premise reminded me of a British film
I'd seen, "Fish Tank". Maybe it was because of that high benchmark that
I was thoroughly disappointed with "Diary of a Teenage Girl".I am not the main demographic for this film, but that in no way should
be used to excuse the faults it has. Despite the film being intended
for teenage girls, its themes are universal. Themes like insecurity of
identity, longing for love, and the confusing loneliness of adolescence
are feelings known by nearly everyone. The issue this film has,
thematically, is how it portrays its themes. Too often our protagonist,
Minnie, would simply talk to her diary (a surrogate for the audience)
about how she felt without any visual representation to convey those
feelings.For the most part the acting was stellar. Performances by Bel Powely
and especially Alexander Skargard were particularly great. Kristen
Wiig's performance was a little on the weak side, but due to her
characters lack of contribution to the plot, it's excusable. The
costume and set design were nothing special, they realistically
portrayed the 70's which is all they really needed to do.The cinematography was hit and miss. There certainly were some very
pretty shots within the film. The two main problems with the
cinematography were a lack of shot variation and how it was used to
tell the story. Just about the entirety of the film was shot in either
close up or a medium shot. The majority of the film was Minnie's face
as she looked at something, and every now and then there would be a
shot of what she was looking at. There was no notable camera movement
and rarely were there more than 2 characters in a frame, neither of
those things are necessarily bad but when it's all the film does for
nearly 2 hours it gets stale fast. The visual metaphors were lacking in
this film. As said before, Minnie would simply talk the themes at the
audience directly rather than the film showing them through visual
motifs. The only scenes with visual motifs present were those where she
lays in the bath or looks at herself in the mirror and ponders her
loneliness. But even those scenes feature her voice-over narration
explaining her emotions rather than allowing the audience to decipher
them alone.The editing was slightly above average. The pacing was pretty good,
although some scenes were cut short and then later referred to as being
relevant when they didn't feel so. The sex scenes were kept at an
appropriate length. Often films with prevalent sexual themes will shoot
and edit sex scenes in a drawn out manner for the sake of shock value.
This was not the case in "Diary of a Teenage Girl". Other good uses of
editing were a few examples of cutting to sound to start a scene. Aside
from that the editing was pretty standard.The sound was not great. The music choice didn't work for this film,
most of the songs sounded like typical indie/folk rock songs made from
the last decade. The soundtrack didn't need to be "Dazed and Confused"
but for a film set in the 70's, it would do it some justice to have at
least one recognizable 70's song.Much like the cinematography, the script was very hit and miss. The
characters were all written to have the maturity of a teenager, even
the PhD step-dad character. This was either done as a commentary on
parenting in that generation, or as a way of showing how Minnie sees
her world; as inhabited by those with a maturity level akin to her own.
None of the characters, not even Minnie, were very likable although
that was probably done intentionally. One fault the script had was the
lack of development Minnie goes through. Towards the very end she does
grow a little, but for the vast majority of the film the only changes
to her character are external. Meaning things like how much drugs she's
taking or how much sex she's having change, but internally she stays
the same. It's only at the very end that her general attitude and her
attitude towards Monroe change. There was no dialogue that stood out as
especially clever but there was also no dialogue that was especially
stupid. This film had its fair share of good bits but it failed to use them to
tell a great story. With its plot dealing with such engaging subject
matter, this film really fell short of its potential.It was mediocre, maybe slightly below average. If you tend to like
films like this, you'll probably get a decent amount of enjoyment out
of it. Unfortunately, I did not. I'm rating this film as a weak 6/10,
it might change to a 5/10 in the future.
