Slight and predictable, but just amiable enough to work.

Romance novelist Cecilia Ahern made a bit of a splash in chick-lit
circles when her second novel, Where Rainbows End, was published in
2004. It was a tale of two people who were clearly perfect for each
other but could never seem to find their way towards being in love,
told in the form of e-mails, text messages and letters. The story
itself was predictable, but the format was reasonably hip and
refreshing at the time. Ten years later, the book has been turned into
a slight but amiable romantic comedy for the silver screen. The film
isn't particularly hip or refreshing, but boasts just enough charm and
emotion to entertain - even if it isn't a film that will stay with you
for long afterwards.Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) has been best friends with Alex Stewart (Sam
Claflin) since they were kids. They've always meant the world to each
other, but have never become more than friends. At their high-school
prom, they ask other people to the dance. Alex moves to Boston to begin
his studies in medicine, and Rosie must stay behind due to an
unexpected pregnancy. Over the next several years, she raises a child
on her own, and he gets married. Through all of life's changes and
upheavals, they still pop up on each other's radar, connected via
e-mails, text messages and a bond that one suspects can never really be
broken.That's pretty much it, really - the outcome of the film is never in
doubt, however long it might take to get there. Indeed, one problem
with Love, Rosie is that it does take a relatively long time to get to
the point, even though it's tried to simplify Ahern's novel by merging
characters and removing subplots. The longer it goes on, the harder it
becomes to buy into the various situations, events and
misunderstandings that conspire to keep Alex and Rosie apart - whether
it's his marriage or hers, the rekindling of old relationships, or
plain ol' geography. Their relationship is so heavily peppered with
coincidences and mishaps that it could have made a decent dark
melodrama about the dangerous effects of co- dependency.And yet, for all its plot problems, Love, Rosie is a mostly charming
affair. There's some real depth to the relationship between Rosie and
Alex, one which transcends both friendship and romance in unexpectedly
touching ways - whether it's her decision not to ruin his future by
telling him about her pregnancy, or the comfort he selflessly gives her
when she's struggling to stay afloat in the wake of a family tragedy.
Thrown into the mix is the sweet chemistry shared by Collins and
Claflin, who are both very cute and very committed to making their
roles work. (Collins never feels or looks old enough to play the mother
of a teenage girl, even one who had her kid as a teenager, but that's a
minor quibble.)Considering how predictable the story is, it's something of a minor
miracle that Love, Rosie works at all. But it does, for the most part,
whenever it manages to find the heart and humour of its characters and
their almost painfully intertwined lives amidst its many narrative
contrivances. It's not great art, or even one of the great romantic
comedies, but it's a surprisingly decent diversion - one that should
please Ahern's fans and perhaps win her a few new ones.
