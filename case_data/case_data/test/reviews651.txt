Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is a southpaw that goes straight to the heart

We can always criticize Hollywood for bringing movies that are intended
to toss some smoke to the viewer by presenting something new with
repeated formulas and recycled plots we have seen somewhere else
before. The same goes for "Southpaw"... apart from the fact that
there's something more lying inside this story about a boxer's
redemption. The answer to it is the trust it puts into the strength of
its actors and the gripping emotions that come with it.There's a little sparkle that starts to light up inside of us during
the very first minutes of the movie. And even if we barely have the
time to see Gyllenhaal and McAdams' characters, we didn't need more
because we were instantly dragged towards an emotional charge that
never abandons the plot and whose "legacy" is carried on the main
actor's shoulders.Gyllenhaal doesn't skip a beat and keeps his character's pain and rage
constantly vivid in every detail - we feel it because we've somewhat
experienced in our lives what it means to lose someone we love and feel
lost afterward. We felt the struggle coming after the loss of a bond as
strong as that one. That's why his performance is relentless and
immaculate.Truth is that the genuine side of "Southpaw"'s plot is based on the
main character's fall and his irreproachable route to stand up again,
reach the top once more. Only this time, the fight has completely
changed and the goals are different, goals that make us question what
we really fight for in our life.You already know this story but not told under these terms. Hollywood
has crafted good flicks about fighters/boxers in the last few years and
"Southpaw" follows a line that is close to the more recent "Warrior",
starring Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy due to its "underdog" screenplay.
What makes this movie different from the rest is the ineluctable
emotion that never departs and befalls us, stirring and stirring our
inner feelings.We don't always need to criticize a movie for its predictability.
"Southpaw" is predictable but it's also honest in assuming itself as
such because its purpose - and I believe, Antoine Fuqua's purpose - is
to divert our attention towards something more meaningful. And when a
movie pierces the bone to reach our heart and soul with this impact,
then it deserves our respect and acknowledgment."Southpaw" is, quite simply, liberating.
