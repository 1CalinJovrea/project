It seamed to be a comedy

The movie is full of Hollywood's bullshit. Bulletproof good guys with
excessive military experience and skills of professional
stuntmen....and stupid bad guys, who run after the remote controlled
car, kill the potential hostage and don't kill the good guy just
because of the scenario.
