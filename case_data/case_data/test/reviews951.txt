Atmospheric & surprisingly calm

Well, I have to recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be stunned
by a cozy and atmospheric setting, a convenient cast, surprisingly calm
and well thought dialogs and a plot which sometimes triggers a variety
of mixed feelings like disgust & attraction, shame & dignity. Overall i
felt very calm and relaxed, sometimes i smiled, sometimes i wondered.The film is so beautifully shot from beginning to end that every
picture has its right to exist. Although the subject could be seen as a
controversy to people who don't like to think outside the box it never
felt like one. This made me think about what i would have thought if
the gender of the characters would be the opposite. Despite that this
would be a real challenge creating a movie which feels exact the same
way i came to the conclusion that there is no equality in love and life
and therefore this movie works for me like a charm.The title of another (accurate) user review here can be misleading
though and almost led me to skip this movie. This is definitely not a
chick flick for grannies ;)
