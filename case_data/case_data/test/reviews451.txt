A Ghoulish Portrayal of Victorian London

Based on the 1994 novel Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem by Peter
Ackroyd, The Limehouse Golem (2016) is a ghoulish portrayal of a
Victorian London slum and the stone-faced detective trying to solve a
series of grizzly and sensational crimes. It was directed by Juan
Carlos Medina and adapted for the screen by Jane Goldman.Medina is an inexperienced director, having only four films under his
belt since 2001, and only two were full-length. Goldman wrote
screenplays for The Woman in Black (2012), X-Men: Days of Future Past
(2014), and Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014). Her talented script
shines through.In the opening act, Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke) is arrested on suspicion
of poisoning her husband, John (Sam Reid). Meanwhile, Inspector John
Kildare (Bill Nighy) is tasked to solve the "Limehouse Golem" murders,
which have become sensationalized in the press. He enlists the help of
a Limehouse bobby George Flood (Daniel Mays).They discover the Golem's diary written on the pages of "On Murder
Considered as one of the Fine Arts" (1827) by Thomas De Quincey in a
library and narrow the suspects to four men: philosopher Karl Marx
(Henry Goodman), writer George Gissing (Morgan Watkins), comedian Dan
Leno (Douglas Booth), and John Cree.Inspector John Kildare is not an adept detective and even refers to
himself as a scapegoat. Focusing almost entirely on handwriting
analysis to whittle down a list of four suspects, he misses obvious
clues like the fact that no new murders occur after the death of John
Cree and the imprisonment of Elizabeth. The Limehouse Golem made it
clear he was seeking fame above all else; he would not let someone else
take the blame while he quietly slipped away, meaning the murderer had
to either be John or Elizabeth.**Major spoiler** In the end, it's revealed that Elizabeth was the
Golem all along. Left scarred and unable to enjoy sex by a cruel
punishment inflicted by her mother, Elizabeth was raised on the streets
until eventually carving out a home at the local theater. John Cree
promises to give her the staring role in his new play if she marries
him, but the play bombs and he loses interest. Desperate for the
crowd's adulation, Elizabeth turns into a monster, crafting her
murderous persona around the mythological golem, a creature in Jewish
folklore created from mud or clay.This surprise ending doesn't work well because it's so out of left
field. There are no indications Elizabeth is capable of the grisly
crimes, and it's a historic fact that most female serial killers (rare
in and of itself) are poisoners and not brutal killers. Also, if
Elizabeth was so desperate for fame and wanted recognition as the
Limehouse Golem, why did she wait until just before she was executed to
take credit? Why did she bother poisoning her husband and attempt to
put the blame on him? That being said, Olivia Cooke, who also played
Emma Decody on Bates Motel (2013-2017), was great in the role.The Limehouse Golem is not historic fiction in a sense that the main
plot and events really happened, but the setting, crimes, culture, and
peripheral characters were largely historical, much like Gangs of New
York (2002) colorfully brought to life mid-nineteenth century New York
City. Limehouse is a district in east London on the north bank of the
River Thames, and has long been an important shipping hub. In Victorian
London, Limehouse was a bit Bohemian, with numerous bawdy music halls.
It was frequented by well-known performers and intellectual figures,
like three of the historic characters in the film: Karl Marx, George
Gissing, and Dan Leno.The Limehouse Golem is not without its inaccuracies. The movie is set
in 1880 and contains references to concealing homosexuality, public
hanging, the age of consent being 16, and a magic trick involving a
woman being cut in half. According to Christopher Pittard, a Senior
Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Portsmouth, the age
of consent in Great Britain was raised to 16 in 1885, homosexuality was
not criminalized until 1885, public hangings were abolished in 1868,
and no woman was cut in half in a magic trick until 1921. These are
relatively minor inaccuracies, but I wonder why the film wasn't just
set five years later, since it contains other references to events in
1885 as well.The film criticizes "white knights," men who rush to the aid of
vulnerable women, and even uses the anachronistic term. When George
Gissing asks Inspector Kildare if he's surprised he married a "fallen
woman," Kildare replies contemptuously: "Why would anyone be surprised?
The world is full of men like you, Mr. Gissing. Men who feign
generosity when all they really seek is congratulation. Men who play
God by saving lives. Is it really so different, I wonder, than playing
God by taking them?" It's a great line, but doesn't make much sense. I
think any reasonable person would say saving lives is quite different
from taking them, whatever the motive.Overall, The Limehouse Golem has a decent cast, good direction, and
great dialog. It rises above the typical police procedural, especially
for history buffs, but isn't quite as impactful as its creators
intended.
