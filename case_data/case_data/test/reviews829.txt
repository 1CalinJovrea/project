Suspenseful, keeps you guessing until the end

Just saw this movie before it was GONE from my town's movie theaters
tomorrow. I love all types of films, including suspenseful
psychological thrillers, and this one did not disappoint. I was already
a fan of Amanda Seyfried, and her performance in this one was one of
her best so far. This is a fast-paced movie that kept me guessing until
the end about what was really going on, thanks to Amanda's terrific,
edgy performance. The script was tightly written, sparing us any
unnecessary story lines, but yet giving us a few questionable
characters to wonder about. Nice direction, and the other actors
contributed nicely to the mystery and the central question of reality
vs. insanity.
