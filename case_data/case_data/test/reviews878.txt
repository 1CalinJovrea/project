Some good, *A LOT* of bad

The good: - Some unconventional and interesting cinematography made by
Chung- hoon Chung with some departures from his usual style (I
recognize in it a mixture of Wes Anderson and a bunch of other pretty
known directors). Sometimes framing and camera movements are a bit an
end in themselves but whatever. - Nice performances by some actors -
Well... that's all.The bad: - Most of gags and jokes are just meh. - Some of the gags and
jokes are not just meh: they're so bad it's embarrassing to watch. - In
fact, I think about a joke out of 10 in the movie is actually decent. -
A bit juvenile, and this is meant in the worst possible way - The plot
is so predictable it's painful. Yes, it will develop and it will end
just like you expect it to do after 10 minutes of watching. - In the
economy of the movie, Earl could've never existed and it would've been
exactly the same. A useless, insignificant character who for some
reason is in the title. - At the 30 minutes mark the movie already
began to bore me, and it bored me from that point till the end. - The
delivery of any emotional content fails miserably. Everything is so
fake, shallow, badly written, badly directed. It's not actors' fault.
This, with the exception of something towards the end, where they got
it easy...Inconceivably overrated piece of sh*t of a movie that saves itself from
total failure only thanks to some good cinematography. It is actually
one of the worst movies I've watched in 2015, and believe me, I watched
plenty. 4/10.
