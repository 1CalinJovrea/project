The bad Chucky is back

The first 2 Child's Play movies were good and then it only received bad
films, until 2013 when The Curse of Chucky gave some life to the
franchise.I was with high expectations because I liked the previous film, however
The Cult of Chucky is really bad like The Seed of Chucky (or even
worse). The story is a mess, stupid and boring, the kills are bad and
the characters are just uninteresting. However this installment has
some good jokes and tries to give some life to this franchise,and the
characters of Fiona Dourif and Alex Vincent are fine.In my opinion this movie should start with what we've seen during the
ending, that would open an opportunity for a good and interesting
story.If there will be a sequel, I hope will be different, more violent,
funny without being ridiculous and with good characters.Chucky is back, but we have seen him in better days.Rating: 3.5/10
