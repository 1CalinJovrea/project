Not a Fast&Furious film

I saw this film by chance in my local cinema. To begin with, it is
nothing like some of the best actions from European creators, such as
Taken, District B13, Transporter, etc. The action is good enough, with a couple of silly moments. The leads
are handsome, but they don't give the performance of their lifetime.
Some good funny moments, very beautiful landscapes from France,
stereotypical villains and very rare and exotic cars. The plot is also
not very original and the directing is nothing special - it has no
special vibes like the action/criminal films by Luc Besson, Pierre
Morel or Olivier Marchal. It is a "popcorn movie" not worse than the most of the recent films
that stars like Nicholas Cage, Bruce Willis, Val Kilmer and even Robert
DeNiro are part off. I believe that Scott Eastwood is getting better
and better in acting, he just needs some more challenging roles, not
just handsome guy for average actions and romantic films.6,5/10 in order to stimulate more the European film creators and young
actors.
