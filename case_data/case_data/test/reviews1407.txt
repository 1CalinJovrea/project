Wow, what a pleasant surprise this film was! This was the Australian
production/version of Star Wars meets Mad Max meets Aliens!The Aussies nailed this amazing low budget indie sci-fi flick,
especially the tight directing and outstanding cinematography!Director/writer/producer Shane Abbess impressed to the level of any top
Hollywood director, creating a vision and executing it perfectly.
Absolutely stunning cinematography, visuals, special effects, sets and
locations. Editing and sound were both on point. I really felt as if I
was watching some 100M+ budget big screen Hollywood production! Let me clarify how and why I am so impressed - and how I rate a film
accordingly and deserving of its merits (and not comparing it to
similar big productions in the same genre): this was a low budget
(approx 800k), independent film by a somewhat amateur director, writer
and producer. Add to the mix some not-so-big B-list actors - only one
being American and granted, the most notable in his role, Kellan Lutz.
The end result was a stunning smorgasbord of visual satisfaction. I
truly hope other reviewers rate this film on its merits as I did, as
it's the only fair way to rate and review a film.Yes, the writing (particularly some of the characters dialog and
certain parts of the screenplay) could've use a little tweaking, and
some of the characters could have been cast differently, but other than
that, this film was outstanding in every other area of critique.Had this film actually been a big budget A-type Hollywood film with any
leading seasoned director/writer/producers, and backed by a big- named
production company with an A-list cast, I would have rated it a
disappointing 6-7/10.But as I rate a film on it's merits as outlined above, and get as
impressed and satisfied as I was after watching this film, it's a well
deserved 10/10 from me!I'm really hoping a Volume 2 comes out very soon! Great job and props
to all involved in this little gem of a masterpiece!
