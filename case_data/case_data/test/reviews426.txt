Perfect for kids but even better for adults

First lets; clarify; I am not Mexican nor any in my family and friend
group; however it has been a long long time since we catch kids movie
able to captivate 5,6,7 or 8 year old girls and boy and the parents
that took them. Just the quality, colors and artistry of the images;
makes the movie worth; but the subject matter is even more impressive.
How many times you were able to really laugh on a subject matter like
death and make children (and adults) happy with an adventure that is
pure entertainment but also gives a quite poetic look at life and dead.
In brief; take your children to see it as an excuse; you probably will
enjoy it even more. Forget PIXAR formula products; this is just a
masterpiece
