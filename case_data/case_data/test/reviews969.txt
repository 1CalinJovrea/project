A disgrace

This is a disgrace to the original, at the time it was a groundbreaking
and very shocking film, with great actors very original and well done
ideas and such an original style to it, well this crap is exactly the
opposite, terrible story line, very slow to start I would go as far as
saying boring, and for the actors in it got to give it to the director
the whole film is just all terrible acting, the overall very bad crime
feel in Detroit doesn't come across, where are the crazy adverts, where
is the infamous bad guy, and the setup to murphys story? All missing,
why mess with the story line from the original which was excellent
anyway, this is nothing short of an epic fail, it just manages to scrap
1 star rating as robos HUD view is quite cool but that is literally the
only good thing I have to say, I can't remember the last time I was so
disappointed with a film, please director don't do any more films, a
complete waste of what could of been a brilliant opportunity
