Visually impressive but soulless

As I left the theater after watching this movie I tried to put my
finger on the reason why I felt so underwhelmed by what I had just
watched. Perhaps it was the overly simplistic video game plot (save the
princess), the lack of a well defined villain, or the lackluster
development of any of the characters. In the end I couldn't precisely
point to any single issue that derailed my ability to really enjoy this
viewing. What this movie really lacked was the ability to engage the
audience on any meaningful level whether it be emotional, mental or
otherwise. In short, it's soulless. I don't know exactly what gives a
movie its soul but I know when it's missing and this movie,
unfortunately, was quite lacking.
