Had major potential, then fell short. Fast.

Naturally, I was intrigued by "The Captive", great plot and amazing
actors, what could possibly go wrong? From the start, I could tell this
movie was going to have a ton of flashbacks, which is fine, until those
flashbacks kinda become irrelevant because the viewer has no idea which
flashback comes first. Strike 1. The introduction of Scott Speedman was
a treat, until he was a bit weird acting and since that was never
explained, I guess that was just his character?.. Then the part where
Ryan Reynolds character has an abusive past was brought up (in
reference to plot), then was never to be heard of again. Strike 2.
Still don't know much about the wife's character. Strike 3. No
explanation about the relationship of the two detectives (Dawson &
Speedman) but since Dawson seemed to have a picture of Speedman's niece
in her office, it's to be assumed they're in a relationship. OK. And
for the focus to be the family of the missing girl, I feel it rarely
focused on them. Strike 4. This movie just needed a lot of tweaking. Starting with some back story
of the characters at the beginning. And less flashbacks. More
explanations. And more focus on how the unit was actually working
towards finding the missing child.
