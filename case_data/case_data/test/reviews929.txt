WHO in the right mind would produce this film....

Chucky is an iconic figure in the horror genre it's as if someone just
wanted money and had never seen a chucky movie made this. I agree the
film before this was not all that great either to be honest childs play
is the best and my personal favorite is the Bride of Chucky because you
really got to see chuckys side way more. That's one reason this movie I
believe failed is because of the fact the doll looks terrible only time
it looks good is when its talking the old first film had a better doll
than this movie. Chucky didn't really get much screen time at least as
a talking psychopathic doll. This film was below a 1 to me I felt for
its time it should have been 100x better.
