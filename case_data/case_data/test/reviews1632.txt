Seeing The Light Within The Darkness: Transcendence

Spoilers Ahead:First, all of these Ape movies are allegories, they were never intended
to be taken literally as empirical realities. Of course, the Apes home
is impossibly constructed, the mastery of human weapons and tank use
are absurd. What was adumbrated in Rise, with the sneeze of the
contaminated lab worker, is brought to full fruition here with the
Simian Flu that almost exterminates the human race. Yes, detractors,
the movie is a failure as a pure adventure story. The way to appreciate
the movie is to see it as it was intended to be: an allegory about two
groups of creatures full of hatred and mistrust learning to overcome
their differences and, through the commonalities of existence, reaching
a sense of understanding for the other group. This powerful lesson is
taught through Caesar's nobility where the love visited upon him by his
adopted father, in Rise, gives him the strength to endure great
challenges to his patience with humans. There are two parallel stories
working here with each group: Caesar and Koba with Malcolm and Dreyfus.
Both Koba and Dreyfus are filled with implacable hatred for the other's
group; Koba's is more salient but Dreyfus shows it to you when he
stumbles on the words,"Regain all that we lost." The battle at the
building is as unreal as the bridge battle in Rise; yet, it is
important to remember the point is to teach a lesson about learning to
overcome prejudice and racism towards different peoples.It is not a coincidence that the dyads fight simultaneously at the end;
Dreyfus shares Koba's wish to exterminate the other group regardless of
the costs to his own group. Caesar tries to remind Koba of this but,
Koba in an ascending tone of rage replies, pointing to his torture
scars,"human work, Human work, HUMAN WORK." His hatred is mirrored in
Dreyfus, this is the key to the story. My favorite scene is where
Malcolm hugs Caesar, restoring his faith in humanity. This scene is the
entire movie in a microcosm. The movie begins with the near fatal first
meeting where Caesar stops a massacre. The director throws in
historical allusions like the famous Reichstag Fire that Hitler blamed
on the Jews and used to persecute them mercilessly. Here, Koba shoots
Caesar and starts the fire he blames on the humans. What hurt this
movie, severely, is that many people approached it as a straight
forward action movie. Be warned, it is an allegory like Rise, here the
theme is two groups of creatures learning to stop hating and killing
each other. Yes, detractors, it contains some bad scenes that were not
the best choices. I could have lived without the gas station with the
60's awful music. Admittedly, the cast, with the exception of Oldman, is much weaker than
Rise. There are greater breaks with reality (using automatic weapons,
tanks, conquering humans); always remember that, like the bridge battle
in Rise, these are necessary to make the allegorical points of the
narrative. Serkis does well conveying Caesar's nobility, it is not all
one sided. Caesar's naivet√© about Apes not ever reaching humans level
of violence is disproved by Koba. He clings to it as he released Koba,
to his death,"Koba not Ape." The core of the allegory is spoken by
Caesar to Koba when the latter tries to cloak his genocide with Apes'
survival. Caesar responds,"Koba fights for Koba." When you watch it
notice how this is mirrored with Dreyfus. It was a nice touch to have
the humans return Caesar to his childhood and protect / care for him.
This rankled the empiricists who decried the improbability, but again,
this is not a realistic movie. Caesar's faith is restored and he
returns to defeat Koba. The embrace of Malcolm and Caesar with their
look at each other was the entire point of this misunderstood treasure.
Yes, detractors, this is a step down from Rise but its message of
overcoming fear and prejudice for others different from ourselves,
coupled with Caesar's nobility, is why I own this movie. I invite you
to revisit it as I found myself doing; it took many showings until I
could articulate why I loved the movie. The sufferings of Life bind us
together as one wherever upon this small planet we may find ourselves.
