Highly original and darkly humorous comedy

"The Lobster" is the first English language film directed by Yorgos
Lanthimos ("Dogtooth"), and stars Colin Farrell as David, a man who is
recently separated from his wife and must now lodge at a government run
hotel in a near future Britain where he must find a suitable partner in
forty-five days, otherwise he will be turned into an animal of his
choosing.This is a very strange movie, the presentation is very serious and
oppressive (using the Mozart pieces repeatedly over slow motion motion
montages and Rachel Weisz narrating the story very sternly), but at the
same time the delivery of the lines and the odd way each character acts
made me laugh at the ludicrousness of it all. It's all done in such a
deadpan manner and the supporting cast made up John C. Riley and
several British television comedians (Olivia Colman, Ashley Jensen,
Ewen MacIntosh) help propel the comedy.There's plenty of unique ideas about relationships (people coming
together because they have something trivial in common, like nose
bleeds; being assigned a child to stop newlywed couples arguing, etc.).
The love story between Farrell and Weisz drives the second part of the
film, showing the two at odds against the world, trying to find a place
for themselves in a world with conflicting ideologies (she's from a
group of loners who hide out in the forest, their leader has a strict
policy on romantic relationships and is just as oppressive as the
government they're fighting against)."The Lobster" is a unique movie that is worth watching if you enjoy
quirky comedies or just something different.
