Pleasantly surprised!

It might be prudent never to judge a book by its cover, but often
enough, the author would give you a good idea what you're about to
invest your time in. Bryan Cranston and James Franco doing a comedy
together was enough to give me the necessary shove to press "Play" on
this one.I like comedies but finding a good one lately has been a challenge.
Been disappointed many times with trailers that seem promising only to
find out that those scenes are the best the entire movie has to offer.
There have also recently been a bunch of comedies relying on the
director's or the leads' reputation to carry the film to box office and
critical success only to crash and burn upon release. This one is a
rare exception. Congratulations to the team for getting it just right!
James' Laird was a delicate balance. Annoying yet sweet, sometimes
offensive but without being repulsive. Bryan's Ned fits the stereotype
yet has been restrained enough to remain relatable. Even the cameo from
Gene and Paul, though expected, came out fresh.If you're looking for a fun movie, give this one a try. Be forewarned
though of the liberal use of profanities.
