A darkly comic treat

Jake Gyllenhaal's Lou Bloom is an instant classic scuzzball character.
He echoes the memorable sociopaths played by Robert DeNiro in his prime
(Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy and Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver),
but he's less sympathetic than either of those. A parasite on the
prowl, Bloom soon fixates on a career ideally suited to his amoral
loner/ go-getter characteras a crime journalist during L.A.'s night
hours. He listens for crimes in progress on his police scanner, speeds
to the scene, and then angles for the most shocking, risqué footage he
can possibly get away with.New colleagues Nina (Rene Russo), the struggling news producer he goes
to first, and Rick (Riz Ahmed), a desperate "intern" railroaded into
the nightmare, are exploitable because they want what Bloom can give
themmoney, work, success. The risks he takes and the lines he crosses
are mainly ethical ones at first, but he quickly realises the quickest
way to make a name for himself is to get truly sensational footage. The
kind that requires taking bigger risks, and eventually endangering
lives.Bloom is the most detestable character I've seen in ages. He's a
soulless cockroach rummaging through the misfortunes of others,
ravenously feeding off violent crimes, sometimes while they're still
happening. But the news station keeps on buying what he's selling.
Viewer ratings spike with each successive horror scene that hits the
air.Writer/director Dan Gilroy makes us squirm from start to finish here
because Bloom is so queasily familiar. We all know people who share his
traits, even if they don't take them to such extremes. He's society's
Frankenstein's monster, made from all the worst parts of capitalism.
He'll achieve success by any means, and he's proud of that.With End of Watch and Prisoners, and now Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal is
finding the sort of edgy, dangerous roles relished by great actors of
the 1970s, and he's attacking them with gusto. This might be his best
performance yet. The film itself is a darkly comic treat. It's tense
and unsettling as a thriller, but the most fascinating part is seeing
how far this scumbag will take his obsession, and how much we'll allow
him to get away with.
