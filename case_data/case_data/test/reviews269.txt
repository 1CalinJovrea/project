Reserved for the male of the species

The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one
Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other
people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI
agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like
Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own
way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the
realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants
to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift
by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not
about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the
more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far
from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted
bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do
mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene
amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all
kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so
well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as
are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional
brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the
first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up
paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of
DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one
of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by
DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has
him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a
combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But
in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out
and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle
Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where
presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around
to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they
did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for
Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations
for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.
Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character
that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he
could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is
almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as
a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes
him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's
getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to
teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are
nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall
Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the
big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did.
