Should have been called Silent Snooze

I absolutely love the first Silent Hill film. The flashbacks
(reminiscent of how one learns the back-story in a video game) were
chilling and unveiled a haunting past for little Rose/Alessa. So I went
into the sequel with anticipation and an open mind, but honestly...the
best part of this movie was the opening credits, which did look pretty
awesome in 3D. Everything after that was just boring as heck. The storyline just seemed to move at a snail's pace. Plus the movie
relied more on startle tactics instead of horror and gross out factor
like the first. The new monsters did a lot of screaming and little
else. The older ones we've previously seen were treated like
domesticated livestock. And all I got of my favorite character (Rose)
was a 10 second exchange with another character and dialog straight out
of a 1.99 Harlequin Romance novel. Ugh! I actually had to wake myself
up in the middle of this film. The only other time I've fallen asleep
was back in the 90's with Blue Chips. It'd be a toss up as to which I'd
be willing to sit through again. Oh, and the gal was NOT as good or
creepy as the original Alessa/Sharon kid. Could they not afford to hire
that one back again or something?And I really think it was the wrong move to go with a film so dedicated
to the video game. Tossing out things like magical totems and demon
gods...it just didn't translate to film well. The first one made sense
without having to have played the game. The plot for this one seemed
too B-movie, especially if you weren't a player.
