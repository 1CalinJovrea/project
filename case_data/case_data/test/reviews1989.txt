I think the "War" in the movie title was a misspell

a) The most deceptive movie title there is. It tries to hype you up by
adding an epic feeling, but the movie was nothing but garbage. Heck,
there wasn't a war, a battle, or even combat.b) Characters we can't relate to, the portrayal of the characters was
even worse.c) Can someone tell me what the purpose or meaning of this movie was?
I'm having trouble finding one.d) Nothing good about this movie. No action, hardly any story line, no
meaning...please don't waste time and money watching this d) I'm going
to go to the zoo, film some apes jumping around, and call it "War for
the Planet of the Apes". Anyone interested in seeing it?
