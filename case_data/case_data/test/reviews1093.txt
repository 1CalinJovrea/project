Don't waste your time with this, even with the great actors... it is a
horrible film that makes no sense at all. It is boring and depressing.
There is no action in the film. Here is a example bale goes to the bad
guys town and knowing he is a drug dealer, goes up to some bad guys and
wants to buy some "candy". they ask him what kind, and he says anything
LOL. Then they take him to a house and he buys some meth but he refuses
to smoke it in front of them, but they sell it to him anyway!?? Then he
pays for it and walks out forgetting his bag of candy? lol The guy
comes down and says you forgot this.?? then bale and his friend go back
to their truck and just sit their for hours till the police arrive and
run them out of town.the whole movie is like that , just stupid stuff that makes no sense,
and is boring. Also many many things are not explained at all. An
example of that is the car accident at the beginning, then next scene
he is in prison? Why the brother and pretty were killed also made no
sense at all, and nothing about the whole debt or fight business is
ever explained.Some good actors in the film, and good acting, but the director who
also wrote it Scott cooper is a idiot who needs to learn how to make a
real film.This is the worst movie with big actors in it that I have ever seen.
