loosely based on a true story of unmitigated greed

Matthew McConaughey, Edward Ramirez and Bryce Dallas Howard star in
"Gold" from 2016, based on the Bre-X gold mine scandal in Canada.After his father dies and the fourth-generation prospecting business
goes belly-up, Kenny Wells (McConaughey) does not want to give up on
his dream of finding gold in them thar hills.He approaches a well-known geologist, Michael Acosta (Ramirez) and
talks him into partnering with him. Michael hasn't found gold either
but thinks he knows where in Indonesia to look. Wells manages to get a few investors and the two go to work, but
without luck. It's looking like another failure, especially when the
workers quit. Knowing they need fresh water in their community, Michael
lures them back to work by providing purifying systems for them.Wells contracts malaria and is out of it for weeks. But when he is
well, he learns that Michael has found gold. Their subsequent success
is enormous.This is one of those pathetic stories we've seen and heard about a
million times - Enron, Madoff, etc., etc., where no one questions
anything because -- as Wells says at the end -- everyone is making too
much money. This to me was one of the more outrageous stories. It's
amazing to me that enormous corporations will buy into anything, no
matter how stupid, if they think they can make a few dollars.The film is entertaining, with McConaughey a vision with his shaved
head, 45-pound weight gain and false teeth, giving a fine performance
as a man who looks like a loser and kind of acts like one. Ramirez is
subtle and underplayed, in good contrast to the bombastic Kenny.Nice ending.
