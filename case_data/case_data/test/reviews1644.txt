Consistently funny and a surprisingly cohesive effort from MacFarlane

First there was Gollum, then Caesar the ape and now ... Ted? If you
thought motion-capture animation was beyond the range of foul-mouthed
R-rated comedy, here's your evidence to the contrary. "Family Guy"
creator Seth MacFarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldn't
behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level and the big
screen  with "Ted," a story of growing up  at the age of 35.Fans of MacFarlane and "Family Guy" will be the first to tell you that
the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately (I guess those
manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard). It's not
easy to keep scoring laughs using the same non-sequitur formula over
and over again, but fortunately "Ted" is a more comically cohesive
effort than you'd ever expect from the king of unexpected random jabs,
references and political incorrectness.If you haven't been curious enough to find out what the film is about
already, "Ted" tells the story of how young John Bennett (who grows up
to be Mark Wahlberg), who had trouble fitting in as a kid, made a wish
on Christmas Day for his teddy bear to come to life. His wish comes
true and Ted becomes world famous, even appearing on the Johnny Carson
Show. But as Patrick Stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his
role as narrator: like Corey Feldman and Frankie Muniz, eventually,
people stop giving a ****.Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori (Mila Kunis),
nearly middle-aged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s "Flash
Gordon" with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend.
Eventually, John must start to make sacrifices if he wants to become
the adult that Lori wants him to be, and Ted is arguably the chief
reason for his inability to shape up.There aren't exactly any curveballs in this story, but that's when you
realize you're watching a film in which a man is trying to stop hanging
out with his profane teddy bear. Despite the obvious outcomes, "Ted"
has to be considered an original comedy.It's also consistently funny. Sure, the nature of many of the jokes is
that they exist in a vacuum and aren't necessarily related to what's
going on or what matters, but much of the references actually tie into
the plot later on (such as Flash Gordon ... it'll make sense when you
see it) and it's far less random than skeptics will come in expecting.
That said, some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a
personal level, i.e. if you watch this with a group of people, you're
bound to laugh really hard at times when they don't and vice-versa.The only thing that feels a little out of place is a subplot involving
Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy single father who has been a longtime
admirer of Ted's and inquires about purchasing him for his overweight
son. You've never seen Ribisi like this and that alone is amusing, but
the focus of the film is on how John and Ted's mischief impacts his
ability to grow up and get more serious with Lori, and this sort of
butts into things.Yet for all its shenanigans, the amount of heart and sincerity in some
of the relationship drama between John and Lori is surprising. Wahlberg
and Kunis are generally pretty convincing, even if it's a bit weird
that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but
not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to
Ted's peer pressure. (Bear pressure?)The secret weapon is that Ted really is kind of adorable, and the
mo-cap gives him an extra lifelike quality. The film hits some
emotional notes early (who can't identify with loving a stuffed
animal?) and this helps it to reconnect later on despite all the
R-rated chaos in between. That ability alone assures "Ted" will be seen
as better than a majority of foul- mouthed, dirty-minded comedies."Ridiculous" comes to mind as the best descriptor for "Ted," which one
has to imagine MacFarlane aimed for in the first place. His performance
as the titular bear is certainly reminiscent of Peter Griffin (there's
a wink to the audience about that, by the way), but more importantly,
Ted is treated as more than just an opportunity for a never-ending
string of jokes that are simply funnier because "it's a teddy bear."Maybe having to create a complete package in the form of a movie has
helped MacFarlane learn how to tone down his shtick. Audiences will
write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and
scatter-brained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their
lives, and MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild
make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion. "Ted" is
as engaging as it is clever, funny and ridiculous. ~Steven C
