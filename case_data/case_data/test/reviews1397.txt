Do the Right Thing

Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies that take place in a
confined space are outright thrillers that usually take full advantage
of helpless feelings and desperate actions. Think back to Duel, Phone
Booth and Buried. A ticking clock and lack of a safe escape route had
us sweating bullets with Dennis Weaver, Colin Farrell and Ryan
Reynolds. This entry from the Dallas International Film Festival takes
a much different approach.Noted British writer Steven Knight also directs this one, and rather
than nail-biting tension, we get a pretty interesting character study.
Mr. Knight has written some impressive screenplays: Dirty Pretty
Things, Amazing Grace, and Eastern Promises. Utilizing every ounce of
his writing expertise, he keeps us connected to Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy)
as he drives on the freeway with intermittent rain being his biggest
physical obstacle. There are no high speed chases. No stunts. No
weapons. Ivan is not being followed by a spy or anyone else. He is
merely driving and talking on the phone via Bluetooth.In what could be considered the ultimate film gimmick, Tom Hardy is the
only actor to appear on screen. His Ivan Locke is not just the only
major character. He is the ONLY one. All supporting work and conflict
is provided by a multitude of voices on the other end of a phone call.
There is no need for me to delve into the story or the plot, but you
should know that the situation Ivan finds himself in is not some
creative web of criminal deceit ... instead it's his penance for one
poor decision. That poor decision has him in a tough spot with very
poor timing.For those that wonder if Bane from The Dark Knight Rises has the acting
chops to hold our attention, a reminder of Tom Hardy's fine work should
alleviate concerns: Warrior, Inception, Lawless, Bronson, Tinker Tailor
Soldier Spy. He can act and he can make a character his own, just as he
does with Ivan Locke.
