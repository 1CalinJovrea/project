REVIEW - THE FOREIGNER There are very few films that impress me much these days, either the
story is rubbish, the acting terrible or the effects just dull, but and
this is a HUGE BUT, this film is THE BEST JACKIE CHAN FILM! From start to finish excellent, can't say anything more. One film you must see.Previous films were humorous with amazing stunts this is real in your
face. A new Chapter of Chan!Rating 10 out of 10
