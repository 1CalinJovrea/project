Not Funny. Rauncy.  I will never learn

There are two candidates for a Senate seat: Incumbent Cam Brady (Will
Ferrell) and challenger Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis). Billed as a
comedy, but no comedy showed up. However, a lot of raunch did.The promos led me to watch this raunchy excuse for comedy. I will never
learn. The promos weren't funny either but gave the impression that
this "could" be good. It wasn't. Hey, they don't show you the raunchy
stuff in the promos. This was raunchy from the word "go." I know there
is an audience for this type of "comedy" and we keep waiting for these
people to grow up. Not going to happen. I will never learn. Will Ferrell is not funny, never has been. And, will someone please
tell me why everyone is so high on Zach Gilifianakis. I don't get it at
all. But, the real culprit here is the script and combined with two of the
most unfunniest people on the planet, this doesn't deserve the ink on
any review. End of story. (1/10)Violence: Not really. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes, a nipple is exposed.
Language: Yes, many F-bombs.
