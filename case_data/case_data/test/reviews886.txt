Magnificent

Maleficent is magnificent. The story is sophisticated enough to delight
adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a
delightful twist including the meaning of true love. The characters are
sympathetic and there is enough excitement.The art direction and cinematography are beautiful. The fairy land
scenes resemble a pre Raphaelite painting. The castle was a bit generic
CGI. The right blend of human faces with CGI so it didn't look too
animated. The director Stromberg who did Oz the Great and Powerful did
an even better job here.Angelina Jolie's expressive face is the perfect showcase for the
character - it is the role of her lifetime. Like the way they did her
cheekbones to make it like the Disney cartoon. Sam Riley as her
sidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow, dragon horse. The
creatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming.
Elle Fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of Aurora and
Brenton Thwaites plays her prince. The fairies including Juno Temple
and Imelda Staunton are cute too.Liked this more than the Snow White movies 'Mirror Mirror' and 'Snow
White and the Hunstman'. The first was fun but a bit silly and the
second was too grim. Maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and
fairy tale. Most enjoyable film of the year.
