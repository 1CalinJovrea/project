Family Friendly, Festive and Fun!

There are very few movies anymore that are truly kid friendly, but i
truly enjoyed this one! The best part is it has nice messages for both
kids and parents. My boys loved the whole monster theme. I personally
would wait till a child is 8 or 9 before letting them see it only in
case they may fear goofy monsters and voices. It was nice as an adult
to have some unexpected clean laughs. The many generational
perspectives, and even in an odd way, cultural perspectives can make
this an easy film for a broad range of ages to enjoy, from 8 to 70
years. I also enjoyed hearing good old stars like Kevin James, Adam
Sandler, and Fran Dresher as the voices. As an 80's teenager i have a
natural respect for these actors, actresses, and "90's feel" films. I
did not see it in 3D, but based on the animation i just saw, i am sure
it would even be better in 3d. So this would be a fabulous film to add
to the October/Halloween festivities. It really put us into the spirit
of fun and laughs.
