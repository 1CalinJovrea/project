I wrote this myself

This movie was made on a shoestring budget. And they all shared the
same shoestring. Some really stereotypical wannabe Irish 'gangsta'
acting in this. A couple things i noticed: The film has no sense of time passing. It
feels like it all happened in one afternoon. Irish police DO NOT get
involved in enforcing evictions or serving bailiff summonses. It's a
Sheriff who enforces non payment in Ireland not a bailiff. ....sorry i'm not wasting anymore time on this. I'm gonna end it here.Actually the ending is stupid and only a moron would do that knowing
who the person was. I reckon they only had one shoestring and it was used to hold the plot
together.
