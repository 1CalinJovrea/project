The persistence of memory is exceptionally well illustrated

I loved this movie uncritically. It's only upon "thinking" about it as
a work of art that my reaction to it (10) is revised to 9. Some bits
are too long (what else is new), and the real-life personages that we
see in a video at the end look more interesting than their actor
counterparts. The child actors who dominate the first part of the movie
are wonderfully effective.Although I've never been lost in the sense of not knowing where to find
my family, I identified acutely with the adult Saroo who must wrack his
brain and become heavily involved with Google in order to try to find
out where he fits into the world. Nearly all of the most important
people in my elderly life are persons I met when I was young but "lost"
for a very long time thereafter. I can't expect everyone to share my
experience of the movie in that way: others will see it through the
experience of being a parent or a son, but I believe most will be
moved.India isn't overdone. It's dirty, it's crowded, it's poor -- but we all
knew that -- there is no effort to shock us by exaggerating these
things, and I appreciate that. Also appreciate their sticking with the
languages that would actually have been spoken in the various locales
of the story, and using subtitles, instead of doing the whole thing in
English and making us figure out when that's a story-telling
convenience.
