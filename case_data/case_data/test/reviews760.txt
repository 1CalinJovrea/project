A Doll's House Re-visited, Almost

The themes presented in this film are still relevant and have merit.
With that said, I want to add that ever since Ibsen wrote "A Doll's
House," it's very rare to get a film (or play for that matter) that is
charged with the theme of gender equality and presents it in a way that
truly resonates. What do I mean? In films that aim to give a message or
present an issues, such as when the writer wants to say something about
the relevant society, more often than not, the writer portrays those
characters in simple categorizations of good and bad. That may work in
a superhero film, but in a piece of realism, where character
development and relationships are key elements to the storytelling,
simple good and bad just won't do. That's my issue with this film. The
screenplay simplifies a few integral characters too much, in favor of
hoisting up its protagonist.To get this out of the way, the performances are fantastic. Emma Stone
and Steve Carell lead the cast well, and the cast doesn't have a weak
link in it. In particular, a lot of credit has to be given to Steve
Carell. He took a character that was underwritten and perhaps even
misrepresented and makes him sympathetic and someone to root for.
Andrea Riseborough also delivers a very affecting performance and
really gives us some great scene work with Emma Stone.The directing is swift, well paced and well filmed. Kudos to the
cinematographer who really has a wonderful grasp on stillness to
promote an essential moment and exerts great uses of soft and hard
focus to portray dramatic moments and internalize character feelings.
The editing also deserves a shout out for some wonderful pacing and
really effectively switching between the grainy, 70s like
cinematography and more clear cinematography.Now, back to the screenplay. What made and still makes "A Doll's House"
the ultimate gender-equality script is that every character can be
sympathized with. We learn more about the human condition and evils of
society, rather than placing blame and anger on individual groups.
There are only two men that can be rooted for without hesitation and
that's our protagonist's husband and father. Every other guy is
completely unlikable and has no arc, and Steve Carell's character can
be questioned. Carell's character, who is a vital part of this story,
isn't written very well or thoroughly. It's always hard to have two
protagonists in a film, especially at a reasonable and well paced time.
Carell's character is both an antagonist and protagonist or, at least
attempts to be so. Carell's character opposes Emma Stone's. It's a man
versus women ordeal and their tennis match is the crisis and climax of
the film. But, here's the issue. Carell's character is NOT the
antagonist. It's society! So why is Carell's character's standing
within the realm of the film so questionable? Why doesn't he get his
own arc? Every major character in "A Doll's House" takes a journey.
That's what makes us empathize with them and come away disliking their
society, and not the products of that society. The same would work with
this film. But instead, there is a co- protagonist / antagonist that is
not written for people to care about or even empathize with. He gets no
arc, no change. He's unaffected. He may as well have been a smaller
part.Why is this an issue? Because Emma Stone's character is a catalyst.
She's the driving force and vehicle used within the film to represent
the affects of an unjust era and to showcase the positive effects that
a change in this society would have. Unfortunately, because Carell's
character and the real antagonists (the sexists who sit atop the
societal ladder) don't change, because we only see them as unlikable,
this story turns into something simple and ultimately un-fulfilling.
Stone's character merely wins the battle within the film and we come
away knowing that and are momentarily happy. However, that soon goes
away, which makes this entertaining dramedy perhaps a little
forgettable. Had the writing been more substantial and caring to all
its characters, and forgiving to all its characters and condemned
society instead, we'd come away with a more profound understanding of
where issues lie and are issued from. That's a memorable film. I
suppose the cinematic world is still chasing Ibsen. I give this film 3 out of 5 stars for its entertainment value and
performances and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Reviewed by Willie J.,
