More of the Same

Another MCU movie that the bandwagon is giving stellar reviews to even
though it sucks.The movie follows the same basic formula as all of the other MCU
movies. There's quips, there's jokes, there's a McGuffin, there's a
1-dimensional villain.Movie's sole purpose is another lead-up to the next Avengers. The
mystical artifact Strange uses turns out to be an Infinity Stone.
"Shocking". If I had a dollar for every time Marvel did something that
took me by surprise, I'd be flat broke, because you can see this stuff
coming from a mile away.I swear, I almost walked out when I heard the wifi password joke. Not
to mention the stupid cape being alive so they have more comedy in the
movie. Comedy? My mistake, I meant cringe.Marvel Movies have a tendency to love to have the hero getting betrayed
by someone they thought an ally. Baron Mordo is a friend of Strange and
his group in the movie. He's a villain in the comics. Anyone knows what
is coming from a mile away. He doesn't go full bad guy in this one, but
expect him to be full on evil in the sequel.Another thing nearly every single MCU movie does is the fake-out death.
A character will die and then in the next movie or even just in the
post-credit scene of the movie they died in they'll pop up alive and
well. Seriously, go back and look. Wong dies in this movie and Strange
just reverses time and brings him back. The only character I think has
stayed dead is Quicksilver. And there were rumors he was going to pop
up alive and well somehow in the New Avengers scene at the end of Age
of Ultron.The warped city stuff isn't as revolutionary is people claim.
Considering Inception did it 6 years ago and that horrible Devil May
Cry reboot did something similar as well.Movie is getting stellar reviews, which doesn't mean much. At this
point Marvel Studios could just release a 2 hour movie that is just the
main character sipping a glass of tea while sniffing a dog turd and it
would still get critical acclaim.You know why it's so freaking hard to enjoy Marvel movies these days?
When everyone is on the bandwagon and everyone attacks you if you have
a different opinion, and when the movies are praised for being
"amazing" when in reality they're just actually "just okay" or only
"halfway decent", it makes them movies feel worse to me because when
they don't live up to what critics and the fanboys say it is. Like Civil War this year. Everyone called it a "Masterpiece." Then I
saw it and the whole movie only functioned because of the gaping plot
holes. But if you point out said plot holes you get vilified.I think this movie might be the last MCU movie I bother seeing. They
all feel the same, follow the same formula, and the fanboys make going
to see them insufferable. Maybe Spider-man: Homecoming could be good,
but since they have Vulture, Shocker, and Tinkerer (3 1- dimensional
villains) as the villains of the film, it looks like the movie is
already setting up to be the same movie with different characters we've
seen about 15 times now. Just watch, I bet that the plot ends up being
Vulture trying to steal a priceless artifact and Spidey has to keep it
from him, and then in the post-credit scene it's revealed to be an
Infinity Stone so they can do another "Look, look, shared
universe,everything tied together" moment that are tired at this point.Why did I give it a 1? I'd have given it a five, but the over-hyped
nonsense from critics and the Marvel fanboys just makes these movies
feel worse than they actually are to me. A mediocre movie ends up
feeling like complete trash when everyone is calling it one of the best
movies ever and then you see it and it's just "kind of sort of okay"
Especially when the only thing I thought was good in the movie was the
special effects. I also enjoyed the special effects in the Transformers
series, but as we all know, those movies suck, and no amount of great
special effects will save a crap movie.Movie also shows the problems the MCU will be facing soon. Dr. Strange
is a D-list character at best. After they lose Iron Man, Cap, Hulk,
Widow, Thor, Nick Fury, and the other characters that the MCU was built
on, they'll only have Spider-man and a bunch of C and D-listers holding
their shared universe together.
