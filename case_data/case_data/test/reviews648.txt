Failed myth adaptation

Myths were created to help human build and understand the model of
surrounding world. 'The Killing of Sacred Deer' is too artistic to
bother. It builds a dent in reality in which a lower deity (surgeon)
accidentally kills father of a greater one. While making people believe
that the characters are somewhat real, it combines the mythical
sacrifice of Iphigenia with clich√© of train dilemma (kill 3 people by
inaction or pull a lever and decide who dies). Unfortunately the
setting is so artificial that the movie completely fails to deliver a
point and decides to abort any attempts of explanation leaving viewers
in a limbo. It's gripping, but completely dry upon closer examination. 'The Saw'
was more believable than TKoSD. Viewers can admire a glimpse of naked
Nicole Kidman for this suffering though!Acting: 7 Plot: 2 Production: 7
