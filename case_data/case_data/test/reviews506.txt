The book is much better

Some ***SPOILERS***Amazing visuals aside this was a poor movie. When will filmmakers
realise the MAIN reason the majority of people watch films is for a
story to be told and to relate to the characters involved - NOT to see
amazing visuals, as entertaining as they are! The story of Moses in the
Bible is rich, amazing and epic. Unfortunately the story in this film
is slow, lacks heart, but more importantly, completely betrays the
original "true" story. The scene where Moses kills an Egyptian was flat, empty and over before
you could blink. What should have been one of the biggest moments in
the movie to help understand Moses passion for his people, character,
disdain for Egypt (according to the movie he LOVED Egypt) and origins
ended in a flash. Moses showed zero remorse in what was more an act of
self defense over empathy. When you don't tell the whole truthful story the characters involved
are ultimately betrayed. The movie suffers from this particularly in
God's character. Ridley Scott seems determined to focus on the supposed
relationship between Moses and his supposed brother. But we never
really care about either of them or their relationship. Not to mention
the Bible never mentions this, in fact it implies that the Pharaoh at
the time of Moses return didn't even care about him or perhaps even
know him?Ridley Scott would have done well to concentrate on staying true to the
story and establishing a connection between the audience and the two
central characters: God and Moses. Unfortunately we end up with a movie
that is desperately trying to be epic in scale and visuals but somewhat
confusing in it's story and it's characters.
