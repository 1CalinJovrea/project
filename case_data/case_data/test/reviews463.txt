I liked it a lot!

"Warm Bodies" is a comedic, romantic, action-filled zombie flick. Being
a zombie movie, people do get chased, attacked, eaten by zombies but
since it is PG-13, it's not too graphic. Fun surprise: zombies aren't
the only creatures stalking humans in this movie.This movie opens with a wonderfully fun and clever introduction to the
zombie apocalypse as well as the main zombie character named R.
Nicholas Hoult's R is funny, loyal, curious, likable, protective,
charming. Definitely not a typical zombie. There are many scenes where
our zombie friend goes about his daily life, accompanied by hilarious
and clever voice overs. It's interesting how he questions everything,
thinks constantly, longs to connect. This opportunity arises when he
meets Julie, sparking a sort-of Romeo and Juliet type of relationship.
Julie is a resistance fighter whose dad (John Malcovich) leads the
humans. She is strong and brave yet vulnerable and sweet. The chemistry
between R and Julie is undeniable. I can honestly say that I cared what
happened to them.All the actors did a fantastic job. John Malkovich is great as always.
Dave Franco's character was quite tragic. Analeigh Tipton is wonderful
as Jule's best friend, providing some funny lines and support, though
it would have been nice to have more of her. A shout-out to Rob Corddry
is required as he has some of the best lines and is just fantastic as a
fellow zombie. (Definitely would be on my crew during the zombie
apocalypse)I absolutely recommend "Warm Bodies." It's fun, fast-paced, clever,
looks great, has interesting characters, action, some scares, romance.
Maybe see with a date or by yourself or a group of friends, up to you.
