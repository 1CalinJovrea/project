nasty piece even as it is low on blood or gore

A throwback to the eighties a time when children were abducted nothing
was done. You had to wait a few days until the police came into action
to find the lost ones. And that's what this flick shows but being a
horror it of course goes a bit further.Not that it becomes a gory flick full of rape and torture not a thing
about that but it isn't going to be a flick for the faint hearted or
people who get easily offended. Therefor you are too close with the
abducted girl. Even as the movie is rather slow it is that what makes
it a nasty flick. There's no gore and most of the things are insinuated
it still get's you by the throat.Not for all horror geeks out there but for me it's a nasty piece that
took me back to the time I grew up.Gore 0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5
