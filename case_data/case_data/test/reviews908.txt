The Accountant - review: Intellectual & Ferocious

Gavin O'Connor, the director of my favorite movie Warrior. Ben Affleck,
the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the
distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from
The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's
great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny
especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this
guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major
project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these
people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good
leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed
like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental
problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work
he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients
want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much
more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the
information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The
Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.The direction of this seems rather simple, but as the story progresses,
things become a bit too complicated, and maybe not for the better. I understood the main story and what was happening. The subplot of the
movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit
messy but yet still engaging.The acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan
Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is
both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but
Affleck steals the show.The violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have
felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people,
he kills people, and it's not pretty.There's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie
constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the
transitions are fluid.The execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent
jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.Each character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's
the coincidence that brings them all together.I think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it
succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot
about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their
situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business
with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K
Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.Overall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were
breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the
best performance of his career. Every actor played their part. This
movie suffers from sensory overload, but regardless, I believe that it
will stimulate not only intellectuals but white-knuckled action junkies
as well. The main plot, Ben Affleck, and the violence is ferocious.Final Grade: A-
