Not enough vengeance

For those who came in late, the Underworld series is all about the
eternal enmity between the non-human species of Vampires and Lycans,
the latter being an evolved race of werewolves. So far, we learned all
about the centuries of bloodshed, and the absolute necessity for the 2
groups never to reconcile.At the heart of the narrative is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who was once
the pride and joy of the Vampire army, till she fell in love with a
hybrid (part vampire part Lycan), and began to question the ethics of
her tribe.Underworld: Awakening begins with a new development in the world that
Selene and Michael inhabit. Thus far, the inferior human species has
remained unaware of the existence of the other species. Now that covens
and nests have been unearthed, paranoia strikes, and annihilation of
non-humans becomes military priority.Selene and Michael try to leave the area by boat, but both are captured
and frozen in a lab, for research. When Selene awakens, she manages to
flee from her prison, only to find that it is now 12 years later.
Lycans are almost extinct, there is a weapon that she has, and her
enemies want it for their evil purpose.This installment of the Underworld franchise has the flimsiest plot,
the least talented actors (except, of course, for Stephen Rea), and the
most unsatisfactory climax. In fact, this has to be the first movie of
the series that leaves loyalists not clamoring for more. The premise is
so incredulous (and not in a good way), that you will stop trying to
comprehend the sequence of events that leads Selene to the end of the
movie.To make up for the lack of a credible story, the makers decided to
intersperse every second conversation with visuals of ripped heads,
severed body parts and plenty of blood. The gore in the movie is not
only irrelevant, but also added for shock value, or so it seems.The icing on the cake is the presence of constantly flickering lights.
The lab has them, the parking lots have them, the corridors have them -
the civilized world does not seem to believe in proper lighting. What
the audience is left with is a semi-hypnotized sense of being after
sitting through all those lights.Kate Beckinsale goes through all the motions of being Selene with the
ease of a professional. She has done this to perfection before, but
this time, she seems complacent, and bored. To give her credit, she has
maintained her figure, and looks no different than the Selene who first
made an appearance almost a decade ago (in the first movie of the
series).The very talented Stephen Rea plays a villain of sorts in the movie. He
does look confused at times, as if he wonders why he signed the film.
There is no sign of effort from any other member of the cast.The music is more like stock music, and production value is
inconsequential (there's nothing in the film except walls and piers).
The fight sequences are not engrossing enough, and the spurting blood
and flying intestines are distracting.In short, the entire movie is a disappointment. If, however, you insist
on watching Underworld: Awakening, avoid the 3D version, and maybe your
headache will not be as bad.On a more positive note, there is always the hope that the next movie
will manage to regain the lost glory of the series.
