I made an account to write a review about this....

I was actually getting anxious to leave mid way through but tried to
toughen it out as i was with a friend that really wanted to watch this
movie. She later admitted it was probably the worst and most
predictable movie she's seen. I second the predictable nature of the
movie but was second to blues brothers 2000 for being coined "worst"
movie. Only reason i gave it a 1 was that there were a couple, or dare
i say maybe a few, funny parts. Save your money TRUST me.
