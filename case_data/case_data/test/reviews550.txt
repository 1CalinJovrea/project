Intricate tale of obsession and deceit

Set in Italy but filmed in English, "The Best Offer" is a highly
unusual and unusually interesting tale of two lost and hurting souls
reaching out to one another for meaning and salvation. Or at least
that's what it wants you to THINK it's about. What it's ACTUALLY about
may be something else again.A self-described "old man incapable of love," the allegorically named
Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush) has kept pretty much the entire world -
women included - at arm's-length for his entire life. He's a renowned,
if not entirely scrupulous, art appraiser and auctioneer who has his
entire mode of existence turned upside down when he meets a mysterious
young woman named Claire (Silvia Hoeks) who pleads with him to come
appraise the belongings in her home upon the death of her wealthy
parents. The problem is that Claire, who has been a recluse since the
age of 16, seems to be suffering from a severe case of Agoraphobia and
will speak with Virgil only through a wall in the house. Dismissive,
even irritated at first, Virgil soon becomes obsessed with the
faceless, disembodied voice that floats to him through the dusky halls
of a lonely villa.Virgil is so emotionally cut off from the world around him that,
despite the fact that he is physically able to come and go, he is just
as much a prisoner of his life as Claire is of her disease and of the
decaying mansion in which she's chosen to entomb herself. Is Claire the
unexpected someone who will finally provide that meaningful human
connection that Virgil has avoided all this time? Or is she merely the
vehicle through which he will finally be made to pay for the many
professional transgressions he's committed over the course of his
lifetime? Rush carries almost the entire weight of this film on his shoulders,
and he certainly shows he has the acting chops to see it through. Since
Hoeks is largely off-screen for large portions of the movie, her task
is a somewhat less arduous one, though her accomplishment is no less
impressive for that. Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland are also
effective in smaller, yet highly significant, roles in the drama.With a smart screenplay and lyrical direction by Giuseppe Tornatore,
"The Best Offer" is a haunting, mesmerizing film that draws you into
its world and keeps you guessing every step of the way till the big
reveal at the end.
