Beautiful

I haven't seen a movie like "Before we go" for a very long time. The
script, the story the characters everything is just so charming and
cute. I love that kind of "intimacy" on screen,it's intelligent and
honest. I'm with a smile on my face after the movie. I think this is
definitely not a commercial movie so if you need to see something
different but at the same time very close to you. That will be not a
waste of your time but a reason to questioning yourself and consume
things in a different wayVery true, gentle... great directing work, light and acting at the same
time Perfect place to chose New York City by night...applause to the
cast +crew. If you need to see something smart,depth and sensitive...
Enjoy:)
