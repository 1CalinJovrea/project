A different kind of review

I want to write a different kind of review for this movie because every
other bad review has already said most of what is so bad about it. My
two star rating is for Andy Serkis alone, who I think is a true artist
with everything he does!This review is a Spoiler from start to finish!Massive budget - check A reasonably good first movie of the franchise - check Andy Serkis - check Storyline - let's talk about that pointWriters sitting in a room to put together a "great storyline" for this
sequel:We are set only 10 years after "The Rise" so..."What are the basics we need"?"Apes""Good. What else"?"Humans.""Sure, but maybe a few less. Let's face it, the Apes have to have a
chance at fighting the humans. Say we kill off most humans on earth,
leaving just hundreds left in smaller groups...but how?""A virus! A virus that was a result of complicated genetic....""Perfect! A virus! And we can say it had something to do with the Apes
and so on! We need to keep it simple. Moving on. What else do we need?""A new nice guy...Oh, and maybe a couple of "actors" playing his
family""What happened to James Franco? Never mind...a new nice guy then. What
about more important things now like...we need a war. So, how do we
give the Apes a chance against the technologically advanced humans?
Should they be 'building' sophisticated weapons to challenge the
humans?""One option would definitely be to have the humans create a massive
arms depot and just have two idiots look after it. Oh, and maybe these
two idiots could also just spend their time drinking and shooting for
no reason. It would be easier to kill them off that way. This way the
Apes would have access to lots of guns, which they know how to use,
since...they are intelligent.""Awesome...but how do we explain the arms depot. Did I miss something
about zombies or others human enemies in the outline?"Nope, just the virus. The humans aren't really aware of the Apes
initially."Ok...arms depot it is.""How do we get things kicking off?""I'd say we need a human volatile and a monkey volatile.""Say no more...done""Anything else?"Explosions""I agree. That's it for today. We meet again next week to discuss the
next sequel. Thank you for taking time of your well deserved luxury
life style!"This is my first review of a movie. The enjoyment of writing this
review made up for the 2-hour agony of watching an appallingly bad
story line together with poor acting and terrible scripting. And most
of all - a negligence to explain anything to the audience.
