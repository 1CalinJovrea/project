what a masterpiece!

One of the best Mystery "suspense" thriller of all time!! Be it Acting,
screenplay, direction, background score, an amazing movie! The Body, a
really good thriller, and its mentioning as Hitchcock style is not too
far off. Its music was also akin to The Shining, but in the way that it
perfectly fit the scene.. Now since I won't go into depth about the
story, its only fair that I tell you that this movie really pays off in
the end, so don't write it off if some of it doesn't make sense.
Besides, watching √Ålex freak out at each clue is truly worth it all on
its own. What initially caught my eye about this film was the mention
Hitchcock-style psychological thriller. After watching the film I did
indeed feel as if I just say a Spanish version of a Hitchcock film.
