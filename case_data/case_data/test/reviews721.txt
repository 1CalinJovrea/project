An Understated And Beautiful Story of Two

In 1950s New York, a department-store clerk who dreams of a better life
falls for an older, married woman.Director Todd Haynes has created a film of subtle and undeniable
beauty. The set design is magnificent and builds a world that is
uniquely 1950s, the costume design contributes greatly to the overall
sense of time and place which can be hard to underscore in a period
piece but the crew of Carol has manage to pull it off effortlessly.
Todd Haynes direction is fluid and his camera lingers to capture the
full emotional content of each scene. The score by Carter Burwell adds
another layer of sincerity to this motion picture, and the
cinematography by Edward Lachman vividly illustrates the elegance of
the locations used.The performances are outstanding, the relationship between Rooney
Mara's "Therese Belivet" and Cate Blanchett's "Carol Aird" anchors the
film. Rooney Mara plays "Therese" with an underlying sense of innocence
that she herself knows more than anyone, she exclaims "I just say yes
to everything", Mara's physical embodiment of her character is
undeniable and everything you need to know about her motives can be
found in a glance or a stare. Blanchett is terrific as "Carol" and
there is a mysterious side to her character that begins to unveil as
the narrative progresses, her particular predicament is a major source
of pain in her life. Her relation with "Harge Aird" portrayed by Kyle
Chandler highlights this, as he becomes deeply dissatisfied with her
actions.It's the sequences were Mara and Blanchett share the screen that define
the brilliance of this film. There interactions are spellbinding from
there first unusual interaction at "Therese's" department store to
there affectionate conversations in "Carol's" car. To see how they
progress is fascinating and the way in which Haynes frames them apart
is superior direction. Its how we comprehend there relationship without
clich√© dialog, but mostly through facial expression that we get a sense
of how they feel for each other.The structure of the narrative itself was quite unexpected and I felt a
major satisfaction as the film began to conclude. Its also perfectly
paced with the exact amount of lingering to allow emotions to run wild.
Its simplistic narrative tells a deeper more wholesome story about
human connection and how it is viewed by society in the 1950's which
strangely parallels today.Overall, I found Carol to be quite beautiful, from its spectacular
production and costume design, fluid direction, mesmerizing
performances and incredible pacing this is a film where I personally
relished on those lingering moments that detail the emotions of the
characters. I am going to give Carol a 9.2/10.
