I like Your Style

Greetings again from the darkness. It's not unusual for an actor or
actress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes
those changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and
Christian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless
of the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the
performance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or
Gwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually
get two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning
performances.Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto each lost approximately 40 pounds
for their respective roles as Ron Woodroof, the redneck, three-way
loving, alcoholic, drug-addicted electrician/rodeo cowboy; and Rayon,
the sensitive, street-savvy, would-be transsexual so desperate for a
kind word. Their physical appearance will startle you more than once,
but is quite effective in getting across the struggles of those
infected with HIV virus in the 1980's. The numbers impacted exploded
and the medical profession was ill-equipped to properly treat the
patients.This is based on a true story and a real life guy (Woodroof) who became
a most unlikely beacon of hope for AIDS patients. Woodroof fought the
medical industry, Pharmaceutical companies and the government (FDA,
DEA, IRS). It's impossible to miss the message and accusations that
most of these had a single goal of increasing profits, rather than
curing the disease. And that's where the story lags a bit. Michael
O'Neill and Dennis O'Hare are the faces of greed and bureaucracy, while
Jennifer Garner, Leto, and Griffin Dunne represent the side with a
heart. Woodroof seems to be a guy who just doesn't want to die, sees a
business opportunity, and even learns a little bit about humanity along
the way.There have been numerous other projects that deal with AIDS, including:
Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and the recent documentary How to Survive a
Plague. This may be the first with a protagonist who is simply
unlikeable, despite his passion and strong survival instincts.
McConaughey doesn't shy away from the homophobic personality and cruel
manner of speech that Woodroof possesses. We never doubt his
frustration at those controlling the big picture, but we never really
see him connect with those his brash tactics help.McConaughey is on a dream run as an actor right now, and it certainly
wouldn't be surprising to see him garner an Oscar nomination. But it
would be a mistake to chalk that up to his losing so much weight - he
really delivers a character that we won't soon forget. And let's not
overlook Mr. Leto, who has been away from acting for 4 years touring
with his band. He is a remarkable talent and a true screen presence.
Compare this role to his Mark David Chapman in Chapter 27. It's not
just the range of weight, but moreso the range in acting that so
impresses.Also worth noting here is the outstanding cinematography of Yves
Belanger. This movie is shot in a way that brings out the intimacy of
the moments, while not losing the big picture. Director Jean-Marc
Vallee (The Young Victoria) and co-writers Craig Borten and Melisa
Wallack work together for a solid foundation, but it's McConaughey and
Leto that we will most remember ... and of course, the pics of the
great Marc Bolan on the wall. www.MovieReviewsFromTheDark.wordpress.com
