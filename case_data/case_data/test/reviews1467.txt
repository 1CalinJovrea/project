Eeeesh...

Oh... my... word...A girl wants to go where her dad won't let her, wants to do what her
dad won't let her. Hmm.. sound familiar? Little Mermaid, Aladdin,
Poca... Pocahontas, Mulan, Brave and just about every modern Disney.
Let's look at gender then Disney, seeing as you're OBSESSED with it:Male characters: Dad - scared, repressive, short-sighted, wrong.
Demi-God chap - selfish, conceited, vain, ineffective, emotionally
repressed, thief. Crab - as above (I'm assuming he's male). Coconut
Pirates - murderous but ineffectual (I'm assuming their male).Female characters: Moana - bright eyed, aspirational, quick learner,
visionary, empathetic, brave, strong, amazing, indefatigable,
indomitable, perceptive. Granny - as above plus supernaturally gifted.
Earth Goddess thingy - was only trying to kill people because the male
character had robbed her of her precious.Yawn. Increasingly Disney is working as a SJW - righting perceived
inbalances in society. They have obviously perceived a gender imbalance
biased towards males in society and have therefore produced their own
version of the world where the gender imbalance is biased heavily and
totally towards the females. Everything else in the film is nice .
