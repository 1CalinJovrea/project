Brilliant effort!

The place beyond the pines was a bold and magnificent effort by
filmmaker Derek Cianfrance.The movie is set with three major acts. The first focuses on Ryan
Gosling, a motorcycle stunt rider who turns to robbing banks to support
his new born child. This first act was executed with excellence.
Gosling's character is a joy to watch, the soundtrack is phenomenally
executed and the cinematography is so beautiful, not to mention
Gosling's partner in crime also manages to give an outstanding
performance.The second act focuses on Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a rookie cop
trying to move up the ranks with a family of his own. The second act
was also executed with utter brilliance. Cooper's acting was beyond
brilliant, his best yet in my opinion (including his recent Silver
Linings Playbook). Cooper deserves to be rewarded for his beyond
excellent portrayal of a good cop merely trying to fulfill his duties
in a corrupt police department trying to profit from proceeds of crime.
Cooper's conflict with the corrupt detective (Ray Liotta) is tension
filled and a joy to watch.The third act focuses on the son's of both Cooper and Gosling, who have
both grown up to become teenagers. This is by far the weakest act in
the movie in my opinion. Although I would rate this act as "good" of
itself, it simply felt like it detracted from the overall viewing
experience of the phenomenal first two acts. Although it seems the
overarching purpose of the movie was to demonstrate the impact
fatherhood (or lack of) has on kids, I felt that this last act was
simply unnecessary.The place beyond the pines was set to be an exceptional experience with
the first two acts if it was tied up there, but the attempt to install
the third act went too far. The attempt to demonstrate the impact
fatherhood (or lack of) has on kids felt too rushed for it to have
sufficient impact on me. The first two acts of themselves were
extraordinary and the movie should have been left there! It didn't need
to be stretched out to achieve some extended purpose sought out by the
director.Nevertheless, what we have are two excellent acts and one good one,
which, in my opinion, would equate the movie to a "very good" viewing
experience (as opposed to "excellent", "extraordinary" or "top of the
range").In my final opinion, I would highly recommend this movie for the first
two acts alone.PS I might also add that the introduction of Cooper's cop character
Avery has to be one of the best introductions ever! It was so subtle
and realistic. I loved it!
