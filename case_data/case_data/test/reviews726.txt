It's called entertainment people

This is the first review I've ever written ever. I don't subscribe to
movie reviews--at all. I actually enjoy movies. It seems to me that by
in large reviewers just don't like movies. Not the intelligent
reviewers anyway. They seem to be more concerned with how they look to
their readers, pretending they know something about film. Reviewers are
writers who want to be something else, filmmakers perhaps, and find it
incredibly trendy and smart to disassemble and deconstruct the hard
work of others; and to hate entertainment. They all seem to have this
idea that they know better and I have little time for their self
righteous, self important, pretentious bullshit thinly disguised as
some sort of public service. Heads up: it does no one a service to be
condescending or insulting. With that said I will now step off of MY self righteous soap box and
say that White House Down is a damned good time time with excellent
shots of DC (making it look like an attractive, interesting place to be
as opposed to the hot and smelly dumpster it actually is...seriously,
the place smells like a dumpster), in your face action, fine
performances-- Jamie Foxx is pretty cool as the leader of the free
world--a bad guy who you just can't wait to watch die (there are
several bad guys in this movie, so I'm not counting that as a spoiler),
and pretty awesome hero in John Kale.Now the movie gets a little long which is only an issue if you're a
smoker like me, by the middle of the third act I was craving pretty
hard, and there's some dumb lines of dialogue during one of the action
sequences that didn't seem to fit the characters, but whatever.White House Down is a fun and intense action movie that I would gladly
see again. 8 out of 10!
