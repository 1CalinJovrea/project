Bad, cheesy and heavily prejudiced.

Why does the Irish Film Board finance such a biased movie? Protestant
Rose is the woman every man wants, even the catholic priest! And the
Catholics are all savages who commit atrocious crimes that go
unpunished. Rooney is absolutely forgettable, and for me it's got one
of the saddest ugliest soundtracks I've ever heard. And why are all the
actors faking the accent, are there no good actors in Ireland? I
watched till the end even though the plot was appalling, just because I
love Ireland. The only plus side to this movie is that it is a reminder
of how much has already been accomplished as to the troubles and the
hatred in between the two groups. May we continue to make life on earth
better.
