Unapologetically gruesome, authentic horror

This came up suggested to me on Netflix last night and I really like
Kurt Russell (who doesn't' right?) and Patrick Wilson from the
Insidious films and of course The Conjuring so I gave it a go. I
certainly wasn't disappointed. I had heard it was very long that there
was a very long set up etc but that didn't discourage me. Simply put it
is fantastic which is rare to say of a Hollywood horror film these
days. Highly suspenseful and gut wrenching stuff! It's worth every bit
of the prolonged set up. I've seen hundreds of horror movies all my
life and I found the gore in this borderline unwatchable. If you are a
horror fan this is a MUST SEE film! Easily the best horror film Kurt
Russell has done since John Carpenter's The Thing in 1982. This film is
darker than The Thing though I would say. The film is dripping in
foreboding tension and atmosphere. Very long but so worth it. Don't
miss this classic horror film!
