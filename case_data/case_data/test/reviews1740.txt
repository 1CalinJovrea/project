Feels like a bad version of Die Hard 2 in Space...

Pros - slick - seems that non-trekkie, non-scifi lovers love it -
visually grand - great music - nice homages to the Original SeriesCons - Too many absurd plot holes. - the storyline is really
over-dramatised/over-done and lazy. - action scenes too fast and so far
beyond the laws of physics its ridiculous.Before you shoot me down, just listen. I love good Science Fiction. I
love good storytelling. Action in Sci Fi is OK if it serves a good
purpose.But bang crash, run for kilometres and never get puffed out, ignore the
Prime Directive, freeze a volcano, get demoted, get repromoted, ooh
there's a bad admiral in star fleet (Star Trek VI) blow up, smash, do
the Millennium-Falcon-sideways-to-escape-the badies, die and come back
to life using super-human blood (Battlestar Galactica), jump 30meters
and don't brake an ankle...A great SciFi movie can get away with a few things that are beyond
reality IF there's enough good story telling/acting/drama to help you
make that leap. Christopher Nolan does that for me. The story of Batman
makes no-sense logically, but through the carefully structured drama I
can make that leap-of-faith. In this movie I can't.Khan - brilliantly played and nicely developed and the backstory
cleverly brought this character into the Abrams universe.But the rest just felt like Die Hard in the 23rd Century.
