Emotionally manipulative to the point of being offensive and some of the worst acting I've ever seen

"Act of Valor" proves that soldiers aren't actors and that if you're
going to make a movie out of a gimmick you should ensure that someone
has the common sense to stop the project before it becomes a colossal
waste of time. I can't go into the premise of this movie without
informing you of the biggest flaw of the movie: the stunts and
characters of this film are performed by actual active duty Navy SEALS.
That means the lingo, tactics and stunts here are real. Too bad none of
these guys can act and the story is so paint-by-numbers that it becomes
dreadfully dull.The film opens with a terrorist named Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle) blowing
up dozens of children and a U.S. ambassador using an ice-cream truck
filled with explosives. Oooooh! I hate him already! In Costa Rica, a
CIA operative who has been gathering evidence against Shabal's
associate, Christo Toykovich (Alex Veadov) is kidnapped by his
drug-dealing militia. That's when we meet our heroes (and by meet I
mean they appear on screen and a box containing their stats appears
next to their faces). The two main characters are Lieutenant Rorke
(Rorke Denver), who informs us that his wife is pregnant with his first
child (odds of living through this movie are low!), and Chief Dave
(credited as SOC Dave in the credits). The SEALS learn of a most
sinister terrorist plot against the greatest country in the history of
time and space: the United States of America! The most infuriating
thing about this movie is that I know there are going to be tons of
people out that that will be suckered into loving this cliché-ridden
snooze-fest. It's because the movie pulls every trick in the book to
trick you into thinking you like this movie. Take Lieutenant Rorke for
example. It's not enough that he's a hero, literally; he has a
beautiful wife waiting for him at home and she's pregnant. On top of
that, his father died saving other soldiers and he now carries that
man's flag with him on every mission. I half expected Rorke to tell us
that he was retiring after this last mission and that he hoped to
reconcile with his son whom he hadn't seen in ten years and the
villains to be gay child molesters on top of terrorists and drug
dealers.The cliché storm is not limited to our heroes, this film goes out of
its way to throw in cardboard cutouts for our heroes to fight in the
form of Generic Brand Bad Guys. We get maybe one antagonist that gets
the slightest bit of character development, the rest are
run-of-the-mill baddies, ranging from terrorists to cartel members that
are just there to be gunned down by our heroes. The film, knowing fully
well that it has no real emotional impact whatsoever (except maybe if
you are yourself a Navy SEAL or you went through some kind of war)
tries to get around this by dedicating the film to "... warriors of the
Naval Special Warfare who have made the ultimate sacrifice since 9/11"
and then by listing all of the names of the men and women who have been
killed. I'm up for respecting people who have given up their lives as
much as the next person (despite not being a red-blooded,
baseball-loving resident of America, the beautiful), but notice how
this text comes before the end credits, ensuring that unless you walk
out early you will feel compelled to sit down and read it. The movie
then goes on to play a sad song about giving your life ("For You", by
Keith Urban) while images of smiling children, people holding hands,
soldiers and civil officers scroll.To the people who thought this movie was emotionally effective, I say
that had you not seen those last ten minutes (which have no bearing on
the story whatsoever by the way) you would not have liked this movie
nearly as much as you claim to. Even if you tried to avoid this montage
of emoooootion, the movie would still get a leg-up on you by concluding
itself with a sad reading of "Live Your Life" by Tecumseh.To give the movie credit, the action sequences are well done in terms
of pyrotechnics, intensity, realism and special effects. It's enough to
jolt you awake in what is unfortunately a dull action movie populated
with wooden "actors", incoherent lingo and an ultra-patriotic tone that
tries so hard to get you riled up it becomes a little bit offensive.
This was headed pretty quickly for a straight 0 / 5 for me, but thanks
to the combat sequences it earns itself a 1 / 5. It's a terrible movie
that I can only "recommend" if you are yourself an active Navy SEAL,
you haven't seen a movie in so long you can't remember what acting is
like and you are not able to access any war/shooter video game movies.
