Frogmen aren't superman  but there can be only one

Awful. However I enjoy war films that make an impact, showing war for
what it is. This film was miles off that mark. Making comedy to please
the arena. Rather then actually paying the proper tribute to the fallen
with their acts of courage, bravery and valour. There were absolutely
no combat tactic's of any real battle significance shown as
established.This film was a machine-gun'slasher, in it Rambo meets Sparta. The
frogmen aka sniper-ninja's. Try to fly off of mountainsides a few
separate times. Headbutting granite, smacking their necks, backs, limbs
into tree's and rocks. When being riddled with .45 calibre rounds from
enemy Ak47's. The enemy who engage with superior numbers, die
overwhelmingly to single shot kill guns. Even when having many RPG's
but not grenades. After the insurgents claim the elevated positions,
they can not really create any shrapnel explosions of any kind, even
when the frogmen are but a few yards below. The Talibunnies die in
numbers to the holy hand grenade, in this propagated comically attempt
at heroism. The scenery shown was within a lush forest. I am wondering
what part of Afghanistan that region is? Perhaps bordered with Pakistan
wouldn't response EVAC been more timely, if being backed by air support
or drones? Would the insurgents not have planted IED's and mines where
the radius for optics on their stronghold was in location. Despite of
arming their goats with cell phones? Alas the frogman's tale is spun on
the title, once being peppered with so many bullet holes they
eventually. Well....Action film's could be made with realism when showing specific war
events in honour of those that have fallen. Or they are turned into
fiction. This is Sparta, NO, not at all..
