An "Electrifying" Tale Of A Boy and His Dog.... Arf! Arf! Arf!

With its cute, yet, decidedly creepy-looking characters, and all, I
thought that Frankenweenie was a pretty darn good "Mad Scientist" story
that's sure to be a hit with audiences of all ages.Containing some very nice touches of warped humor, grotesque horror and
several arousing moments of pathos (cleverly injected into its weird,
but oddly wonderful, little tale), Frankenweenie has proved, once
again, that director Tim Burton still has the master's touch when it
comes to making stop-motion, animated films that seem to emerge from
the very depths of the dark-side.If nothing else, Frankenweenie certainly turned out to be a
lovingly-charged homage to a variety of classic horror, monster, and
Sci-Fi pictures from those glorious days of yesteryear.All-in-all, Frankenweenie certainly had its share of flaws, but, just
the same, I certainly hadn't expected to enjoy this film as much as I
did.Appropriately filmed in b&w, thank goodness that it didn't contain any
musical numbers.
