Best Comedy so far of 2012

So if you like Jonah Hill and comedies with really great cameo
appearances, I think you would definitely like this film.I must admit I expected this to be at the same standard as maybe The
Change-Up or The Hangover Part II which weren't terrible movies, but
they weren't the funniest movies I have seen either. This movie is more
on par with The Hangover (the first installment), Superbad and
Anchorman.The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and
it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or
"rom" setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is
generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and
slapstick. There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected
and there were some scenes were I couldn't even control my laughter in
a full cinema.All in all, I'm not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I
would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill's ridiculous
dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations
of it being anything like the original TV show, I would definitely
recommend this one! Best comedy film I've seen at the cinema in 2012.
