An absolute waste of time

I know the first movie is considered as more of a popcorn flick, but I
loved it. I've lost count of the number of times I've watched the first
movie. Needless to say, I was incredibly hyped about the sequel.This was the first movie that I ever wanted to walk out on about
halfway into the movie. The whole thing is such a rip off of the
original, that it's incredibly cringeworthy. The dialogue is laughable
and there are a bunch of characters that no one cares about. To be
honest, I couldn't even understand the whole story. It was so messed up
and they kept trying to re-create scenes from the original movie like
those epic speeches(every one of them failed) and trying to fly out of
closing enclosures, aliens speaking from a human etc.. Can someone tell what the whole point of the school bus story was? I
had no idea why they kept going with it apart from the fact that it was
Jeff Goldblum's dad.Overall, this movie is absolute shambles and save some bucks for
yourself. It's not worth watching in theatres at all.
