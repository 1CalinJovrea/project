Canned garbage -- Are the Writers Laughing at us?

The only redeeming part of this film is that it allows you to think
about how fun the first movie was. Two possible theories for why it is so bad:1. they found a group of high school drama students with no creativity
to write the screenplay, and all they had was a list of generic plot
and character devices to use for ideas.2. the writers purposely wrote in all the canned, tear jerking, feel
good plot/character plays they could as a contest to see how good
ratings they could get for something they whipped off in an afternoon
and knew was garbage.Just horrific if you are looking for anything remotely creative or
interesting. If this had been the first movie, their would not be a
sequel, and, hopefully -- they'll give up now
