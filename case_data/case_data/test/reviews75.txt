Unfortunately Taken!

I was unfortunately taken to see the movie, hoping the directors (art
director, etc) would have done a better job since Midnight Express. The
scenario is full of awkward, hard to be believe events like Kim bombing
the whole covered bazaar area which is like one of the most crowded
parts of the city. While she is doing that, the dad is kept by the
kidnappers who were stupid enough to leave him alone for hours and let
him speak on the phone. He escapes from the place just like that, and
then is followed by Turkish police cars from 1970s. Kim who was not
able to drive automatic car in US, right away makes all these car moves
driving a stick Taxi in the most narrowed streets. I also have to
mention that all the women appeared in the movie were dressed in black
veils- I don't know why, someone should explain that, also Turkey does
not have a border with Albenia. The list goes on, but I don't think its
worth to spend money or time.
