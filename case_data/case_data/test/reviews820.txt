A disjointed sorry mess that's going nowhere

This movie is truly the most awful movie I seen for the past year or
so. Complete and utter disjointed mess that's going nowhere. I am not
even sure what I am watching, characters just do whatever that doesn't
seem to contribute anything to the plot in any way.I am not even sure what category this sorry mess of film is under - is
it comedy? Because I sure as hell wasn't laughing. Is it drama? There
isn't any dramatic moment - every time it seems something is build up
to something they cut the scene and viewers are forced to forget about
everything. There is no tension in the movie.All in all, just a sorry mess. 1/10
