She sew them all

This movie is like a patchwork, little by little you get the whole
picture, a really fine piece of work, Kate Winslet is great, Judy Davis
simply brilliant, not to mention Hugo Weaving's performance,
outstanding, I enjoyed every minute, never underestimate a woman,
revenge is a dish best served cold, well in this particular case,
sewed, you don't get it at the beginning, why is she dressed like this
and what is she doing in such a forsaken place, not wanted at all,
starting by her mother, than the battle begins, with a sewing machine
(a Singer), determination and a lot of talent, a few golf club's, and
the whole place is headlong, word for word, fasten your seat belt, this
is going to be one kind of a ride
