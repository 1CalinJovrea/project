Worst Film I've Seen in a Long, Long Time

O.M.Ghost! This was the WORST film I've seen in a long, _long_ time!It was so bad we were giggling and cracking jokes during it (we were in
an empty theatre that nightunaware of what audiences may have already
known). I'm never one of those rude people who talks during a film, but
we didn't know how to survive without a little humorous banter. Most frequently uttered phrase that allowed small laugh related
releases: "He's a very patient ghost."{SPOILERwell, actually, "RESCUER" Alert since you should avoid seeing
this film!}During the long, _long_ scenes where NOTHING happens, we began
suggesting that Casey Affleck probably had a stand-in for this "art
film" since he was covered in a sheet 95% of the time. Apparently,
Kesha (Jerry Seinfeld's pal) plays the only other ghost in the film,
but she too is covered with a sheet (with a floral pattern, so we know
she's female) so who's to know who's under there? This whole film feels horribly self indulgent and pretentious. It
presents like an undergrad film school project where the student film
maker has just studied Andy Warhol, Kurosawa, or a Jarmusch film
backwards or something. The movie is littered with bad 4-5 minute scenes when _nothing_
happens. Nothing. The ghost just stands there. Okay. I get it. He says
nothing, stands there for an interminable amount of time and we get to
project our own thoughts and feelings on him. Done. Understood. Can we
please move on now?We get to watch Rooney Mara eat an entire pie in one long shot that
eats up 5 minutes of screen time, while her dead husband, the ghost,
just stands there, unmoving, and watches the whole thing through a the
sheet. I guess that's her actor moment when she really "commits to the
part." After a couple minutes, it pulled us out of the film as we began
to wonder about the actress and not the character she was playing with
a blank face to match her ghost's. Does she throw up for real in the
background?...Honestly, I feel like I'm living in Bizarro world when I read summary
snippets like this one at Rotten Tomatoes:"A passionate young couple, unexpectedly separated by a shocking loss,
discover an eternal connection and a love that is infinite."WHAT?!. "Passionate?!" Where the hell was passion in this film? Even
the 4-5 minute kissing and cuddling scene in the beginning was sterile,
like an unthawed Ingmar Bergman homage. I love kissing and cuddling. We
were bored out of our minds watching _nothing_ transpire between the
two leads before Casey dies and turns into a ghost with that famously
easy Halloween costume. Certainly didn't see "love." Plenty of "eternal." THAT's a promise the film delivers on! It's an
experience in mind numbing eternity. You'll feel older leaving the
theater.And with all of this "undying love," why does Affleck's ghost offer
zero comfort to his grieving wife? There's only one moment where he
reaches out with sheet to touch her hand. The rest of the time he
stands in the corner like a sad boy in 2nd Grade, shamed for some
misbehavior. We see him get angry and flash the lights when she brings a new man
back home. She finally moves out, and for reasons that are never clear,
Affleck's ghost terrorizes a single-parented Latino family who buys the
home. We're supposed to to assume he's frustrated or confused or sad
because Rooney left? But he does so by hurling dishes against the wall
in front of little kids and their Mom as they try to eat dinner.
Assumedly it's to answer that questions that haunts us all, "Why do
ghosts throw things?" Yeahhhhhh. Right.While Lowery's tale may be a horribly misplaced homage to foreign
cinema or film school, it really felt like it robbed us of a couple
hours we'll never get back. Why does it not surprise me it was made
with only $100k? It could have been an interesting, half hour episode
of "Black Mirror." There are some good shots of the ghost standing alone amidst rubble,
and the strange flipping forward and backward in time to suggest a
loop. There are even a couple of dry humorous moments when the
absurdity of the white sheeted ghost just tickles. Sadly, these moments
extend another 3-4 minutes too long, grinding all of the possible humor
out of the moment like stereotypical Germans editing comedy.There are even 2 Affleck ghosts at the end of the film as if to suggest
this time loop might keep creating ghosts for every one that finally
translates into the beyond? Okay, that's interesting. There's the
endless attempt to get the piece of paper that Rooney leaves for him in
the door jam, but we never see what she wrote. Oh, I. get. it. WE are
supposed to write whatever we think she wrote there! "Hey, I'm okay. You can go now." Can WE go now? ALL of this could have been done in 30-45 minutes. It
feels horribly narcissistic and pretentious to expect an audience to
sit through this unceasing indulgence. I have no idea what happened at
Sundance when this screened, but it may be one of the rare downsides of
legal weed. The anti-entertainment critics were in full force when they
rated this film.I give it TWO, no _FOUR_ THUMBS DOWN.You've been forewarned. Please ignore the high Rotten Tomatoes rating. Something failed in the
ratings system because when you read some of the "positive" reviews,
they list these problems too. Perhaps it too reminded them fondly of
film school?He's a very patient ghostit's unlikely audiences will be.Zzzzz.......
