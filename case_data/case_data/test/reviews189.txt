Honestly, the WORST film I have ever seen !!

I have read the books that this film is based on quite a few times and
absolutely love them. They are brilliant !! When I heard there was
going to be a film, I was ecstatic !! When I watched the trailer I was
slightly let down, but thought maybe it was just a bad trailer as
trailers don't always give the best first impression. When I saw the
film?? Well, I was COMPLETELY let down !! The trailer was a true
representation of the film to come !! The characters didn't have the
right personalities and they cast the completely wrong people, they did
not match the books descriptions !! All the Moroi seemed to have
British accents which confused me as they don't in the books and
Dimitri was too short !! I'm disappointed in this film and really wish
I hadn't seen it !!
