A Smart Suspenseful Crime Drama to Start the Fall Season Off Right

The Drop (2014) is the latest screen adaptation of Dennis Lehane's
writings (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island), and is
directed by the relatively unknown (though hopefully not for long)
Michaël R. Roskam. Knowing very little about this movie beforehand, the
one thing I was gambling on was its cast; a gamble that thoroughly paid
off I might add. Tom Hardy (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises), Noomi
Rapace (Prometheus, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), and everybody's
favorite soprano James Gandolfini star in this gritty crime-drama that
reminds us all that you don't mess with people's bars. We the audience find ourselves in the chilly streets of Brooklyn once
again and in that most sacred of places - the local bar. Tended by the
mild mannered, possibly slow witted bartender Bob Something- or- other
(Hardy), this bar, like all good bars, has its frequent patrons that
pile in night after night, raising a glass to a dead friend's
anniversary or simply watching the game. The bar itself, named for
Gandolfini's character "Cousin Marv", just happens to be the setting
for an elaborate money drop off system (hence the title) and is
frequented by the Chechen Mobster owners that cousin Marv is constantly
trying to appease (having apparently lost ownership of his namesake in
the not too distant past).Naturally the conflict arises that, since the bar is occasionally home
to large sums of money, some folks inevitably want to hold up the
joint. Eventually things go south as the Chechens aren't too happy to
have their money stolen and what follows is an incredibly intricate,
but unassuming narrative. Noomi Rapace plays the fragile love interest
and Tony Soprano playswellthe small time crook that pines for the
respect he had in the glory days. While I don't want to cheapen the roles of Gandolfini or Rapace in this
film (as they both are extremely important in driving the film to its
crescendo), Hardy stands out for his performance as the unassuming Bob
the Bartender. One thing that I love about the actor in his films is
that he easily adapts and manifests himself into his characters -
seamlessly adopting accents, quirks, etc. (I'm thinking Bronson not
Bane). It was disarming to me to follow his story, ever-waiting for a
massive plot twist to signal his call to action, only to have it
continue on at its pre-established rate of reveal.Therein lies the beauty of this movie, as it never departs from its
inconspicuous tone until, much like the ambiguous quote at the end, you
never see it coming. Like putting a puzzle together without looking at
the box, you gradually see characters, conflicts, and resolutions weave
together and develop over time. Having seen Lehane's other work Gone
baby Gone (2007) not too long ago, I found The Drop to be just as
refreshing albeit with a much simpler, linear buildup. One device the director uses particularly well in this film is slightly
off focus scenes with relevant characters or items of interest often
pushed in the background. These shots work nicely with the eerie
accompanying score to really drive home the apprehension that at any
moment someone is just going to get shot in the face or worse.It goes without saying that I'm always going to recommend a movie like
this simply because it has so many things that work in its favor. It
has a quality cast including an exceptional performance from Hardy as
Bob the Bartender, a rewarding narrative, and if nothing else  an
adorable puppy named Rocco. The romance subplot initially seems
distracting, but ultimately ties in nicely as does the religious
underpinnings on morality. The Drop is definitely worth it to see it in
theatres and it's not terribly violent or profane for a rated R movie.Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website
