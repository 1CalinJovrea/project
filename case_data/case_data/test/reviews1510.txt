"An awful movie had great potential but could not deliver up to the mark"

Summary (no spoilers)This movie is based on a true story which happened on April 1980. Some
armed gunmen rushed into the Iranian embassy in princess gate, London
and took everyone inside hostage. Over the following six days a nail
biting standoff took place, meanwhile a group of highly trained
soldiers from SAS prepared for a raid the world was yet to see.My Review (no spoilers)I cannot blame the plot since it's a true story but they could have
made the standoff a little more interesting instead it turned out to be
so boring. Guy's u need to just fast forward the movie towards the last
ten minutes to see some action otherwise it's all just talking and
topics which are not even related to the incident. I did not come upon
anyone with any kind of good acting in this movie. They made this
incident into a joke. People tune into to watch what actually happened
and they end up saying "that's it", "that was not so bad" when we all
know how bad a hostage situation is. My RecommendationNo this made me sleep towards the half of the movie.My Rating0/10
