Review: Dallas Buyers Club

Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010, 

Matthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked 

well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of 

romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996, 

McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To 

Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like, 

critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.



In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer, 

a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some 

of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in 

what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent 

memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be 

casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.



While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time 

span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of 

McConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and 

proud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like 

himself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction 

Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in 

heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient 

Ron Woodruff.



For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally 

well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron 

Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money 

throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling, 

chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and 

his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't 

until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized, 

giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives 

of many others.



Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty 

day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his 

hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested 

medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug 

Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of 

AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United 

States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a 

close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the 

ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced 

doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral 

treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic 

money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the 

realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working. 

Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the 

two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for 

paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the 

FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks 

to Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic, 

homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his 

opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual 

discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s.



Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors 

physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic 

forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty 

amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon. 

Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and 

grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The 

Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical 

spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a 

candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal 

struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the 

United States in the 1980′s.



Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and 

edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for 

wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic. 

Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to 

be a part of.



Although the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at 

this year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a 

clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their 

is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon. 

His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a 

large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's 

dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will 

surely be rewarded.



Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting 

effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of 

the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park 

living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not 

AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government 

fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful 

companies is wealth, or health.



Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic 

based on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate 

condition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires 

others. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the 

powerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled 

in his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto 

ride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized, 

passionate display of what it's like to die "with your boots on"; 

dirty, gritty and with a fighting chance.
