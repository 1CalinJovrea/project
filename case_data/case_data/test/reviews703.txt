A real piece of crap. How has this got a rating of 6.7?

The killer who is in the house already once and steals the phone
decides to leave the house to send pictures and then stays outside
until he is seen and then gets locked out. Now it seems he can smash a
car window made of tempered glass but does not seem bright enough to
break the house windows to gain access. The male neighbour who see's
the writing on the door glass but seems clueless and puts his hands up
because a stranger with no uniform or gun dressed in a hoodie shines a
flashlight at him. No attempt to even make it realistic in any way. The
woman keeps thinking about leaving the house but because the killer
makes no attempt to break in she is safer to stay put and wait him out.
So the whole movie is just totally implausible.
