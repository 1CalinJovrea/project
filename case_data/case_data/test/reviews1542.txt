The Final Episode of a Historic Trilogy

I just got home from a pre-screening of this movie (guess it pays to
know people with connections to local movie theaters) and decided I
would throw up a review. *please note I am not a professional critic of
any kind and this is my first review* First off let me say that I am a
19 year old college student who has loved the past couple of Hangover
movies (the first much more than the second, though). Right off the bat
I noticed that the third installment of the series, though filled with
awkward moments and hilarious one liners, has much more of an actual
plot than the previous two seemed to have. It revolves around a drug
dealer/business man who is hunting down Chow (who did a spectacular job
in his role as always) to get back 21 million dollars in gold that Chow
has stolen from him. The drug dealer kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill
him if the rest of the wolfpack are unable to bring Chow (who is in
hiding) back to him in three days.The crew worked well together and the movie, though still fresh in my
head, was very enjoyable. I wouldn't go out to say it's the best
Hangover of them all, but I also wouldn't say it was the worst. Full of
moments, hilariously awkward scenes, and Zach Galifianakis, this
Hangover gets a 8/10 rating from me.It's a movie you're going to want to go see, and a movie you won't mind
spending a few bucks on. If you're easily offended, you'll hate this
movie (even I thought they pushed the limit on a few of their jokes in
this one, but hey, it's an adult comedy). I thought the near 2 hour run
time felt much shorter and I thought the acting was great. Though I
didn't have to pay to see it this time, I'd fork out 10 bucks to see it
again with friends. It'll definitely be another movie that you'll be
quoting the one-liners for quite a while.
