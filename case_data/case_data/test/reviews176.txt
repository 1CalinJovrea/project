Dumb and dumber against a blind man

A rating higher than 2 for a film like this one either means that a) The average IQ of the population dropped below 70 b) The review are
fake or submitted by family members of the people involved with this
piece of junk.In which planet, dimension, galaxy three healthy individuals are
overpowered by one blind guy?And the girl in the basement subplot was an imbecilic attempt of
padding the film with extra violence porn. The whole film is a succession of stupider and stupider decisions by
the main protagonists, that is all there is to it.It is disappointing to realize what passes as entertainment these
days...
