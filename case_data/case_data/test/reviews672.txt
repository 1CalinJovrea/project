Not the worst Halloween movie ever, but...

Let's get right to it- this movie is OK at best. If you are very
forgiving when it comes to bad special effects, mediocre acting, and
not-so-clever nods (rip offs) to other horror movies (Halloween, Friday
the 13th, The Exorcist, for starters...), then you will probably be
entertained. It's not the worst, but I had hoped for a little bit
better, a specially with some of the names attached. It has the feel of
some of those straight-to- video horror movies of the 80's, so, if
that's your thing, try this one out. I watched this on pay per view, so
now I'm feeling a sense of loss (the 5.99 I paid to watch this flick).
To summarize: if you don't have anything to do, you're easily
entertained, and you are not a horror snob, this movie will probably be
watchable.
