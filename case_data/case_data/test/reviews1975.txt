Not Nearly As Involving As Needed... & Certainly Slow

I think a lot of folks will like this movie. I think many more won't go
out of their way to. This isn't to say it is not a watchable movie as
it certainly is. What it requires is a lot of patience as it evolves
slower than paint drying. It feels, on purpose, claustrophobic as per
the situation the main characters have found themselves in. It's dark
and depressing for the most part.This is Arnold Schwarzeneegger like you've rarely, if ever, seen. He is
in a dramatic role that, although has a little action, is the polar
opposite of his usual shtick. I'd say he is good enough that he maybe
ought to move in this direction more since 60+ action heroes have got
to be a shrinking market any way you cut it. And, the girl who plays
his doomed daughter brings a somber combination of humanity and
suffering to a good level indeed.Its the pace and the story that really didn't reel me in. I'm not
immature, but I just couldn't invest enough in the story to wade
through what felt like visual and mental molasses. I didn't finish it I
readily admit as I lost that degree of interest. In fairness I heard an
opinion by Dave Schrader on DarknessRadio that he felt it had some kind
of good, or interesting, ending. I don't know...and am just not
interested in this one enough to revisit it. Everyone is uniquely
different and if you long for a very humanized zombie drama devoid of
the usual head exploding action, and don't mind something slower than
Heinz ketchup, check it out, At least you see Arnold can actually act
outside of blowing up stuff and knocking people through walls.
