Okja, a whole new look on livestock

I have never cried so much, after watching Okja it really opened my
eyes to what really happens to livestock in the world. If you are an
animal lover i suggest you watch this. If you want to know the reason
why a lot of people are vegan you should watch this. After watching
this I decided to cut back on meat slowly until i completely cut it
off. It's an inspiration, thank you so much to the creators.
