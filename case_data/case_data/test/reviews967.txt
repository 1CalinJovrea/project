I enjoyed it more than the book.

I am in shock at how well this movie was made. Stephen King and Mike
Flanagan are absolute geniuses and should team up more often. I enjoyed
the book, but this movie exceeded my expectations. Gerald's Game
legitimately terrified me. Don't think twice about watching this, just.
watch. it. Make sure you can handle gore as well.
