"Gerald's Game"- A fascinating and gripping tale of suspense that takes hold and never lets go despite a shaky and questionable finale...

From the mind of Stephen King and director Mike Flanagan comes
"Gerald's Game", a Netflix original movie based upon King's novel that
takes a simple and elegant premise and successfully uses it weave a
tale of suspense that is among the year's most impressive of surprise
treats. And though it might not quite reach the great heights attained
by the best adaptations of King's work, Flanagan's fierce and stunning
portrayal of a woman pushed to the brink of insanity in a desperate bid
for survival is a slick and very satisfying adaptation. And it stands
tall and proud among the catalog of films and franchises that Netflix
has launched over the past five years.Jessie (Carla Gugino) and Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) are a well-off
couple whose marriage has taken a decidedly bad turn, and who are
seeking a way to spice-up their life and reconnect a bit. At the
suggestion of Gerald, the couple decide to try something new in the
bedroom to add some flair to their love-life... bondage and role-
playing. Though initially open and allowing herself to be handcuffed to
their bed, Jessie soon becomes agitated by her husband's increasingly
violent kink, resulting in an argument and Gerald's accidental death
from a heart-attack. Now trapped with her dead husband's body and a
hungry neighborhood dog who wandered in through an open door, Jessie
realizes that she won't be able to get any help, and must do whatever
she can to try and escape from her imprisonment. All the while, her
mental state increasingly deteriorates from stress and she begins to
have flashbacks to her troubled past...At its core, "Gerald's Game" is a deceptively complex story that was
for many years considered "unfilmable" due to its shockingly minimalist
plot and lack of characters or settings, and yet, here we are. And it
is indeed surprising how director Flanagan is able to make the movie
not only work, but thoroughly excel with clever structuring and
top-notch performances. It's a film that takes place almost entirely
within a single room outside of a few key sequences and flashbacks, and
yet it never feels dull nor does it fall into tedium. Flanagan wisely
allows us to really get into Jessie's mind, and also adds plenty of
entertainment value in seeing her work out potential solutions to her
problem. The film also cleverly allows dialog and character development
to occur thanks to a rather brilliant device- having Jessie "talk" to
hallucinations of different characters and people from her life
including her deceased husband and abusive father (Henry Thomas), who
all represent various pieces of her memory and her mental state. Its an
invaluable storytelling tactic that pays off wonderfully, and feels
like an organic piece of the puzzle.Gugino absolutely steals the film with a career-defining performance as
Jessie, and I would not be surprised in the slightest to see her
getting some serious nods in the upcoming awards season. Though I've
been a fan of hers for some time, I've never seen Gugino in anything
quite like this. She carries the entire film, and covers a range of
virtually every emotion possible with an ease and sense of realism that
was frankly awe-inspiring. Greenwood is also quite a bit of fun in his
role as Gerald, as he is allowed to play the character in several
different lights, especially after his death when he begins to
re-emerge as a vision seen by his wife. He's both slimy but charming.
Sympathetic but unlikable. It's a unique balancing act, and Greenwood
nails it. I also really enjoyed the small turn by former child actor
Henry Thomas as the deeply troubled and abusive father. He's everything
you could ever love to hate, and he does a wonderful job with the role.Unfortunately, there are two issues I take with the film that I feel
need to be discussed. And while they don't ruin it for me, I do think
they bring the film down a few pegs and are the reasons why I cannot
give this a perfect ten despite desperately wanting to. Throughout her
ordeal, Jessie begins to see cryptic visions of a figure known as the
"Moonlight Man" (Carel Struycken), who Jessie perceives to be a
personification of her potential impending death and frankly... it's a
fascinating idea, but it comes off as just a tad-but silly. Even in a
film containing elements like hallucinations, visions and flashbacks,
the "Moonlight Man" just seems out of place and contrived. And I'm
sorry... he looks goofy. He just does. Compounding this is the other
key issue- the film's denouement. While I will not spoil this, I can
say with some certainty that the final ten minutes could have easily
been removed entirely, and frankly, the film would have been better for
it. It's tacked on and superfluous, only serving as padding that
demystifies the tale somewhat instead of enhancing it.Still, these issues cannot detract from an otherwise entirely stellar
and enthralling experience. "Gerald's Game" might suffer a few missteps
along the way, but I would still give it my highest of recommendations.
With remarkable performances, an intriguing story, wonderful characters
and top-notch visual direction, you really couldn't ask for more. It's
one of the better Stephen King adaptations of the past decade and just
a darned-fine thriller in its own right. And so, I give it a very good
8 out of 10. Definitely one to check out this Halloween season!
