Entertaining Film

To start off, it was a really great movie that never failed to keep me
entertained. There were, however; some bad aspects of this movie. The
acting was well above average, though some characters came off as a bit
corny in some of the dialogue that I believed could be said in a much
better way or expression to tone down the corniness.I have not read the books so I cannot judge how the characters
portrayed their book counterparts but I will take the word of many
reviewers on this title and agree with them on this issue. But, even
without reading the books I couldn't imagine a better set of young
actors for the roles. The actress who played "Clarisse" - Leven Rambin,
mostly caught my eye with her acting. She was superb in the role as
Clarisse and every scene she did was great.Some moments or events in the movie were fairly predictable. And the
idea of the movie seemed to follow every other film in the "The Main
Characters never die"...The sad moments in the movie were immediately
changed to bring happiness to the audience but in my opinion, I would
like a little tragedy in such films.A boy, the son of Poseidon, faces a quest to help save his home. The
antagonist made such a brief appearance in the film and the problem was
dealt with fairly easily. Almost, too good that there wasn't such big
trouble going against the "evil boss"...But I am sure we haven't seen
the end of him. I am anxiously waiting for the next movie as the story
is simply great, exciting, and entertaining.I just went today to see this movie in the theater and I actually came
out of the movie feeling pretty satisfied and not at all disappointed.
I chose this movie over The GetAway and I was glad I made the choice
considering the rating and reviews I saw for that movie.In summary: The actors were great, the dialogue was good except for
some corny parts that definitely needed a look over. The story is
simply perfect and the whole rating of the movie was good. You would
love this movie if you really liked the first part. Definitely a Film
Series worth watching.
