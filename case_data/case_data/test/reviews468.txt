Style/Substance ratio is skewed beyond recognition

Stylish but astoundingly insubstantial, this film is visually stunning
throughout, but was completely doomed by Refn's decision to eliminate
all but around nine or ten lines of dialogue to allow more time for
lingering shots of Gosling staring blankly into the middle-distance.The torture scenes are more painful for the audience than the
recipients of said torture, but they do nothing to elicit an emotional
response from the audience - or even build any momentum or tension.By the time the final act of a film arrives, the viewer must have made
some kind of emotional investment in AT LEAST ONE of the characters to
be interested in how things turn out. However in this case, there
wasn't a single character whom I actually cared about, they were all
entirely superficial and obnoxious.I know some people feel as strongly positive about Only God Forgives as
I do negative - some films are designed to be divisive. For me though,
this is way below par by Refn's (normally very high) standards.
