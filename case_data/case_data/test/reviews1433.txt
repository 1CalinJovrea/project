Crime in the City

You know this is structured in the best sense, a familiar sense for
people who have seen a couple of crime movies. You know a little bit of
how they are structured, you can feel where it is going. And still the
suspense is there. Even when you are like "I see, I know", it still
delivers the punch with such precision that you don't mind a bit of
predictability. Also the quality is of the highest standard.Acting wise and story/script wise that is. We are talking about a very
tight story about many characters, connected one way or another. If you
judge this morally you may have some issues. It'll be hard to find a
likable character in this. But that is not what this movie is about.
Since this somehow connected to the people who did Gomorra, the show
and I reckon the movie, I'm looking forward to watch that too
