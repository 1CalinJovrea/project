Outstanding character building by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - even a bigger fan now!

I went to watch Snowden with someone who was extremely well informed
about the subject while I sadly wasn't and while we had extremely
different perspectives going into it, I believe it is safe to say both
thought the movie was pretty darn awesome. From the former point of
view, it appears some important things were left out, while I kept
getting stuck on stuff like how does a guy who did not even finish high
school and obviously really wants to make it in Special Forces turn out
to be such a genius, only being self-taught.The fact is the story enthralled me. Even if some things felt cheesy,
especially the abuse of light surrounding the main character in key
moments, the fact is due to such a strong issue and Joseph
Gordon-Levitt's stellar performance (queue choir of angels  yes, I am
biased towards this guy, sue me), this was indeed a memorable
experience.I mean, that guy obviously did such a brilliant character study. I
cannot get past how he placed his voice. The facial expressions and
ticks, the way he held himself, a lovely mixture of a fragile and
strong young man with principles literally held me at the edge of my
seat sometimes  I had to keep reminding myself to sit back.Some things did throw me off besides what I mentioned above, such as
the way he got the information out (the entire process just seemed
oversimplified)  and really every single time he expressed his
obviously dangerous points of view.However, I had a terrific time watching this and I highly recommend it.
Makes me want to watch the documentary, to find out what really
happened and what is just in the movie.
