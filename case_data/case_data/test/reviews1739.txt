The little brother of Spring Breakers

Beautiful movie which could be considered a parody of Disney's
aesthetic and didactic content. The movie's parody is willingly
conventional and at the same time the efforts in directing children, in
the amazing cinematography and set design are truly recognizable; still
it feels like there's something missing, even though the story has
everything it needs to be an entertaining piece about white American
trash struggling with ordinary life in a fable-like environment.
Actually there is really nothing to complain about, that feel is simply
produced by the decay surrounding the lovable protagonist, which is
deliberately sugar-coated as only a child's mind could manage it.
SPOILER (?): The very final sequence, which I kinda felt to happen few
seconds before, is a very well-fitting example regarding the masterful
level of Baker's self- awareness in the use of parody as a cinematic
striking weapon.P.S. hands up who could ever imagine Willem Dafoe as one of the best
Disney's character ever written, in a non-Disney movie.
