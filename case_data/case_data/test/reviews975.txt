Doesn't even deserve 1 star honestly

This is one my very bad movie experience in Malaysia. Only 10 people
were there to watch this movie after 35 mins 5 left.. I don't know how
to express about this movie.. Lots of money invested but no story no
climax nothing. Through out the whole movie they are Just forecasting
dozens of expensive cars.
