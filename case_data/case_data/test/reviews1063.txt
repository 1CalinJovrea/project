Good story great actress

This is a sweeping romantic drama that goes back and forth in time
between the present with an old woman in an asylum and her younger self
in "neutral" Ireland during WW2. Even though there is a clearly
fictional quality to the story, the themes of the Irish conflict feel
very real.Rooney Mara is eminently watchable. You can really believe her beauty
is enough to drive the men in the small town to distraction. She really
acts well here - wish she had more good roles.Theo James plays the villain, a lecherous priest. His face is actually
quite suited to the cruel character - he should play villains more in
the future. Eric Bana should be on screen more. Vanessa Redgrave
wouldn't act in a mediocre movie. One fault is a lot of non Irish actors speaking with accents - need
subtitles sometimes.This movie is saved by a good ending. A nice old fashioned ending that
is feel good and doesn't leave you hanging.
