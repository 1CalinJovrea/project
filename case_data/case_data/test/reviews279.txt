Touche...

Precursor: I just moved back into town two days ago and had made plans
to see one of my old friends tonight. I did not want to see this movie,
and wouldn't have under any other circumstances but my friend really
wanted to and the tickets were free so I went. Review itself: This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill, his fashion of
humor or his fans at all, but I, personally have grown tired of what
seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. (The
success of Project X seriously worries me...). Anyways, having that
mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh
once during the 21 JS trailer, green or red band... I really wasn't
expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the
house and catching up with a buddy. But damn. I honestly thought this movie was great. Yes, there were parts I wasn't
fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for
the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill
trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock
gag but the majority of the movie was, to me, surprisingly
satirical/smart/relevant in today's society, self-aware, and
situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this
movie's jokes and clich√©s seemed to know that they were such and were
given the proper comedic build up/context to at least warrant a
chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout
and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies
(Ice Cube, The Principal, etc..) What really stood out to me though was
the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly
humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration.
Despite it's faults, I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate, and
would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.All in all... genuine, clever, vulgar yet respectable comedy with some
heart. IMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum. Stoked for the sequel.
