A Masterpiece !

To put it simply, the movie is fascinating, exciting and fantastic. The
dialog, the fight choreography, the way the story moves, the characters
charisma, all and much more are combined together to deliver this
masterpiece. Such an amazing flow, providing a fusion between the 90s
and the new century, it's like the assassins are living in another
world, with another mindset, without people understanding it. Just one
advice for you though: Don't build an expectation of what you want to
watch in this movie, if you do, then you will ruin it. This movie has
it's own flow and movement, so watch it with a clear mind, and have
fun.
