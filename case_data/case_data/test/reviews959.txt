This was so lame ,predictable and boring...

I don't know what other movie people saw, but I for one I'm not
impressed by some special effects anymore . Got to see this movie with
some friends and based on the reviews I saw on this website we thought
it would be fun .The movie started OKs first 20 min they build it up nice , then could
have skipped the next hour, utterly pointless , the story predictable,
full of clich√© lines and just a waste of time, and I don't know what
was wrong with the girl playing the "love interest" but when she was
attempting to cry or give some longing look i started laughing and when
they tried to make a funny scene you could see it miles away and i
wanted to cry how awful the script was. And Charlie, I like him in SoA
but he didn't have to go to that much trouble to play Jax in this movie
as well .Well the action scenes we're OK I suppose if your into big things.. and
even those had their "genius" moments like the sword and its
"analogical" ...moment , granted If the intention was to ridicule and
make me laugh at the absurdity of its logic then it did its job.By the time this movie was nearing the end , I was at least hoping the
director of the movie could have the decency to just kill them off,
instead i got to see Jax fondling that annoying 14 year old (yea ... i
know the actress is like 30+ but that doesn't change the fact that in
the movie she looks and acts like 14-15).In conclusion if this what entertains people in this day , then by all
means, let the monsters loose , at least we get a good show ...
