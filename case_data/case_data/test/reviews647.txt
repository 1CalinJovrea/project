Good straight-forward entertainment packed with action.

It is a pretty straight-forward action flick. With the short runtime of
1 hour and 28 minutes, you can expect this to move briskly and to be
packed with a lot of action.The story: The movie starts with the young Hansel and Gretel losing
their parents. They are shortly picked by a witch to be food. They
manage to escape and burn the witch alive and that's how they become
witch hunter. Cue to the opening credit. The next scene shows them
saving an innocent woman whom is accused of being a witch. And from
there, the action keeps going. There are some slight twists about the
innocent woman and Hansel and Gretel's parents. Other than that, it is
purely straight-forward for a good thing. The action scenes are not bad
but they are more gritty than fantastical. Music wise is quite alright
with Han Zimmer acting as the music supervisor.3D: It is okay. As many of the scenes take place at night, the 3D
effect dampens. It becomes more like harder to see. But when it comes
to explosions, blood splatters and action, it is gimmicky with objects
flying to your face. Other than that, the 3D is not really recommended
unless you have some spare money.Overall: It is not bad for the month of January. Sure, there is a great
potential that the movie never reach but Hansel and Gretel: Witch
Hunters won't disappoint if you want a good entertainment packed with
action. Next fairy tale movie is Jack the Giant Slayer in Feb.
