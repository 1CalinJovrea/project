A return to tasteful science fiction.

This is awesome science fiction. Wonderfully crafted.By 40 minutes in I knew this film was absolutely fantastic. A welcome
treat among so many scripts that tend to walk the line of "the
ridiculously over the top."Ryan seems to be winning me over with serious roles, more and more, as
he matures as an actor. He does very well in the roll that Ben Kingsley
gets started in a journey to achieve "Immortality." The fact that the film was shot exceptionally tastefully, had a great
cast, and contained a worthy script makes it a shoe in for a good ride
at the very least.You should take it.It's a return to what Science Fiction should really be. A continually
changing bar or understanding of the universe as we "dare to dream the
things that might be within our grasps tomorrow."
