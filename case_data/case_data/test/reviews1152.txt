good cerebral sci-fi

Great cerebral sci-fi. If you're looking for aliens and spaceships this
ain't it but if you like the twilight zone kinda stuff this is a good
one. Maybe I was in the right mood for it but I really enjoyed this
one. The characters were believable and what I thought were holes in
the plot turned out not to be. not sure I would have been thrilled to
see it in a movie theater at present ticket and snack prices but a good
rental. Gotta pay attention and don't worry if you can't catch
everything being said in the first part as it's just party chatter.Not all questions answered and the premise is not, I think, meant to be
exactly the Schrodinger cat thing but just something to motivate the
action. Just because the characters discuss something doesn't mean they
figured everything out right.
