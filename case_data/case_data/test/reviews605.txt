Better than what I thought, but not as wonderful as possible.

I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, only assuming the
commercials had been far to revealing. Anyways...safe to say that
assumption wasn't very far off. Anyways, now to speak of this in a more
revealing light.Fascinating visuals, wonderful eye opening colors. It felt almost like
a comic book jumping onto the page. The portrayal of Peter Parker and
Gwen Stacy were amazing. Needless to say there's a connection felt
between them. However rocky it forms most of the movie though. this
isn't much of a qualm, but it was one of the more enjoyable elements.
Now, onto something a little distasteful. The villains as they were
developing had me hooked. Drawn into them (At least the ones shown
mostly,only spoiler here). One character in this is shown to be around
more in the commercials, it was more an illusion. You hope for more and
it comes up short. The villains when they fully descended failed to
keep what was making them enjoyable before the transition. Anyways, I hope you find this insightful. Through less of a bias side
(Love Spider-man). I'd give this movie around more of a 7, or 6.7, give
or take between them. Go see it and see what you think, it's worth the
ticket.
