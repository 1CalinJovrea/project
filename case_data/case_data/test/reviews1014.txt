Zero IQ Thirty

I totally agree with the blog posted on Dawn.com regarding this movie
by Nadeem F. Paracha.Zero Dark Thirty', was quite an experience. Though sharp in its
production and direction and largely accurate in depicting the events
that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden, it went ballistic bad in
depicting everyday life on the streets of Pakistan.With millions of dollars at their disposal, I wonder why the makers of
this film couldn't hire even a most basic adviser to inform them that1: Pakistanis speak Urdu, English and other regional languages and NOT
Arabic; 2: Pakistani men do not go around wearing 17th and 18th century
headgear in markets; 3: The only Urdu heard in the film is from a group of wild-eyed men
protesting against an American diplomat, calling him 'chor.' Chor in
Urdu means robber. And the protest rally was against US drone strikes.
How did that make the diplomat a chor? 4: And how on earth was a green Mercedes packed with armed men parked
only a few feet away from the US embassy in Islamabad? Haven't the
producers ever heard of an area called the Diplomatic Enclave in
Islamabad? Even a squirrel these days has to run around for a permit to
enter and climb trees in that particular area.I can go on.
