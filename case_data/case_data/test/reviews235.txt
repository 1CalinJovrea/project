A love letter to Rocky and film fans alike

There's no other way to say it; Creed is a knockout. From start to finish, this film exhilarates and crackles with brilliant
on screen performances and masterfully directed fight sequences. It
wholeheartedly captures what was so brilliant about the first film: the
characters. Yes, I'll return to theaters to see the fights, but it's
the characters, particularly Rocky and Adonis that truly captivated me
from start to finish. I can't say enough great things about writer/director Ryan Coogler. The
way he masterfully captures the modern spirit of Philadelphia and the
visceral tension of standing toe-to-toe with a man who wants to see you
hit the ground is second to none. What stood out the most, however, was
his writing of Rocky Balboa. The subtle nuances that we love about the
Italian Stallion are effortlessly worked into the script and flow like
water from Sly's crooked mouth. Speaking of, the script would be for
naught if it weren't for the beautiful performances by Michael B.
Jordan and Sylvester Stallone. I'm not ashamed to say I was brought to
tears at various parts of this film. I'm just so happy to say that this film wasn't a disappointment. This
film exceeded my wildest hopes of a 7th Rocky installment and had me
feeling amped up for hours after the credits rolled. I can't wait to
see more from the talent involved in this film, and I proudly endorse
and recommend Creed to Rocky fans and film fans alike.
