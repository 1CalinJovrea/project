Interesting portrait of a man, indeed but as a movie it almost lost me.

It's one of those labor of loves it seems as the film felt like it was
more interested in making an artistic narrative than it was about
making money. I can respect that, but it was a boring movie for that
reason. The Lost city of Z is about a British explorer named Percy Fawcett who
while on a survey mission in the amazon discovers evidence that the
"savages" once had a civilization the might even be older than the one
he came from and spends his life trying to find it.I loved Charlie Hunnam in it. Hands down, his most grown up acting
performance, and really made Fawcett a compelling man to follow. In
fact the whole cast was impressive with Sienna Miller as Fawcett's wife
and Robert Patterson who I totally did not recognize under the bread as
Fawcett's most trusted companion on his trips. Tom Holland is also in
the movie as Fawcett's oldest son who joins him on his last journey to
the amazon. Other people gave great performances, but these are the
ones I knew by name, making it a pretty stellar cast for me.While this movie does such a great job making Fawcett's life look
fascinating,following him through his time with the army to his time as
an explorer, I must admit that the slow burn of the narrative almost
put me to sleep. It reminds me of another project Brad Pitt (who
produced the movie) was evolved in, The Assassination of Jesse James by
the Coward Robert Ford. Though the Lost City of Z is not as painfully
slow (Notice the tile is half that of the Jesse James movie), the
combination of the quiet tone and it's speed was not something I wanted
to sit in a movie theater and watch. It's not that the movie is long,
it's that it feels long, and it feels like something that the movie
does on purpose.I feel like the movie tries to gives us the realest accounts of a man's
life as they can and I can respect that, but man, the two hours and
thirty minutes this film comes in at was not easy at all to get
through. That's just my warning.http://cinemagardens.com
