O Russel's worst movie.

David O Russel is a good director. "I heart huckabees",now this is a great film, with lot of ideas and inspiration."Three Kings", "The Fighter", and the two previous with Lawrence, i
enjoy all of them "Joy" is not even a mediocre movie, it is a bad
movie, with a terrible and naive script. A failure in every level.
Actors performances are good but they cannot save any movie like this.
Every minute, it was getting worst and worst, there are no words to
describe this mess, i wish i could say it better but my English are not
that good, my English are on the same level with this film:Î‘wful. And
what was the message of this film?That there is still hope in a
materialistic world and we should chase our dreams, even when all seem
against us? Maybe interrupt and invade to a board meeting of a powerful
company and confront the CEO? Come on, a director should respect the
audience. If you want to direct a fairy tale,OK, i like fairy tales but
don't present me an uninspiring fairy tale as a realistic movie, "based
on a true story". Even if it was a true story, it is not convincing.
Please, respect the audience. A talented director like O Russel should
not forget it
