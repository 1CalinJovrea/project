A Very Puzzling Missed Opportunity

The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and
suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and
enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't
exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely
forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible
in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted
opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source
material is.Having read the book World War Z, I could tell from the trailers for
this movie that it wouldn't exactly be a faithful adaptation. I thought
that the most interesting aspects of the book were its exploration of
how the Zombie plague affected social and political structures across
the world. Anything like that is completely ignored in the film, but I
can at least understand how the filmmakers thought that those aspects
wouldn't work in a single feature length movie. What I can't understand
is how the filmmakers seemingly ignored the book's most obviously
cinematic content. The book features a lot of setpiece action scenes,
and to be fair, many of these involve world cities falling to zombie
infestation and the movie does do enough to cover this. However, the
book's immense battle scenes - the meat of the titular Zombie War, such
as the Battle of Yonkers, nuclear war between Pakistan and Iran,
Chinese civil war and massive formation combat against zombies - are
completely absent. I was very surprised that they did not cover these,
especially the Yonkers scene, because they would obviously fit so well
into a film and the script, even as it is now, could easily be tweaked
to include or at least mention them. The action that did make it into
this film is very unsatisfying and obscure thanks to the restrictions
of the PG-13 rating, and the narrative around is not engaging enough to
really get me invested in it.I was also surprised at how cheap this movie looked. This film cost
hundreds of millions of dollars to make, but it's hard to see where it
all went on the screen. Swarms of zombies look very fake and
nonthreatening, and in some cases individual zombies are computer
animated, which gave me bad flashbacks to I Am Legend's awful CGI
overload. Aside from the opening scenes in Philadelphia and the middle
act in Jerusalem, there are no big outdoor sets. A South Korean airbase
is portrayed as a series of dark rooms; too much of the movie takes
place in an airline seat; there is a lot of sitting around inside of
the aircraft carrier, etc. The sense of scale is very inconsistent, and
this is accentuated in the bizarre final act, which was obviously the
focus of the infamous reshoots as it feels like a completely separate
movie. I consider myself a patient viewer, but this very long and dull
scene started to bring me down after a while, and my less patient
viewing audience eventually fell completely out of sync with the film
and began to make fun of it at every opportunity - not really a fair
criticism of the film, but it's a real issue when it can't hold an
audience's attention. The final act does actually have an interesting
idea at its heart, albeit one that completely doesn't connect with
anything in the book, but I just didn't think it was a well executed
concept. The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it
feel like a completely different movie.Again, while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ, I didn't
think it was anything to get excited about. In other words, a perfect
5/10 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's
potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the
book, WWZ (the film)and WWZ (the book) only share a title and the
central premise of a zombie plague, which is not an original idea in
itself.
