Better than the neighbors and this is the end.  James Francos  best movie yet

From start to finish this film is witty fresh and original. The
chemistry between Franco and Rogan was fluid as ever, leading to a
light and easily digestible comedy leaving me wanting for more. There are five or six scenes that could make this one an all time
classic, which I think could happen with the Adam Sandler flick blended
from this year as well as this is the end. But this one is in a whole
different league from both of those because it pushes new boundaries
and explores new topics which most others have been scared to reach. Many quotable lines come back to mind such as honeydicked and in
America we call it Stallone. About 100 others that will more than
likely make its way into everyday language and slang. The political slants and angles were not over the top and not in any
way in my opinion too unfair or politically incorrect. Both sides of
the story were presented with facts to let the viewer decide. A process
of self discovery occurred for both the viewer and for Franco which
made it an intellectual journey. I Am not a cult follower of Rogan but enjoyed this film highly and hope
for its success. Almost as good as team America :)
