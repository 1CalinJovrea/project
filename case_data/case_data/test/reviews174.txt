Reluctant Romantics

We won't even know their names. "Me" (the Narrator) is a movie
scriptwriter who gets assigned to write a script for a rom-com. He does
not exactly have an easy time writing this since he has not really been
in love. Then one day, our reluctant romantic meets "Her", the ideal
girl of his dreams. However, she happened to be already engaged to a
"Stuffy" guy. With his circle of friends around him giving him "sage"
advice, will our Narrator get his script written. and win Her over in
the end?The script of "Playing It Cool" by Chris Schafer and Paul Vicknair is
smart and witty as modern rom-coms go, chock-full of nuggets of
armchair "wisdom" about the relationship between men and women. Under
its original title of "A Many Splintered Thing," this script actually
found itself into the Black List, a yearly survey of the "most liked"
(though not necessarily "best") motion picture screenplays not yet
produced. Other famous graduates of this Black List were "Slumdog
Millionaire," "The King's Speech," "Argo," and "American Hustle."
Admittedly, this one is not exactly at those levels though."Me" was played by Chris Evans, whom I have not seen as a regular guy
on screen for a long time since he began donning superhero costumes.
After seeing him in all these major action films, it took a while to
get used to seeing him playing an ordinary lovestruck guy. He gets to
wear various costumes as his imagination runs with various characters,
including a female one. He was actually quite good as this charmingly
unsure character, sweet-talking not only to his co-star, but also to
his female fans in the audience."Her" was played by the very attractive Michelle Monaghan, whom I only
remember as the female love interest in action films like "Mission:
Impossible 3" and "Source Code". This girl really has an arresting
presence, you would not wonder why Evan's character falls hard for her.
The two of them look good together and have a smart chemistry between
them that makes this screen romance work.The supporting actors (Topher Grace, Aubrey Plaza, Luke Wilson) playing
the Narrator's unconventional writer friends add a lot of color in the
story as they discuss his love problem from different points of view.
Evans was actually reunited with his a couple of his fellow Marvel
superhero buddies here. "Mr. Fantastic" Ioan Gruffudd was funny as he
plays Her's fianc√©e Stuffy. "Falcon" Anthony Mackie was sleazy as he
plays Bryan, the Narrator's manager with a thing for Malaysian women.
Matthew Morrison and Ashley Tisdale have cameos as the actors in the
rom-com Evans was trying to finish.In his full-length feature film debut as director, Justin Reardon was
fortunate to have gathered an impressive cast of young actors to bring
the crackling script to life. It is still a rom-com though, not exactly
my thing, but this is not bad. It still follows the same basic formula
though that we have seen time and again. However, there was interesting
storytelling technique, crisp cinematography, snappy dialogue, and
quirky visuals to keep audiences' attention up to that final romp
across San Francisco at the end. 6/10.
