A quite different vibe to part 1, and undeserved of the bad reviews

I was the key demographic for the first film when it was released. I
somehow snuck into the theater a few years shy of being 18 (and legal)
to see it, and it had the same effect on me that it did on so many. The
slick production, now-iconic soundtrack, grimy aesthetic, grim humor -
it hit me hard (pun intended). Of course at that age, as gen-x cynical
and world-weary as I thought myself, I was naive. Drugs were still
novel, I was yet to see how dark and sad an actual addiction would look
like. On some unconscious level I felt like I would live forever. A
misplaced sense of my own intrinsic genius would allow me to balance an
appreciation of the seedier, self destructive elements of the world
with the actuality of my own inevitable personal success. As such, I
walked out of Trainspotting 1 with a spring in my step. It was fun,
fast, clever and a quick and temporary tour through some really ugly
things. It was 'cool'. Sequels to iconic movies are dangerous, and there are many that I've
avoided simply due to the knowledge that I'd rather not sully a great
film's memory by adding to it a mediocre sequel. T2 was the same - I'd
toyed with seeing it in the theater, but when that never eventuated, I
was fairly unfazed. Tonight, feeling a little sleepless and lonely in
my single room apartment, I stumbled upon a copy and thought 'why
not?'. I knew that the reviews has oscillated between 'quite bad' to
'surprisingly good' but in a fit of downbeat nostalgia, I thought it
might fit the bill. And it did.It wont be remembered with the reverence of the first film. I don't
believe that Boyle made it under that assumption. It contains some
great sequences, some similar (if familiar) visual effects, and a heap
of well-integrated allusions to the earlier film. It doesn't have
anything with the cut-through of the baby scene, the toilet scene, the
(original) 'choose life' monologue. It is a more subdued, 'adult' and
downbeat film. So - if you are a teenager who has recently seen the
first film and are chasing the gut-punch intensity by watching the
sequel, I can almost guarantee you'll fell let down. Conversely, if
you've aged with the film, I suspect you'll find a good degree of
resonance with the film. The genius of the film is how it manages to be
a deeper, more emotional, more (god forbid) 'mature' take on life. At nearly-forty you probably don't party like you did in your 20's.
Drugs are out, or few and far between. Meeting nubile 20 year olds is
also out, or if not, feels seedy. You no longer find revolutionary new
music weekly. IN fact, half of the songs on radio just alienate you.
Despite the mixed blessings of this unforeseen middle -aged-ness you've
found yourself shouldering, you are still a little haunted by what was,
and what could have been. The wonderful moments of being young, the
mistakes, the missed opportunities, the near-misses, the opportunities
and betrayal. They don't leave you. If you can appreciate any of what I just wrote, you may (like I do)
find T2 to be a very close second to T1. It's a real downer, but in a
bittersweet way. Check it out.
