Do tears freeze in the snow?

BR2049 has more plot holes than emmental cheese and one big "plot
twist" that I won't mention, not because it would spoil much, but
because if you decide to watch this movie, you deserve to be
disappointed by its stupidity.The big "twist" is mentioned as the "miracle", but it is absolutely
idiotic and illogical from the point of view of a manufacturer of
replicants. How did "that" might have ever be considered a good idea?
One would assume that after the disaster of the Nexus 6 series, Tyrell
Co. and his successors would have invented some more reliable security
system - such as a lower level of self-consciousness, way safer than
the questionable "obedience" of the Nexus 8. Or even something like all
the androids looking the same, so that they can be easily detected and
you would not need blade runners to locate and eliminate them.Anything that would provide humanity with useful, free labor without
ethical problems But no, in this movie ethical problems just got
exponentially bigger. And so much for a science so advanced as to
reproduce perfect bodies and minds...Besides, since it is established that humankind sucks, I failed to
understand how replicants are in any way better, since they just want
to be more "like humans". On the visual side, BR2049 sucks, too. Looks like they used random
leftovers scenery from other Sc-Fi/disaster movies, from the overused
industrial background of Terminator to the desertic blurred landscape
of MadMax and the inevitable nightmarish city-scape, which looks like
Blade Runner, but on cheap side. Costumes looks like the contemporary
drab clothing promoted by Nordic high street chains: lots of dark,
cheap-looking leggings and stretchy tops, a far cry from the decadent,
elaborate futuristic/retro suits of BR.In one scene, Deckard meets Tyrell's successor in a closed room filled
with water, except a square island in the middle. A room that has no
other reason to exist except bringing back memories of the "original"
Tyrell building.The dialog is unbelievable bad and scenes drag on forever. When the
Goslin character finds Deckart, the two spend over ten minutes fighting
and chasing each other, when a couple of lines of dialogue would have
avoided that. The ending is both manipulative and plagiarist: it wants to move the
audience, recreating the amazing poetic moment of Roy Batty's death,
but using snow instead of rain. If nothing else, the ending would have
been enough to put me off this piece of commercial garbage.
