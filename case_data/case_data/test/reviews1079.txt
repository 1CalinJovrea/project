Silly action movie = no masterpiece

I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype
train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown
comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it
preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically
celebrates "heroic" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an
alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an
alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and
basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as
progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any
good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is
poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen.
Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty
Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did
cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which
has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans
are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British
Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a
nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal
album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part
and wasted him entirely.Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to
the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse
professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics
have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder
and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting
mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the
critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess
we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?
