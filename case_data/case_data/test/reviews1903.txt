Decent beginning unexpected twist but not much in the middle

The idea had a lot of potential. A company colonizing planets creates
some kind of monster/weapon that suddenly goes out of control. In order
to cover up decides to blow up the hole planet Osiris; killing
everybody there. One pilot (with heavy drinking problems) has to save
his daughter who is alone in the city with the help of an ex-con
escaped from Osiris prison. The trailers are fine and the movie star
decent (to much dialog and exposition little action). Sadly, the low
budget, the director's lack of experience and specially the very lazy
written script kick in and movie becomes too tedious and cheap to be
acceptable. FX action scenes are decent; but the monsters and their
attacks are too cheap for recent movies (even low budget ones). Sam
Raimi with less money was able to make things terrifying; here are
lame. The final twist near the end gives some value to the movie and
make it more interesting and wanting some more. If sequel is ever make;
please get a better budget, writer and director and perhaps you might
have a hit.
