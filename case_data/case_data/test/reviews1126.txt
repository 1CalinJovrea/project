Exhausting, Thrilling and Powerful.

Paul Greengrass has proved his talents with two fantastic Bourne films,
The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, and two impressive
real-life dramas, Bloody Sunday and United 93. Green Zone, while being
a little like Bourne in Baghdad, was also a worthy thriller. Captain
Phillips sees Greengrass deliver another true story to the big screen,
proving that he is indeed the current king of cinematic re-enactments.Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. His
Captain Phillips is a professional, serious man that keeps his emotions
in check while sternly ensuring his crew understands his expectations.
As the situation escalates, his emotions begin to creep through.
Leading towards a final release that is both heartbreaking and
relieving. Hanks' character isn't explored too deeply, but we are
nevertheless with him every step of the way.In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by
Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate. We're given more
access than expected to this character  to all four pirates for that
matter. Abdi manages to evoke empathy from a character that could have
easily succumbed to stereotypical villainy. His performance provides a
complex level of emotion to the proceedings. He knows that the
situation has easily ran away from him, yet he naively decides to
re-assure himself  and Captain Phillips  every chance he gets.This is no-nonsense filmmaking of the highest order. Paul Greengrass'
kinetic camera rises above the sometimes dizzying approach from some of
his last films. The hand-held factor works beautifully here, ensuring
the you-are-there level of realism is cranked to a ten at every second.
As the events escalate, we are always kept aware of what is happening.
While skipper jargon and navy terms are exclaimed every which way, care
is placed on making sure we still know exactly what is going on. Billy
Ray (Breach, State of Play, The Hunger Games) constructs a taut and
clear screenplay that compliments Greengrass' filmmaking style.To call this tense is an understatement. Henry Jackman's score pushes
every sequence to an almost unbearable level of tension, Barry
Ackroyd's cinematography beautifully captures the sweat and intensity
of every moment, and Christopher Rouse's masterful editing brings it
all home.Exhausting and thrilling, Captain Phillips is all the more powerful
with the knowledge that you're witnessing a true story. Paul Greengrass
and co. have crafted an experiential film that you won't be forgetting
in a hurry.- thereelword.net
