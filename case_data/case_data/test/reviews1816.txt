A Very Clever Take on the "Home Invasion" Sub-Genre

To make this short and sweet, all I need to say is watch this movie.
Watch it with a big group of people.It takes a very simple plot and makes it into a very well-thought out
horror movie. The opening scenes effectively establish Maddie's story to allow the
audience to get to know and care for the character.Once the masked killer arrives, it begins as your typical cat-and-mouse
game seen in every home invasion movie. The main character being deaf
does allow a fresh spin on this game though. And without giving much
away, the movie slowly begins to evolve into a very tense, fun ride. Not to mention the superb acting from Kate Siegel, given the fact that
she was only able to use sign language and other resources as a form of
communication. You wonder throughout the film what you would do in her
shoes, and you may be surprised by the logic and resourcefulness of
some of her decisions.There are several moments that would likely get an audience riled up,
so grab a big group of friends and enjoy.
