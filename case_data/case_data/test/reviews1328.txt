Good love story

I watch a lot of romantic movies but inspite all of them i liked movie
a lot i mean this movie truly depicts the plots about two people who
are in love and they know until they get to get along with their life
whats good and impressing about this movie is that they showed that
true love never dies, after 10 years he was able to get her which
happens rarely in true life separated by sea but bound by heart. i
feels good to watching a part of life so romantic and so colorful.Over all good characters , good plot , good story , script was good.
The music sounds good (gotta buy the soundtrack!) too. And I love Lily
and Sam Claflin as Rosie and Alex
