Insults the audience from start to finish.

It's predictable, in that it's exceedingly formulaic, and laden with
plot devices that are way overused for any genre. Drawing and
quartering (halving, in this case) a man with two cars (in the opening
scene) certainly could be considered one way to set the tone, however,
after the first five dark, and rather grueling minutes, it quickly
devolves to a sentimental buddy/action romp, and becomes impossible to
be taken seriously. Even the cool noir-speak is abandoned once the
action sets in. Once the plot starts rolling along, characters stop
saying neat things like: "Who's the tomato?" (In reference to Emma
Stone). Thoroughly disappointing. Sadly, Penn's performance falls
spectacularly flat. Too much makeup, not enough emotion.
