Boring and upsetting at best

Fans of Cheryl Strayed likely come away from this movie feeling
reasonably content with the outcome. There's no challenge to the end
product or hope for anything more. Reese Witherspoon is a pretty
personification that many can put their hopes and dreams and selves
into and flutter away to the pretty pictures of mountains for a few
fleeting moments in their day. For the rest of us, however, the movie
is quite unmemorable and intangible. If anything, we simply watch
Strayed (Witherspoon) walk around like an entitled, annoyed bitch for
two hours, getting into trouble, doing stupid things, hurting anyone
close to her, and then crying over spill milk again and again. And all
along there's this audacious overtone telling us we should be feeling
sorry for Strayed and her struggles give me a break.It's clear Jean-Marc Vallee wanted to produce an Oscar-season prospect,
not an accurate or truly vulnerable adaptation. Coming off his success
with Dallas Buyers Club, Vallee wanted to shift momentum to a prettier
landscape and fill in the rest with exhausting flashbacks for back
story. I can visualize what he was aiming for, and it could have been a
shoe-in for best picture or certainly best actress. Unfortunately the
end product missed the target by thousands of miles. Wild is tiresome,
disjointed and certainly not Oscar-worthy material. The big difference
between the two films is that Dallas was based on a tremendous story,
one of transformation and growth, which is why it resonated so well
with audiences. Wild is not a tremendous story, not even a good one,
and simply takes the same approach as another vain diatribe, "Eat Pray
Love." Essentially, a struggling female writer feels trapped in her
life and decides to try something extreme, get herself out of this rut
and find purpose (then shockingly decides to write a book about it and
capitalize off all the people who want to do the same. CRAZY!). I won't
argue that Strayed didn't have a rough go at it. With the death of her
mother, her rotten coping mechanisms through anonymous sex and heroin
use, the consequent failure of her marriage and the downward spiral of
her life, Strayed was headed nowhere before she found the path of the
PCT. But that does not excuse how ego-driven and basic Wild is (and is
told).Strayed is the ugliest character in the story. Aside from a terrible
voice-over at the end (seriously, WTF was that?), Strayed truly does
not change physically, emotionally or in her relationships from
beginning to end. Yet somehow the film goes out of its way to make her
a hero, innocent and a victim in this crazy world around her. We see
this when all the rangers, hikers, townsfolk, even customers at the
diner she's waiting at all want to rape her or take advantage.
Apparently every man in the 90s was absolutely horrible (even the
husband she was cheating on who drove across the country to fetch her
out of a drug den and save her life. Hrm). The most ironic part is how
Strayed described in the book that she wanted to sleep with nearly
every man that crossed her path (including most men on the trail), and
at times she said she had to hold herself back. And that's the worst
part of Wild, the blatant, phony feminist propaganda. Feminism is so
trendy in pop culture right now that everyone is claiming they're a
part of the cause. But it's a word that is completely misappropriated
and misused, especially by quite terrible role models such as Cheryl
Strayed. She is a woman who wants to desperately be considered a
feminist that she adjusts her story to justify her mistakes, even
throwing in the line, "I am a feminist," into the movie to frantically
convince us. But she's not. Being a selfish, inconsiderate asshole
doesn't make you a feminist or a martyr. It makes you a selfish,
inconsiderate asshole, and not a person the viewer should want to feel
compassion for.To be honest, one of the best parts of the book was the relationships
and perspectives of others who Strayed came across on the trail. We got
to hear what they were going through, not just getting hit over the
head by a whiny Witherspoon. Yet the theatrical version (again) only
focuses on Cheryl and her theoretical struggle with life (i.e.
herself). We totally skip over all the other people who in my opinion
were the 'therapists' and friends who helped Cheryl to grow and guide
her change into a new woman and move beyond her horrible past.If the story is intended to be one about personal growth and finding
oneself, then there is none of that here in this adaptation. For a
15-minute montage Reese is bitching and moaning about hiking and her
life, then suddenly we're at the end of the trek and she's telling us
about how happy-ever-after things are going to be in the future. It was
like Vallee just said, "I'm over it," and decided to end the terrible
experiment. By the end of this movie I find myself really caring less
about Strayed (even distrusting her more since she signed off on this
thing), and I'm insulted by her story and embarrassed that so many
embrace her and what she did as some sort of feminist martyrdom. I
think Strayed was a stupid girl who did stupid things, and out of sheer
blonde luck was able to survive a trek on her own. Even more luck, she
was able to turn that mediocre story into millions of dollars in her
pocket. So good for her. It's not a terrible movie, just a terrible
story about a terrible person who wants us all to believe she's a
saint. I don't buy it, and unfortunately I rented the movie and bought
the book.
