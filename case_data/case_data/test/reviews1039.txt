Darling! Moses is on the phone....

What, in God's name, was this? Everything reeks of commercial operation
without any real thought behind it. Of all the puzzling elements in
this bizarre epic, the most inexplicable is Christian Bale as Moses.
Not the choice of Christian Bale - commercial operation, remember - no,
that I understand, what's inexplicable is his performance. We know now
Christian Bale is a great actor. Great. The Fighter alone puts him
right up there with some of the best of his generation so why then he's
so bad, but so bad here. His Moses is absent. Not a moment of truth,
not a moment of real connection. Was he a hostage, performing against
his will? That's what I felt, that he didn't want to be there and that
alone made me watch the whole film with disdain. What a disheartening
experience. I give it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew,
because their work is real and present on the screen.
