Over Simplified

I get that this is a kids film & they were trying to use simple ways of
showing how emotions are formed but I can't forgive the fact that the
whole plot was about how a little girl was suffering from depression
because, due to a clerical error, happiness was out of office. & the
final lesson just felt like "Cry & everything will be alright". Given how much praise this film was receiving (let alone it's a Pixar
film) I was hoping for a much smarter explanation of emotions.Also most other aspects of the film just weren't funny/enjoyable.
