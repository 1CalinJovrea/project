Absolutely Horrible!

I watched and thoroughly enjoyed the first Horrible Bosses so was ready
to be entertained when this came out.Circumstances meant I didn't get to the cinema to see this as planned.
Boy, was I lucky. I would have wasted my Â£10.Awful plot line; disjointed story; pathetic attempts at humour; Boring!Not very often that I turn something off because I really can't stand
it, but this was once.(NOT REALLY SPOILER) . . . I mean, if you've seen the first HB, the
toothbrush scene was hilarious. Whoever thought it would be funny to
redo it - give me a break! . . (END OF NOT REALLY SPOILER)Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. Now you've read this
you'll probably watch it as you don't believe it can be that bad. Well
you'll be back and comment for the first time, just to agree with me!
