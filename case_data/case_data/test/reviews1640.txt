A lumbering, distasteful comedy that has a lower impression of you than you have of it

There I sat, in stone-cold silence, not completely watching, but
observing Grown Ups 2, one of the most desperate comedies of the year.
Smiling maybe twice, groaning several times, rolling my eyes several
more, and eventually closing them for a few seconds trying to imagine
what a movie like this could've been if the quality of the talent
matched the quality of the three screenwriters behind this project.The first Grown Ups film wasn't great - or even good - by any means,
but had the vibe of a cheery, stupid ABC Family movie. The strongest
complaint I had about the original film carries over to this one
immensely which is that given the immense amount of talent in this
film, from the three title characters alone, this should be a much
better, much funnier movie. Adam Sandler can be funny when he is given
timing and a decent character, Kevin James can always be sweet, simple,
and relatable, Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians working
today, and David Spade almost always knocks one out of the park in
Rules of Engagement. It's dumbfounding to note that Taylor Lautner has
the biggest laughs in the film, and after watching this, I have faith
that after the redundant Twilight franchise he'll find work in some
solid buddy comedies. However, the first inkling that Grown Ups 2 is
terrible is by the sole fact that Rob Schneider himself decided other
matters were worth is time than making a film that was almost
guaranteed to be a hit.The entire event is a plot less picture (not the good kind) that
provides its audience with a pathetic array of scenes that seem more
like throwaway skits from Saturday Night Live. It's a massively
redundant, laundry-list of senseless setups with unfunny payoffs that
usually involve something along the lines of bathroom humor,
objectification, homophobia, and obnoxious behavior. In other words,
it's another Sandler movie. It takes place entirely on the last day of
school and revolves around the gang of Lenny (Adam Sandler), Eric
(Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade) returns,
this time welcoming a more quiet, suburban lifestyle contrary to that
of Lenny's in Hollywood, and the ridiculous series of sitcom antics
that unfold overtime.The plot stops there. What follows is, as stated, a series of
cheaply-staged, poorly-performed, witless gags that do nothing but make
one check the time. Among the barrage of questions I had while watching
this film, one of which was, "who is the target audience here?" My mind
resorted immediately to tweens and adolescents, who spend too much time
giggling at bathroom humor as is. But then, as the film progressed, it
began to redirect its senses to a more sentimental side, which only
shows the immense tonal strain the film has which is "create cinematic
anarchy for forty minutes before showing that this is a story about
being true to ones roots and taking care of the family." The
sentimentalism is then mixed with a strangely out of place eighties
party that concludes the picture, which will definitely not be
appreciated to the fullest extent by the previously mentioned tweens
and adolescences, as many of the jokes and period references will fly
straight over their head.The problem with the film is that it seems so effortless and so poorly
conducted. At least with various Sandler films like Happy Gilmore, Big
Daddy, and even the unexpectedly raunchy That's My Boy, I could sense
that it was made for somebody, be it adolescents or a bit older of a
crowd and stuck with that persona. Grown Ups 2 is a film made with no
agenda, no personality, and no spirit. It even resorts to the tireless
Sandler clich√© of having all the male characters being a cornucopia of
stupidity and the female characters being nothing but eye-candy for the
men. There are certain things I expect Sandler to be over now, what
with approaching fifty in a few years.You have a choice as a moviegoer this weekend and the several other
weekends Grown Ups 2 is going to play. You can either a see a film that
possesses gags as commonplace and predictable as a Fruity Pebbles
commercial or use this time as an opportunity to seek out nearby
independent features in theaters, at your local video store, or even on
Netflix. Say you refute that suggestion and want to see Grown Ups 2 as
a pleasant, feel-good movie. I know plenty of independent movies that
are pleasant, feel good movies (Frances Ha is one of them and is still
playing in many theaters nationwide). Wouldn't you at least want to
give money to people who don't believe that you're sitting in the
audience because you possess the attention-span of a newborn? Starring:
Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Maya
Rudolph, Maria Bello, Nick Swardson, Shaquille O'Neal, Peter Dante, and
Allen Covert. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.
