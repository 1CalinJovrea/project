Interesting and mildly inspirational, but also kind of bland

After a tragedy occurs, telling the stories of the individuals affected
is often the best way for others to understand and relate to what
happened. That's what the 2017 biographical drama "Stronger" (R, 1:56)
does with the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing and the story of victim Jeff
Bauman. He only survived because another bystander, Carlos Arredondo,
ran to the scene of the explosion, put tourniquets on both of Jeff's
legs, placed him in a wheelchair and helped get him into an ambulance.
A New York Times photo by Josh Haner, which showed Jeff in that
wheelchair, with Carlos at his side, became iconic. Responding to
widespread interest in his story, he joined forces with best-selling
author Bret Witter to write what became the 2014 book "Stronger", which
is the basis for this film. Before the Marathon Bombing, Jeff Bauman (Oscar nominee Jake
Gyllenhaal) was an unremarkable, anonymous guy born and raised in
Boston. He worked at Costco and loved his hometown sports teams 
especially the Red Sox  to the point of superstition and even
obsession. He lived in a modest apartment with his divorced alcoholic
mother, Patty (Oscar nominee Miranda Richardson). Jeff was obsessed
with local girl Erin Hurley (Emmy winner Tatiana Maslany), whom he had
dated and who had already broken up with him three times. On the night
of April 14, 2003, Jeff and Erin were still apart when she came into a
neighborhood bar where Jeff and his friends were watching the Red Sox
game on TV. He went over to talk to her, helped her get the other bar
patrons to contribute to her effort to raise money by participating in
the marathon and he promised to be there for her the next day at the
finish line holding a sign. The next day, as Jeff's waiting for Erin at the end of the course, a
man bumps into him and Jeff turns to look at the guy who is walking
away. Jeff looks down at something in the street. Then comes the
explosion. Jeff finds himself on the ground lying in a pool of his own
blood. Erin hears the sound ahead of her. She stops running, ducks into
a local bar and sees on the TV a picture of Jeff, injured and being
tended to by strangers. She rushes to the hospital, where Jeff's family
and friends were also gathering. Jeff's father (Clancy Brown) fumes and
even lashes out at Jeff's boss (Danny McCarthy) who shows up to offer
help. After waiting anxiously, Jeff's loved ones learn that doctors had
to amputate both legs above the knees. When he wakes up, not only does
he manage to keep his sense of humor and his usual positive attitude
(relatively speaking, of course), he's also able to give the FBI
valuable information about the bombing.Obviously, Jeff survives, but his life and the lives of those closest
to him are changed forever. We see the pain and discomfort that Jeff's
injuries cause him  both in the hospital and when he finally gets to
come home  and we follow him as he adjusts to life without legs and
begins the long and difficult recovery process. He receives gifts and
well wishes from all over the world, he's greatly in demand for media
interviews and he is given the opportunity to make public appearances
at Bruins and Red Sox games. He goes along with much of it, but he
really doesn't want any of it. He doesn't even want to meet with Carlos
(Carlos Sanz), the man who saved his life. Jeff says that he doesn't
want to be reminded of the worst day of his life. Jeff wants to walk
again, but he approaches the challenge half- heartedly. He needs the
love and support of his family, his friends and, especially Erin, even
though he often treats them unkindly and even pushes them away. He
doesn't want to be famous or inspirational, but it's out of his
control. Something has got to give."Stronger" is a somewhat inspirational, but mostly bland bio-pic. With
no disrespect to Jeff Bauman or any of the others directly or
indirectly affected by the Boston Marathon Bombing, their individual
stories are interesting, but aren't necessarily best served in the
format of a feature film. Having said that, this one does about as good
of a job as can be expected, given its limited focus. The screenplay by
writer-actor John Pollono (who plays Tyler on TV's "This is Us") adapts
the book of the film's title without being exploitive or flashy,
telling the story almost entirely chronologically and only occasionally
drifting into melodrama. Director David Gordon Green (mainly known for
producing and directing TV series like "East Bound & Down" and "Vice
Principals") does here what he did with 2014's "Manglehorn" and 2015's
"Our Brand is Crisis", telling a story solidly, but making it less
impactful than it probably should've been.Green does, however, often get excellent performances out of his actors
and this film is no exception. Gyllenhaal is as great as he was in
similarly emotional roles like the desperate astronaut in "Life"
(2017), the grieving father in "Nocturnal Animals" (2016) and the
down-and-out boxer in "Southpaw" (2015), while Richardson and Maslany
completely inhabit their roles. All three are award-worthy, especially
Maslany in her most high-profile feature film role to date, following
her personal triumph that is TV's "Orphan Black". In this film, she
will be a revelation to many Movie Fans, while they may also notice and
wonder how Gyllenhaal manages to continue giving exceptional
performances in high-quality films every single year. This one may not
be as exceptional as some man-versus-self films, but it's worth a look.
