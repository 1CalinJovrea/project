Cruise and Liman make a great pair again

Always reliable if not exactly visionary, director Doug Liman has
another entertaining outing with Tom Cruise, reinventing his charm,
swagger and grin as tools for finding easy cash and marital respect
when honest work doesn't exactly get one far enough.Cruise plays a totally reprehensible and despicable character and yet
manages to keep everyone invested in the ride that accelerates with
every misstep on the way, fully captivating the audience to wait for
the extent of the looming train wreck. Cruise is entirely game here,
not once trying to make audience feel sorry for his character or
thinking that maybe he had a heart of gold, after all. Worth pointing out is also a stellar turn from a less prolific Domhnall
Gleeson whose ambitious CIA operator is equally blind, naive and
brilliant, and Gleeson makes his oily presence wonderfully effective.
