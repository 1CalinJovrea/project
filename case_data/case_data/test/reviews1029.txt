Tender, funny, sweet, silly and surprisingly wise.

Looking at the starry cast of This Is Where I Leave You, it's easy to
get excited about the film. But that excitement might easily fade away
when you realise that the director at the helm of this family dramedy
is Shawn Levy, best-known for resolutely mediocre films like Night At
The Museum and The Internship. Surprisingly, however, Levy has crafted
something witty, wise and quite wonderful from Jonathan Tropper's
screenplay (adapted from the latter's own best-selling novel). Its
narrative might struggle a little at points, and some characters fail
to really leap off the screen the way they're clearly meant to. But
This Is Where I Leave You is without a doubt Levy's most engaging,
full-bodied effort yet: a rich, bitter, quirky film about love and
family that teeters along the thin, broken lines dividing life and
death, and comedy and tragedy.Judd Altman (Bateman) is having the worst year of his life. He's just
discovered that his wife Quinn (Spencer) is having an affair with his
scumbag radio-host boss (Shepard). The last thing he can handle is the
death of a family member. But home he must go in the wake of his
father's demise. Once there, Judd and his siblings - driven Wendy
(Fey), stern Paul (Stoll), and quirky Phillip (Driver) - must abide by
their father's dying wishes, as relayed by their mom Hilary (Fonda):
they are to sit shiva for seven days, a week in which secrets are
revealed, tensions run high, and love sneaks through amidst all the
lies and loss.It's a situation rich with potential, one that could easily have taken
the path of high melodrama or descended into outright buffoonery. Levy
and Tropper go for something in-between. And so, in a film in which
Judd struggles desperately to mourn his father after the implosion of
his marriage, the sexual escapades of Paul and his baby-hungry wife
Annie (Hahn) are telecast to the entire house via a baby monitor. Wendy
re-connects with Horry (Olyphant), the brain-damaged childhood
sweetheart she left behind for a loveless marriage to Barry (Lazar).
Her brothers sneak off and get high during a service at the synagogue.
The final result is a tangle of black humour and bittersweet tragedy,
woven into a tapestry of joy and misery that's remarkably close to life
itself.What keeps the film's servings of tragedy and comedy from tipping into
farce are its endearingly real characters. It's easy to see the wealth
of love and resentment that binds the Altman family together. The
siblings argue to the point of bloodshed over who will take over their
dad's sporting goods shop, and they tease one another with the
poker-sharp memories of years of enforced familiarity. But they also
let their guards down around one another: Judd chats out his troubles
with his sister Wendy, perched atop a roof; the siblings complain about
the loss of privacy stemming from their mom's best-selling book about
their childhoods, but still find themselves turning to her in moments
of deepest grief. "You're idiots," Wendy declares at one point to her
brothers, "But you're my idiots" - a sentiment that most would agree
applies particularly well to one's siblings.Even the supporting characters are mostly well-served by the script,
whether it's widowed next-door neighbour Linda (Monk), mother of Horry
and keeper of a secret that will shock the Altman children when it's
revealed; or Phillip's new fianc√©e Tracy (Britton), a sexy, intelligent
therapist who knows just what a big mistake she's made in falling for
the Altman family screw-up. It's particularly intriguing that Quinn
isn't written off simply as a degenerate whore, but someone whose
mistakes - though inexcusable - are rooted in as much heartbreak and
sadness as she's causing Judd with her infidelity.Unfortunately, not every character in This Is Where I Leave You rings
quite so truly. While Judd freaks out about Quinn, especially when she
flings a bombshell at him when she turns up at the Altman home, he also
draws closer to Penny (Byrne) - the sweet, kooky girl who's held a
torch for him since high school. In a film filled with so many
quirky-but-realistic characters, each of whom could easily have taken
the lead, Penny is an odd cardboard cutout of a dream girl. In effect,
she bounces around and chirps supposedly insightful but painfully
awkward things like, "I've always seen you, Judd Altman". Poor Byrne
tries her best, and has a sweet chemistry with Bateman, but her
character feels less like a genuine romantic option than the wishful
thinking of a writer who's spent considerably more time fleshing out
his other characters.In news surprising to no one, Levy's ensemble cast is an absolute joy
to watch in action. Bateman anchors the entire film with one of his
most sensitive performances yet, but everyone around him gets a chance
to shine. Fey, better known as a comedian, mines Wendy's troubled
relationship with Horry for genuine emotional trauma, while Stoll and
Driver round out the Altman quartet with steady, appealing turns as the
eldest and youngest brothers who just can't get along. Fonda is
luminous, carrying off the comedy - and her prosthetic breasts - with
remarkable grace, while creating a picture of a tough, sexually
progressive woman with plenty of depth and love for her children.Like the fractured, dysfunctional family at its heart, This Is Where I
Leave You isn't perfect. It can be insular at times, and its characters
occasionally speak in perfectly tart soundbites that don't quite ring
true. But Levy's film is also a tender, silly, deep, smart and
ridiculous look at a family in mourning. It finds the hidden joys and
awkward sadnesses in a group of people who sometimes love more than
they like one another. And it serves as a potent reminder that life -
happiness, tragedy, and everything in between - keeps happening, often
when we least want it to.
