Surprisingly Effective Gem

Don't be put off by the seemingly ludicrous storyline, what starts off
as looking like a comedy/horror cornball piece, actually develops in to
a rather good horror movie. I was apprehensive when first watching
this, it could have gone either way, and 15 or so minutes in I was
thinking, "This is gonna be dumb!" But surprise surprise, it takes some
very dark turns and becomes a very enjoyable out and out horror storyI don't think I'm giving too much away by saying (This all happens in
the first 10 or so minutes) Son loves clowns, Father running late for
birthday party. Clown booked for party cancels at last minute. Wife
calls the Father. Father working in old house and finds trunk with old
clown costume and decides to step in.One of the things that makes this film, apart from the on the nose
acting, is the clown costume itself. It's not bright and garish, a la
Stephen Kings Pennywise, but understated. There is some humour, used to
good effect towards the start of the film, but not too much and it
never falls into the trap of relying on the humour, which would have
been so easy with a clown based horror film.Despite initial apprehensions, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it's
one of those goodies that catches you by surprise every so often.
