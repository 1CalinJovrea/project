teenage girl discovers her sexual and creative power -- and their danger

You don't have to be or remember being or know or parent a teenage girl
to find yourself addressed by The Diary of a Teenage Girl. Its broader
theme is the danger of power, especially the sexual license which the
setting  San Francisco, 1976  emblematizes. Young Minnie discovers both her sexual and her creative power as she's
deflowered by her mother's boyfriend Monroe and draws cartoons in the
style of (R Crumb's wife) Aline Kominsky. (Monroe, by the way, may be a
studly ballooning of Jules Feiffer's nebbish hero of the time, as
Minnie proves a long way away from the cartoon style of Mickey and his
gal.) The animation scenes show her living in a state of heightened
awareness, life bursting out and into art. Both endeavours prove
dangerous. Her affair threatens her mother's shaky security and her
art-work can strike the conventional (e.g., Monroe) as freaky as her
exuberant sex strikes a younger lover. Her other creative enterprise,
tape recording her confessions, blows up the scene. Art and sex are
avenues of self-discovery and self-realization  dangerous. Both are
life-affirming but both herald the frightening responsibilities of
adulthood.Minnie is obviously the film's central subject and consciousness.
Self-conscious about her physical imperfections, she succumbs to her
mother's and Monroe's invitations to assert her sexuality. Full credit
to Bel Powley for an astonishing, shameless and vanity-free
presentation.But the other women are significant too. There's Minnie's "white trash
 but in a good way" best friend, in whom she entrusts teen confidences
but who steals a bout with Monroe herself. There's the lesbian lurking in the bush who seduces Minnie only to
exploit her for her own purposes. So you don't have to be a man to
exploit a trusting young girl  though Monroe demonstrates how
swaggering manhood and convenient access are a huge advantage. Monroe's
casual predation shows how his power can destroy him too. He knows he
shouldn't do what he does and he knows Minnie is manipulating him but
he can't control himself. He even drifts into Charlotte's silly web to
resolve the issue: Monroe must marry Minnie. He's too easily satisfied
even to realize his own small dream of a mail-order vitamin empire.
Remote infusions define him. The fact that he lets himself be seduced
by young Minnie shows him victim of his own passivity, a character
wholly without character.But the two other key characters are Minnie's mother and younger
sister. Charlotte was a highschool beauty, is still as beautiful and
enchanting as Kristen Wiig, surrounded by lusting lovers  and is
paralyzed by that former power. She desperately clings to romance
because she feels she has lost her sexual appeal and beauty. As her
egotistical ex-husband Pascal insensitively declares, she can't run her
own life. We watch her drift from one stupor to the next, abandoning
Minnie to Monroe and latenite TV, eventually being fired from her
library job. Only the fear that her anger may have driven Minnie to
suicide sobers her up sufficiently to embrace her prodigal daughter. At
the end, though, Charlotte is still "seeing" Monroe, unable to escape
her enslavement to her sexual liberty with him. "We can never talk
about it," she instructs Minnie, but she can't leave the man who
humiliated her either.Kid sister Gretel shows more hope. Without either her beautiful
mother's or her plainer sister's looks she has to find another path to
mature self-respect. With her mother's shallowness as one model, she
finds a preferable one in the new Minnie. From her she learns that she
doesn't need a man or a relationship for self-respect. The two sisters
used to fight and swap bitter notes but at the end they frolic
together, with an exuberance that bonds them as women, as sisters.
