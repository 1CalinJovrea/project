Great movie.

I liked that it was based in modern times and the girl who played Annie
did a wonderful job with the character. The musical scenes were great
as well. I even had tears at the ending. Very emotional and great movie
in all. The movie is about Annie who is a foster child and lives in NYC
with 4 other girls and her foster Mom. She is saved by a man who is
running for mayor and eventually gets adopted in the end. The story is
well done to adapt to modern times and the characters are really good.
The girl who plays Annie is a great singer and the whole movie will
brighten your day. I would definitely see it again. This could be a new
classic in its own right.
