Great if you like teenage love stories

This is a teenage love movie about a sorority student who falls for an
older rodeo rider (yawn). The way this happens almost made me throw up
in the first ten minutes - it was just so fake. OK, after 45 minutes it
starts to pick up when Alan Alda's character begins his love story, but
even that is painful to watch - it's the same old line about love
complicated by war and it's effects. I gave it another 15 minutes, but
there was still nothing original and so this is now only the 3rd movie
ever that I have been unable to sit through to the end. $25 and two
hours of my life wasted. Sorry to those peeps that like the teenage
love stories - you'll probably love it, but that doesn't mean it is 7+
on IMDb.
