Return to form

Split is directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars James McAvoy and Anya
Taylor Joy. It follows the story of a troubled youth as she is
imprisoned alongside 2 classmates. The kidnapper suffers from multiple
personality disorder with a 24th personality about to be unleashed.M. Night Shyamalan has successfully created a film hearkening back to
his classic tales such as The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. His style of
writing and directing follows his older movies more so than his latter
ones. In Split, Shyamalan has returned to his ability to direct
character driven thrillers. Every scene was directed with sharp writing
and tight directing.James McAvoy does an excellent job portraying the damaged and troubled
personalities. The film allows James McAvoy to apply his full range and
personality to the roles. Another actor could have emoted the lines
poorly ruining the movie. Special care was taken to make each
personality distinct and each does feel distinct.Split is highly recommended to casual moviegoers and for Shyamalan
detractors. The movie is creatively tense and James McAvoy's
performance is astonishing.
