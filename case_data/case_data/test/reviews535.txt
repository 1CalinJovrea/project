Solid Movie With Just a Few Flaws

I enjoyed this movie overall and feel it was well filmed.Ray McKinnon and Sam Shepard stole the show in terms of acting. Amazing
job done by the both of them. I wasn't impressed with Matthew
McConaughey's acting. He is a very average actor and I feel the movie
could have had a different vibe without him in the role. Both young
actors (characters of Ellie and Neckbone) did a great job.It is interesting how the movie is set in modern times (2011 was seen
on a calendar) yet you don't see people using cell phones or computers
or the internet. It's almost as if the film could have been done 30
years prior based on how it was filmed and the mood/tone of it.I didn't fully understand the point of the character Galen and felt he
could have been cut from the script and it wouldn't have made a huge
difference. He was entertaining but irrelevant to the movie.In the end (this is the spoiler) we are basically watching two
murderers get away with murder. Of course they have our sympathies
but...well...you know.
