A film that's sadly uncommon in America (which is also makes it a film you need to see)

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a film that shouldn't be as uncommon
as it is for American cinema. It's a seriously contemplative and
revealing drama about a young woman lost and confused about her sexual
identity upon committing one of society's most serious taboos and
realizing that she liked it and might want to try it again. And again.
And enough times to keep an audio diary of her thoughts and experiences
about said act.I'll catch you up; set in 1970's San Francisco, Minnie (Bel Powley), a
fifteen-year-old girl and aspiring cartoonist, experiences her sexual
awakening after losing her virginity to her mother's sorta-boyfriend
Monroe (Alexander Skarsg√•rd). Minnie considers herself overweight and
undesirable in every sense, and is largely neglected by her Bohemian
mother Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), who is usually too busy smoking weed
or doing drugs with strangers to even notice her daughter, so this
awakening comes as an immense shock to Minnie and her person.Minnie begins to crave more sex and attention from Monroe, going as far
as to make intimate sex with him a regular thing, in addition to
craving sex from strangers and other boys her age, all under her
mother's nose. This sex drive, however, is deeper than horniness, but a
cry by Minnie for companionship, desire, and, most of all, love. Minnie
wants to be the apple of someone's eye, so much so that when she
leaves, the person feels like they'll die without her company and
security.I've long had the same hunger Minnie has had, though I've been
fortunate, as a male, to see roughly two or three coming of age films
that accurately reflect my emotions, my desires, and my sexual
awakening. Young girls and stories of their sexual awakening have been
cruelly shortchanged in American film and "The Diary of a Teenage Girl"
takes note of that just by existing. Consider scenes when Monroe and
Minnie have sex, makeout with one another, or Minnie describes past
sexual advances to her best friend. If these scenes made you at all
uncomfortable, uneasy, or awkward (like they did me), then writer and
directress Marielle Heller has effectively proved that fact without
even saying it. Now switch the genders of the two main characters,
think about the situation over again, and see if you feel that same
level of discomfort.Heller unapologetically details Minnie's desires in a way that, while
revealing, is whimsical, thanks to the presence of Minnie's drawings
springing to life before her eyes. However, this occasional distraction
is offset by Heller's honest depiction of Minnie and, most importantly,
the rawer scenes of the film, like when we see Minnie stand naked
before a mirror as she examines her body and voices her desire to be
loved and cherished. It's something I'm sure most young girls have done
at least a few times in their life; standing before a mirror entirely
exposed and hoping someone will love you for all of you rather than
just parts of you. It's the basic level of human feeling, and Minnie
has discovered it and craves it much quicker than any of her friends
have.Bel Powley is a force on-screen here, positioning herself not as a
fabled caricature but an empowering everygirl that transcends beyond
the confines of a typical teenage girl into somebody many can relate
to. It also helps that Powley, herself, is such a great screen
presence, confident even when her character is insecure, and
encapsulated in a bubble that teeters between innocence and the loss of
innocence."The Diary of a Teenage Girl" could easily be paired with "Turn Me On,
Goddammit!," a Norwegian coming of age drama about a girl relatively
the same age as Minnie, who becomes entranced with masturbation and
sexual pleasure so much so that it takes over her life. Truly impacting
and significant coming of age stories for young girls are depressingly
few and far between and here is a film that boldly asserts itself by
silently calling audiences out on its double standards for young women,
focusing on a relatable protagonist throughout the film, giving us
artful direction and attractive aesthetics not as a means to sugarcoat
but to humanize, and concluding the picture with an ending that, while
unfortunately fairly radical for American cinema, hits as hard as some
of the best endings of films this year.
