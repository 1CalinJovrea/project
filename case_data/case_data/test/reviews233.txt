Kind of like your cute little niece that you should like more than you do

The sequence and the double use of "and" in the title foreshadows more
than just the plot, it also give you a sense of the third-wheel-ness of
the titular female character. Olivia Cooke spends most of the film
failing to thrive while Mann and Cyler play out the pathos and give
author Jesse Andrews a chance to revel in his love of cinema. The movie
parodies produced by Greg and Earl are less approachable nostalgic
references for a wider audience than film geek inside baseball for a
more specific crowd. Between the long spates of movie lore, Greg's
monologue-ing about the densely layered high school class structure and
The Dying Girl's swooning, the movie is fairly dull. In short, much of
the critical praise comes from movie geeks complimenting a movie geek
movie and from a twist ending that gives a French film melancholia to
the processings.
