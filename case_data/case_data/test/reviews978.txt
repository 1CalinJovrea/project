Just another terrible, straight to Blu-Ray, low budget movie

Okay, Where do I start? The movie is just.... Well, Terrible! After
Wrong Turn, I was convinced that maybe the sequels to the original film
just may be as good, but I was wrong. The acting in the films following
the original are okay, but not great. Instead of adding a little horror
to the film to go well with the plot, they decide instead to add more
sex scenes. I mean, after watching the one hour and thirty-one minute
movie, I felt like I had watched a porn movie or something. The movie
has more sex scenes than death scenes, seriously! The violence in the
movie definitely gets old. The scenes are not as shocking and
unexpected as they use to be. You're expecting crazy things to happen
at almost every given second of the film, and it does. If you're a fan
of Wrong Turn, just skip this film, it's far worse than the other
films.....
