Not as good as the first one but still very solid and entertaining

Let me begin by saying that the first Sin City is one of my favorite
movies of all time. I thought it was an absolute blast to watch, and
the filming style blew me away.A Dame to Kill For is the same type of movie as the first, but it is
not executed quite as well. It may just be be cause the style lost some
of its original appeal, but I thought it didn't live up to its
predecessor. With that said, I still thought A Dame to Kill For was a
great time at the movies. Everything about it was solid. It continued
the action from the first and did not fail to keep me at the edge of my
seat. And, Marv was his normal, b.a. self.A Dame to Kill for consists of two story lines that are prequels to
those of the first Sin City and one that is a sequel. I felt that it
delivered very well in its attempt to support what happened in the
first movie. I would recommend re-watching the first one so that you're
fresh for this. Sometimes you can forget the names if you haven't seen
it in a while.Overall, this movie was great. If I had not seen the first Sin City, I
would have been blown away.I give it a 8/10. A definite must-see.
