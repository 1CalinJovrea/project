Completely shocked

Over the past months I've realized how much improvement have Spanish
movies and series done in their works. However, when it comes to
thrillers, I tend to be very selective and delicate because there are a
lot of elements to take into consideration.The Invisible Guest accomplish almost all the elements in any checklist
of a perfect thriller-suspense movie. The script forces you to think
quickly, you can't get distracted for a second because you'll miss an
important detail. The story is told in a puzzling-kind of way, letting you feel like you
finally know what is going on, just to tear your expectation apart with
a new shocking truth. Some of the actors did a pretty good job. A remarkable performance was
the one from Victoria Goodman. The music is absolutely engaging. The twisted feeling you get with the
melody traps you into the story. The different tones and volumes of the
music actually happen in agreement with the intensity of the sequence. 100% RECOMMENDED.
