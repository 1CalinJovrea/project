John Carter earns more respect!!!!

John Carter did not get the attention that it needed! This movie should
of been more successful and despite what most of the critics and
viewers are saying about this movie, "that its a lot like Star Wars and
Avatar", that is not true. I have found John Carter to be an amazing
movie visually, and the story was actually great. Don't get me wrong,
Star Wars and Avatar were great movies, but I believe that John Carter
was far much different and slightly better. I saw John Carter in the
theaters the week that it came out and I had a lot of fun watching this
movie!. So the hell with the critics, in my opinion, John Carter kicked
ass!!!!.
