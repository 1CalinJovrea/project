A masterfully composed narrative

If someone told you to watch a movie with only one character in it, and
it's set in a car for the whole running time - you may think that it
would be boring and rather dull.Locke isn't.It has a real-world plot that is augmented with simple yet artistic
shots of the road on which he is driving. Locke is on the way to the
hospital - his only companion is his phone which, connected to the cars
blue tooth system, is ringing constantly.Tom Hardy holds this movie together and grips the audience with a
rather simple plot with his superb acting and dialogue (+ monologue at
times).Watch this film!
