Could Have Watched a Re-Run on TV rather than This Pile

Dead in the water best describes this movie. Boring from beginning to
end. Spoiler Alert - I watched the whole movie hoping for something exciting
to happen however, there is no apparent climax to the story - it just
drones on and on to the end. That's it, the relief you feel having it
end, is the climax.Michelle Williams nominated for Best Supporting Actress for about 5
minutes of screen time with little dialogue - not bad work if you can
get it. Her real role in the movie was to provide her name to the list
of credits. She is rather cute too so the movie has that going for it.In one of the rare scenes where Williams and Affleck appeared together,
their engagement in a dialogue of half spoken sentences interrupting
each other was lame and probably ad-libbed.Casey Affleck played the part of a severely depressed person well, but
the role was not that challenging - Jim Carey could have performed it
equally as well. I liked Casey in The Finest Hours where the role had
more dialogue and the movie was far more exciting and entertaining.
