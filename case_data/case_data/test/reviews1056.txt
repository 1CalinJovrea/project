Cop Rabbit learns about her safe space in bad allegory for racism simulator the movie

What can I say? Well to start I'm not a big fan of this movie. I do not
understand the praise it receives. This movie seems like a cash grab
for the the racial tensions in American while still being simple and
funny enough to be aimed toward children. If anything marketing toward
these too seem immoral. Anyways Enjoiy day thanks for reading my
review.
