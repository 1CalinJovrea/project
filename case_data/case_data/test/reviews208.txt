Bloodlust in America

It is no secret that humans are prone to violence. "The Purge" takes
place in the United States, a country founded upon violence through the
Revolution, savage dealings with Native Americans and Africans, and
incessant involvement in wars throughout the world. Though the film
itself remains relatively simple, it does touch upon not only
humankind's thirst for blood, but on additional societal issues such as
socioeconomic status, crime, and governmental control.The film focuses upon the traditional cinematic nuclear family: a
father who has just earned the spot as top salesman at his place of
employment, a mother home cooking for her family while drinking wine,
the teenage daughter messing around with her boyfriend (of whom dad
does not approve), and the unusual younger sibling, a son playing with
his remote controlled vehicle with a camera hidden inside of a
half-melted doll. Okay, so the introduction to the son is a little
strange, but the impression of that of a typical family unit.The new founding fathers of America (in the year 2022) have created an
event known as "The Purge" which has, according to the film, saved the
country. During the purge, all crime is legal for a period of 12 hours.
This allows mankind to "purge" the hatred, anger, and violence from
their souls and contain these natural instincts to this 12 hour period
alone. The reports indicate that, thanks to the purge, unemployment and
crime now stand at record lows in the United States. However, the film
suggests that this is because many Americans "Purge" by killing those
too poor to afford the security systems sold by the aforementioned
father played by Ethan Hawke. As we discover, these security systems,
much like those available now, are simply a false sense of security and
can be penetrated if the assailants so desire.Compared to other films currently in theaters, "The Purge" presents a
fairly original plot. Humans are inherently violent and man killing man
happens every day. Therefore, why not attempt to regulate and contain
this violence? Ultimately, however, the film falls into predictable
patterns of main characters separating and aimlessly wandering in the
dark with violent intruders abound. Furthermore, these intruders are
reminiscent of those in the film "The Strangers" though not nearly as
frightening. Also, with all crime legal for 12 hours, the only crime
displayed by the film is that of murder, often via the use of firearms.
One would think that robbery, rape, drug trafficking, and a myriad of
other illegal activities would garner as much interest and attention as
violence. Regardless of some predictability, simplicity, and
familiarity, The Purge was still more entertaining the majority of the
mindless special effects-laden nonsense churned out by Hollywood's
backside. Are you ready for The Purge? See the film and enjoy the
discussions that ensue.
