trying that Harry and Sally bit

In 2002, college student Jake (Jason Sudeikis) finds Lainey (Alison
Brie) yelling for Matthew (Adam Scott) in the hallway. Jake and Lainey
end up losing their virginity to each other. In the present day, the
two run into each other in a sex addiction support group. They haven't
seen each other since that night. Jake sleeps with inappropriate women
rather than maturely breaking up his failed relationships. Lainey has
been in an on-and-off affair with Matthew even after his marriage to
Emma. Jake and his best friend Xander cash out by selling their
business to a big company. Quickly, Jake is flirting with the company
lawyer Paula (Amanda Peet). Jake and Lainey have a platonic
relationship but their romance is never far below the surface.This hits on similar terrain as When Harry met Sally. Sudeikis and Brie
have some slightly irreverent brand of humor but it's never completely
edgy. They seem well matched. The missing element is the uncontrollable
heat. Sudeikis is a little too standoffish and always joking around.
There seems to be good possibilities with these two but it fails to
land that knockout punch.
