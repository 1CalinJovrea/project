The story is a long way from reality, Persian characters all have come
from the mind of the patient's Writer, This movie is more damaging to
Persians and no purpose other than. However, the only thing that did
not distort history and not more. If you had looked at Persepolis historical symbols only once, Fully
understand all the characters and dress and culture and created a
devastating. Xerxes is no way that someone that you've built and only
open the doors you had a history of insulting installment. In the end,
I'm not bothered because I know with such films history can never
change.
