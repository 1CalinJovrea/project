The trailer raises your expectations. The movie then shatters it!

I love this genre of movies. I was so excited to watch this movie, but
then I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did.Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal started this movie with great stunts,
killing animated beings that were designed below par. Anyway, then came
along Willam Dafoe, and well, his presence and contribution to the
entire plot were redundant. The entire plot was a poor story, poorly
animated beasts, a no-brainer solution, shi8y hot air balloons and a
mighty waste of Matt & Dafoe talent. I came back from this movie sad.
