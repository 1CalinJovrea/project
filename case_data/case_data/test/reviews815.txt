Exactly what you'd expect from the Farrelly brothers,

The Three Stooges is a brilliant,hilarious movie,its just a laugh out
loud comedy from start to finish with a great storyline,characters and
cast.The movie will take you back to the old days if you are a
dedicated fan of the original Three Stooges,but it will also entertain
kids of all ages who aren't familiar with these characters,with some up
to date stuff so the kids don't get confused,such as i-Phones and
Jersey Shore.Its exactly the kind of movie you would expect from the
Farrelly brothers,there movie this reminds me the most of is Dumb And
Dumber,which reminds of Laurel And Hardy if they where alive today,and
this movie is basically what The Three Stooges would be like alive
today.And surely if they can bring back The Three Stooges,they can
bring back Dumb And Dumber,lets hope a sequel gets made sooner than
later.Moe,Larry and Curly head on an adventure to make $830,000 to save there
orphanage where they have lived all there life.They meet a girl named
Lydia (the beautiful Sofia Vegara),who says she'll give them the money
if they kill her husband,who she pretends is very sick and wants to end
it all,but she actually wants him gone because she is having an affair
with his best friend.
