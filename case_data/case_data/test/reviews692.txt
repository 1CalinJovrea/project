Insulting Piece of Idiocy

How in God's name did Scott make a worse movie than "Alien 3"? And then
Rotten Tomatoes reviewers gives it a Fresh rating to boot. Any
skepticism I've had for that rating site being an accurate barometer
has imploded.This movie is a masterful mess. The worse thing Scott has ever done. I
won't step too much into the plot, as others have already given the
best parts of comical nonsense away. Only to say this, the movie begins
with a captain of the ship, who...is a free rock climber...who takes a
selfie video with one hand on the rock...nearly falling. This is the
man they initially send to guide a ship with "terraformers" to set up a
society. Then the second in charge...he answers a random beacon and
decides it is a better course of action to follow up on that rather
than stay the course. Dumb beyond belief.I am through with Scott. I've been a fan for decades, but the slide is
real. Like painfully real. He is treading not only over similar
material, he is gutting it and leaving the fans to rot in the sun. This
is the worse of the series and everyone involved should be ashamed. A
true crime of a movie.
