Very Disappointing!!!

I know movies are rarely as good as the book due in part to time
issues, therefore lack of details. This movie really tested my ability
to not walk out. The two largest issues for me were the casting and the
poor acting but the special effects, like the dogs, were just poorly
done. Ahh...DemetriÂ…what a let down! The worst casting of all!!! Some
of the characters didn't even match their descriptions in the book! I
was quite disappointed that the movie did not start at the beginning of
the story and was narrated quite a bit in the beginning. It seemed to
me to be a low budget film. That's really too bad because the book
series is quite an awesome page turner! I will not see the sequel(s)
and would not recommend seeing this rendition of the VA series even
when it's released on DVD.
