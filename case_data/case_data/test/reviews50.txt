Overrated

Thought I would enjoy this film, unfortunately I didn't. You could see
from a mile away that the main character was going to end up with the
other women(yawn, seen this in other films). It was too long, well it
felt like it for a 2 hr film, it kind of dragged on and on, and was
hoping for the end to arrive. Deniro has done better work than this,
Jacki weaver was good, and deserves the Oscar nom for her role, as for
Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, there was NO chemistry between
the 2 leads, I thought His character was going to end up with his
wife(ex-wife in the film), would of been interesting if they had of
gone this way instead of the predictable outcome. Long on fluff, short
on substance is Silver Linings Playbook.
