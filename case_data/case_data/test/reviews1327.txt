Why Was This Necessary?

When it comes to remaking a movie, I'm all for it if it means that
they're going to try and make a better movie out of something that
wasn't all that impressive to begin with. That being said, if the
original film was already solid or decently received by both audiences
and critics, then why bother? Flatliners was a film that was released
back in 1990, and I quite enjoy that film, even though the overall
product has many issues of its own. I didn't see the reason for a
remake, but I could see potential in improving it, so I was
open-minded. Sadly, Flatliners is one of the worst films I've seen all
year. Taking a solid premise and putting a supernatural spin on it for
absolutely no apparent reason, bothered me to no end. Here is why
Flatliners fails as both a remake and as an original piece to be shown
to a new audience. The idea of doctors being capable of flatlining people and bringing
them back to life, being able to have conversations about what death is
like and going through hallucinations as a side effect is quite
interesting; However, this version of the film becomes a supernatural
thriller by the time it reaches its third act, making for a very
confusing film, due to the fact that there is clearly no physical
entity that could ever accomplish these things. This version of this
concept just strips away anything that was exciting or intriguing about
the original film. Not to compare and contrast, but idea of Flatliners
definitely benefits from a more subdued and subtle approach to things. What bothered me was the fact that the majority of the cast seemed
capable of being subdued, but the film's screenplay was such a mess
that I found myself thinking these actors/actresses deserved better
material. In particular, Diego Luna and Ellen Page were actually very
good in their respective roles, making for a few emotionally resonant
moments, even though the lines they were given were pretty lame. Quite
honestly, with a better script, a title change, and a bit of
originality, this cast could've worked in a much better movie. Even though the performances are all decent, the fact that this cast
was a bunch of youngsters actually annoyed me. The original film was
about a group of experienced doctors who had a neat idea, and were much
more capable of being able to bring each other back to life. This time
around, it's a group of students who have just enough knowledge in
maybe being able to bring each other back. This notion alone was a
scripting mistake, because it just becomes a story about naive young
students who become obsessed with someone's experiment. I found no
attachment to any of these characters and none of them really had a
reason for wanting to die (with the exception of one or two without
spoiling anything), which left me not caring from frame one. In the end, this film benefits from a strong enough cast (for the most
part) and the concept itself is very interesting, but all you have to
do is watch the original to see how it should be done. This film tries
too many new things, and quite frankly fails at pretty much all of
them. Having terrible dialogue, an unnecessary supernatural turn of
events, and a climax that turns into a straight up horror flick, I
found myself not caring what the outcome for each of the characters
would be. The only thing redeemable about this film is the premise
itself, which has been done better in the past, so I can't recommend
this movie to anyone, but I do recommend checking out the original
Flatliners if you haven't seen it yet.
