Better than the first!!! (Warning: spoilers ahead!)

And this is why...The first How to Train Your Dragon touch the hearts of adults and
children alike. However it fell a little short in the graphics
department and had details I couldn't help but notice. For example,
why, when they have said there are multiple kinds of dragons do they
only six? Also when Toothless's tail is damaged why was there no wound
or trace of the tail flap? These are minor details when considering
this is a kids movie, and when the story makes up for its short
comings. I'm not going to give this movie slack just because it's
mainly targeted to children. If I used that as an excuse then I might
as well give Food Fight slack. (If you don't know this movie GOOD. Let
it stay that way). The only reason I say this is because I understand
it had limits because of its target audience, but even with its lower
rating the first movie did great. Then in the sequel found what was
missing in the first. This is probably because the creators had
received a bigger budget thanks to the first. The sequel takes place five years later and shows that many of the
characters have changed. The animation is a lot better and you can see
many new dragons. While the characters do change in appearance some
have the same personality as the first movie. Stoick is still hard
headed, but you can see he's truly proud of Hiccup. A few of the jokes
are ridiculous, but the overall story clearly takes more precedence. Also I want to say this; why do so many people have a problem with
Stoick dying? Did you complain when Mufasa died in the Lion King? What
about when Jack died in Titanic? Did the deaths in these movies make
you think they were terrible just because it didn't have the picture
perfect ending with everyone happy and care free? Death is a factor in
life, nothing can change that. People will get emotional about death.
This also won't change, but to say this changed how you feel about a
movie is honestly unreasonable. It carries purpose and pushes other
characters forward. I think that if Stoick got his wife back and that
it was happily ever after then it makes the movie unrealistic. That's
why I give it more points for it's choices.Overall this movie turned out to be a lot better than its predecessor.
It's worth watching and it was worth the cost of the movie theater
ticket. If you haven't seen yet you truly are missing out. Go see it.
