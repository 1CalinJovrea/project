it was fun, but not the best of the series

Ice Age: Continental Drift is funny, and i had fun watching it and
looked forward to seeing what this weird herd is up to now.It is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series and the seventh CG
production of Blue Sky Studios and the first sequel not to be directed
by Carlos Saldanha who will be directing RIO part 2.What I love must about this flick is the introduction of a partner for
Diego; a white tiger lady is added ladies and gentlemen. The movie also
has the whole fun of the old clich√©s, which I seem not to be tired of
seeing. It also showcases cool CG effect; I loved the water effect
most.The plot was educational (as long as you know it is bogus) due to
Scrat's (Squirrel) hunt for acorns he triggers the break-up of the
world continent into the continents as we know them today, which cause
Manny to lose his family.Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure to find his family,
after their continent is set adrift. Using an iceberg as a ship, they
encounter sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore a new world,
and learn why it is good to be part of a family herd, than being part
of a group where one person leads and other follow.Well, the new directors weren't that bad, as the movie did have some
fun screenplays and events that you will be thrilled to see. As we
watch this creatures move from the Ice Age to the present age the
pictures tell stories that are kinda informative and entertaining.Hey! I must have missed that geography class when they taught that
Scrat the squirrel created the whole world.Although this is not the best addition to the Ice Age series it was fun
to watch. And the movie kinda opens doors to new additional sequels.But I hope Blue Sky won't bother making any more.
