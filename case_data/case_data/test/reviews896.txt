A Bizarre Flight of Fantasy, but WOW...

I'm giving it an 8, just because I've watched it three times, and it
still has my attention...This is a rather dry and subdued look at the
potential power of the human mind, and I'm one of those ten percent
that find it fascinating...Lucy takes her boyfriend's place as a narcotics "mule", ends up with a
large bag of blue drug surgically inserted in her stomach cavity. The
bag leaks, and she begins a transformation into a super mind, with
bizarre mental powers materializing throughout the flick.Now, like I said before, this is a rather dry and bizarre movie, so it
won't appeal to a huge audience. The ending is something of a let down
for superhero fanatics, but I found it appropriate in maintaining the
subdued atmosphere...I find that I really do like this one...
