Inspiring movie

Lol.I guess you have to be slightly more sensitive than a brick to get
this movie. I was relatively bored at the start and came close to
switching it off but it developed into a very emotionally satisfying
and inspiring movie mainly thanks to the performance of the lead
actress and the character who never did give up. I don't care if it is
fictional. Maybe there were so many bad reviews because she didn't see
herself as a victim. Haters always gonna hate.
