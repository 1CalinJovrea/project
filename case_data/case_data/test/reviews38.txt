a shallow statement on passing time

Director Jim Jarmush has never made conventional genre films  after 

the unbreakable samurai code of 'Ghost Dog' or the spiritual western 

journey of 'Dead Man' it is no surprise that his 2013 vampire film is 

not really about vampires, but a certain melancholic nostalgia towards 

past times. However, 'Only Lovers Left Alive' is a shallow statement on 

passing time, and doesn't have anything new to say about modern 

society, nor vampires themselves.



Adam and Eve (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton) have been in love and 

married for centuries and haven't killed for blood for a long time, now 

surviving on blood-bank supplies, leading a long distance relationship 

 while she's in Tangier, keeping contact with fellow vampire and 

Elizabethan era poet Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) (who, according to 

the film, wrote most of Shakespeare's plays), he lives in on the 

outskirts of Detroit. Adam, having influenced numerous musicians and 

scientists throughout history has become burnt out and depressed  

hiding and making music in an apartment filled with memories of the 

past, he even considers committing suicide, resulting in Eve visiting 

him. He is disappointed in the human race, or the 'zombies', as the he 

calls them  all they do is attack their own scientists, destroy once 

beautiful buildings, fight over oil.



'Only Lovers Left Alive' is more of an insight into a few days of its 

characters than a film with an actual plot. While the vampires live in 

present day, they deny modern life and apart from using iPhones and 

Youtube they manage to be isolated from society. They hardly encounter 

other vampires  the only one with different values is Eve's younger 

sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) who still lives the irresponsible, 

murderous lifestyle of older times. During a visit Ava kills Adam's 

'zombie' helper and friend Ian, forcing the couple to fly (by plane, as 

most mythical vampire qualities are excluded) to Tangier, where they 

witness Marlowe, the old vampire's death due to blood poisoning. The 

film ends when, weakened by blood-withdrawal, they are forced to kill a 

human couple.



Jarmush bases his story on the idea that our present is corrupted, 

longing more for the 1960s than for the centuries before, making the 

film seem more of a hippie swan song than the summary of the timeless 

pain of the immortal. The old character's death is predictable even in 

this transcendent level of existence, Ava's rebellion is not important 

enough to support the concept. While more recent vampire love stories 

like 'Let the Right One In' or 'Thirst' add to the romantic, tragic 

quality of being immortal, 'Only Lovers Left Alive' focuses on its main 

point, name-dropping historical and cultural references and 

occasionally explaining the plot by characters talking to themselves. 

While the two main actors offer great performances and some of the 

scenes (such as the hospital sequences) are a great mixture of Gothic 

and modern elements, it is safe to say that Jarmush was not able to 

fill the screenplay's plot holes and hardly touches on points regarding 

its concept that would require a lot more screen time.
