Very well made film...dark and expressive.

I almost DID NOT watch this movie due to the fact that the horrible
reviews were really horrible and those people seemed to absolutely hate
this film.I decided to give it a shot anyway and I am certainly glad I
did. I sat down to watch the film expecting it to be bad and it was
not. I loved it. The acting the was spot on, the characters flawless in
their representation. The plot was extremely interesting. The movie as
a whole was captivating. The only thing I hated about it is that it was
over. It's not an action-packed, explode in your face kind of film.
It's thought provoking, dark and highly enjoyable. I am glad I gave it
a chance. It's a film more than deserving of the time I spent watching
it and one I will own for myself.
