Masterful cinematography, bravura acting and classic production design can't save old hat tale of lesbian romance

Unlike the sentimental melodrama "Brooklyn," Director Todd Haynes has
fashioned a more salacious tale based on Patricia Highsmith's 1952
novel "The Price of Salt" (later named "Carol"). Like his predecessor,
Douglas Sirk, the grandmaster of the 1950s melodrama, you can always
count on Haynes to deliver the goods in terms of brilliant
cinematography, bravura acting (this time provided by Cate Blanchett
and Rooney Mara) as well as a production design that magnificently
recreates the heady days of the early 1950s, just as Dwight D.
Eisenhower ascends the "throne" of the American presidency for the
first time. Despite all the positives, why then is "Carol" simply
"average" and mediocre to boot?When Highsmith's novel came out in 1952, a lesbian romance was
considered fairly scandalous. Indeed, when the film's protagonist,
Carol Aird, begins a lesbian affair with salesgirl Therese Belivet, the
villain of the piece, Carol's rather mean and pathetic husband, Harge,
invokes a "morality clause," permitting him to gain full custody of the
couple's young daughter, Rindy, without the possibility of Carol having
any visitation rights. Carol's ensuing decision to get away from it all and inviting Therese
on a sensual whirlwind of a cross country car trip may have been
shocking for 1950s readers, but today it feels like old hat. We're
supposed to get excited about the two lovers' intense desire for one
another but what's so original about a lesbian romance? It's simply not
enough on which to hang your hat on for an entire movie. True, at the
midpoint, there is a welcome plot twist involving Harge, who hires a
private investigator to tape record Carol and Therese as they make love
in the "presidential suite" of a cheap motel. But what happens after that? Spoilers AHEAD. Carol goes back to Harge
but eventually (wouldn't you know it?) is unable to shake her love and
lust for dear Therese, and it's postulated at the climax that indeed
they will once again reunite. The uncreative ending -- which really
needed some kind of extraordinary twist -- leaves the two lovers
staring at one another in a fancy hotel restaurant, as the screen fades
to black. I suppose the non-stop "passion" between the two principals
is what has seduced both critics and the average film-goer alike into
declaring that this is some kind of masterpiece. But in reality Mr.
Haynes should be applauded only for creating an impressive atmosphereÂ—
mere attraction (no matter how intense it is), is not enough for us to
care about characters that are in need of much more detailed
development.
