Great film.

Jack Reacher was a surprisingly fantastic film. I went in thinking,
thanks to some slightly misleading trailers, that this was going to be
a high octane action movie with a bunch of gun fights, car chases, and
explosions but little development and quality. I was completely wrong.
While there were a few gun fights, one car chase, and an explosion of
sorts, it was done in a completely different manner and was more of an
action thriller. Tom Cruise did a great job in his typical role. The
rest of the supporting cast was solid enough and the cameo by Robert
Duvall was awesome. The plot developed really well and made it more of
a "thinking movie" than I anticipated. That being said, the turns in
the plot kept the film from becoming stagnant or boring and the action
sequences felt real and authentic. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the
cinematic elements and there were some flaws in one of the plot twists
but nothing that really hurt the movie-watching experience. All-in-all,
I'd say this was a great movie that most people would very much enjoy
watching.
