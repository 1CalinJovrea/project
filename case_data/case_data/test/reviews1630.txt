Insulting

*** May contain spoilers, proceed at your own risk ***I'm part of the 95% of the world population who is not a resident of
the USA and I found this film insulting. A drug user, adrenaline junkie
who chooses risk before discipline, a social derelict takes himself to
the brink of death in chase of an adrenaline rush. Undoubtedly, the
central character is a strong and able man, but he's also
irresponsible. In every other place but pampered "America" the guy
should be maggot food. Lacking basic survival equipment --a good jacket
with a hood, a basic magnetic $10 compass, a disposable gas lighter or
flint striker, an emergency small backpack (costing probably $10) with
a modicum of survival elements like a space blanket, a few energy bars
and a $20 rescue kit- plainly qualifies as stupidity. Darwin's Law
applies. Being rescued by a million dollar helo, factual or not,
insults the rest of the world who would never have the chance to expect
that. Consequences: Fair cost to irresponsibility.
