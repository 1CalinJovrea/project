Wasteland in more ways than one

Spoilers Ahead: If you have seen Tron:Legacy the director's earlier
piece of tripe then save yourself the boredom. Is it possible for these
people to develop their characters for say all of fifteen minutes
before mayhem ensues? Do people under 40 like their movie characters to
interact at all besides running shooting yelling and everything
exploding every five minutes? Cruise mails in his usual aging reluctant
hero crap that is growing older then even he appears to be. Victoria's
character seems to think the deer in the headlights look is how concern
is to be delineated to convey great worry. They are Pacino and Streep
next to Olga who sounds like she is reading her lines from an off
screen teleprompter. The sheer boredom which is the first half of the
film Jack tooling about the CGI wasteland repairing drones induced many
people to go get refreshments why not? Will you miss anything? I could
have made a sandwich from scratch, balanced my checkbook.Here is a slight problem: do not trick your viewers by ridiculous plot
twists by having the humans all dressed and sounding like aliens when
the Jack clones for some glitch i do not know maybe there is gas in the
hoses up at the TET your guess is as good as mine fill in the blank an
AI that is thousands of years ahead of us and clones Jack while leaving
his sympathy for humans intact? The lame reason for their concealing
their humanity within alien apparel and communication evoked laughter
in my cinema when Beech babbles it out. Oh yes that would fool galaxy
travelling aliens 100,000 years ahead of us. Hey that makes sense. This
is because intellectually the FACEBOOK generation of screenwriters
simply lacks the grey matter to write plot twists thematically with the
slightest degree of believability.Believe me if u can clone dumb asses who believe everyone is a billion
miles away in the absolute zero environment of frozen Titan i think you
might be able to purge their humanity without such a moronic reason for
making survivors disguise themselves as aliens to fool the audience.
Why is Victoria a lobotomized robot and Jack a soul searching
philosopher full of doubt? Does the TET have two different machines for
cloning and one is on the fritz? Gas in the hoses? Maybe Jack had the
chili before his capture? I love the feeble attempt to import roman
philosophy to lend intellectuality to comic book level writing. Trust
me if the philosopher were living he would must assuredly sue take it
from a living philosopher. The ending is the piece de resistance of this piece of crap. The TET is
apparently devoid of sensors to detect large deadly amounts of energy
within Jack's approaching craft. We saw this in Independence Day yes
travel light years or fold space but just could not afford the full
sensor array was not on sale this week. sorry. The other reviewer is
right about gender detection also a slight problem. The TET evidently
got the bargain basement sensor package cannot notice huge amounts of
concealed energy in that heavily shielded life boat? Must be solid lead
sure looked like it. Yes please a giant HAL lets not even go there. I
felt so sorry for cruise what a disaster. Save your time and money
watch Tron:Legacy over again explosions kung fu shootings fights
yelling it is all there the core items that make todays films such a
treat.
