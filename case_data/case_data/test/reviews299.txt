Fun, Funny and Fantastically enjoyable.

Absolutely Anything isn't the kind of film that would win awards, nor
will it come in on the top 100 films of all time, but that's not its
goal; it is a fun film with a lot of acting talent including Robin
Williams in his final role before his untimely death and the members of
Monty Python in voice over roles. Simon Pegg is a likable guy surviving on a teachers salary as he tries
to write a novel and trying to woo the girl of his dreams, and failing
miserably but then fate... or in this case aliens throws him a hand.This movie was made to be just a bit of fun, it's not trying to rewrite
the art of film making and it also doesn't rely on the over top, gross
out humour that we've become accustomed to lately. I found each joke landed well, and gave full belly laughs many times
throughout the film. It wasn't offensive or rude and was rife with
British humour. Absolutely Anything deserves so much higher ratings, it is a fun way to
spend 1.25 hours.
