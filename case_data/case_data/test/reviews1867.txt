Not as funny as the first, the magic is wearing off

I was so looking forward to Ted 2 after really enjoying the first one.What a disappointment!Basically Ted is married to a hot girl and tries to get a baby to save
his marriage. However it all goes wrong and Ted is investigated and the
state say he is not a person so he loses all his rights job and
marriage. Ted than has a court battle to prove he is a person which he
eventually wins with the help of John his best buddy and girlfriend
lawyer. Such a boring plot really bad. The old enemy Donny tries to get
Ted as he is regarded as just Property, in attempt to make Hasbro rich
- this gets foiled by john who saves TedThere are some funny bits to the movie, like Jurassic park bit where
they see cannabis field and some good one linersHowever the film is looking and trying far too hard for jokes for every
line in the movie - rather than naturally funny they try all the time
to make one liners a lot of them not that funny.The cute factor of Ted is wearing off and the magic too, I was so bored
after the first hour I wanted to leave, the jokes and sarcasm were so
predictable.Hopefully no more Ted films but you can guarantee they will make Ted 3
just for the money.Next time have a good plot and story this was very weak.
