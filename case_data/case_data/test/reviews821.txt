A ton of Colors and Criativity

One of many done in good crop of animations that cinema is providing
increasingly more often. A definitive example of smart and edgy script,
which can enjoy brilliantly the legacy of one of the most popular toys
of all time. A universe that seems to come from a psychedelic hallucination in
breakneck pace, is narrated the journey of Emmet, the most common Lego
character, that quiet life amidst the building blocks, will become a
true hero. Masterfully using the resources of dystopian fiction plus lots of
humor, and a visual that never fails to impress, "The LEGO Movie" is
tailor- made for generations accustomed to the pace of video games,
that with quite a collection of characters charismatic , a ton of
colors and creativity, will deliciously take you until the surprising
and affectionate outcome that celebrates the power of childish
imagination.
