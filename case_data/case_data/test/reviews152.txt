Oscar worthy

This movie premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival
yesterday and today was the second screening, to overwhelming crowds.
What an amazing, mesmerizing production, phenomenal acting. The crowd
relived the agony of the Armenian people and felt like they were part
of the events in the movie. The movie absorbed the audience by the sad
events, love stories and the sacrifices of the people and transported
us back to 1915. Bravo to the director and the entire cast for being
part of history to make the whole world be aware. The director, the
movie and the entire cast is Oscar worthy. History is repeating itself
today in Syria because generations of people were lied to by their
governments. Education is key ... not ignorance. Open your eyes and see
what a handful of dreadful people did to those living on their own
land.
