Unexpectedly Good

I have no high expectations when i heard this movie. All I know is this
movie stars the great Vin Diesel, about witches and an seemingly awful
trailer. Yeah, it's a sign for a bad movie.But the movie eventually delivers a fun ride that no one would ever
expect, thanks to the spoiler-free trailer (which also awfully bad at
the same time). Vin Diesel's performance was incredible, like his Fast
and Furious persona. Michael Caine's acting was also still awesome as
always. The film also has twists, something that I couldn't imagine
before. Overall a good experience by the wayAlthough with solid performance and a fun story. The film still has
several mistakes. The storyline itself was confusing (in my opinion) so
it's no surprise that people may not understand the story at first
glance. The CGI still can be spotted easily, but several CGI involved
scenes were spectacular. The plague in form of million of bees(?) were
jaw breaking. The lack of humour in this movie, in my opinion, for me
makes this movie not really enjoyable. The film also has several plot
holes (once again, it's in my opinion, everyone's view to this movie
are different)But overall, this movie is a fun ride to be watch. For die hard Vin
Diesel fans, this is a movie for you!Final Score: 7/10
