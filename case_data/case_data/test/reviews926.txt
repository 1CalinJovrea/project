Save the movie theatres from movies like Knock Knock!

Eli Roth is back! Eli Roth is back! Eli Roth is back with a movie that
might just be worse than all the other dreadful crap he made. If he
thought that the status and talent of Keanu Reeves was going to save a
script that can have only been written by a ten-year-old, well, maybe
he should stop thinking altogether. Knock Knock, a cheap copy of Funny Games, Fatal Attraction, and god
knows what else,, is a sexual but not sexy thriller that tells the
story of Bel and Genesis, two "Femme fatales" that wreck not just the
home of a married Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) but also his life. First and foremost, Genesis and Bel are far from being femme fatales. A
femme fatale has a certain look. A femme fatale uses and hypnotizes a
man and with it has the ability to get him to do anything she wants him
to do. A femme fatale is a woman a man would do just about anything
for. A femme fatale is a woman whose sex appeal is so deadly that just
looking at her will make anyone, even the viewer, drool. I don't see
any of that in Knock Knock. Yes, they are "attractive" in their own
way, and being all wet from rain certainly adds to that, as most guys
would say, but that is where it all ends. I do however have to admit that the first act that focuses on the
seduction was pretty believable. The girls sure know how to seduce a
man. But even that ends as the story progresses (or not so much). The
performances by Lorenza Izzo ( Misses Roth) and Ana de Armas made me
want to knit my eyelids close. It was forced, amateur, risible. Maybe
they should take some more acting classes. Keanu Reeves is the only reason this movie is not going to get the same
rating all his other trash movies got. But even this does not have a
happy ending. While Keanu Reeves is an actor with class and talent,
Knock Knock should have not been on his "to do list." I felt so bad for
him for having had to memorize such awful, on the nose dialogue. If he
hadn't been Keanu Reeves the great actor and had been a newcomer
instead, Knock Knock would have closed the career doors for him. I guess the lack of good acting in Knock Knock takes us back to the
directing. Eli Roth compares himself to the great ones like Hitchcock,
Polanski, Tarantino. Eli Roth claims that he is still growing as a
director, and developing his style / taste. There is no such thing as
"growing as a director." You either have the skill, or you don't have
it. If you make ten crappy movies (like Hostel and everything else he
made) , please don't try to come back twenty years later with a copy
movie and claim that you can still convince people of your
"hallucinated directing skills." Here comes the worst part: As the IMDb states, Knock Knock was written by three writers: Eli Roth,
Nicolas Lopez, and Guillermo Amoedo. It looks like Roth works with these writers on all of his movies. But
what surprises me is that none of the movies they wrote together ever
received superb reviews / ratings. They can't write. The stories are
predictable. The dialogues are boring and on the nose. They fill their
stories with clich√©s and cheap jokes. So, this is it. Knock Knock. A movie that should have not been made. It
would have spared many people's eyes from seeing such trash.
