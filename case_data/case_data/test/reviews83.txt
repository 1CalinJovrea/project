It is super-bad, over-hyped and ratings are fake!

If you believe this movie is good, you may as well believe crap tastes
like chocolate.This movie is for 8-10 year old's. Vol1 appealed to more mature
audience, this does not. So much cringe. So-so-so cheesy. Yes, 99% of
this movie is effects, but I don't think CGI alone this days live up to
bring this one to 8+ rating. It's fake. It will go down, after the
marketing hype and rating bots will fade away.Watch it online later. It is not worth going to cinema.
