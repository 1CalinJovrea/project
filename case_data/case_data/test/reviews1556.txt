Promoting fascistic perfectionism.

It amazes me that a movie that promotes such level of fascistic
perfectionism gets so much praise. I say fascistic because the sick
perfectionism of Nazis was one of the main reasons they thought it is
OK to gas millions of people. If you are not perfect based on our
standards you don't deserve to live. This movie tells us if you are not Charlie Parker I feel free to
humiliate you, insult you, hurt you and abuse you, and it is all
justified because if you are Charlie Parker you don't mind this level
of sick manipulation. What a disgusting message. Yes, the actors did a
good job playing these sick characters, and the movie was well made,
which makes it even more dangerous.
