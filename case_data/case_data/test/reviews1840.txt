Stick to the road

Never read up on this so went in blind.What I found was tense and well done affair that gave as much as it
promised.Kept up the tension all the way and some of the cinematography
and audio really brought the theatre to life.Able acting all the way through and had just enough jumps to stop it
getting predictable. Well directed and great script...some of the
banter was really well done and made us all giggle.The set pieces containing flashbacks and hallucinations were very very
well done. I've read some reviews about a so called silly ending, bur
for me I thought the ending was in the vain of the movie.It brought back to me last years Blair Witch with the camera- work..did
i see that? ..what was that ?? Very well done indeed. Well worth a trip
with your partner as they will be clung to you from the off set. Will
keep an eye on the director for more. I gave it a 6 and not a 7 because
of the ending..it wasn't silly but maybe could have explained a bit
more.
