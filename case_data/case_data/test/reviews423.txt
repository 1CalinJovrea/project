A Brilliant Tough Thought Provoking Movie

I do not care what anyone says, this movie is great, and in my mind it
is amazing. This movie is not the standard bad drug cartel movie, with
way too much action, bad story-line, and bad dialogue. This movie is a
dark thriller with very few bad things about it. I personally think
that Denis Villenueve proves he is one the best directors of our time
with this movie, and of course with Incendies, Enemy, Prisoners, and
now Arrival which is probably his best movie yet.Denis Villenueve shows that whatever subject he may pick, he will do it
with grace, style, and the best way he can. He really outshines himself
in this movie as a director, the cinematography is some of the best I
remember seeing in a long time, and makes the action scenes so great.
The story is dark, but amazing, so trying not to spoil anything
important, here is a short resume. The main character Kate Macer is leading a kidnap response team in
Phoenix, after witnessing what the Mexican cartel has done in her own
city, she is recruited to a CIA Special Ops team in Juarez Mexico,
dealing specifically with the Mexican drug cartel. She soon find out
that the rules in Juarez Mexico is very different from the ones in
Phoenix, and has to learn how to deal with the much tougher
environment.There is much more to it, but since it also is a mystery I am being
careful not to say to much. The story is in my mind amazing, and it
keeps getting better by each minute. It is a very dark story, but
nonetheless it is one of the best stories I have seen in a long time.
Emily Blunt in my view, gave her best performance yet, showing what she
can do given a good script. Benicio Del Toro gives a chilling
performance, that may also be his best performance yet, but it is hard
to say, since he has gotten so many amazing roles. There is also many
other great performances like Josh Brolin, John Bernthal, Daniel
Kaluuya, Victor Garber, and many others.I am gonna finish by saying this is one of my own personal favorite
movies and I would recommend it to almost everyone I know. I hope this
review was helpful, and I hope you will love the movie as much as I
did. 9/10
