Modern approach to a classic.

Hate to be clich√© voting this 7/10 but thought it was appropriate for a
film of this nature.I was sceptical, like I imagine many were, when I first heard they were
remaking The Magnificent Seven since the original is such a classic.
Being a fan of westerns in particular, I will jump at the chance to see
a western in the cinema.I really don't think this was a bad movie by any stretch of the
imagination. It upholds some originality rather than just blindly
following the original script and attempts a more modern and socially
aware approach. This approach I do not necessarily agree with as it
comes across far too forced at times, like they were attempting to
recognise as many different races or even 'minorities' as possible.It was cheesy at times, there is no doubt about this, but classically
westerns were styled this way, being melodramatic at times and maybe
one too many standoffs with intense close ups of characters staring at
each other. In a way I like this though. I thought it paid almost
tribute to the classic westerns of the 1950s and 60s. The famous
lighting another mans cigar' scene was a pretty neat addition, and
instantly reminded me of 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'.The build up was worth it too was an awesome showdown and shootout,
lots of well delivered performances and cleverly directed fight scenes.
Not a bad film at all but definitely not a masterpiece. Worth your time
if you're a fan of the genre.
