Refreshing Vince Vaughn

Best action film of 2017 in my book so far.... Wasn't sure what to
expect when I started watching but the trailer peaked my interest
(which is hard to do). Within the first 10 minutes of the film I was
able to get a sense of what was to come and the sheer intensity
portrayed by Vince Vaughn's character was mesmerizing. I felt like the
film flowed really well with great acting by Vince and above average
cinematography. The violence in the film was extreme but went along
with the story. The ending was slightly disappointing at first, but
after letting the film marinate in my head I decided it definitely
wrapped up the whole story in a complete package. Don't be surprised if
you want to go take some boxing classes after watching this...
