I was embarrassed to be seen at this movie

How can I fully express my total disappointment in this film? It may
not be possible. I am one of those who actually liked the first Grown
Ups. It had a plot, good characters and lots of fun. The sequel, on the
other hand, is pointless, stupid, juvenile, and insulting. Not one
redeeming quality in the entire movie. I contemplated leaving after the
first 15 minutes! I forced myself to stay just to see if this mess
would get any better. It didn't. The jokes concern nude men, homosexual
men, brainless women, sex, bodily functions (over and over again!), and
more of the same, repeatedly. No story, no acting, no thought, no
point. I was the first one out of the theater and never looked back.What a total waste of time.
