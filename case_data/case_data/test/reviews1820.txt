Sleek Legal Drama With Great Performances and Excellent Screenplay

Marshall is a sleek legal drama with great performances from Chadwick
Boseman as the title character and Josh Gad. Don't be fooled by the
snazzy vintage costumes, the real heart of Marshall's success is its
screenplay and the chemistry between its lead actors.This film follows pioneering Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in
his earlier years as a lawyer for the NAACP. A white socialite in
Greenwich, Connecticut, accuses a black man of rape and attempted
murder. The NAACP believes the man, Joseph Spell, is innocent and sends
Marshall to defend him. Marshall enlists local lawyer Sam Friedman
(Josh Gad) whose previous track record involves tax or insurance cases.
Friedman worries about his family's safety due to the unrest the
controversial trial causes. Sam and Thurgood must work together to
defend SpellÂ…and each other.This film is very good and so is its screenplay. The touches of comedy
bring a welcome balance to its serious topic and difficult history.
There is an array of good lines for Boseman and Gad. Several other
actors get a chance to shine as well. I appreciate that Marshall takes
its subjects seriously, but doesn't take on a dreary tone doing it. The
scenes in the courtroom are intense and keep you interested in the
action. As the case develops, these scenes get more and more engaging.While Boseman is very good as Thurgood Marshall, his performance is
disappointing considering how hyped his portrayal has been in the
film's ad campaign. He gives Marshall a suave personality but the
script limits his ability to show off his range and really take the
character on a journey. On the other hand, Josh Gad is a standout as
Sam Friedman. He plays to his comedic strengths as Marshall's sidekick
while also giving a genuinely good dramatic performance as a central
and evolved character. He is a nice foil to Boseman and their chemistry
reminds me of a buddy cop comedy.The lesson I take from the film is that you have to follow your moral
compass even when it's hard. Sam's unwillingness to join the case makes
sense. He is just starting out and worried that it could ruin his
reputation. The fact that he does it anyway is a testament to the
person Friedman must have been in real life. I give Marshall an age rating of 14 to 18 because of some racial and
offensive language and suggestive and violent content, including
depictions of the alleged assault. And my verdict on Marshall? 4 out of
5 stars. Marshall opens in theaters on October 13, 2017 so go check it
