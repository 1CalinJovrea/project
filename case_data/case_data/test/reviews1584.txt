If this is how kids get kidnapped - cause of stupid parents

This is the worst recreation of a parents actions to a kidnapping. Her
thoughtlessness got him kidnapped, there's no reason she faced the way
she did. I had my kid at parks and playgrounds, but you can still keep
an eye out. Sure kids can wander away, but this wasn't the case, it was
all her. Then her bad pursuit got them to get away, there's reviews
that stated she didn't stop the kidnapper car cause they showed her a
(spoiler) knife!! She was right behind them on a slow moving ramp, she
has a van pull in front of them and block them. The knife scene was
much later. Don't she know how to use a van. Her frantic actions were
understandable but the way she pulled it off was pathetic, the writing
was really bad. People without common sense would enjoy this.
