Turn off your brain, relax and enjoy the action ride!!

We've asked for a real Die Hard movie, for a very long time.We've asked for a real R rated action movie, for a while.We've asked for a decent and crazy actioner for a long time.There you have it. Olympus Has Fallen is the movie that has everything
you were waiting to see. Thankfully, Bruce Willis is on vacation ( just
like he claimed several times, in Die Hard 5). So, he is nowhere to be
seen, thankfully. We have a good amount of violence, shootouts and
action.It's important and really honest if you like the movie for what it is,
a fun, crazy and silly action movie with some good lines and some good
acting. So, like it for what it is, but don't hate it for what it
isn't. It's not meant to be a serious, edgy and visceral movie. It's
Die Hard in White House, plain and simple.You'll find the same old plot holes that similar movies had, but don't
be scared. The flaws won't take away the fun you'll have with the
flick.The movie is not for kids or babies. It's very violent and they don't
hold any punch regarding the display of violence and brutality on
screen. Woman, men, that doesn't matter. Headshots, impalings,
explosions and lots of deaths. That's about it.Don't walk to the cinema, expecting to see a serious and complex
thriller. This is a action movie that doesn't stop until its ending.
You have 25 minutes of "building up" and after that, the action is
pretty much nonstop.Yeah, you'll see patriotism, but then again, a movie about the White
Houlse wouldn't forget anything about it.Finally: Go watch it for the action and some of the acting.
