Blows the doors off the guns and drugs Iran Contra Scandal

By Terry Reed, Author of Compromised: Clinton, Bush and the CIA. It
finally happened. The complex core of my book Compromised, the CIA's
covert guns and drugs debacle cleverly mislabeled the Iran Contra
Scandal, has hit the big screen thanks to the efforts of Universal
Studios, Director Doug Liman, Screen Writer Gary Spinelli, Tom Cruise
and a host of professionals. Liman told me he was attracted to this
project as a result of insider information he gleaned from his father
Arthur Liman, Chief Counsel for the US Senate's investigation of the
Iran Contra affair.As the person who wrote the original, first hand and definitive book on
the Barry Seal/Mena, Arkansas operation, from the inside, I was the
most skeptical critic the movie had to win over since I had lived much
of the Mena ordeal right along side Barry SealÂ…the movie's main
character played by Cruise.Sure, there are major deviations from the historical record of what
happened in Mena, and the screenwriter exercised his dramatic license
combining characters and blending together events for the purpose of
cramming this sordid story into 120 minutes of educational
entertainment. But that's Hollywood.As someone who worked with several major Hollywood production companies
and screen writers (Clint Eastwood and Dennis Hackin just to drop
names) who attempted to bring Compromised to the theaters, I realize
how difficult it is find that balance between authenticity,
entertainment, time constraints and marketability. Doug Liman has done
just that! Those I worked with who attempted to whittle Compromised
down to an understandable narrative were most often left with a
docudrama type product that in most cases over-reflected the political
bend of the whittlers. Just as the title of my book suggests, the Iran
Contra scandal and the subsequent unraveling of a CIA covert operation
run amuck impacts both political parties. Sure, most will argue that
Hollywood is liberal and most likely to err on the side of
protect-the-Democrats at all costs, but let's face it, the vast
majority of the guns and drugs scandal imbedded within the Mena/Contra
support program falls directly into Republican laps. Again, Liman did a
superb job of staying true to the Mena geographical location and then
suggesting strongly that then-Governor Bill Clinton had a hand in it
when the US Attorney's efforts to apprehend Seal in Arkansas are
thwarted.But alas, two hours is a short time to compress history, relay
intricate information into a comprehensible story line and then
ultimately deal with the life and fate of Cruise's character, pilot
Barry Seal. Cruise for the most part is receiving accolades for his
Seal portrayal, and I agree American Made underscores that occasionally
Cruise can move outside of his Mission Impossible persona and
reacquaint us with the depths of his talent.I must say how rewarding it is to have consulted on the movie with Doug
Liman and his staff, and to see how he wove the nuances I provided into
the scenes in such an authentic and unobtrusive way. The Contra
training camp and mile-high-club scene are just a few of those nuggets
that cause the screenplay to frequently place foot on terra firma.Debbie Seal, the real life widow of Barry who unfortunately is being
forced to relive this tragic chapter of her life by watching her
husband's demise, saw the movie in a different light. She reminded me
that Barry was double-crossed by the Reagan White House which not only
resulted in her husband's death by Pablo Escobar, but also forced her
to raise their three children alone. Debbie compared it to Jacqueline
Kennedy watching a movie of the JFK assassination. A grim reality
check.The Mena/Iran Contra scandal resulted in many of us falling into the
category of "disposable assets" and being falsely labeled when a covert
White House back door operation ran amuck, and we became political
liabilities. Much of what we suffered through was the result of
cowardly behavior on behalf of the Reagan/Bush Administrations who knew
full well that many of us who were recruited for this covert operation
were "left in the cold" and disavowed when this violation of
Congressional Law (The Boland Amendment) became public knowledge. Most
of us were Vietnam Veterans who had skill sets needed for the operation
and felt honored to be selected to become part of a CIA backed Air
America style operation.This is where I do take exception to the movie plot line. Many of us,
myself included, had nothing to do with the transportation of illegal
narcotics into America. We were briefed on Barry Seal's multi-prong,
multi-agency (DEA, and US Customs undercover activities penetrating the
Medellin Cartel that included "controlled deliveries" of cocaine)
operation but the vast majority of us were tasked with the difficult
and dangerous work of training the Contras to build out their own
guerilla warfare weapons air delivery system and delivering both
munitions and humanitarian aid in a war zone. The movie had two
different opportunities to move deeper in this direction, but I presume
time constraints kept the plot line humming along in the direction it
took.All in all it is a great first effort to bring the Iran Contra scandal
to the movie theaters. It is about flawed human nature, war, life,
death and the seedy behavior of politicians and the alphabet soup
federal agencies that violate their own codes of ethics and
policies,all in the guise of National Security.If you haven't seen American Made do so. But I must brief you. Fasten
your seat belt, stow your tray table and get ready for an exciting,
educational and turbulent flight.P.S. Thank you Doug Liman for your satchel charge effort to blow the
doors off this scandal. Iran Contra still screams out for an in-depth
and tell-all docudrama production that lets the political fall-out
descend as it may and truly takes no prisoners. I am currently working
on that project.
