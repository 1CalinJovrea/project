Saw the trailer? There's no need to watch the movie then.

Good idea that failed in execution. If you saw the trailer and read the
reviews you might think that there's some depth hiding in the actual
movie, but unfortunately, you'll be wrong to think so. The actors are
the only bright spot. You'll see some well known and rising star faces
who's acting was on point. The movie tries to win you with likable
characters, scenes that show familiar problems to most internet users
(e.g.Skype call glitching) and with a cute little morale story at the
end but fails as it provides no depth to be discovered. Some scenes are
super cringe worthy and left me feeling uncomfortable about my movie
picking skills.It's just one of those films you watch and forget about in a day,
doesn't leave you questioning some character's decisions or the way it
ended which left both me and my girlfriend disappointed. Overall 5/10.
