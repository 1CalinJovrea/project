'Fantastic Four': The Movie Where Nothing Happens!

'Fantastic Four' has always been a fun comic book. Ever since the early
60s, these four heroes have entertained us in each crime fighting,
earth saving, and alien destroying issue. With Reed Richards, Johnny
and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm, there was nothing that these four
couldn't handle. One of my favorite story arcs was from the mid-2000's
where Ultimate Fantastic Four had to deal with zombies. It was an
excellent storyline, one that I wish will be told on the big screen at
some point. Speaking of the big screen, the Fantastic Four have never
seen a good adaptation.There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies),
which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a
friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film
fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's
terrible. Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the
'Barbershop' movies was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic
Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was awful and that
Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at
least the most talked about. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel
properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is
still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that
studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise.That brings us up to date with 2015's 'Fantastic Four', which is a
movie where nothing happens for 100 minutes. The studio hired Josh
Trank to direct the film. Trank's only other credit was the "found
footage" superhero film 'Chronicle' which had its good moments, but
supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was
booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had
going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like
it's one long set up for something yet to come. Over 95% of the film
takes place inside a science lab where we see Reed Richards (Miles
Teller) , Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and
Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) building a teleportation device and typing fast
on a computer rather than using any powers or participating in an
action sequence of any kind.Then there is Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who of course is Dr. Doom
and is evil for really no real reason. Maybe he's angry because his
name is Victor Von Doom. It's never really explained. For a movie that
is really 100 minute of an origin story that is supposed to run deep
with character development, we really learned nothing about any of the
characters at all other than that Sue loves to listen to her iPod, Reed
can type fast on a computer, Johnny likes to race 90's rice rockets,
and that Grimm may or may not enjoy his new rock body. That is
literally the character's story arcs. Sure they come together and
travel thru their teleportation device to another dimension after one
of the monkeys from 'Dawn of the Plant of the Apes' does, but that's
about it. It's not until the final 45 seconds of the film where we see
some fraction of a team forming.I get that this is the start of something new and a big origin set up
for future films, but there has to be something at stake here and some
sort of conflict. Unfortunately, there isn't, other than at the end of
the movie, there is a small crater in a rural area.The only good moment
of the film was seeing Dr. Doom show his sadistic and violent powers,
but it was over way too quick and was met with some bad directing. Then
there is a the issue of the script, which is just terrible. I've seen
better dialogue the 'Sharknado' films than I did here with 'Fantastic
Four'. Most of the movie is just someone shouting what's happening on
screen and what they should do to fix it. It was cringe worthy,
complete with Ben Grimm yelling his actions as he's executing it in
full on Thing mode. This is a shame too, because there are some very
talented actors here who aren't given anything good to work with. My
advice is to wait a few more years until Fox gives up the rights to
Marvel so that we get a real origin story to this great superhero team.AVOID THIS MOVIE!
