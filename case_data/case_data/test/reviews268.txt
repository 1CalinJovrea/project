This movie is brilliant, period!

I saw The Book of Henry about a week ago and wrote a very deep and
honest review/analysis. Unfortunately, since many things in your life
don't go the way you'd expect I wasn't able to publish it anywhere
because it was over 2,000 words long!! And do you know what the best
part is? There wasn't one bad word about the movie almost all critics
tried to kill. So I decided I'd try harder this time - I sat down,
re-watched it and now I'm here writing this. To sum up what was in that 2k words long review just so you don't
suffer from not knowing what I've spent that much time on:This movie is brilliant, period!Well, now you know everything necessary to proceed further. I might
have forgotten to say that this review is going to be biased and if you
got a problem with that go watch a cartoon. There is so much nonsense coming from all the "professional" reviewers
that I just have to share a few secrets with them (by secrets I mean
pretty obvious things these for sure very kind people miss by default).
The first thing you have to realize is that (bummer incoming!!!) this
movie is not about Henry (weird since his name appears in the title
huh?). It could be but then you could end the movie when he died (yes
spoilers read the warning sign?) and that'd be it. So my question is
which character is there from start to finish and gets from nowhere to
somewhere? Bingo, it's Susan. Remember how she had no control over her
life in the beginning of the movie? She was childish, indecisive and
probably couldn't even live on her own since Henry was the one making
most of their money. After the tragic event halfway into the movie we
see her going somewhat crazy not only because she couldn't handle the
pain but also because she didn't know how to live. Things needed to
change and Henry knew that before died so he came up with a plan -
that's what the critics unleashed their wrath toward pointing out how
bad, unrealistic and clumsy it was. Come on people seriously? How many
of them complain when Sherlock or House knows everything about a
stranger in a few seconds just by looking at them (and by the way yes
I'm comparing a genius to a genius you wanna tell me that's a crime?)?
Then why do so many people go nuts when a brilliant 11- year-old who
can make millions of dollars on the stock market, plans a perfect
murder and gives detailed instructions to his mom (whom he's known for
his lifetime so no doubt he can predict her responses and behavior
patterns)? Finally, the finale was absolutely terrific and for those
who say it ruined the movie are ruined themselves. At first, I was kind
of surprised by it too. Honestly, I would've been completely happy if
she'd just shot him and thus proved that Henry was right and could rest
in peace. But remember what I said 300 words back (it's okay we got
time)? This movie is about Susan, not Henry. By pulling the trigger
she would've acted like Henry's pawn yet again. By making a decision
based on what she thought was right she was able to figure herself out
and overcome her sadness about Henry's death. Alright, enough of this!
I still got some space left so if you came here just for some general
quality descriptions (as that's something everybody's dying to read for
some reason) this will for sure fulfill your needs.Acting - everyone is great and absolutely authentic, now to be more
specific: Naomi Watts - 100% believable and beautiful; Jacob Tremblay -
does magic (haha quite literally), sad scenes with him will make you
cry; Jaeden Lieberher - (Jacob Tremblay)2, sad scenes with him (and
without him!!) will make you cry more than once; Maddie Ziegler -
dances quite well Writing - original ideas, ballsy moves, deep
characters and their motivations that 90% of the critics don't
understand, sometimes gets philosophical which is something 100% of the
critics don't understand, there are heartbreaking scenes and then there
are humorous scenes some of which make the sad ones even sadder
(seriously the contrast is extreme!) and it has one unforgettable
speech at the end. Soundtrack - excellent, melodic, creative,
submissive, memorable and I can play it on piano (but you don't care
about that do you?)On top of it all let's see how I'd answer these questions: Did I like
the movie? --- Seriously? Read the review again and you'll figure it
out. Why did I like it? --- Because tears contain toxins and I do not
like toxins. Is there anything I didn't like about the movie? --- Even
if I thought about it for 10 years I still wouldn't find a thing. Would
I watch it again? --- Absolutely!This obviously isn't all I got to say about this awesome movie but as
I'm running out of space so here is just a quick message to everybody
who gave The Book of Henry less than (alright I'm gonna be very kind)
let's say 8 stars:If you don't like family movies ( which suddenly turn into dramas (
which even more suddenly turn into thrillers)) just don't annoy this
world with your totally off-point garbage reviews. Thank you very much!
