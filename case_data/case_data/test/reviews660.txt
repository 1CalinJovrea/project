Great fun and smarter than you expect

When it comes to summer movies, this is about as good as it gets. We
got to the movies to be entertained and lose ourselves for 2 hours for
a price of an admission ticket. I can say without flinching that this
was totally worth it. The film was so much more enjoyable than I thought it would be from
watching the trailers. It has a lot of wit, clever plot, suspense,
magic, humor, twists, and action. It has something for everybody. The
acting was great overall and I really liked the characters. In my mind
3 people stuck out. Mark ruffalo, Morgan freeman, and woody harrelson.
They were great. Overall I was surprised at how good the story was. Sure it won't win
any Oscars but it takes a road at the end that nobody would see coming.
It makes you want to go back and see it twice to understand it better,
and just like all magic tricks, some of it can't be explained and you
are left with no answer but to believe that what you saw was true. And
to me that's fun
