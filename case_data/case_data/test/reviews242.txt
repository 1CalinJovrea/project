pretentious, boring and incoherent

I'm going to buck the trend here and instead of extolling the virtues
of this wonderful spiritual journey through time and space, I'm going
to call it an undisciplined, self-indulgent, incoherent piece of
claptrap. I really feel like this is a case of the Emperor's New
Clothes. I'm standing up and saying the old guy is naked and he's ugly
to boot. They said this was a book that couldn't be made into a movie.
They were right. And it was pointless to try. What you were likely to
get was... this! If you've read the book and liked it, then you might
like the film too. But just remember, you are bring understanding and
structure to what you see. If you haven't read the book and know little
about it, this movie is likely to be a frustrating and incoherent mess
to you. That was certainly my experience. So don't get suckered into
going to see this godawful film "cold." Tom Hanks looked like he had a
grand time being part of it. You won't.
