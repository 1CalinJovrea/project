HI YO SILVER we are back!

I recently attended an early screening for the film at Disney's
California Adventure and wow it was great. The story is well told and
gives you a good idea of how a man named John Reid becomes the Lone
Ranger who is brilliantly played by Armie Hammer. Johnny Depp obviously
stole the show for his portrayal of Tonto; I thought it was one of his
best characters he's ever played. The highlight here is the two's
chemistry throughout the film, these are two very different people who
both have different perspectives on life and they were just hilarious
together. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, I
thought some characters were a little under developed and not as
enjoyable as the leads. I wished the villain were just as enjoyable
like how Geoffrey Rush was for Curse of the Black Pearl. So in other
terms the film is not as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but more
superior then the Prate sequels. Go see this movie you'll have a great
time, and people can learn from this movie it's got some good messages.
