Just awful.

Did anyone actually get drunk in the movie? Why so many gratuitous
killings? The only similarity between this rag and the previous
hangover movies is the actors. Just an awful movie! Don't even rent
this thing when its released. I expected more from the "Chow" character
but was greatly disappointed. Alan? What happened to this character?
Actually none of the characters were as developed as the last movies.
This is a major problem because we came to see the third installment
hoping for a continuation of the previous two and were totally let
down. The best parts of this movie must be in the blooper scenes or on
the cutting room floor. As I'd mentioned, don't even waste your time
renting this when it's released or buying it for that matter.
