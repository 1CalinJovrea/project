Going Ape

(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A conventional approach to the Tarzan story which swings back
and forth, without getting anywhere. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: The story of a little boy who goes ape.JIM'S REVIEW: There have been many incarnations of the Tarzan legend,
starting with Edgar Rice Burroughs original 1914 novel, Tarzan of the
Apes. Our ape man has appeared in magazines, novels, comic books,
movies, radio, cartoons, and television shows, all with varying degrees
of success. Various actors have filled his loincloth, from the most
famous actor in this role, Johnny Weissmuller in the 1940's, to Gordon
Scott in the 1950's and Ron Ely taking hold of those vine reins in the
mid 60's. His legend lives on once again in this modern day re-boot,
The Legend of Tarzan, with Alexander Skarsgård as our muscle-toned
hero. The story adheres to its source and follows the basic outline of
Burrough's novel. Told in flashbacks, we learn of an infant left in the
jungle without parents and adopted by the great apes. Tarzan, now John
Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, lived and thrives in his tropical environs
until he was rescued and returned to England. Having difficulty
readjusting to British society, he finds a comrade in the beautiful
Jane Porter (a beguiling Margot Robbie). Upon his return to his
childhood home in the Congo, Greystoke (a.k.a. Tarzan) discovers man's
cruelty in the form of Belgian huntsman, Leon Rom (a typecast Christoph
Waltz, playing, what else, but the villain). Whereupon Tarzan must
takes sides to protect his adopted tribe of primates and protect his
homeland.Mr. Skarsgård plays Tarzan as an eloquent victim, more at home with his
hairy friends than his human species. No "Me Tarzan, you Jane"
monosyllabic banter here, and no loincloth either. This Tarzan mixes
the physicality and brutishness of Stanley Kowalski with the
sophistication and aplomb of a true noble gentleman, no small feat. If
only the film matched his interpretation also.The Legend of Tarzan is all too proper and seriously-minded which cuts
down on the fun and adventure. David Yates directs his film solidly,
keeping the action moving. Yet the production design by Stuart Craig
seems too well-crafted for its own good, nothing out of place. It lacks
authenticity in its detailing. This man-made jungle is just too
pristine, so clean and sanitized just like its story. (When the vines
look suspiciously like greenish rubber tubes and the cragged rocks like
painted styrofoam, something is a bit off.) The special effects aren't
that special either. Except for the primates, most of the animal
kingdom is obviously the results of CGI, effective but slightly unreal
and unsatisfying.On the plus side, the fluid camera-work by Henry Braham has an
acrobatic energy, especially as Tarzan travels from vine to vine, the
best part of the cinematic experience. Mark Day's fine editing enhances
the effect. The panoramic vistas help to give the film a sense of epic
adventure, even if the adventures we witness never attain the grandeur
of other epic film tales due to its script.The narrative structure swings from its more interesting backstories
(Tarzan's early life and upbringing, his adaptation to his aristocratic
England, Jane's personal journey) which are only hinted, to the
standard main story dealing with The Great White Hunter's poaching of
ivory, diamonds, and the slave trade...granted all important subjects,
but the treatment is painted in the most black and white terms with the
widest of brushstrokes. That's the problem...there are no grey stokes
in this Greystoke's version.None of the characters are remotely real or believable, but the roles
are well cast. There is a nice chemistry between the two leads,
although their beauty reminds us too often of an Abercrombie and Fitch
ad. Both are gorgeous human specimens who fortunately can act, even if
the dialog that they are given by screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig
Brewer, is banal and stilted.Given strong support is Samuel L. Jackson as the real life George
Washington Williams, a political activist and do-gooder, but his
character, as written, speaks in anachronistic modern day jargon. Still
the actor brings much needed bravado and is amusing in his role. Djimon
Hounsou as the avenging chief does some effective underplaying when Mr.
Waltz again overplays the menace angle. However he does bring some
interesting human quirks to the part. (Nice moment with the silverware
arrangement, Christoph.)All in all, the initial story line remains intriguing, the action
sequences entertain, and Mr. S. makes an awesome impression, all
swagger, six-pack, and sensitivity in a tight delightful manly package,
although his fluent English language skills are never addressed.This Tarzan has its flaws, but it does keep the legend intact, until
the next chapter.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com
