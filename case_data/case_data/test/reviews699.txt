It's f-ant-astic.

For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel
Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt
with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios
umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension.
Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym 
the original Ant-Man in the comic books  to the sidelines, while
killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the
founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised
parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright,
who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his
departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the
final product  Peyton Reed's Ant-Man  is a fun, frothy delight, one
that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's
doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected
movie-and-television franchise of all time.After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to
reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he
soon discovers that people in the outside world  including his ex-
wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) 
aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by
circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally
optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in
the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist
who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the
Pym Particle  a technological breakthrough that allows him to become
the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man  from falling into the wrong
hands.Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of
an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a
well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to
embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of
tiny indignities, the dialogue  still credited to Wright and his
co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay  is
uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no
subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to
hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott
stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His
discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails  working with Hank,
meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly),
training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from
replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder  give the
story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this
superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind
of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis'
unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive
Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark,
trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting
its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously.
This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap
chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young
daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton
 initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend 
is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that
seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best
action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the
camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely
proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply
heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between life and
probable death. For anyone concerned about Ant-Man subsisting in its own little bubble
within the MCU, rest assured that there's plenty on display here to
please even the most die-hard of fans. The film features not only a
welcome cameo from a very popular agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also ties
Scott firmly into MCU continuity with a hugely pleasing direct
reference to Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The subsequent semi-aerial battle
that takes place between Ant-Man and a certain Avenger proves that this
miniscule hero has what it takes to stand proud alongside the world's
mightiest champions. (Stay through the credits, by the way, for two
incredibly exciting hints at what's to come for the MCU in the future.)As with all the other films and television shows in Marvel's burgeoning
media empire, the cast of Ant-Man is pitch-perfect. Rudd puts his goofy
and amiably sexy charisma to excellent use as Scott, allowing us to
believe that this one man can be as silly as he is strong, and as
serious as he is funny. Lilly gets the big-screen role she richly
deserves in Hope, who's acknowledged at every point in the film as
being better, stronger, and more capable than the men around her think
she is. Douglas plays a far more palatable version of Dr. Pym (who can
be tough to swallow in the comics), and does so with his trademark
charm and magnetism, while Stoll gives good psychopath as the
increasingly unhinged, patently cruel Cross.Ant-Man may not edge out the other films that make up Phase Two of the
MCU in a straw poll  it does, after all, face some pretty serious
competition in what has been an unbroken run of truly excellent
superhero films. But it's an incredibly solid effort: smart, rich, deep
and funny, teeming with ideas, genres and the potential for so much
more. Now if that doesn't make for a great superhero movie, what does?
