The fake reviews

GREAT MOVIE, Before the the movie even opened to the public, there was
already over hundred thousand reviews on this page giving it a low or
negative review. It is a shame that IMDb lets fake reviews to alter the
real review for the movie. Every review before the opening date should
be looked at and taken down. Other then real, professional critics and
reviewers who actually watched the movie. This movie gave a great way
to educate people, adults, kids, people who never heard of the Armenian
Genocide, to learn what happened. They could of gone the other way and
showed a lot of violence, blood, gore, horrors of what really happened
to our people, but this movie went the way to tell the story in a way
anyone can watch and learn.This was a great movie, everyone should watch it and learn what
happened in our history, during the time of our grandparents, how
cruel, and brutal the ottoman empire was, and how still history is
repeating itself. They, the modern Turks, can deny all they want. we
know what really happened, I've heard the stories from my grandmother,
grandfather, what happened to them, how they ended up in Lebanon or
Syria, why we were born in Lebanon. This Movie shows why, and that we
are still here and we will never forget until the Turks accept
responsibility and admit what happened. GREAT MOVIE...
