Has often depended on the greatness of  other authors

This Allen film has some pedigree and within the first 30 minutes its
clear he has sharpened the pencil well for the writing of his principal
character, Jasmine or Jeanette.Later on, with the other male characters who are part of her sister's
life, a nagging feeling comes on. This is like...what was that play
about a delusional sister and her brother-in-law and the steamy life in
that southern city... Oh yes, it was "A Streetcar Named Desire".The template for this is movie is so close to Williams's play that it
is well, uncanny, but Allen has form here; with his Bergman pastiches
and his nods to Henry James, he knows how to plumb other work- perhaps
its all so well absorbed he hardly knows the difference between his own
work and theirs. As TS Eliot said, great artists steal.Tarantino does it with everything he has ever done; Allen just appeals
to the middle class who don't read the source material and this format
flatters their informed sense for what is good drama.The movie is pleasant enough; it falters at times and goes around and
around, and has very lazy plotting, it deals a few morals blasts to
Wall St and greed, cupidity, amongst other sins, but it never develops
well. It's a slight story based on another work.Blanchett is fine, and like the original Blanche, she, along with the
author, has often depended on the kindness of strangers. It's nearly a
perfect fraud.
