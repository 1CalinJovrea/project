"On The Road" is only the skeleton this film is fleshed out around. It
is not simply the novel made into a movie. Director Walter Salles WAY
expanded it. For starters, he used the scroll, not the '57 edition as
the working blueprint. And a ton of the movie came from Neal, Jack &
Allen's letters, Carolyn's book, the LuAnne interview, Jack's audio
recordings  in other words, there's a lot of stuff that's not in the
novel. But it's all based on accounts, not solely Jack's account as
told in that one book, scroll or not.It's not the novel On The Road as a linear film. It's an interpretation
based strongly ON that novel, but it ain't a literal filming of the
storyline. It's a work of art, its own work of art, a new work of art
based on an old work of art.There's lots of cool things about it. I don't want to "spoil" it for
you, but many of the specific scenes in the novel that always stood out
for me are in the film. And since it's so non-linear, you don't know
what's coming next. And it's, "Oh wow! It's this scene! No way!" It's
so funny-cool that way. Something that Jack might spend a few
paragraphs on in a 300-page novel could be 3 minutes of the 137 minute
movie. And things he might cover over 20 pages aren't included at all.
It's kind of a series of choice scenes portrayed.And the cameos by Terrence Howard and Steve Buscemi are to die for!
That two of my favorite actors are in this in such weird and wonderful
ways is just great.And Viggo as Bill! Holy heck! Maybe the best part of the film.And the music is GREAT. Yer gonna love it if ya love it.There's loads of problems, big and small, but I'm not gonna mention 'em
cuz maybe you won't even notice 'em. It's its own work of art, its own
statement, its own piece. It's new and different and will stand (or
fall) on its own. But the movie of "On The Road" now exists. And here
it is  2 hours and 17 minutes. It's more large than small. It's more
new than old. It's more timeless than dated.How this is gonna play for other people will be interesting to see. There's gonna be the Beat world's reaction, and then the non-Beat
world's. Beat people in general are gonna like it  cuz it's On The
Road and so much more. People who have only read the one book and have
it emblazoned in their brains may have trouble with how it's been
expanded, or edited by the limitations of the medium. I have no idea
how non-Beat-familiar people will respond. Not a clue. I think if you
were predisposed this way, you'd already be there.Oh, and there's a whole lotta sex in it. The things that are said and
the things that are shown, for The Puritanical American Rating System,
this is gonna be an "R" fer sure. I mean, there's hand-jobs, oral, gay,
straight, three-ways, you name it  and f-bombs, which actually were
not in the casual vernacular of the time the way they're used in this
film, and certainly not in the novel. This is definitely an adult
movie. Which, if you know your On The Road, was a very G-rated book,
other than the subject  the sex is all off-page, and the language is
clean. The movie  not so much.I look forward to experiencing this many more times, under many
different circumstances, in many different mindframes, with many
different people, and how it'll continue to reveal new colors and
angles with each new Road adventure. It's a memorable, expansive
dramatization. It's a helluva party condensed into 2 hours. It's a road
trip with old friends to familiar places. But you better leave the book
at home and be ready for anything.
