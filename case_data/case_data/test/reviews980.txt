I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, let alone children

The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this
film is anything but. It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to
California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey
house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and
disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak
of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young
people let alone children. The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time
on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain
headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most
annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong,
Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad
Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he
and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get
out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks
back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying "take Riley to
the moon for me". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited
with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a
downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable.There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new
classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be
there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy
and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with
Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen
time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides
to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as
soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to
headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly
feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and
runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and
says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film
ends there.So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions
are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would
have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably
end up being raped and murdered.Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really
happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being
isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two
important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house,
eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney
film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the
film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I
never watched this.
