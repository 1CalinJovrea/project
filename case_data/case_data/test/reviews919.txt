The Fun Way of Showing Biography of Barry Seal's Unique Life

For a biography movie, this one was interestingly done. The way the
story was told made it seemed quite fun. Some portions were using dark
humor and Tom Cruise was real charming in here. I could actually
picture him as this real unique character. His relationship with his
wife and family was also real fun to look at, especially during the
moment when he tried to convince her about the good about his works.One cool thing about the movie was the very good costumes and sets. It
was like we were transformed into the world of the 1970s and early
1980s when the film was set. Especially the make up effects of Tom
Cruise was also exceptional. He looked a lot younger than his actual
age here. Even my wife was very amazed with his appearance and looks.
In addition to the costumes and sets, the film was also having some
songs from that period which enhanced the aura of 70s and 80s here.The main attraction of this movie was definitely the uniqueness of
Barry Seal's life as a pilot and smuggler and also the impacts he had
in the US history during the Ronald Reagan's presidency then. It even
had some political figures mentioned as well. The title of the movie
also suit the story very nicely. You would understand why it has such
title by the end of the film.In the end, you could already guess the conclusion of the movie.
Especially if you are a history buff who already knew the story of
Barry Seal. There appeared to be various versions of his life story, so
I am not sure either whether the one we saw here was the real actual
version. But anyway, in term of entertainment, the movie was made into
a non boring kind of biographical movie. However, those who were
expecting to see Tom Cruise kick a$$ in this movie would probably be
disappointed cause this is not that kind of movie. There were some
action scenes but this film could not be categorized as action type.
There were no very emotional moments as well (which I found rather odd
as usually biography movie would have some of those parts).Finally, if you are looking for a good biographical crime movie, this
one might be a good option. Though this was not as heavy as other
movies in such category, it was still interesting to see Tom Cruise's
portrayal of one of the controversial character in US history. It was
also directed by Doug Liman who was the director of some good and/or
commercially successful movies such as The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs.
Smith, Edge of Tomorrow and few others. But for those who are looking
for movies with lots of actions by Tom Cruise, better wait for his next
Mission: Impossible movies. For my complete review, pls have a look in
