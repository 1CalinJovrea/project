"Vacation" stikes a great balance between honoring the original film and paving its own holiday road.

"I found out long ago. It's a long way down the holiday road." Those
are the opening lyrics from the Lindsey Buckingham song that is found
in all four of National Lampoon's "Vacation" movies of the 1980s and
90s. Those movies all starred Chevy Chase as the father who would stop
at nothing to give his family the perfect vacation, whether it was a
European vacation, a Vegas vacation, a Christmas vacation or a road
trip to California's (fictional) Walley World theme park. The holiday
road is indeed a long one. It led us to all those places and back and
then it led us here. 32 summer vacations later, a movie called simply
"Vacation" (R, 1:39) is a remake/sequel/reboot hybrid which also
features Buckingham's catchy tune. The question is whether this
vacation lives up to the legacy of the iconic film that shares its
name.This time, the only son of Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen Griswold
(Beverly D'Angelo) is all grown up. Rusty (Ed Helms) is a pilot for a
small budget airline. Like his parents in the earlier films, he's
married, has two kids and lives in Chicago. His wife, Debbie (Christina
Applegate), is loyal and supportive, but longs for a little more
spontaneity and variety in the marriage. They have two kids, boys named
James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). James is an
awkward, nerdy teenager and his foul-mouthed kid brother teases him
mercilessly for it. Maybe a cross-country road trip is just what this
family needs to come closer together. After all, as the movie poster
asks: What could go wrong? Rusty decides to drive his family all the
way from Chicago to Walley World in California, recreating his family's
similar (but infamous) childhood trip hopefully, with better results.
Rusty starts by renting a "Prancer", a car that's even more
interesting than the "Family Truckster" in the original film. It has
two gas tanks, along with a plug which doesn't look like it would fit
any outlet in the known universe. This boxy blue bastardized Toyota
Previa has a key fob and control panel with a bewildering number and
assortment of buttons and a GPS that too easily gets stuck harshly
giving directions in Korean.But taking this "Honda of Albania" out on America's highways is only
the beginning of this Griswold adventure. Their ill-advised road trip
involves being followed by an ominous-looking truck, being directed to
a "hot spring" that really isn't, losing personal possessions, plus
father and son having a sex talk that's more conjecture than fact.
Stops on the trip include a very revealing visit to Debbie's old
college, a river rafting trip with a highly unstable guide (Charlie
Day), a visit with Rusty's grown sister, Audrey (Leslie Mann), and her
hunky local TV weather man husband (Chris Hemsworth) as well as
stopping at a bed-and-breakfast owned by a couple who will be very
familiar to fans of the earlier films."Vacation" strikes a great balance between honoring its iconic origins
and paving its own holiday road. The movie makes use of a few sight
gags and incidents from the 1980s classic, but puts its own spin on
them. The adult Rusty is every bit as earnest and bumbling as his dad,
but Helms makes the character his own. As in the first film, the script
makes good use of the comic potential inherent in a cross-country car
trip, but doesn't copy any scenarios from the earlier movies. Despite
the distractingly inappropriate amount of foul language coming from the
family's youngest member, the humor, as raunchy and crude as it is,
works well. While the first film's humor was often more subtle in
nature, the jokes in this one are often laugh-out-loud funny."Vacation" has some self-referential fun as Rusty's family discusses
who has heard of the original vacation and whether trying to duplicate
it would just result in a big letdown. Whether an on-screen family
conversation or a reflection of the thoughts of real-life moviegoers,
those concerns are unfounded. The new fictional Griswolds are brought
closer together by their trip and the cinematic portrayal of their
misadventures is both fun & funny maybe even more than the first
"Vacation". "A-"
