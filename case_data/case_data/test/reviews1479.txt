I loved this movie!

Mostly I was interested in this movie knowing Tommy Wirkola directed it
because I loved very much his Dead Snow, and it shows. It's stylish, dark, suspenseful, moderately gory, fast-paced and
mesmerizing! I really can't recall enjoying another fairy tale this much. Finally a breath of fresh air. Great direction, great writing, great acting, great everything! The 3D
rocked this time. I'll definitely go and see it again and will be
looking forward to the Blu Ray.And Gemma Arterton is simply a goddess.
