Beautifully done!

I had a great time with this one! It really succeeded where few monster
movies manage to. It provided tension, scary moments and it did made me
hold my breath!Beside this year's The Shallows, we got In The Deep, which is a
beautifully shot movie, good acting, nice reactions, pretty much the
whole nine yards here. It was a great little movie, I'm just sad it
didn't get the attention it should have. People need to know that this
is not another low budget shark movie, but a damn good one!Watch it and you will not regret. It provides a great, great atmosphere
and surely enough, most of you will enjoy it.Cheers!
