A Big Budget Ouchie: Needs Lots of Bandages

Failing to point out similarities that new movies share with old ones
is like ignoring a familiar face who says hello... After bumping right
into you...So it's important to mention that The Tom Cruise MUMMY is, in its core,
almost exactly like AN American WEREWOLF IN London, arguably the
greatest werewolf picture ever and, directed by John Landis, centers on
two doomed vacationing hikers: one gets killed by an initial attack,
the other injured: The latter has ominous, foreboding dreams while his
not-very-pleasant-looking dead friend appears randomly, offering spooky
yet cordial reminders that he, the living, must also die to lift The
Curse... After a little while, the same thing occurs concerning two American
soldiers in Iraq. Tom Cruise and his reluctant buddy  a whiner so
saturated with fevered sarcasm you would think he'd remain the comic
relief sidekick (like John Hannah in the 1999 version) against Tom's
Indiana Jones-like determination to make digging up artifacts a number
one priority... Soldiering be damned...Of course there's a beautiful girl. Actually, two. One is the ingenue
and the other, as you probably already know by the promotions, is our
title antagonist: an ancient and lustful, tattoo-faced black widow who
literally gets inside old Tom's head. He even says at one point: "She's
in my head."Leading to surreal moments where the director attempts combining a
Mind-Trip- Thriller Sub-Genre to the Action-Fantasy Mainline  along
with a few violent battle scenes with the frantic pace of THE WALKING
DEAD, WORLD WAR Z or any sinewy CGI zombie outing, it's impossible to
distinguish who or what should be feared most since they all look
alike, and do the same thing: Attack and Attack, and Attack some more. The plot-line, having to do with our flawed hero attempting to reverse
this particularly personal Mummy's Curse, is contrived, forced. And
then there's Russell Crowe, who narrates the prologue set way, way back
during The Crusades, only to return as... get this... a doctor named
Henry Jekyll in the present time. Funny thing is, the surrounding
characters are actually surprised when it's revealed what he's been...
Hyding all along...Crowe's entire role is a banal, superfluous distraction to one of the
most unnecessary reboots ever. And it's no surprise that, being a Tom
Cruise vehicle, when it comes down to it, everything's about him. Like
in the first MISSION IMPOSSIBLE  what had been an eclectic ensemble
becomes a one man show. It's more like THE DADDY than THE MUMMY. Or
perhaps THE DUMMY since he makes all the wrong decisions, and is hardly
someone to root for or care about. In fact, along with the pouting
love-interest, no one on board has anything to say, or add to the
overall mindless void of it all. Somewhere, though, Brendan Frasier is
smiling. Perhaps imagining himself as the new Maverick in the upcoming
sequel to... Okay, now we're pushing it... (www.cultfilmfreaks.com)
