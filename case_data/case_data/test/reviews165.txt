I Lost Faith In Humanity!... This Movie broke my heart!

I know that this is not a sequel to the other films or series... But if
something should exist in this one is the consistency... You can not
just take a symbol (for some like me sacred) such as SUPERMAN and make
this joke called MAN OF STEEL only for get a lot of money (that is
called "sell your soul")... The essence of Superman is that he is the
symbol of hope, because of that SUPERMAN is not a SUPER-MAN by their
supernatural powers, instead he is by their conviction, principles and
values​​, the teachings of his father Jhonathan and what learns JOR-EL
(not in 5 minutes)... Therefore:-SUPERMAN does not kill!!! (No matter what happens)-Jhonathan always will protect Clark's secret, but never say it was
better to let children die because of it. never! -Jor-El dies stabbed? Lara dies alone??? -Jhonathan dies in a hurricane, and Clark does not do anything???-Clark becomes Superman in less than 5 minutes, only for wearing the
suit? -Lois Lane tells almost half the planet that Clark is SUPERMAN (she
even goes to the Kent house, looking for Clark with the police)...-SUPERMAN does not kill... Did i told you that???I've always admired the work of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Lawrence
Fishburne, Diane Lane, among others... But I can not understand that
they have agreed to participate in a film that should inspire people to
always be better based on the fact that the truth, justice, equality
and above all humanity are most powerful things of all the universe.Today my heart feels stabbed and my faith in humanity more destroyed
than ever, the few things that inspired me to always become a better
person is destroyed, trampled and spit like crap ... Even worse is to
see the indifference of those who criticize the movies and say that it
is an excellent movie just to be full of special effects an a history
without sense... Even I read someone say that Henry Cavill is much
better SUPERMAN than Christopher Reeve, when the truth is that Chris
Reeve was much more SUPER MAN in real life until the end of his days,
than it was in their own movies...I think at heart, that this team had in its hands the opportunity to do
something magical, colossal but, they waste time in making this
blockbuster only by the desire of the money ...Dc Comics I will not even think of the anger I have against you right
now!I just hope that IMDb publish this review as it was written so that if
any person connected directly with the creators of this movie can
understand my frustration and maybe if they plan to make a sequel to
this movie rectify and understand that they are are dealing not only
with a success at the box office but the idea that behind that "S"
which means HOPE hides much more... SUPERMAN is not a comic, not a
fantasy character, not a marketing article... It is an idea, a way of
life, that there are still good things in the world... respect that!This is a translation with the help of Google Translate
