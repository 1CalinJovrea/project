Good story, nice acting, great scenery, not so strong editing and plot development. My outdoor friends and I loved it.

I saw Wild last night. I typically read reviews after watching movies
but on this occasion read a number of IMDb reviews before watching the
movieone was positive and three very negative. Two friends had
recommended the movie and I approached Wild with these thoughts in
mind.I loved Wild. The scenes were beautifulespecially the desert, the
snow, and Crater Lake in Oregon. The Bridge of the Gods overlooked a
beautiful stretch of the Columbia River (which I have visited only at
night). This will be important to nature loversfor me just the scenes
made the movie worth watching.Reese has been criticized for not being realistic as a drug / sex
addict and for lacking range. I found her to be one perfect type. In
her background were physically abusive male grown ups but her mother
was very nurturing and loving and encouraging of Reese's character,
Cheryl's, development. Going into her period of abuse, then, she was
not a typical 'user'. Not that there is a type but while she was losing
her center she did not lose it altogether. I imagine that there might
have been more evident struggle, suffering and perhaps hysteria
('acting') but not necessarily; some people suffer quietly. Reese did
this well. The character would have scored high in introversion.I liked the story-lineone woman finding redemption in the wild. In
some movies flashbacks are part of the story, making for non-linearity.
In this movie I saw the scenes from the past not as stylistic
flashbacks but as Cheryl's thought bubbles as she hiked; the editing
could have been less choppy but the idea worked well for me. When I'm
out hiking the physicality of it, the wonder at nature, and my own
thought bubbles are all large parts of the experience.Which reminds me, I would have liked more nature in the movie; it would
have been nice to see more hiking; and it would have been nice to see
more attention to Cheryl's physical and skill development as a hiker.
Her pack was a huge mess in the beginning (natural for a beginner
without much preparation) but it would have been nice to see it get
smaller and tidier; it would have been nice to see some real hiking
skills. And her emotional growth could have been developed betterit
seemed rather sudden at the endthere could have been more continuity,
perhaps with growth as well as setbacks. Perhaps, though, given her
'sophistication'by which I mean her growth as a person before she
entered her time of 'difficulty' with drugs and sexsudden realization
might have been natural.Overall I liked the story and the themes a lot; the editing and
Cheryl's growth as a person could have been done better. I've given
Wild an 8 because I really did enjoy it. I do think the movie could be
re-done better. But, as a long time backpacker in wilderness areas of
America, Wild appealed to me very much. My story is not Cheryl's but
the wild has loomed large in my life and growth.
