Different, surprising latest effort from the Austrian Oak, taking a standard plot line and going somewhere new

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA contagious virus has spread across America that is causing the
infected to slowly mutate in to cannibalistic zombies. Wade Vogel's
(Arnold Schwarzenegger) daughter Maggie (Abigail Breslin) would be one
such person, a young girl grimly aware of her terrible predicament. As
the inevitable closes in, father and daughter bond in a final, all
encompassing way, before they're drawn towards a terrifying final
outcome.After his much hyped comeback a few years ago, Schwarzenegger has
achieved what can only at best be called the most hit and miss results
with his new batch of explosive, '80s flavoured action films. There was
still something resembling an audience, but most people's tastes have
cleaned up quite a bit. And so, out of nowhere, it seems, he delivers
this latest offering, which on paper comes off just like one of his
regular shoot 'em up type films, with him versus zombies. But instead,
he's taken such a plot line and given it a more mature angle, as a more
tender and heartfelt examination of the final days of a father and
daughter, that shows a departure from his usual type of fare.As more emotionally driven as the plot is, it doesn't really have the
best sense of structure or direction, and instead seems to be driven
more on a moody, lingering sense of atmosphere and tension, with the
lighting drained out and brightened up in subsequent shots to affect
the mood. Debut feature length director Henry Hobson has shown a
certain knack and sense of style behind the camera, but he needs to go
back to school a little on his structural narrative abilities, and
crafting a film that has somewhere to go in spite of it's heart.So, we have it, then, Arnie's most bizarre film, ever, a totally
unexpected and different effort from him that's appeared out the blue.
In spite of it's strangeness, it's better than anything he's done
lately, and shows a more mature and emotional side developing after so
many years. ***
