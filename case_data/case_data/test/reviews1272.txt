Surprisingly good

I went into Happy Death Day with low expectations, thinking it would be
a fun yet cheesy horror movie. I was right about one thing: it's very,
very fun. Now, don't let the frightening trailer fool you: this is a
not a very scary movie. Yes, there are some tense moments, usually
followed by a jump scare, and there was moderate PG-13 violence, but
this movie succeeds more in its one-liners than its death sequences.
There are tons of good jokes from Jessica Rothe, who is the best part
of this movie by far. And there is a twist, it's not very memorable,
but it's smart and well thought out, and it leads to a very satisfying
end fight scene. Despite the misleading marketing, Happy Death Day is
an hilarious and entertaining horror/comedy.
