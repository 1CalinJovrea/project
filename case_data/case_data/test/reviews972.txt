Extremely accurate and faithful to the novel

Masterpiece. The last ten minutes were brilliantly executed. This
director's work is definitely on par with Frank Darabont's movies.
Every sequences of the novel is present in the movie. Acting is
delivered at its finest. Netflix need more Stephen King adaptations
like this one. A must watch for everyone.-Dude from Blossomsoft
