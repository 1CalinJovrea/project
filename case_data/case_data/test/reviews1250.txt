A perfect holiday without leaving home.

My heart is still rolling from the escape to 30's Europe this
afternoon, and without jet lag. This movie is an inspiration, a dream,
a walk through a painting and a study of humanity. Ralph Fiennesï»¿ is a phenomenon as M. Gustave. his interactions with
every cast member and especially newcomer Tony Revolori are fantastic.
The later holds his own weight beyond belief and the entire film is an
amazing adventure with James Bond style chases, a large murder mystery,
the best placed cussing and of course the sensational cinematography.
The sets, models, angles and even the most nondescript characters come
to life each on their own and together as a symphony of beauty. It's
freaking brilliant; The Grand Budapest Hotel.
