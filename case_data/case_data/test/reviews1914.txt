A good movie for a good franchise

This is by no means a masterpiece, but it is an excellent animated
movies that both the target audience of little girls, their parents and
bronies will enjoy. It has a few flaws in how it drags the protagonists
around by their plot-noses, and inconsistencies compared the
development of the characters in the show. It seems to be roughly late
season 4 with several characters regressing a bit compare to their
character development in the latest seasons.
