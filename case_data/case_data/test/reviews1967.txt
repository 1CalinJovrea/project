Expectations weren't high ENOUGH

I was a mere child when I watched LOTR franchise and I still liked it.
Ever since, year by year, I grew fonder and fonder of the movies and
they remain, and probably forever will, one of my favorite movies of
all time. I've read all the books countless times (including Hobit) and
when I saw that Hobbit was coming into the cinema, my mind was entirely
wiped away from its existence due to excitement that entered me. Now, movie review. As expected from Peter - almost flawless masterpiece. Given that he had
a lot of material to work with, I imagine it was quite hard to put
everything together for the scenery - yet he did it, once more. He
captured the feeling of the book and transcended it onto a screen; of
course, it was not solely his credit, to not be mistaken. The acting
was amazing - perfectly fitting into fantasy style. The chemistry
between actors was more than just the obvious - you could actually feel
their interactions and live the story. Yes, it was that good. I have no need to begin writing about camera work and all that comes
with it; locations were beautiful, effects and colors were mixed
perfect, a soundtrack that followed through pattered with what was
going on perfectly ... it is really one of those moments when you
simply can't say enough because you know, regardless of how many words
you put in, you still won't be able to describe things the way you felt
them. I have only one thing to say: congratulations Mr. Jackson and
rest of the cast.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey will become classic without any
doubt; I am just glad that I got to be a part of the generation that
witnessed the never-dying franchise of Mr. Tolkien's work.
