So Underrated

probably one of the best films of 2015 Miss, Lawrence delivered one of
her most powerful performance to the screen, and even though she won an
Oscar for (Silver Linings Playbook 2012) her performance here is much
more powerful. she bring a very hard combination of both comedy and
tragedy that no other actress can bring to the screen, and i must give
a big thanks to David O. Russell who gave Jennifer three Academy Award
nomination for three movie they worked together ( SLP 2012, AH 2013,
and this film).There're so many critics criticized the film by saying that all the
rest of the cast are so weak or unnecessary and any other unknown
actors could do there job, which i totally disagree with. yes the role
of other actors are not as the size of Joy's role and that's for a
reason ( because she is the center of the whole story), but all of them
give a brilliant job. Robert De Niro was amazing in his small role and
gave us a couple of funny scenes such as the wedding, and the fighting
scene between him and Virginia Madsen ( his ex- wife) which also was so
good and funny even though most of her scenes were made in one room the
bedroom.Also the grandmother role (Diane Ladd ) which also was the narrator of
the whole film was very powerful to the whole film, because she was the
the person who encouraged joy to become a important person in this
world.
