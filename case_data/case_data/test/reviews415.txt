Like an true nightmare, A Monster Calls has a lot of dark beauty within it's tragedy

The traces of crayon and markers on paper will tell you a lot of thing
you need to know about the child that drew it. You'd be surprised by
how much a drawing of a horse or a sloppy house can tell what any kid
would like. I remember during the third grade, my teacher noted several
sketches I've done of space aliens and flying pizzas invading over an
unnamed city. She actually asked if this was supposed to be about a
fear of meeting new people and by going back to a slice of cheese
pizza, I was ignoring new things. I only said that I liked aliens and
pizza.As I've said, drawings may not always say a lot, but they do something.
It depends on the person and the emotions their going through. I can
only interpret that my crude sketch only said that I was board and
would rather make up something weird to pass the time. My friend too
did his own drawings, but his were a lot darker. Whenever I asked, he
simply said, "their just cool", despite that their darker imagery
frightened me. It would be several years later when I found out that
his father had passed away. Perhaps A Monster Calls reflects perfectly
well what my friend went through.Twelve-year-old Conner O'Malley (played by Lewis MacDougall) loves his
mother and does his best to care for her, given her terminal illness
and his determination to see her get better. His mother Lizzie (played
by Felicity Jones) has told her son several stories and encouraged his
artistic talent. His grandmother (played by Sigourney Weaver) also does
her best to tend to her daughter and grandson, even though Conner see's
her as something of an unsympathetic witch. On top of that, Conner is
also the target of a bully.One evening at the strike of 12:07, he sees a giant, tree-like creature
rise out of a church graveyard and comes to the boy's house. The
monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) tells Conner that he'll tell him three
stories and that when the time comes, a fourth must be given in return.
Though Conner see's this creature in a reoccurring nightmare, he shows
no fear, probably due to his early maturity. In conjunction with the
Monster's visits, Conner's grandmother and father (played by Toby
Kebbell) come to realize that Lizzie may not make it much longer.
Conner allows the monster to tell him the stories, with the hope that
his mother can be saved. When I was watching A Monster Calls, I was surprised by how much it
made me think about Where The Wild Things Are. Not because their
similar movies, but because their both family oriented movies that feel
very mature and adult. This is what I like about A Monster Calls. Like
a lot of nightmares one would have, the visions that the child has of
the monster (which is cool looking, though he looks similar to Groot
from Guardians of the Galaxy) connect incredibly well to the events
that he's going through. It's a master class of great screen writing
and editing.A Monster Calls will defiantly feel heavy to a lot of kids that are
going to see this. Their going find themselves watching something sad,
but I hope that parents see this as important. Lewis MacDougall manages
to carry a lot of the heavy emotions that the story requires of him and
pulls off a performance that's better then a lot of adult actors. As an
audience member, I wanted to see where his story was going to go and
was sad to see it end. You know a movie is good when your sad that it
ended.I'll give this ten sketches of the monster out of ten. I can't stress
with how beautiful this movie is. It's full of story that should help a
lot of people going through with someone's terminal illness or their
own. I can only say that this is geared towards older kids (probably
over the age of ten would be best) and I doubt that they won't get
something out of this. See if A Monster Calls is worthy of your life
story and check it out.
