Wouldn't dare put spoilers in on this one!

If you know how fine a writer Dennis Lehane is, that's about all you
need to know as to how good this movie is. Lehane's in top form on a
gritty crime story with very close-up ominous characters, constant
tension and suspense, and James Gandolfini. Do not wait around, go see
this one, you'll be glad.There's also a great doggie central to the story (and I ain't even a
pet person!).If you want an idea how dangerous the mob activity is, uh . . . think
Chechnians (who cares how it's spelled?).It's only a small-scale drama, though great, otherwise I'd give it a
10.
