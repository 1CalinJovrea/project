Improvement over "Chapter 1"....not even close.

Let me start out by saying that I love horror movies. Good ones. But in
my opinion that's an unfortunate thing because no other movie genre is
as plagued by poor quality garbage as the horror genre. The first
Insidious movie was not great, but I definitely felt it was above
average and deserving of the near-7 rating is has in IMDb. Very few
horror films merit a rating of 7 or higher, and that is particularly
true in the case of Chapter 2. Apart from some interesting ties they
made between events in this film and events in the first film which
made this one interesting at times, it was worse than the first one,
not better. The acting by some of the characters was B-quality at best.
The dialog was cheesy at times. The plot was mostly unoriginal and
boring. As for evil spirits and imagery, there was nothing new
introduced at all. No red- faced demon. Just the ghost of a serial
killer who became one because his mother made him dress like a
girl...gee, we've seen that before about a dozen times. Lazy, lazy
storytelling. The rating at the time of this writing is a 7.3. I'd give
it a 4 and I expect that it will trend down over time and end up at
least a full point below Chapter 1, which as a 6.7 at this time.
