A clichéd "bromance" film with all the wrong beats

That Awkward Moment seems like a promising comedy for guys, the raunchy
humor, objectifying women and boner pills. It sounds like a good time,
right? HELL NO!!! That Awkward Moment seizes every chance it gets to be
as clichéd as possible and to be as unfunny as possible. Zac Efron and
Michael B. Jordan turn in acceptable performances but that is
overshadowed by the thin-as-ice plot and crude humor, which ends up
losing two good performances in the mix. To be fair to those involved,
this film should have either been shelved or given more thought, either
or doesn't give this film a leg to stand on. The next Knocked Up it is
not. This is Sex and The City with too much testosterone and not nearly
enough laughs to justify any of the plot holes, clichés or how these
characters treat women. This isn't a rental, this is more like a bottom
dollar movie you take a chance on at Wal Mart.
