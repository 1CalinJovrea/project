Sensitive Movie about Love and Friendship

In Arkansas, the fourteen year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives in a
floating house with his mother Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and his father
Senior (Ray McKinnon). Ellis helps his father selling fish with his
best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Ellis and Neckbone find a
motorboat stranded on the top of a tree in an island on the Mississippi
River since a flood and they plan to fix the boat for them. One day,
they climb the tree and they find fresh meal inside the boat meaning
that someone is living in "their" boat. They leave the place and meet a
man named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) near their boat. Soon they learn
that the passionate Mud killed a man that had beaten up his girlfriend
Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and now the father and the brother of the
deceased man are hunting him down. Mud makes a deal with the romantic
Ellis and Neckbone to help him to reunite with Juniper. But when Ellis
meets Mud's stepfather Tom (Sam Shepard), he has a different opinion
about the love of Juniper with Mud. "Mud" is a sensitive movie about a romantic boy that tries to help a
stranger to meet his beloved girlfriend. The story of love and
friendship brought recollection of "Stand by Me" because of the
charismatic characters Ellis and Neckbone. The performances are
top-notch and the cinematography depicts wonderful locations along the
Mississippi River. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Amor Bandido" ("Bandit Love")
