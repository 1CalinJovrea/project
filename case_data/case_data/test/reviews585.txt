Don't care about others, this is an Arnold COME BACK!!

The whole cast was great don't get me wrong, and i enjoyed the plot of
the whole film, as much as it could have been a little longer with a
few more, twists and turns, it still got the point with lots of gun
fire, lots of "breaching" and lots of cussing for no reason. Arnold
himself being team leader, did a great job, and finished his mission no
matter what, i enjoyed the hell out of this film and i think it was a
come back for Arnold, it wasn't a flop (in my head, again most people
are posting that it was crap and Arnold is done, blah blah blah) This
movie had everything going for it, action packed, lots of good actors,
lots of crazy gun fights, lots of cussing and dirty jokes, i saw a
review that said this is a "guilty pleasure for manly men".....honestly
its just a guilty pleasure for anyone who likes action movies and
Arnold surrounded by a group of good actors, i hope to see him doing
more movies like this (unlike the expendables, which i am not the
biggest fan of) this movie was more about him and less about the other
actors, i think anyone who is an action movie fan, and an Arnold
fan....would enjoy this....so give it a shot. seriously :)
