A True Tall Tale of High Stakes

Nothing comes close to the rush of winning, at least according to those
who have succeeded where others have failed. Molly Bloom (Jessica
Chastain) managed to become a millionaire with a dose of luck, will and
endless street smarts. The former professional skier ran high stakes
poker-games in Los Angeles and New York and found herself in the middle
of a federal investigation, where she was accused of colluding with
organized crime.Being a sucker for great stories of real life characters, it is easy to
see what Aaron Sorkin saw in the very true tale of Molly Bloom. The
American ethos of being No. 1 combined with the isolation and
principles of its heroine make "Molly's Game" a tremendous playing
field for Sorkin's directorial debut.Even though he has dealt with themes of power, loyalty and the darker
side of entrepreneurial endeavors in "The Social Network", "Newsroom",
"Steve Jobs" and "Moneyball", what sets this story apart is that Sorkin
chooses to layer the rise-and-fall of the titular character with
questions about business morals and the loss of a more principled
economic system, that has been washed away by fast-buck artists and
fatalistic devil-may-care attitudes."Molly's Game" has a speedy pace, marvelous performances by both
Chastain and Idris Elba, as her lawyer, and is directed with a sure
hand. Which makes Sorkin's first directorial outing a joy to watch. It's two-hour-plus running time glides by like a breeze and ends on a
corny yet truthful note about the virtues of failure, that is a glimmer
of hope in times of struggle, as well as one of the tenets of screen
writing. The fight, the hustle and the failure never end, but then again, so do
the rewards in their own funny way. You win some, you lose some, and
Sorkin never seems to forget how close he is to the edge.
