Kenny Rogers Taxi Company

Greetings again from the darkness. An effective thriller must either
put real people smack dab in the middle of believable peril or
facilitate the suspension of disbelief. This latest from
writer/director John Erick Dowdle (co-written with his brother Drew
Dowdle) takes bits of each of those approaches and provides a pretty
intense ride  despite the mostly nonsensical happenings.We pick up Owen Wilson and his family while on an a transatlantic
flight to his new job in some unnamed Asian country that we later learn
is just a couple miles down river from the Vietnam border. Not long
after their arrival, the generic Prime Minister of this unnamed country
is assassinated. The rebel forces responsible for the coup were
evidently motivated by the political ploy of Owen's company, and they
aim to kill him.Lake Bell plays Owen's wife, and the two of them spend most of the
movie on the run together while protecting their two young daughters.
Ahh yes, the daughters. While watching this, it made me think that the
writers must not be parents, as the kids' reactions to this
extraordinarily dangerous situation involves excessive whimpering
combined with whining for food. Anyone without kids will certainly not
want any after watching this.One of the family's earliest escape sequences involves leaping from one
rooftop to another, and all I could think of was how fortunate that
this was not a typical American family who, shall we say, struggles
with the effects of a fast food diet. In addition to the long jump,
Owen Wilson takes over the record for best on screen child toss  an
under-appreciated cinematic category.The writers do deserve credit for understanding that Owen and his
little family were insufficient to hold our attention for the full run,
so they threw in a bizarre super agent played by Pierce Brosnan  or
Liam Neeson, or Bruce Willis, or maybe Chuck Norris. No, no  it really
was Pierce Brosnan. Action sequences appear spontaneously with
Brosnan's character, as do the funniest lines  and the Kenny Rogers
taxi company.There do seem to be some conflicting story lines. On one hand the big
Western corporation is cast as the villain who cares only to capitalize
on the local citizens, yet on the other hand, we as viewers are
supposed to root for the cute white family as they run from the rebels.
Perhaps this is over-thinking  something the filmmakers won't be
accused of.Most movie lovers enjoy a thriller that creates tension, and there is
no shortage of intensity here. Just don't expect to buy into everything
you see.
