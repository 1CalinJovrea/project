The Best Western/Horror Film i've Ever seen.

I had added this a while ago to my list but had put it off until a
friend recommended I watch it so I pushed it up my list. Think Western
Revenge/Rescue posse meets Cannibal Holocaust. It starts off a little
slow and stilted, feeling almost play-like in it's manner of delivery
and at first I was like oh no, this isn't going to be too good. But
then the story ramps up and Kurt Russel enters the film and from that
point on there is nothing dull or under-delivered. The violence starts
off a little over the top but more hinted at or slightly shown, but by
the last 3rd it is insane, cringing, screaming out kind of violence
while never loosing site of the story, it's characters or the pacing.
Nothing breaks you out of the film either, no moment was so far out
there you went yeah right. This is a film done very, very well.
