Are you 12? This may be the one for you.

If you are a 12-14 year old male with low or no standards for comedy
who wants to be a slacker when you grow up, you may love this movie.
Although I really like Mark Wahlberg and think he is the best thing
about this film, I really disliked it overall (like you couldn't tell).
I laughed three times: Liam Neeson, apples on the roof, and the first
black cock. Apart from that, in my opinion this movie tries to lower
the level of the lowest common denominator. Yes, it is true that I also
dislike "Family Guy" and, had I realized who is behind "Ted 2," I would
not have seen it at all. I don't understand people spend their money
and/or time on no-brow "entertainment." "Ted 2" is just dumb, and it's
definitely Ted LAST for me.
