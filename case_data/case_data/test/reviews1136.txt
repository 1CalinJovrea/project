SING will Blow You Away!

We just finished seeing "SING", and it is undeniably effervescent and
will make you leave your cares in the cinema and burst with youthful
glee as you witness the effect of the performances on the little
children (and some adults), and the happiness emoted from their
actions. IF that doesn't make you want to see this movie...you probably
shouldn't, for it will possess you with a spirit of joy that you'll
have to later explain why your body was moving the way it just did.
This is a great Family Movie that everyone will enjoy, for young and
old, 8 to 80, blind, crippled or crazy...this is a must see Holiday
Treat!
