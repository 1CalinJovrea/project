The Theory of Eh-verything

The curse of most biopics about famous individuals is that the films in
question always boil down a subjects life to a "greatest hits" reel and
then stuffs the rest of the run time with a sub-narrative to tie all
these moments together. More often than not, this sub-narrative is a
love story, which isn't inherently bad; it's just that when a proper
balance isn't struck between the major themes and the filler, the
results are usually lackluster. "The Theory Of Everything" charts the
tumultuous marriage of legendary physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife
Jane as they struggle to keep their life together while Stephen slowly
succumbs to the symptoms of ALS. And while it puts all of its efforts
into trying to be a heartbreaking portrait of a strained marriage (a
portrait that at times is quite beautiful), the movie seemingly forgets
that one of its subjects also happened to be one of the most brilliant
minds of the 20th century.Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) meet
in college and forge a bond through the universal law of "opposites
attract". Jane believes in romance and poetry and God, while Stephen
believes in logic and reason and the rejection of what he calls a
"celestial dictatorship". Jane is pursuing an education in the written
word while Stephen seeks to find a unifying theory that can explain
life, the universe, and everything. The two fall in love, only to face
a roadblock when Stephen is diagnosed with a neurological disorder that
threatens to destroy his motor skills one by one, giving him two years
at most to live. Jane pledges to stay by his side, and although Stephen
beats the odds and manages to live year after year, the struggles of
caring for her crippled husband take their toll on Jane.If the above description seems like it forgot to mention that Stephen
Hawking was a world famous physicist whose theories were revolutionary
and world changing, it's because for the most part, the movie forgets
this too. The most we see of Stephen's career is regulated to the
beginning and end of the movie, with passing mentions made to the
evolution of his work made whenever the film needs to remind the
audience of where we are in history; such as in a moment shortly after
the birth of Stephen's third child, when his father mentions that
Stephen is "world famous". Having never seen Stephen working on
anything beyond giving a lecture or two, we never actually see how he
got to this point. It's frustrating, because the film doesn't seem to
want to find a way to balance "Stephen the Husband" with "Stephen the
Physicist", and so we watch as The Physicist is shoved to the margins.Not that the story of Jane and Stephen is terrible, it's just that its
good moments are few and far in between. A lot of these struggles
manifest in tropes so familiar, there was a point when I really felt
that this could've been any story about a husband and wife dealing with
the pain of a partner's disease. The fact that it involves Stephen and
Jane Hawking is, at times, almost entirely inconsequential. These flaws
aren't helped by some of the film's problematic directing and editing
choices. Certain scenes seem to trail on after they clearly should've
ended, and important characters are thrown into the film far too late,
only to disappear again without mention. When Emily Watson showed up
almost an hour in without being identified, I was left baffled until
Felicity Jones drops a "Mum" in her line to signify who she's speaking
to. Why are we meeting such an important person in Jane's life, played
by such a serious actress, this late in the movie? It's just one
example of some of the sloppy structure choices made by director James
Marsh.It's only Eddie Redmayne, who truly makes his presence as an actor
known here, that keeps the movie from sinking into the muddy bog of
familiarity. As Stephen loses more and more of his basic motor skills,
Redmayne finds ways to make every movement count, whether it's a
playful smirk or a downward glance of pain. His chemistry with Felicity
Jones, who turns the inner conflict of Jane's struggles into a
revelatory performance of its own, is endearing; and when the two are
allowed to flex their acting muscles they create some of the films
greatest moments. Honorable mentions also go to Benoît Delhomme's
gorgeous cinematography and Jóhann Jóhannsson's powerful score.Ultimately "The Theory Of Everything" has joined the ranks of "Ray" and
"Jobs" and "Dallas Buyers Club": performance pieces more concerned with
winning acting awards than telling a good story. As memorable as
Redmayne and Jones are, their talents only serve to turn a film that
would've been completely forgettable into "good but not great". The
Hawking's deserved better.
