unfunny and lazy

The first was great fun and worth the admission. But this one bombed.First off, the movie's story is almost entirely lifted from the
original. The same setting, same crime, same jokes, same twists, etc.
The characters in the movie actually refer to these similarities on
multiple occasions. Which ofcoyrse was a way of beating the critics to
it. Hard to criticize someone after showing self-criticism. It makes
the critic seem like a grumpy old man. It is extremely annoying.Far worse, the movie is not funny. Its jokes are some of the most
unfunny you'll encounter in a major film. The two main actors have this
irritating manner of stressing certain words in a sentence, for comic
effect. It is hard to explain, but the point is that they try to take
straight dialog and make it funny, simply by pronouncing it a certain
way. Anyway, it is lazy filmmaking.
