The three films together are stunning! But this is the least of them

Before Midnight (2013)The most interesting facet to this slim movie is that it continues the
singular predecessors with such glowing continuity. Most people know
that Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke started their conversational fictional
companionship on film with "Before Sunrise" and then continued it with
"Before Sunset." The first of these was shot in 1995, and the next
followup was nine years later, and then this new one, nine years more.If you saw (and liked) the first two films as I did, this continuance
alone makes "Before Midnight" worth checking out. And if there is a
huge deadening flaw here it is simply that the continuing continues so
expectedly. There are times here when this couplewhich has been living
together for nearly a decadetalk as though they are on that first date
in 1995. It's not that they don't know certain things about each other,
but more that they are talking about things as if for the first
time--and they are such common things. Surely they've gotten around to
some of this stuff before. It's not endlessly revelatory.The director of all three films is Richard Linklater, and he absolutely
gets a lot of the credit for an easy, almost languid style. Some would
call it boringall talk and walk, nothing much to watch. But it isn't
boring. The first movie for sure is the most fresh (it was the first
one), but the second keeps things really interesting because the two
leads (Jesse and Celine) are meeting up again after a huge gap, and
it's an odd and unpredictable situation. By 2013 things have
fundamentally solidified. They are a happy couple with twin girls,
living in France. The day proceeds with conversation, and we listen
closely (there is nothing else to do), but in fact there is nothing to
be surprised or even curious about.So the words become so critical they can't help but fail. A long dinner
conversation with a group of educated friends is fast paced and filled
with clever banter, but it goes nowhere. Yes, you absolutely wish you
were there (and maybe that you had such friendsthat would depend). But
what is said is not so wonderful after all. It's just a mood of warm,
lively companionship.Likewise elsewhere. It's all fun and clever. When they squabble a bit
it never seems remotely possible that the fight is for real, or that
the incredible ease and love shown earlier in the movie would unravel
with a slight ill wind. The very last scene confirms, and is oddly wan.Soa mixed bag. I truly think if you haven't seen these films you might
find the style and the remarkable believability (at times) really
special. It is. But for me it was more special and more interesting as
a story in the earlier movies. This one can now not be separated from
those, however, and the great whole, a trilogy with a possibility of
more to come, is a special and worthy part of contemporary cinema.
Start somewhere and see what this is all about.
