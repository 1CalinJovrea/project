Sex Still Sells

It it preposterous that, at the time of this review, The Handmaiden had
an 8.1 rating on IMDb which would make it the equal of such films as:
The Wizard of Oz, The Grapes of Wrath, the Best Years of our Lives and
Annie Hall. And that would rank it higher than Shane, The African
Queen, The Searchers, and Sophie's Choice. All of the aforementioned
films are among the top 100 films of all time, according to the AFI.
Nor was this movie overrated by one demographic group.This movie did not have an MPAA rating but would certainly have
deserved an X rating with the number of explicit sexual scenes. None of
this would matter if the sexuality needed to be so explicit to advance
the plot. It didn't.There are movies which are fundamentally about a sexual relationship,
and are honest about it, such as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her
Lover or the Last Tango in Paris. One should expect THESE films to be
quite explicit. The Handmaiden is NOT such a film. There IS a story
being told and EVEN THOUGH the father is quite depraved it is not
necessary to exploit this in telling the story. In fact, it is a
diversion from the telling of the main story line.So why was the story told in this way? The answer is clear: sex sells.
It even sold a substantial number of those who reviewed the film at
IMDb. Amazon appears to have mastered the use of the sensational. Now
it is true that there is some excellent cinematography, but that cannot
redeem this film.Clearly, a film goer cannot depend on IMDb or even on the combined
ratings of the critics to find worthy entertainment. More caution is
required.
