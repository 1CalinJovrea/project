What happened to horror?

It's pretty rare that I get hyped for horror movies, especially modern
ones, but I was a little hyped for this. I thought the premise was
interesting, and it had potential to be scary. I wouldn't call this a
disappointment, because it misses the bare basics of what makes a good
horror movie. Next to comedy, horror is probably the hardest genre to
get right, the most important aspect a horror movie needs is relatable
characters. If the audience can connect with the people on screen, it
evokes this fear of them dying, so when they eventually do die, the
audience doesn't want it to happen. Think of great horror movies with
relatable characters; "Aliens", "The Thing", "Halloween", "Vacancy",
"The Descent", just to name a few. Apparently writing good characters
for horror movies is harder than dividing by zero, because these
characters might as well be cardboard. There are three victims, one's a
jerk, one's selfish, one's apprehensive, that is all. They never
change, and we aren't properly introduced to them, so I certainly
didn't care when they started dying. Also, one of them gets killed like
4 times, but I'll get to that later. I don't sympathize with these
characters, even though I can sort of understand their mindsets,
because they're never given a chance to change.My second major problem, you can't see anything. The movie is so dark,
I thought my eyes were closed half the time. Not being able to see
something doesn't make it scary, it makes the audience confused and
only adds frustration. As a result of this darkness, I can barely tell
what happened to the characters, what they see, what they do, so how am
I supposed to be scared if I can't tell what the hell's going' on? The
action scenes are also edited poorly, which makes it look like one of
the characters dies 4 times. How is it that "The Descent" (a movie that
was dark because it was in a cave) had better lighting than something
filmed above ground? Was a little light too much to ask, or was it
meant to represent the killer's lack of vision?You want to know what the twist is? Are you sure you want to know? Are
you positive? Are you sitting down? The blind guy's keeping a girl in
his basement so she can have his kid. Calm down, I know it's super
freakin' intense, except it's not. What movie advertises it's twist? Do
you realize how stupid that is? It's ruins the point of the twist.
Imagine if the trailer for "The Usual Suspects" had the twist in the
trailer, how about "Se7en", it would've ruined the suspense. This movie
thinks it's so high and mighty all because of the twist, a twist that
adds nothing to the movie. I still don't care about the characters, I
don't connect with them, I don't sympathize with them, and I still
can't see anything.Whoever called this the best horror film in 20 years was either paid
off, or he's only seen "Saw" and "Hostel" movies. This offers nothing
new, nothing fresh, nothing unique. It's just 80 minutes of complete
darkness, stupid characters, and a twist that adds nothing to the
story, so basically, it's a modern "horror" movie. I miss real horror.
