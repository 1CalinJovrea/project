It's not a remake, but that's still not an excuse.

There's been this trend in recent years to remake iconic or at least
popular movies from earlier years. For the most part these movies have
been met with yawns, disinterest and have been rightfully savaged by
the critics and viewers. Occasionally you get a good movie out of it
but more often then not it's just a big, costly mistake. And so to get
around this studios no longer refer to these movies as remakes, but
"reimaginings". The idea is take the concept of the movie and and try
different things. This still doesn't make it a good idea.The 80's version of Flatliners was an interesting movie. The concept of
a group of medical students flatlining and then coming back was
original. It brought with it elements of horror, existentialism and how
our choices can affect both ourselves and others. This one? I struggled to find a positive to give to it and I still
can't. This is a bad movie from every single point of view I can give.
It follows the same story of a group of medical students who in effect
kill themselves for a short period of time to see what's on the "other
side". Then before brain damage can occur they are brought back but
each brings back with them something from their past and they are in
effect haunted by this. It's really the same story as the original even if it's executed in a
different way. There's nothing else that needs to be said. Same thing
but worse. Save your money and rent the original if you want to see this. You'll
be happier and it won't cost you as much.
