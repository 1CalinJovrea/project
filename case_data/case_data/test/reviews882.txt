Way better than the critics want you to believe

I thoroughly enjoyed Chappie. I usually don't write reviews, but after
seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to
write this review.Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie
about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most
of the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and
illogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the
CGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make
up for these shortcomings.Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go
last night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm
very excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like
you've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't
prevent the sequels from being made.If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this
movie.
