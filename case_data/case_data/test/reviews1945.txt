Pretty good

I liked this movie. I like the dialogue its quite charming and the
comedy bits work really well .I was pleasantly surprised that there
were not clich√© moments and the flow of the story came naturally . The
2 main characters have great chemistry and Emilia Clark is simply
adorable .Its a simple story told well.The director of the film did a good job overall however there was 1
problem with this movie and that was the soundtrack they used . Except
the 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and it
really hurt the movie . It gave that cheesy soapy feel of a telenovela
episode.But getting past that i really enjoyed this movie more then i thought i
would and i would recommend watching this . Have fun!
