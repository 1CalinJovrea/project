The absolute worst in the series

There is really nothing to say about this film besides that it's a
complete slap in the face to anyone who is a fan of the Terminator
franchise. The plot is very tedious and the script is poorly thought
out. For instance, nothing in this movie makes any sense whatsoever.
And oh yes, I am going to spoil it for some folks.Basically, we have Kyle Reese sent by John Connor back in time to save
Sarah Connor. But then, Sarah rescues Kyle, and is protected by a
terminator dubbed "Pops" who saved her as a child. So Kyle, Sarah and
Pops plot to prevent Judgement Day from ever happening. Apparently,
"Genisys" was a project said to change the world, but it was really
Skynet and was to bring forth Judgement Day. On top of that, John
Connor turns out to be the bad guy, as he got attacked as he was
sending Kyle, and then becomes something more than man and machine.
Apparently, John is not Earth's hope but Skynet's hope. What? That is
just stupid.Even for a time travel story it is incredibly illogical. In a world
where time travel is possible, I am sure that time can be re-written in
a way, but you have got to have logic. This "time travel" movie defies
logic in every possible way.It's like, the whole thing revolved around John Connor, and Kyle,
Sarah, and Pops successfully stopped Judgement Day. After all of that,
Why would Sarah decide to have a John Connor? And if Sarah decides not
to have a John Connor, then Kyle Reese would not have been sent back in
the first place, and there would be no Terminators sent to kill Sarah.
All of these changes in time would cause a paradox.It is also horribly miscast. Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, and Jason
Clarke did not play their roles very well and they can barely act.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, J.K. Simmons, Matt Smith and that kid (whatever
his name is) who played young Kyle Reese are the only cast members who
could act and were not completely miscast.Not even the special effects are good. Basically, it relies very
heavily on CGI effects and it is very fake looking. The CGI in
Terminator 2: Judgement Day looked great and was very impressive. But
here, it is just very unbelievable and looks like a bad video game.It also had an attempt at comedy that did not work. For example, what
was with that Grin that Pops often made. Was that supposed to be funny?
I loved the first Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Heck, I
even enjoyed Rise of the Machines and Salvation for what they are. But
Genisys was just a terrible mess and an insult to the franchise.Overall, I hated Terminator Genisys and I would not recommend it. If
you are a Terminator fan, you will not like this film.
