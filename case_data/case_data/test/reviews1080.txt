Clever enough to scare us

"The Conjuring 2" is an excellent example of what more sequels should
aspire to be. It is a perfectly executed haunting movie from James Wan
that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision, belief
and faith. The family drama is still right at the center and is quite
effective, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent to their
roles. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre,
but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit
on jump scares. The truth is that "The Conjuring 2" has enough suspense
and story to have appeal for all kinds of horror fans and is a film
clever enough to scare us. nikisreviews.com
