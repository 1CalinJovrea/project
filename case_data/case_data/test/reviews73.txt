What the .....

Come on!! How can anyone give this movie anything more than a 1? I
agree with other reviewers - IMDBs ratings are getting to be ludicrous.I am amazed how someone can take an interesting story and butcher it!!
What about the acting? Phffff!!! At least in real life 70's some of
these guys were actually toked out of their skulls and could thus pass
off lame scenes as powerful acting - not anymore chumps - in spite of
all the fantastic special effects, makeup and cinematographic
techniques that are available today - bad acting is bad acting! period!Watching this movie is like watching paint dry, and bad paint at that.
They should be paying people to watch it not the other way around.
Awful.
