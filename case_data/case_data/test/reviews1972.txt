I don't get the hate

I am a King fan but not of this particular series of books although I
get why fans of the series may be disappointed that it was condensed
into one film. In saying that, if you just take this as a fantasy
action film then I really don't get the hate for it. It was well acted
by all involved, the effects were good and the story kept moving along.
One reviewer described it as the worst film of the year and all I can
say to that is that is you need to watch more films as there have been
some howlers and this definitely isn't one of them. I would agree with
the person who said this was "inspired by" rather than "based on" the
books and I do think people who haven't read the books so aren't
expecting a straight adaptation will enjoy it for what it is. In
summary, I would ignore the hate for this and if you fancy a good
action film give it a go. You could do a lot worse.
