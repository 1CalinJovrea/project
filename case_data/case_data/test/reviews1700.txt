Nice old fashioned entertainment

It was a good film for sure. Simple and touching story. Easy to watch
and very heartwarming. It also tries to avoid as many clich√©s as
possible which was a nice refreshing surprise, as the story was nothing
extraordinarily new. Robert Redford was very good and this performance
is possibly his best of the past years. Really beautiful performance
and a very natural and appealing character. Jane Fonda had the more
challenging role and mastered it wonderfully. She had a lot of
different facets that were captured in her performances. A lot of
secrets are involved in that character and she handled that
excellently. Matthias Schoenaerts was also memorable. The film however
did have some little lengths. Also some characters like the one of Judy
Greer or Phyllis Somerville appear and in the next second disappear
again without any significant to the story. It is always nice to see
Bruce Dern but also he was rather wasted. The score was fitting the
mood of the film but a bit overused. The direction was very calm and
concentrated on the two lead protagonists but sometimes failed to give
the story some drive. Still very worth to see on a rainy Sunday.
