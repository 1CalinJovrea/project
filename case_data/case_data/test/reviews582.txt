So disappointing - LAZY

I thought there was going to be some profound social commentary on the
dangers of technology and humans becoming too reliant on social
media..., for a second it seemed like it was going in the direction of
something special.... but quickly failed to do so by turning into such
a predictable and awful film. I really thought the first 20 -30 minutes
of this film had potential and then it just got lazy and bad. I, like
many others thought this film was going to change our views on hand
held devices, drones, screens and provoke deep discussions about what
we are becoming... but instead I was frustrated and disappointed. This
movie was bad. Just bad. They left so many plot holes and loose ends
even some characters that i thought they were saving for a cool moment
was left out or - i don't know. Lazy disappointing and horrible story.
Its a shame too because the premise was really promising. I cant
believe that this many talented people decided to make AND THEN keep
the last 30 minutes of this film. This movie is trash, I watch tons of
movies and this is one of the worst movies I have seen in awhile.
