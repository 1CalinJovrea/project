OMG, This was bad

Just got back from theater with my wife and had to write.. My top genre
is rom coms and i can enjoy the lamest and most predictable, but this
is a real stinker. I can't believe people clapped at the end, morons.
Other negative posts are right on editing, poor story line with weak
motivations, but the killer for me was ZERO chemistry between Lawrence
and Cooper. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be: comedy,
quirky love story, family healing story, concern for the mentally or
emotionally ill, Benny and Joon? I think they never figured it out or
planned well so they threw it all in. All the actors did a good enough job but the support really let the
movie down. I connected with the movie on 3 scenes only, the best being
when the parlay deal is cut. Shame on Danny Elfman for the music, Led
Zeppelin's "What Is and What Should Never Be" for that scene? Really?
All in all I was ready to leave after about 40 minutes, but my wife
lukewarmly enjoyed it so I had to stay. The word "Oscar" should not
appear in the same sentence with the title of this movie as I see no
one associated with it doing that level of quality work. Pathetic.
