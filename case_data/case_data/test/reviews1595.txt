The Best Movie of The Trilogy

Let me start by saying that for me, this was just a perfect ending, to
an almost perfect trilogy. These 3 movies and Boyhood, proves to me
that Richard Linklater is one of the best directors and writers of our
time. Just the whole way all of the movies are directed is just pure
genius, and you can seriously see Linklater becoming much better step
by step.Just the way these movies are able to portray love and life is like
something I have never seen before I am usually not really the guy to
watch romantic dramas but with these movies really gave me respect for
the genre. So even if you think these movies are in no way for you, I
personally think you are going to be very pleasantly surprised, at
least I was.I actually waited a while before watching them because an old friend
told me these movies sucked, but after watching Boyhood, I knew I had
to watch these movies, and I am so happy I did. I also remember
thinking there was no way the last would be the best, but I was wrong
again and the movies just became better by each one. Just saying that
if you haven't watched the first two, wait and watch them first, or
else I see no point in watching this amazing movie. I seriously can't think of any better way to finish it of. It is
definitely much more sad then the first two, but still got the old
romance to it. The connection between Ethan Hawke and Julie Deply seems
more real than anything I can remember watching. While the other movies are more romantic and definitely more happy,
this movie seems much more real, as much as I love the first two, this
is in my mind definitely the best. I personally think this trilogy
could not possibly have ended any better, at least I can't think of a
way. The way this movie describes love, is in my experience just spot
on. I really can't remember the last time I worried so much for two movie
characters to stay together, and I really feel stupid doing so, but
that is just how amazing this movie are. I think that even if you
didn't like the first two you could very well still like this one. All
I can say is these movies are amazing, and in my mind this one is the
best one of them. I hope you found this review helpful and I hope you
will love the movie as much as I do. 10/10
