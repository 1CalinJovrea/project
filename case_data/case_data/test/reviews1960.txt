Not as enjoyable as other natural disaster movies. Its big, loud, and dumb for what it is trying to be.

A disaster film from the producer of Independence Day tries to bring an
another blockbuster cgi fest with the global world at stake once again.
Plot may be cheesy but I am thinking the film is not meant to be taken
seriously and enjoyed for what it is such as a popcorn flick that is
loud, big, and dumb visual effects action. It does check mark all
those. But Geostorm is not as entertaining or exciting. Gerard Butler
has been missing his marks with films lately from the terrible London
Has Fallen and so on. Its basically Die Hard meets 2012. Gerard Butler
is sent to space in a weather controlling space station that stops
terrible weather around the world. And a virus in the system that has
been planted by someone in the inside of the government or terrorists.
So they can cause a geostorm which can cause a global threat with big
storms hitting everywhere around the planet. From a rapid temperature
decrease that will freeze a person in matter of seconds. To huge
tsunamis. To several tornadoes. And heat waves. Yes, the plot is cheesy. Not meant to be taken seriously. But the
action sequences were not as fun as it is trying to be. The visual
effects were terrible. For a big budget film. The budget must have went
somewhere cause the cgi was bad. The acting was terrible, and the
script is filled with laughable dialogue. Gerard Butler plays Jake, an
engineer that is recruited by his younger brother Max (Jim Sturgess) to
help fix the satellite. While Max's love interest Sarah (Abbie Cornis)
works for the secret service and is on a trail of a conspiracy that
someone has planted the virus in the space station. The action sequences were horrible. Its weird to see a smart car outrun
a giant earth quake with the ground breaking away from the heat wave.
And avoiding buildings that are being knocked down like dominos. Plus
seeing all these explosions is filled with obvious cgi that looked too
fake. The acting was not any better. Gerard Butler is a great guy but placed
in a horrible script. The dialogue is terrible. And cheesy. Overall, Geostorm is a bad disaster film. It is a disaster with its
direction, bad script, boring acting, and terrible visual effects. The
action sequences were not exciting. I rate the film 2 out of 5 stars. I do not recommend the film unless
you want to enjoy a cheesy disaster movie. Otherwise, I ll say wait
until it's a rental.
