the spider-man we all deserve at last

this was the best spider-man movie i have seen in a long time but why
is it the best because it is grounded in the why it tells of peter
struggles with being spider-man and how he trying to cope with it plus
it is not about the iron man at all yes he is key to the plot but it
mainly focuses on spidy plus the cast is amazing and make this a much
watch summer blockbuster.
