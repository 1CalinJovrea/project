Great movie

I watched the movie and couldn't stop laughing, it's great, very
entertaining and even if it wasn't it's always a pleasure to watch Gal
Gadot on screen. The acting was great and the story well written, of
course it's not "thaaat" big production but it's very worth it. I loved
it.
