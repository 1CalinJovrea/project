Yawn of the planet of the apes

After watching the 'not too bad' Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the
8.3 out of 10 rating is what made me think this film might be worth
going to see at the cinema. I mean, if it was a bad film it couldn't
get such a high rating, right? Well God knows who on earth is giving
this such a high rating because it is a very poor film, even with my
low expectations after the first film, which was mediocre (but a lot
better than Dawn).In Dawn, humans have mostly died out. Then some humans (who were
apparently living in their hundreds just down the road from the apes,
despite the apes claiming they haven't seen a human in over 2 years)
stumble upon the apes' den in the forest. The humans want access to the
dam that the apes have built their home around.There are some good humans and some bad. There are some good apes and
some bad. There is some betrayals and then war breaks out. It's all
very, very, VERY predictable and we've seen it all before many, many
times. There really is nothing new or interesting here. I mean, yeah OK
it's an old 'one side against the other' story but Jesus man, if you
want to keep the audience interested you've got to do something a
little different! Every element of this film, including the subplots,
have all been done before and it has taken no talent to write this
story. All of the characters are bland and I really just wanted all the
humans shot, good or bad, so that I wouldn't have to suffer their inane
conversations.I had to give this a 1 because it was so dull, so pointless, so
unoriginal, so bland and a total waste of time.
