The title should tell you everything

This film really isn't for everyone. The first clue is that it's called
filth and there is plenty of that in the form of gratuitous sex and
drug use. The film follows thoroughly unlikable, a-moral, all around
awful person and police officer Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) as he
self destructs his way around Edinburgh. He initially wants a promotion
and is determined to screw over his colleagues but his boozing,
drugging, sexing and general being a terrible person prevent him from
that. And don't forget his metal illness and constant hallucination
which leave him with a tenuous grip on reality .The highlight of the film is James McAvoy's performance. He is
consistently entertaining and I actually managed to find myself caring
a bit about his otherwise awful character by the end. He really carries
and elevates the film. The film itself is rambling and incoherent which
I guess reflects the main characters mental state but it can be a
little hard to follow along, especially considering the fact that many
of the characters have Scottish accents. I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone. It lives up to its name
and then some. It's pretty dark and depressing although it can be funny
at times. If you can get past some the content, the film is worth
seeing for McAvoy performance.
