I despise these movies and they do the books NO justice

OK, so to ANYONE who saw the Sea of Monters, can you honestly tell me
that after Percy is crushed by Kronos, Annabeth's reaction is NOT the
worst piece of acting you've ever saw? I mean, the movie as a whole
sucked, not following the books in the slightest, but that one shot was
just SO horrible.So yes, I despised this movie. Annabeth was a bitch and kept getting
knocked over. I mean, in so many scenes, Annabeth was just knocked over
and out until Percy came over to help her up. And when the bull
attacked Percy, she didn't even go back to return the favor! She just
left him. These movies are killing one of my all time favorite female
characters. Now onto Annabeth's racism. I get that a cyclops killed Thalia, but
that should not have been enough mental scarring to make her hate the
whole race. Now in the books, Annabeth is traumatized by a cyclops who
abducted her friends and used the voice of her neglectful father to
lure her to what would have been her death. Everything bad in her life
was thrown at her there! And her heroes were held captive, completely
relying on her to save them.New topic! So I was very disappointed with the missing scenes. Particularly
Circe's Island. Yes, I get that they incorporated it with the theme
park, but I wanted to see Percy turned into a guinea pig! And Annabeth
save him! And the pirates, and stealing the ship! Which leads me to
another missing scene: The Sirens. I feel as if that was not only a
bonding moment for Percy and Annabeth, but also for the readers to
connect with her.Another bad part was the fighting. The fights were practically all just
monsters throwing people against walls! There was some hand to hand,
and some sword action(That sounds wrong...), but mostly it was
clobbering time with fifty monster hulks! I was very glad that they changed Annabeth's hair to blonde though, It
made the movie seem significantly more on key with the book, even
though the plot was so far off.I also say kudos for the CGI. Especially that Steampunk bull at the
beginning. That was cool.I'm almost glad I paid to see it, just so I could force myself to sit
through the whole thing.
