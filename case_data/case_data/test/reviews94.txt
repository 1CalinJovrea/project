A stunning mindbender.

Coherence, a micro-budget sci-fi thriller from debut director James
Ward Byrkit, is bound to cause debate among all those who view it.
Nonetheless, one fact about this film that seems impossible to deny,
even (or perhaps especially) by its detractors, is the delicious irony
of its title. By definition, the word coherence is the ability to be
easily understood, whereas the titular movie is anything but. This by
no means should be seen as an argument against the film, but rather the
opposite; it is Coherence's enigmatic and seemingly undecipherable
narrative that makes it such an unforgettable and ultimately valuable
viewing experience.Viewers should begin this film with as little knowledge of the story as
possible, but I will indulge in a few basic facts. It takes place over
the course of one night, and is set almost entirely within the confines
of a house in Los Angeles. Emily Baldoni (who shares her name with her
character) leads the eight-person ensemble, which consists of a group
of four couples who convene for what appears to be nothing more than a
friendly dinner party. Within minutes, the interpersonal relationships
between these couples begin to come to light through the most mundane
of conversation. Their topic of discussion quickly turns to a comet
that is currently passing over the United States, and the rumors of
supernatural occurrences that these celestial events have caused in the
past. These paranormal phenomena begin to occur at the party at an
exponentially increasing rate and magnitude, turning the characters'
notions of reality, personal identity, and relationships completely
upside-down.When discussing this film, comparisons will inevitably be drawn to
other similarly heady (and similarly micro-budget) sci-fi ventures such
as Primer and Another Earth. While both of those films manage to
present an equally impressive amount of ideas given their financial
restrictions, Coherence successfully avoids the former's frustratingly
abstruse dialogue and the latter's occasional slips into pretension.
Indeed, what makes the film one of the most successful of its niche is
its ability to maintain a sense of groundedness. Even when the audience
has very little idea what is happening (which is the majority of the
movie), the film never feels frustrating because the characters share
that sense of cluelessness. Their behavior is exactly what one would
expect in such an unexpected situation, a strength owed both to
Byrkit's wisely improvisational approach to directing and an impressive
ensemble of actors who never lose their sense of relatability.The true star of Coherence, however, is undoubtedly the mindbending and
constantly engrossing screenplay. The narrative unfolds like a puzzle
so complex that even the most attentive viewer will find it tough to
put the myriad pieces together on a first watch, and even tougher to be
certain that a complete solution exists. However, what's beautiful
about this viewing experience is that the story's intricacy becomes
increasingly evident throughout the film's 89-minute running time. The
script abounds with small details and fleeting conversations that
initially appear to be meaningless filler, but ultimately reappear in
various forms that completely recontextualize their precedents. Even more impressive is that as Byrkit's story explores and weaves its
complex scientific ideas together, it still manages to achieve
uniformly strong character development. The supernatural events incite
the revelation of secrets and the gradual evolution and devolution of
the various relationships that exist among the eightsome. Unlike many
other films of its type, however, Coherence's characterizations do not
feel like a tacked-on afterthought to a concept-heavy story; rather,
the characters and the narrative feel organically linked, as though
Byrkit created these individuals while simultaneously coming up with
the intricate, conceptual narrative.Coherence should be seen as a paradigm of microbudget filmmaking,
presenting a sci-fi tale infinitely more interesting than the majority
of its infinitely higher-budgeted and effects-heavy blockbuster
contemporaries. Of course, many viewers of Coherence will be
immediately put off by its blatantly low-budget feel and the
naturalistic acting style. Others will likely be frustrated by the
film's lack of an overt resolution and their inability to make much
sense of the cerebral, metaphysical concepts that are presented.
Nonetheless, (what I hope will be) the majority of the film's viewers
will appreciate the astounding inventiveness of Byrkit's narrative and,
like me, will have the immediate urge to rewatch it. Until then,
whether there is a completely seamless solution to be found remains a
mystery, but either way, trying to find it proves to be an exhilarating
thrill.
