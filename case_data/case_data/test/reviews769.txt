How Do These Get Made?

I very rarely take the time to review movies, but I had to put in my
two cents' worth on this one. I should start by saying that I'm not a
big Adam Sandler fan. I don't dislike him, I generally just don't like
his movies. A few exceptions would be 50 First Dates, which I liked,
and Click and The Wedding Singer, which weren't bad.But this movie . . . Wow! Did anyone at Netflix read the script before
they green-lighted it? I cannot imagine anything worse, even if they
had intended to make a bad movie.Apparently Mel Brooks said something about this movie in relationship
to Blazing Saddles, saying that Sandler's movie couldn't touch Brooks'
classic film. Boy, was he right. You want to see a great comedy
Western? Put on Blazing Saddles again.
