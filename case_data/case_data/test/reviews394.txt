Thick on analogies and symbolism, to the point of overkill

I saw this at TIFF and the point this movie was trying to make became
clear fairly early on. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but as the
story developed, the analogies and symbolism went into overkill, to the
point where their excessive nature diminished what was an interesting
story.The movie is helmed by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, two actors
I'm particularly fond of. The short summary of this movie is that they
are a couple who live in a beautiful, remote home. One night they take
in an unwanted house guest (Harris), more at Bardem's choosing than
Lawrence's. This leads to countless other house guests and invasions
from the outside world, often to the detriment of Bardem & Lawrence's
beautiful home, and Lawrence's well-being. As the movie goes on, these violations against the home and Lawrence
get increasingly bizarre and excessive. They get laid on so thick that,
even if you have figured out the analogy by the midway point of the
movie and enjoy the way the movie is getting it's point across, the
sheer madness that transpires in the second half of the film is likely
to sour you on the overkill applied to the message. It becomes fairly apparent that the house and Lawrence's character from
which the movie is titled represent our planet. Bardem's character
represents a creator/God (in credits, his character is simply known as
'Him'). Harris and Pfeiffer, the original, invasive guests, are the
original Man & Woman (Adam & Eve), and from there, a lot of the plot
initially descends from biblical references and then into His desire to
provide for his followers and to be adored by them, ignorant of how
detrimental they are to the house and Mother. At the very end, the house becomes overpopulated with people who are
both zealots and warmongers who descend into utter 'WTF' madness while
they destroy the home, murder the couple's child, and force Mother to
burn down the home she so painstakingly created, killing everyone
inside it. After the fire, He carries her out, and recreates the home
with a new Mother. As I said, it's a story thick on symbolism and message. I personally
liked what they were going for, but think it could have been a much
better movie if they had done it far subtly than with the extreme
overkill they employed in the second half of this film. Looking at the
reviews, I see a lot of people torn by this movie, and I think for
these reasons. Some people didn't clue into the message very well and
just thought it was a movie that made no sense. Others may not have
liked the pro-environment analogies, while some may have loved how
excessive the movie hammered it's point home. Another group likely felt
how I did - that the plot and point was unique and interesting, but the
sheer madness the film careened into during the second half was
extremely excessive.Overall, I give it a 6/10, with disappointment that a promising concept
wasn't executed more sensibly.
