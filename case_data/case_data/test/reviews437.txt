A quality change of fate for Pixar

Everything about Brave is different from the Pixar norm, save the
unequaled attention to detail and quality.The Disney-Pixar animated feature focuses on Princess Merida as she
searches for a way to change her fate. In a journey of magic, adventure
and family, the fiery Scot is launched into the ranks of the elite
Disney princesses. As odd and understandably foreign as the accents felt watching the
early previews for the movie, the voice acting was executed following,
creating very real characters that fit their animated molds perfectly.
By the end of the movie, what once sounded foreign blended into the
scenery and visuals to create a completely immersing environment.In fact, amid the magic spells and tall tales of times gone by, it's
the historical, Scottish feeling that made Marida's journey and
transformation (and that of her mother) that much more tangible and
familiar.Underneath the folk-tale storyline lies the same life lessons that ring
true for young and old. Though the movie heavily focuses on a mother-
daughter relationship, it's not just for girls anymore than Mulan was.
Merida is a true Disney princess, with gumption, heart and an uncanny
connection with nature, but the story could have been told from a male
perspective and rung just as true, making it easy to empathize with
Pixar's first female lead.As has been the case with almost every other one of their movies, the
company has reinvented the standard for animated visuals. The
environments are based on real Scottish landmarks, adding real depth to
the story, and the colors are as bright as they are grounded, creating
a wonderfully real world. Such visuals lend credence to the upcoming 3D
re-release of Finding Nemo, though not much, but also show just how far
the studio has come. All of the elements put together, Brave is a different sort of movie
than many were expecting. More focused on a single pair and their quest
together, not to mention darker by far, the story of Merida was a leap
of faith for the once small studio. Many will have their doubts, left wanting another heart wrenching love
story from Up or creative take on a beat to death genre like The
Incredibles. That was never the purpose. Just as with every one of
their award-winning films (Cars 2 notwithstanding), a new movie means a
new chapter, new story and new style of film.Taken for what it is, Brave is a remarkable step into a whole new style
of movie, proving the creative teams at Pixar will continue to write
their own fate.
