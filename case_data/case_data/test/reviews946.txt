Annoying tedious boring policor piece of crap!

Reservoir dogs, pulp fiction & jackie brown are timeless classics.
Since then every movie QT made got worse and worse. He reached a new
low though with this annoying boring policor (politically correct)
piece of crap! It became clear to me though that not Uma Thurman, but
S.L. Jackson is his muse. And clearly QT has the hots for him which
became very clear in this film. +++spoiler+++ There's this scene where Mr. Jackson tortures a white
(hence racist) person to death by letting him walk nude through cold
snow for 2 hours. As the dying victim begs for a blanket Jackson gets
his big black **** out and forces him to suck it while he laughs
sadistically. +++spoiler stop+++It's very obvious to me that what we're experiencing here is an example
of 'mirroring'. QT clearly would love to suck the big black **** of
Jackson himself and expresses that by creating this 'shocking' scene
which is clearly a depiction of his own sexual fantasy. One really
doesn't need a psychology degree to figure that out. Wel Quentin... go
ahead and suck big black **** all day long. I couldn't care less. What
I do care about though is that you should stop making these annoying
boring policor movies.Explaining the policor accusation: The movie apparently takes place
shortly after the civil war in America. Protagonist Jackson kills a lot
of people but they're all bad cause they are from the south... hence
they are racist and deserve to die. The fact that Jackson himself is a
mega racist is not supposed to make us stop cheering for this
protagonist though because... well let's face it... he's black so he
can't be racist.... and he's black.. so he is cool. To clarify:
protagonist Jackson is was a**hole, he annoyed me and I definitely
wasn't cheering for him for friggin' 2 hours and 45 minutes!I could go on for another hour but I made my point and wasted enough
time by watching this hyped poor excuse of a movie. This movie was even
worse that the stupid nazi movie and the dumb slavery movie he made. I
didn't think that would be possible but Quentin... you pulled it off!
