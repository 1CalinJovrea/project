feel-good movie of the year

In my opinion, Chef is the feel-good movie of the year. And this is not
because of the plot or the acting. The former is predictable while the
latter is alright with a lot funny moments.Chef is good because of the atmosphere. It radiates good mood despite
everything that might befall the protagonists. And when it comes to the
scenes with preparing food, Chef will make your mouth water. In my case
it happened after a hefty dinner, which gives you the feeling how good
they are.With this being said and if you're acquainted with the current offer of
comedies in cinema or on TV, you'll appreciate Chef for it's unassuming
delivery.
