More Propaganda....

First off, the historical revisionism is testament to the pure and
brazen ignorance of the production crew and lack of an historical
adviser when this went into production, with the almost terrifyingly
obtuse view to making a film that follows the cheap tried and tested
Hollywood formula that we've all witnessed a hundred times already.From the paper boy waving a paper saying bombs were about to be dropped
in '1939', to god only knows how many facets of fantasy created out of
a well documented Turing's life, and I can't remember accurately right
now but I think they even mentioned Churchill as being Prime Minister
in 1939 which is untrue, this film was an exercise in inaccuracies.These inaccuracies I was quite prepared to forgive until I started
witnessing the exact same structure of film as I would be expected to
see in a comic book film. We introduce an antagonist who causes great
conflict, we already know our protagonist who is a victimised target of
bullies and the entire world is out to shoot him down but he must
overcome great odds to beat a much more powerful enemy. We even witness
the classic buddy moment where our heroes at their lowest ebb have a
motivational coming together of understanding and mutual respect where
their bond of friendship gives them renewed vigour and hope, and not
least of all, the power to overcome their great enemy, 'The Commander'.
Not to mention of course that this film even managed to chuck a twist
into the mix as well. Sure, it wouldn't be a Hollywood style film
without a twist now would it? Add a couple of scenes that are so fake it'll make your head spin and
you've got your film, e.g. 'his brother just happens to be on that
exact boat!!??' Good grief, give me a break.This sickened me to the core of my being. Can film makers really not
appreciate that people have more intelligence than that of a wombat.
I'm starting to feel like a zombie whose soul reason in life is to
watch the same generic film again and again and again with the odd good
film thrown in like a needle in a hundred haystacks. Originality isn't
even worth speculating about anymore, it's a myth that died a death
with cuchulainn. It was such a bad ploy to create this absolute ass of a character and
then have us empathise with him because the world is against him. It
doesn't even try to speculate that he might bring it on himself. 'Just
get the damn audience to EMPATHISE' said the director, I presume. There
isn't much in the way of character here, he's an ass, played very well
by Cumberbatch who can do no wrong at the moment it seems, but very one
dimensional a character nonetheless, Oh yes, they try to get him to
change and get along with everyone which he does, but just so we could
have our great comic book buddy scene where the evil 'Commander' is put
in his place until the next episode of Turing and Friends when the
Commander tries to destroy the world with his next fiendish plot.And what was with all the gay apologies at the end? I thought this film
was about Enigma. I use the phrase 'about Enigma' quite quite loosely
here since this film had very little resemblance to reality. But almost
all the blurbs were about him being gay, and other gays and how they
were mistreated. I'm sorry, was this film not about Enigma? Clearly
not, they must have been afraid that people wouldn't want to see a film
about a gay man? Looks that way.So yea, I was disappointed with this, just didn't care about the main
character, too much empathy mining was going on here. Not to mention
the ridiculously simplistic way in which they supposedly cracked the
code. But like I've said, dumbed down cinema for easy digestion.
