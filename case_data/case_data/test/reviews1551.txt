Watch it for Noomi Rapace's dazzling performance

"Seven Sisters" (2017 release from the UK and France; 123 min.; US
title "What Happened to Monday") opens with a clever montage as to the
world's population explosion, leading eventually to a "one child per
family" policy. But that doesn't stop Karen Settman, who bears 7
daughters (and dies in childbirth). Karen's dad Terrence is determined
to raise his granddaughters "the right way", naming them after the days
of the week, and composing an overall "Karen Settman" composite,
whereby each of them is allowed to leave the house on the day of the
week they are named after. Then one day Monday doesn't return home...
At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would
spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how
it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Norwegian director
Tommy Wirkola, best known for "Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters" a few
years ago. Here he goes into the sci-fi direction , playing out what
happens in 2073 when society allows only one child per family and other
siblings are put into a "cryosleep" until one day things hopefully get
better. The movie's overall feel is quite original and imaginative,
even if there are plot holes the size of Manhattan. But much of that is
compensated by the dazzling performance of Noomi "Girl With Dragon
Tattoo" Rapace, who plays all seven sisters, doing it with nuance and
fervor. The action scenes are at times way over the top, but always
entertaining. Glenn Close has a small role as the "baddie", while
William Defoe has an even smaller role as Terrence Settman. But in the
end, it's all about Noomi Rapace and her amazing performance.I caught "Seven Sisters" in the theater recently while on a family
visit to Belgium. The matin√©e screening where I saw this at in Antwerp,
Belgium was attended nicely.Upon my return to the US< I noticed the
movie has been renamed "What Happened to Monday" for reasons I cannot
phantom ("Seven Sisters" seems so much more appropriate). THe movie has
been streaming on VOD, and hence I don't know that I will get a
theatrical release in the US, which is a shame. Bottom line: if you are
a fan of Noomi Rapace, you'll want to check it out, be it on VOD or
eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.
