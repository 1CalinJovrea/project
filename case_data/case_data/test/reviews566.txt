Best action movie that I saw

Not worth 18 certificate on the grounds of violence, I've seen more
violent movies in my life for almost 58 years(I'm born in 1958 and I'm
watching movies from when I was 3 years old). And I have seen thousands
of films, almost all from 1961 onward and thousands of movies made
before I was born. In terms of action, Hardcore Henry has the highest
level of adrenaline, pure adrenaline, the highest quality. Now I
believe that people, not all of them, only some people, can levitate.
I'm kidding, of course. But everything is so well done in this film,
that it almost seems truthful. The stunts are downright breathless. But
not only. All actors, music, editing, everything. It makes you want to
see it again and again, to understand it and feel better. An
exceptional film, excellent. Ilya Naishuller, I want to work with you!
And, to answer to a guy here on IMDb, concerning the problem he has
with the stupid "dance routine" in the middle, I don't know Ilya
Naishuller but, I'm almost sure that he wanted to pay homage to Stanley
Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971), a film in exactly the same kind, a
masterpiece of the genre, a film about violence and how violence can be
cured. Remember the dance scene of Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) to
the tune Singin 'in the Rain? Maybe Ilya Naishuller will tell us... 10
out of 10.
