Ridiculous

It's funny how I created an account for this website just to tell
people how awful this movie was. I had the benefit of seeing this movie
before it came out last night at my work, and even I felt like I was
being cheated out of time and money. I can't imagine paying to see this
film. Now, obviously I wasn't expecting a serious film. With the title, I
expected an entertaining film with a lot of blood, gore, and action
sequences. This movie however, tried to be so much more, while
retaining a ridiculous plot and ludicrous action sequences. Every fight
scene was either poorly crafted or so unbelievably stupid I almost
walked out of a movie I didn't even have to pay for. The plot itself
was also terrible. Characters barely introduced somehow become
relevant, and acting was so bad at parts I laughed at the
actors/actresses. It seemed like the only character who aged was Abe,
characters such as Mary Todd's fianc√© just disappear, and every single
one liner from the beginning of the film is repeated. You know, that
can work. Spider-Man's classic "With great power comes great
responsibility" was okay. But when the characters repeat 6 or 7
different lines it gets old. fast. If you can't help yourself, then go see this film. I was intrigued by
the title and hoped to see Abe kick some ass. But this film is just so
outright ridiculous. I feel like I've said that word way too many
times, but it's the only word to describe it. Abe goes from a frail and
tall guy to an axe swinging backflipping badass without anymore
training than chopping down a tree (which was also a poorly done
scene). I don't even think I can say something good about this film,
other than the idea. This movie could have been very entertaining had
it not lost total sense of reality and human capability. I found myself
yelling "as if" multiple times during the film. If you don't believe
me, see it for yourself.
