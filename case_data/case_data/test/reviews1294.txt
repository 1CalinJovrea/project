One of Spielberg's best most recent movies

Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks,
co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even
though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very
little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than
ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's
most recent movies.In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during
the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and
Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and
each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified
information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is
arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom
Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of
defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and
difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an
American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured
by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring
countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war,
Abel for Powers.Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely
made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is
most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven
Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments
where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong
and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another
memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his
versatility as an actor.I rate it 8.5/10.
