- They try to kill Money in a party! Why? Just wait for him to be alone
then get the job done. What's the point of getting him murdered in a
crowded area? It didn't seem that they (Shotgun and Herman) would be
the first suspects if Money gets killed.- Jennifer sues him, but their families seemed very close to each
other.- The lawyer knows about that prison and its dangerous situations. So,
the guards, manager and ... must know it too. And yet, no one seems to
care.- The scene in prison where he kills the snitch was weird.- In the riot scene, how they've got those long blades? Did they do it
like that balloon? Why did he save Herman Gomez? Why did the sniper
shoot to the head? I think firing to the sky or a leg would be
sufficient too. See, this is a prison where they put him in. Why? The
whole riot idea was wrong. Why would you riot when you know that
some/all of your guys might get killed or be seen by cameras? What's
the point? Where did this obsession to kill other guys come from?- How did he figure out how to open handcuffs with that thing?- At the end, he receives a letter from his son. He says "I will learn
from your mistakes." What mistakes exactly? Driving carelessly?- Emory Cohen's character (Howie) wasn't convincing. He looks so naive
to decide and plan this deal, find contractors to move guns to America,
and get involved with gangsters. Even by cooperating with his friend in
Afghanistan, it seemed strange.- So, criminals in a gang follow someone who kills their current boss.
The new boss just needs to claim it.- Character development wasn't OK.- There is almost a loop in background music.Perhaps with some changes in the script and characters this would be a
great movie. But it's not.
