Not really a comedy

This picture is being sold as a comedy...however it is more like a
drama with some comedic elements...and those few comedic moments aren't
really that funny. The movie examines with a cynical eye a relationship
that the director wants to present as a real loving one. However,
anyone in the audience can see that this relationship has problems. The
female lead is an annoying selfish character while the male character
is wimpy and feels sorry for himself.The movie is extremely self indulgent...it was written by the director
and by the star. I don't think they wanted to leave any scenes out. The
movie meanders for over two hours. It could have easily been a 90
minute film.
