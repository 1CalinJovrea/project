An enjoyable albeit at times incompetent slasher.

Let's start off by saying that this movie will in no way win any awards
(apart from maybe a teen choice) or win over the hearts of audiences
that are already skeptical to the legitimacy of the genre, but if
nothing else, it's a bloody fun ride (pun intended).The story is simple enough, twelve year old nerd crushing on his super
attractive babysitter, babysitter turns out to be a murderous
psychopath, nerd's gotta get the hell out of dodge, let the games
begin! The kills are surprisingly inventive so gore hounds can rest
easy in the knowledge that they wont be short changed in that respect.
The performances are all decent enough but the stand outs for me have
to go to Samara Weaving as the murderous babysitter, a role she clearly
relished and had a ball playing, Judah Lewis as the unfortunate victim
who delivers a charming and at times rather amusing performance, and
Emily Alyn Lind as the young boy's sweet and loyal friend who impresses
with her understated portrayal that convinced me that there may just be
bigger and better things for her on the horizon. Overall, If you're looking for an hour and a half to kill then there's
definitely worse ways. An enjoyable gore fest that delivers mostly what
you'd be expecting with nice tension filled set pieces and a bonkers
yet strangely touching finale thrown in for good measure.
