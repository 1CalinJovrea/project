So...This Is Supposed to be a Great Film?  Nah.

I admire Korean director and filmmaker Bong Joon Ho. It's OK to have
your own style, and moviegoers appreciate seeing films that offer
something different, like the works of Terry Gilliam or even the Cohen
Brothers. Okja is a film with many different purposes. Unfortunately, it never
really gives any of these purposes the lead. They are blended into a
painful two hours of clichéd characters, terrible scripting, weak
social statements and constant changing tones. It's hard to really
understand which part of the movie drives the narrative. One of the tones and themes of the film is that our society and its
companies are vicious murderers of those poor pigs, each of which is
genetically modified and then slaughtered concentration camp style for
those awful human consumers. Well, this is life folks, and I promise
you that a slaughterhouse is far worse than what you see on film. Is
the film anti- meat, or is the meat production business just incidental
to the story line? We really don't know. And, just as a side note, if
our protagonists are to save the animals from human consumption, how is
it that the little girl, our central character, plucks a fish out of
the stream in the early part of the film and serves it for dinner? If
this movie had any substance, I would have said that the fish scene was
planted there for irony. But, it wasn't. As for the rest of the film, some of film's best talent were assembled
to portray characters that are predictable and clichéd, and the actors
were given really bad dialog. It was amateur hour throughout the film.
There were no surprises, and those "tear jerker" moments that other
reviewers keep sniffling over were barely any kind of emotional
triggers. On a plus side, the CGI animal effects truly brought our pig characters
to life, and the audience "buys" the super pig as being real. But,
let's be real. Pigs, even genetically modified super pigs don't cry.
They don't understand humans (this one understood both English and
Korean), and they don't wave goodbye to their offspring that get saved
from slaughter. Sure, you will say that the pig emotions are symbolic,
however, symbolism isn't achieved by making these film pigs emotional
creatures. Anyway, in the end, when I read all the rave reviews of this film, I
feel like the guy at the art show staring at a white canvas that some
famous artist has splashed with a brush of black paint.. The people
around me marveling at how the painting represents life, the universe
and everything...and all I see is a white painting with some black
paint spilled on it.
