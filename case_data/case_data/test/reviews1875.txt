not worth watching

A talent like Charlize Theron in a movie like this i would have to say
the worst movie i have seen in a very long time no acting whatsoever
nothing to take away except what sounded like a genuine laugh from
Charlize when they were watching the sunset after eating pot biscuits.
but then again slap stick comedy seems to be the up and coming thing in
today's generation why i don't know didn't find it funny at all were
they reading the words of a board. the budget must have been very low
and all money made must have been for a charity no effort at all.the
director Seth MacFarlane has not made a movie worth watching as yet try
something else dude take up a trade
