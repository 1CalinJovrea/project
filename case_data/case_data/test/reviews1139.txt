Blue is the Warmest Color + Oldboy = The Handmaiden

Not the craziest film content wise, that award goes to The Neon Demon,
but definitely the craziest film storytelling wise. Park Chan-Wook's
The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map,
Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the
most unforgettable films of 2016. Think of The Handmaiden as The Duke of Burgundy F'd Up Edition. This
film is pretty twisted in the most unexpected ways from the
cinematography that is very reminiscent of Possession in that it always
keeps moving, eroticism that is reminiscent of Blue is the Warmest
Color, performances as spellbinding as Carol, and the insanity of Park
Chan- Wook as expected. The cinematography is some of the most entrancing of the year. Shots
that look like they came out of The Master. It's shots like these that
make me wonder how was this even possible? It looks so damn cool!The performances are perfect in sucking you into this world of erotica,
selfishness, and trickery. Both female leads were fantastic. Min-hee
Kim and Kim Tae-ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with
the audience watching. It's films like these that are the most
memorable. Making you feel how ther characters are feeling. Jung-woo Ha
and Jin- woong Jo were great as these sexually and financially
repressed men who do the most screwed up things to feel the pleasure
they so desire. Nothing wrong with the cast at all. Of course Park Chank-Wook hits it out of the part with directing. How
else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche for detail.
He always knows exactly what to do to get an emotion out of his
audience and I applaud him for that. The only negative is that during the middle briefly the pacing slows
down a lot and it became really unbearable because I wanted to know
exactly what was going to happen next. Thankfully it doesn't last that
long and it's really minor that probably won't affect others viewings. If you have any interest in The Handmaiden or you've just heard about
it for the first time I strongly suggest checking this out as soon as
it comes out. I'll definitely re watch it when it releases in theaters.
Easily one of the best films of the year and one I hope to re watch
soon.
