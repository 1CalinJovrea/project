Pretty Good Actually

When I first heard of this film, I had no intention of seeing it at
all. The concept -- a night in which nearly all crime is legal -- is
attractive and repelling at the same time. And the annoying use of
"America the Beautiful" in the promos makes the whole thing seem
pretentious and preachy.Anyway, curiosity got the better of me, and I checked it out. I have to
say that I'm glad I did. The film presents a decently told story,
sympathetic characters, and, yes, a pretty unsettling look at what
things would probably be like if this were to actually happen. But it's
not all about chaos. As in real life, you're reminded that the world
can be a pretty dark place, but there's a good deal of decency in human
nature as well.It must be said that all of the actors do a great job. For me, the most
touching part of the film was the growing relationship between
Sergeant, Eva, and Eva's daughter Cali. This trio forms an unexpected
familial bond throughout, and you truly care about them as the tale
progresses. Overall, I have to commend creator James DeMonaco for
crafting a pretty solid and memorable movie.
