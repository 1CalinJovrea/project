Over-BAD

Do not waste your time with this movie. -Directing is bad: car chases
are slow and the director does not give the audience a single frame
that would surprise or be exiting to watch, a lot of editing mistakes,
bad special effects (like the Porsche 911 that catches fire after a
crash...). French companies were in charge of the special FX (umedia
VFX and Digital District) and while they must have put a lot of effort
to do their job with a budget...the result is laughable. -Acting is
very bad: Scott Eastwood CAN NOT ACT. So does the rest of the crew... -
Cars: We're talking about a car movie...and the cars were just
ridiculous except for two... - Bad script: very predictable (if you
didn't see the twist coming at the end...you're not very bright) - I
would like to ask Mr. Scott Eastwood and the movie producers to refund
my tickets for this movie!
