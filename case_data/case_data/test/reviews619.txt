Absolutely gripping and one of the all time most difficult movies to watch

This is perhaps one of the best movies I have seen in 2015 and yet I
would think twice before watching it again. The Stanford Prison
experiment is a taut and intriguing drama hat manages to thrill you for
most of its run time as well as making you terribly uneasy as you
ponder as to why people behave as they do in the movie. Inspire by the
real life prison experiment conducted at Stanford University in 1971
using college students where some would be assigned as guards and some
prisoners and were stationed in a mock prison for 14 days within the
Stanford University premises itself. It proved to be one of the most
disastrous and widely criticized psychology experiments ever conducted
by mankind and was shut down in just 6 days.The movie doesn't spend too much time on buildup as you start feeling
the claustrophobia and sense of loss of freedom quite early on. The
script has been top notch as well as the direction. The best part about
the script that I loved was that it remained truthful to the actual
events and the documentary style cinematography added so much realism
to the experience. The other impressive aspect of this movie is the acting. The casting
doesn't involve any big superstar names, rather most of them are well
known in the indie and television scenes. Phillip Zambardo's character
development was pulled off by Billy Crudup with absolute finesse while
Ezra Miller and Thomas Mann left a lasting impression with the
devolution of their respective characters. The rest of the cast,
especially the ones who played the prisoners were great as well, as
they were constantly able to maintain the sense of helplessness and
psychological deterioration throughout. The main star of the film,
however, is Michael Angarano. His character is what everybody would
love to hate. I used to remember Angarano as this charming kid in
Almost Famous and Lords of Dogtown and I was quite shocked to witness
the whole sadistic and borderline sociopath side of him. The only shortcoming I felt was the overall pacing. The movie slowed
down at some points; especially during the first half (I am not going
to spoil anything) and it could've done a better editing job. Some of
the cast, especially on the guard side could've used a bit more screen
time since the camera was almost entirely focused on Michael Angarano.
However, this doesn't diminish the quality of movie in any way. It's a
great albeit cringe worthy study of human psyche and the movie will
leave a long trail of questions for you to think about. Overall, The Stanford Prison Experiment is undoubtedly a great
cinematic achievement both in terms of visual style, storyline, acting
and direction. This is not exactly a family movie or something you want
to watch with your girlfriend and definitely not a feel-good
experience, but if you are a fan of psychological thrillers, then this
film will give you a run for your money. My IMDb rating is 8.1/10.
