Please don't ruin any more Lee Child novels!

The first JR movie was acceptable. This one, terrible! It opens with 4
guys beaten and laying in a parking lot. JR is inside a diner. We don't
know what exactly happened or why it happened. But of course JR is
responsible. Not even sure why this scene was there. It serves
absolutely no purpose or story enhancement.There are so MANY plot holes it is impossible to keep count. JR may
have a daughter, conveniently he finds her almost instantly. Guys with
guns never used them properly or hit JR.The scene when he is in prison and talking with his attorney, at the
exact moment he is looking outside the window (convenient), he sees 2
bad guys coming in. They of course look the part, and park right
outside the window at the exact time JR is looking outside. He then
gets his lawyer to go get him a sandwich and she leaves her briefcase
and wallet behind. JR then proceeds to escape a maximum security prison
with little effort.It goes on and on like that. He spots his 'daughter' in a huge
Halloween parade in New Orleans, with literally thousands of people on
the streets. It is really a terrible injustice to Lee Child and his wonderful
novels. Typical Hollywood hack and slash job on brilliant novels and
story. Don't waste your money and pay to see it. If you must watch it, wait
for it to be on regular cable TV shortly.
