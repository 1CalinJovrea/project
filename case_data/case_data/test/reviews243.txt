Great Film, ignore the critics on this one

Just got back from seeing it and we were thoroughly entertained. Depp
and Hammer were fantastic in their roles and the action was over the
top, as expected. Be advised, this film is told from Tonto's point of
view based on his recollections of what transpired. This is not an
Oscar contender, nor was it ever intended to be, but it is a great
popcorn flick. It is violent in certain scenes and may not be suitable
for smaller children, but for adults and tweens, it is about right. I
did think that the first 10-15 mins or so were a little too slap-sticky
for me, but once it gets going, it gets good. To all of the naysayers
out there, what did you think you were going to see? It is essentially
a western Pirates of the Caribbean, and Depp portrayed his character
with the usual humorous persona he always does.
