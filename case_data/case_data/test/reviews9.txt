A total disaster!

After reading many positive reviews here and elsewhere, I was eager to
see this. But to my surprise this turned out to be one of the most
overrated movies I've ever seen. The first half is the cheesiest piece
of Hollywood cinema in recent years and the second half contains the
stupidest war action ever aside from comedy; it seemed like slapstick
to me! I really have no clue how people can rate this highly. A total
disaster of a movie!
