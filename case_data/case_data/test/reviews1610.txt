Not the worst movie, but close.

This was an awful movie with gross items and topics that overplayed the
tennis match climax into an LGBTQ movie that if known at the time 0
people would have been watching this match in support of King. This was
written mostly from King's view and simply is not accurate. This movie
is about how the rich and the famous hide behind their fame and in
truth showed Larry (King's wife) not divorcing his wife just for the
fame and money when he found she was unfaithful. President Obama bless
his heart awarded King for her being LGBTQ, and not for the actual
winning of a man that was out of shape and just putting on a show. Warning.. Don't let your kids watch this or you can say goodbye to
their values.
