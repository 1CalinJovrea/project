Poor Screenplay

With foreign investments, it did not indicate that the production house
had to add in so many unnecessary foreign elements into the movie. Is
it even necessary to start off the story in a Chinese restaurant? Where
was the link? Foreign elements should be added if they were needed to
tell the story and not simply just to please the foreign investors.
They only make the story weaker. The story line of the movie was
ridiculously unbelievable, and the screenplay was absolutely
disappointing. The lines were so pale and redundant. It lacked what a
big blockbuster movie should have. No explanation was given for many
scenes, and it became very puzzling and exaggerating. This was not a
small budget movie, but it turned out to be one brainless movie.
