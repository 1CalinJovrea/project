As an action movie, it's great. As a true Bourne-like thriller, not so much.

The original Bourne trilogy of Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum were
brilliant displays in effective storytelling and great action. Jason
Bourne, however, isn't quite as proficient in both of those areas. On
the one hand, it's action-packed to the brim, and provides for a hugely
entertaining watch, but on the other, it's a disappointment as far as
bringing yet another intriguing and truly thrilling mystery to life is
concerned.Let's start on the bright side, however, with the action. Paul
Greengrass does yet another sterling job at directing some hugely
exciting action sequences (including a thrilling chase in Athens that
harks back to Ultimatum's Tangier chase), and in tandem with yet
another excellent performance by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne himself,
the action is definitely the best part of this film.Where the story lacks, Jason Bourne more often than not gives you some
insane action to revel at. Sure, it's not the work of storytelling
geniuses, but if you're the sort of person who can turn their brain off
for two hours and watch wall-to-wall action and explosions, then this
film will have you in dreamland. It's not a Michael Bay movie, and
Greengrass' style lends a lot to making more vibrant action sequences,
but there's no doubt that fans of big action will love this film.On the whole, I did enjoy this film, and I was able to recognise its
flaws and just watch it as a big blockbuster. However, I can't escape
feeling disappointed at the film's total failure to tell as intriguing
a story as the first three films in the series.The enthralling mysteries and gradual revelations about Jason Bourne's
past were what really separated this series from any other spy
thriller. In this movie, however, everything felt a lot more generic,
with a much bigger emphasis on action than clever storytelling and
patient, gradual character and plot development. Unfortunately, it's
that that makes Jason Bourne look pale in comparison to the original
trilogy, and those who are expecting yet another engrossing and
intelligent thriller will certainly be disappointed.That said, there are bright moments in the story too. It's not a
horrifically dull film, and there are a few details that relate right
the way back to The Bourne Identity. What's more is that Matt Damon,
Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones all put in very strong performances
to add a degree of gravitas to what is in truth a very clich√©d and
repetitive story, which was good to see.Overall, I am disappointed by Jason Bourne, in that it doesn't manage
to tell such an enthralling and intelligent mystery as the series'
original trilogy, but its top-quality action and strong directing and
performances still allowed me to have a lot of fun for two hours.
