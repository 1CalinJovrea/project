Itialian Film Noir

I had this on my list on Netflix because we are headed to Rome in the
spring. Thought we would see some on the Roman sights but this is NOT
"3 Coins in a Fountain". It is an excellent movie...very good acting,
interesting but not likable characters, fascinating story line. I would
not normally recommend a movie where almost all the characters are
anti- heroes. The pacing and interesting camera shots move the movie
along and we really could not stop watching. My wife and I both really
liked this film. It involves much of what we think of as the
disreputable portions of many great cities; politicians, gangs and
their rivals, organized crime and even the church. I was surprised that
no major US critics reviewed the movie which is a shame. It is very
good, gritty film making.
