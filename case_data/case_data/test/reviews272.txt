a treasure trove where love can germinate from a most barren place

A biopic of the arthritis-inflicted Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis
(1903-1970) from Nova Scotia, directed by Irish female director Aisling
Walsh, and starring a transmogrified Sally Hawkins as the scraggly Maud
and Ethan Hawke as her fish peddler husband Everett Lewis. In the abstract, Maud's life is hardly newsworthy, there is no oceanic
discrepancy before/after she accrues a certain renown (Richard Nixon is
interested to acquire one of her works), she and Everett have never
moved out of their pokey cottage. To all intents and purposes, Walsh
remarkably skates over the theatricality-ready liaison between Maud's
physical defect and her immeasurable talent, the disability is a
congenital condition for her to inure, a cross to bear but never her
defining feature, and it is up to Hawkins' diligent yet
histrionics-free incarnation to ram home to audience her distinct
physical form is part of the furniture of her identity, it never deters
her life-long pursuit. What undergoes a fine-tooth comb is Maud and Everett's complex
relationship, the jumping-off point of their co-habitation is out of
pragmatism other than anything remotely affecting, he wants a housemaid
and she wants to slough from the clutches of her officious aunt Ida
(Rose). For Maud, it is a precarious gamble because she throws herself
on the mercy of Everett, who grudgingly takes her in (initially
appalled by her unsightly appearance) and belittles her in the lowest
rung in his bare-bones household: him, dogs, chickens, then her. At one
point, Maud can only squeeze some wry but ironic laughter after being
referred as "a love slave" of Everett, she is a slave to him without
question, but there is no love involved. Maud's tremendous effort of thawing the illiterate Everett's unsavory
make-up (inarticulate, churlish, penny-pinching, machismoÂ… you name it)
offers a most therapeutic, wholesome and alternately
heart-warming/heart-wrenching narrative arc by virtue of writer Sherry
White's sensitive, sensible and no-hyperbole script; Walsh's
unobtrusively observant tack against a muted but fetchingly beauteous
scenery; soothing ear-worms (e.g. Lisa Hannigan's LITTLE BIRD) and
needless to say Hawke and Hawkins' stupendous performances. Hawke is unexpectedly against type to give an uncouth Everett a humane
transfiguration that mostly hinges on ineffable expressions, a look, a
mumble, a gesture, greatly pins down a reticent man's innate foibles
but also his rough diamond sheen. On the other hand, Hawkins,
formidably sinks her teeth into the character body and soul, a vivid
impersonation of an enabler, a fighter and most of all, a human whom we
can all vicariously project ourselves in on different levels, a true
testimonial of why humanity is still worthy of redemption and sympathy
in our cynical world. Maud's last word is "I am loved", and MAUDIE is a treasure trove where
love can germinate from a most barren place, a superlative folksy
delight and heartening character study, kudos to those talents who are
involved in the film's timely genesis.
