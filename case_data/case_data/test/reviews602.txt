Excellent action, keeps the pace!

I didn't know what to expect as i had not seen the trailer and I
decided to watch the film due to excellent actress Noomi Rapace. I was
surprised by the flow of action and the pace of the film. If you are
looking for a good action-adventure that will keep you on edge, this is
the film for you. It is one of the better films that have a smart take
on the counter-terrorism movie universe. Enjoy!
