Youth is in the eye of the beholder

Greetings again from the darkness. With a Best Foreign Language Oscar
for his previous film The Great Beauty (La grande bellezza),
expectations were sky high for this one from writer/director Paolo
Sorrentino. Cinematographer Luca Bigazzi is also back and the two
create yet another artistic entrée that is a visual extravaganza,
worthy of the admission price even if no dialogue existed. Combine the
visual artistry with a commentary on age and emotions, and the result
is a film that will either enchant or stultify  with probably no
middle ground.Michael Caine stars as Fred Ballinger, a renowned Orchestra conductor,
who is vacationing at a stunning Swiss Alps spa with his daughter Lena
(Rachel Weisz) and his long-time best friend, screenwriter Mick Boyd
(Harvey Keitel). Fred, a self-professed retiree, is being pursued by
Queen Elizabeth's representative to perform one last concert. Fred is
adamant in his refusal  for personal reasons we later learn are due to
his nostalgic belief that his wife (no longer able to sing) is the only
one who will sing his "simple" songs as long as he is alive. In the
meantime, Mick is working with a group of ambitious young writers in an
attempt to leave a legacy with his most important film ever. So you can
already see that both men are working through their golden years in
different ways.Lena is devastated when her husband dumps her for a young pop singer
(played by the real pop singer, Paloma Faith). Oh, one other detail 
Lena's husband is also Mick's son (Ed Stoppard). This makes for some
awkward (but entertaining) moments, and also leads to one of the film's
best scenes  Lena spilling her emotional guts to Fred while they are
both covered in a mud bath. Director Sorrentino is a master at twisting
these poignant moments with dashes of levity or irony. Another example
is when Miss Universe (Romanian model Madalina Diana Ghenea) puts a
condescending movie actor (Paul Dano) in his place with a devastating
shift in tone and a comeback for the ages.Sorrentino executes a couple of bizarre dream or fantasy sequences 
one with Fred conducting a cow pasture (replete with cows and other
bits of nature), and another with Mick being haunted in a meadow by all
the female stars from his films (each in costume of their character).
Suffice to say, this is not a conventional look at aging. What's also
clear is that Sorrentino believes our emotions drive our actions. The
most jarring example is the aftermath when Mick's long-time leading
lady Brenda Morel (played by Jane Fonda) declines to appear in his
latest film.Even the most bizarre segments are presented with a visual artistry
that forces our brains to process overtime. How about an obese Diego
Maradona (played by Roly Serrano) repeatedly kicking tennis balls into
the air? Or big time actor Jimmy Tree (Dano) struggling with his
decision to sellout by appearing in a popular robot movie instead of
pursuing his desire to be taken seriously as an actor? Or Lena bouncing
back with a socially awkward mountain man? Or the seemingly minor role
of a young masseuse (played by Luna Zimic Mijovic) who has us yearning
for more? In addition to how each of these segments is startling to
look at, Jane Fonda's role has so many nuances that an entire movie
could be made about her.As with The Great Beauty, the film will have the most profound impact
on those of us old enough to be looking through the binoculars and
noticing how far away the past looks  and wondering just how long
until "Life's Last Day".
