Nice Surprise

Bone Tomahawk is a 2015 western-horror written and directed by S. Craig
Zahler and starring Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and
Richard Jenkins.The story follows four men, the town's sheriff (Russell), a cowboy
(Wilson), the back-up deputy (Jenkins) and a gunslinger (Fox) who go on
an expedition to retrieve a group of captives from some cannibalistic
cave-dwellers. The four actors really shine in this movie, giving very
good performances, especially Matthew Fox as John Brooder. It's good to
see Fox in such a good role, considering he hasn't done that much since
the Lost years.The movie gives us a very good look at the Old West. As the four men
make their journey, we learn more and more about them and their
motivations. Sheriff Franklin Hunt is a man who wants nothing more than
the safety of his town and is willing to do anything to protect it.
Arthur O'Dwyer is a cowboy who has a serious leg injury but still goes
into this expedition, because for him the stakes are personal. Chicory
is a simple-minded old deputy but with amazing loyalty for the sheriff.
John Brooder is a well-dressed well- mannered gentleman who joins the
ride because he is a trigger-happy gunslinger with a personal vendetta
against the natives.The script is very well-written, giving us full tri-dimensional
characters. Also the dialogue and the mannerisms feel very authentic,
transporting you back to the Old West. As I said in the beginning, this
movie is a horror-western, and that really shows in the third act.
There are some brutal, gore-scenes that will not be easy to digest (no
pun intended) for those faint of heart. One slight negative about this
movie is the pacing. Sometimes it feels a little too slow, but not
enough so that it will ruin your enjoyment.Bone Tomahawk is a very good movie, with an interesting premise and a
nice twist on the western genre. It's a movie that could have gone
wrong in so many ways, but surprisingly, it doesn't. Sporting some
great characters and an intriguing storyline, Bone Tomahawk deserves an
8 out of 10!
