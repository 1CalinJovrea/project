Awesome NZ Comedy

The three lead vampires in this film were absolutely fantastic,
especially Jonathon Brugh (His solo dance routine was one of the most
awkwardly hilarious things I have ever seen!). I loved all three of the
main characters and their interactions with Stu. I was laughing the
whole way through this film which is continuously funny. I actually found some of the scenes to be quite frightening, especially
when the vampires are chasing one of their victims through their home!
This scene was one of my favourites. I don't think it needed to be a mockumentary though. Sometimes the
shots were purposefully too long which felt unnecessary and just slowed
the pace of the film. Some of the jolty, hand-held camera shots could
be a bit annoying too. Otherwise, I loved it and definitely recommend
it! I hope it claims top spot for its opening weekend in NZ.
