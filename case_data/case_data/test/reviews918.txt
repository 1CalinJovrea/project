Spoilers ...Great movie

If you read the book you will notice some huge differences, but I was
expecting that going in as Hollywood does it to every book adaptation
known to man. This movie won't win any Oscars, but it's a sweet
romantic movie that will brighten your day and make you feel there are
still some good guys left in this world. I thought the performances were great. As the Logan character in the
book didn't have much dialogue neither did he in the movie and I
thought Zac Efron did amazingly well conveying his emotions through
facial and body movements. I will say I think Taylor Schilling lacked
performance wise, but she did gain steam toward the end of the film. I gave this movie a 9/10 because I wanted sappy romance and I got it
with some extra steamy Zac Efron.
