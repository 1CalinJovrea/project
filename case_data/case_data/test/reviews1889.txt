Not an academy award movie, but I must say very entertaining

This is surprisingly a great low lighted action comedy that works in
many more ways than "Contraband". It's a fun popcorn flick, plus it's
fun to watch Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg on screen together.
Overall, a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night. Washington plays Bobby Trench, a cool customer plotting a small town
bank robbery with caffeinated Michael "Stig" Stigman (Wahlberg). What
neither knows is that the other is working undercover: Bobby for the
DEA and Stig for U.S. Navy Intelligence. They're both on the trail of
drug kingpin Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) and the bank reportedly
houses $3 million in drug money.What confuses Bobby, Stig and the audience for a while is why their
robbery nets more than $43 million. It turns out that the CIA is
somehow involved, with a sweaty, sadistic agent named Earl, played by
Bill Paxton, leading the pack. The Navy, represented by
so-helpful-he-can't-be- trusted Quince, played by James Marsden, also
wants the cash. Papi isn't happy, either. A lot of shoehorning and
short cuts are required to fit all this skullduggery into one movie but
it mostly works.It's best to forget the plot and simply enjoy this bumpy, bullet-ridden
ride. Washington and Wahlberg make such a wonderful team  a modern
Butch and Sundance in patter and aim  that you wonder why Hollywood
never thought of this pairing before. Each character has an identifying
quirk: for Bobby, a collection of straw fedoras; for Stig, a
punctuating wink. Mostly the actors are just having fun and it's
contagious.2 Guns is a movie based on smart callbacks and sly flip-flops of
loyalty, regularly interrupted by spasms of well-staged violence. The
perplexing nature of Masters' plot takes effort to sort through but
sets up a terrific finale, literally a Mexican standoff between
everyone wanting the money, with Bobby and Stig back-to-back in the
middle, spraying gunfire in all directions. It's a dynamic sequence
that, like the rest of 2 Guns, proves overkill can be amusing.
