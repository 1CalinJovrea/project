advertisement,  soulless, boring movie

I just watch this movie yesterday and.. I supposed it's funny movie,
and it was really! but not about the story! I laugh on how silly this
movie is and myself that I waste time watch it.. Firstly: this movie was ad for twitter, not just words passed.. they
even make animation of twitter symbol (blue bird was singing singing)
and the daddy ask his son how to use twitter to make him famous
chef(show that if anybody use it, can be successful).. Secondly: This movie miss for funny moments? my teeth never appear from
my mouth as I never smile nor laugh, I was putting my hand on face and
watch with half closed eyes.. Third: there is no real successful ending (where good guys win), so the
writer think its good idea to make the bad who criticize the chef in
the start, back to him and supported him financially to open big
restaurant JUST after he heard about his food truck!!! Fourth: very poor writing story, everything was bad in this movie
except that little boy, he was good actor, and the cameraman show nice
different views of states..
