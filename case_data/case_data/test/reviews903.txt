Best Film Of The Year

Just finished watching Spike Jonze's new movie 'Her', a beautiful,
tender, melancholy film about love and loss and technology. It's that
kind of science fiction so close to science fact you can almost look
out your window and see it, so in that it's of a piece with Jonze's
first movie 'Being John Malkovich', though the cautious, bruised and
drifting heart of it reminds me most of (his ex-wife) Sofia Coppola's
'Lost In Translation'.It's funny: just last month I was saying how 2013 was not such a good
year for movies and then 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' came along, and now
this, which I think is probably the best of the year.This is an amazing, unique, magical film that I would recommend to
everyone, with the caveat that it almost certainly will make you go
'ouch', at least if you're paying attention. But I'm pretty sure that
you won't have seen anything quite like it before.
