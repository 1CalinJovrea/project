Spoiler Alert - it is horrifically bad

I don't get people giving this movie 5 stars but admitting it wasn't
funny or good. Sure the actors in it are good but we already know they
are good. You wouldn't give Rachel Weisz 5 stars for a commercial for
tampons no matter how much it seemed like she was on her period. This
movie deserves less than a single star - no disrespect for the actors -
OK maybe a little disrespect because while I know it is expensive to
heat a pool couldn't you make just as much money doing a commercial in
Japan for Super Fantastic Fun Time Energy Drink (you'll say two words
in Japanese, smile and give a thumbs up)? Each and every one of you
need a better agent as your craft is your band and you diminished it by
accepting these roles.
