Another title of piercing accuracy

Let's get the insane plot of Seven Psychopaths out of the way: Marty
(Collin Farrell) is a struggling Irish screenwriter, who hopes to
finish his screenplay for a film called "Seven Psychopaths," while
battling a case of writer's block and author-indecisiveness. His best
friend is Billy (Sam Rockwell), a boisterous dog-thief, who usually
winds up dictating Marty's life rather than helping him along in tough
times. Hans (Christopher Walken) is Billy's best friend and partner in
crime when it comes to dog-snatching. After both Hans and Billy steal
an unpredictable crime boss's (Woody Harrelson) shih-ztu, it becomes a
violent, relentless cat-and-mouse chase to get the pup back, and in the
meantime, we get lengthy monologues between characters about the
production of "Seven Psychopaths" and how Marty's inspiration begins to
bubble when he starts considering the barrage of real psychopaths in
his own life.There are several films that exist about the movie-making process and
it is a very difficult genre to make effectively. Seven Psychopaths
succeeds in balancing the art of characters and the art of plot
coherency, and it doesn't cross the line of becoming too involved in
the process and too concerned with "in" jokes that leave the audience
lost. To put it simply; the actors look like they're having fun, but
they make sure we are still amused and connected with the film.Right off the bat, the first thing one can commend about this entire
experience are the rich performances by actors of all different career
heights. Collin Farrell plays a wonderful straight-laced man victim to
idiocy and unhelpful circumstances, and is only made better by Sam
Rockwell's character's shameless belligerence. Woody Harrelson, giving
us one of his many diverse roles in recent years, has the rare ability
of rustling up a fierce moment of seriousness and delivering a
devilishly funny laugh in the same breath. And who could forget
supporting-role king Christopher Walken, who continuously borders the
line of self-parody here in a memorably sophisticated role? At times,
Seven Psychopaths is a witty riot and at other times, it can be
monotonous and lengthy. For starters, the film looks and feels like a
Quentin Tarantino film blended with the likes of Guy Ritchie. Shots
have a very slim sense of narrative cohesion and many, many times are
we left bewildered at what we just watched. It's also apparent that the
film has a meta, self-aware tone that can be pleasantly charming, and
sometimes cloying and overly-cheeky. To simply my feelings; after many
sequences was I trying to comprehend what was just given to me and how
was I supposed to digest the experience all together.I mentioned my feelings that the film seemed to drag and felt a little
too long - specifically the final scene in the desert which is roughly
twenty-five to thirty minutes. Perhaps if your interest is in cheeky
comedies and self-aware humor, you won't mind at all. The film is
certainly smarter and a lot brighter than some of the flyweight,
narrow-minded comic exercises that have bestowed on the mainstream
public in recent years. For once, it's refreshing to see a comedy pay
close attention to its characters, its events, and its performance,
never shortchanging anyone in the process.NOTE: There's also something very, very different about the
cinematography of this picture, different from any kind of visual
atmosphere I have seen this year. The southern California area seems to
be captured through a grungy, saturated lens with colors appearing
bright, humid, and very warm. This easily makes Seven Psychopaths one
of the most visually calm pictures of the year.Starring: Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher
Walken, Tom Waits, Abbie Cornish, and Olga Kurylenko. Directed by:
Martin McDonagh.
