Too much of too little.

From the trailers you know it's not such a safe house. Denzel
Washington doesn't break a sweat. Ryan Reynolds never stops sweating.
Vera Farminga is unconvincing as a high level CIA agent spouting
exposition.Plenty of redundant shoot outs, car chases and fights. Generic bad guys
kill plenty of we didn't know them good guys. Up close, and in the
actors face, digital photography is far too grainy. Trendy CIA bashing. Quick pace. Plenty of action but not much new or
interesting in this except perhaps the South Africa locations. Wait for
the DVD.
