Survival drama takes Blue Square route

A former pro-hockey player must fend for himself after becoming
stranded on a mountainJosh Hartnett may be the George Raft of this generation, known by the
roles turned down. More than ten years since he passed up opportunities
to play Spiderman, Batman, and Superman, Hartnett is Eric LeMarque.A former pro hockey player, LeMarque has struggled with retirement and
is facing a drugs charge when he goes up the mountain with his
snowboard. A reckless decision to take an unsupervised course during a
storm leaves LeMarque stranded and exposed to the elements.A lasting problem of 6 Below is how rote the plot is; there is not a
single moment in the film that comes as a real surprise. The film's
subtitle Miracle on the Mountain belies the fact that this is not to be
a tragedy, and that we the audience are going through the motions of
Josh Hartnett feeling cold for ninety minutes.Director Scott Waugh makes heavy use of GoPros and drones for filming
snowboarding shots, yet however he captures the shots there is rarely
an inventiveness on screen. The persistent whiteness of the mountain
over-saturates the eyes, and the constant choral drowns the ears.This is a shame as Waugh uses his experience with stuntwork and
directing Need For Speed to assemble a number of the set pieces with
aplomb. Most notably this includes helicopter search and rescue
sequences in which Sarah (Sarah Dumont) at base camp comes
tantalisingly close to finding LeMarque.There are a few points of immersion in the story, notably a moment that
ignited my own greatest fears when LeMarque falls through ice. Yet as a
character LeMarque doesn't confront his situation with any particular
imagination. He's never forced into the horrifying self-sacrifice of
Aron Ralston (James Franco) in 127 Hours, and nor does the film have
the terrifying resourcefulness and consuming morbidity of Touching the
Void. LeMarque suffers because he has to, in a manner often no more
engaging than a rat on a sinking ship.If the bulk of the mountainside action is taking a blue square route,
this is an improvement on the flashbacks dotted throughout the film. As
with the mountainside, its all filmed flatly, both visually and
thematically.The domineering father and long-suffering mother are familiar tropes,
and how this relationship might evolve as LeMarque grows up isn't
explored. In the drive to tell an all- American tale of redemption 6
Below also leaves out interesting tidbits, such as the real life
LeMarque using his dual citizenship to represent France in the '94
Olympics. A point of connection as LeMarque wastes away on the mountain should be
mother Susan (Mira Sorvino) who clearly loves him very much, but she
has come across as so soppy and one-dimensional it's hard to avoid a
vague irritation with her. I was more interested by Sarah and the
mountain operation, and would hope to see Dumont in expanded roles in
the future.If you're a lover of inspirational memes or fancy the idea of Josh
Hartnett nibbling bits of himself, this film is for you. Otherwise 6
Below will provide you with very little sustenance.christophermarchant.wordpress.com @BrianInvincible
