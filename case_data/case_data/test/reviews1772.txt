Excellent Lovecraftian Flick

I watched this movie without any expectations and was more than
satisfied with it.The story centers on a man traveling abroad after the death of his
mother. By chance he happens to find himself in a very rural seaport
town in Italy. A an exotic woman catches his eye and a romance begins.
The rest of the tale centers on the young mans romance with the exotic
woman, who isn't everything she appears to be and has a horrible
secret.This movie is a slow paced film with just enough gore and pacing to
hold my interest. I was very satisfied with the tension and build-up at
the closing moment of the film.I highly recommend this to those who like well developed tension
building lovecraftian horror. I'd be interested in watching further
productions from this group of film-makers.
