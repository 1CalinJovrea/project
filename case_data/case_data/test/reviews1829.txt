A fun and self-aware thriller; retro without being old fashioned

I've never watched Downton Abbey, but I'm guessing that Dan Stevens
deliberately sought out very different roles after leaving the show.
The Guest is the perfect advert for his abilities. He's convincing as
the mysterious but charming visitor and equally capable in moments of
action, suspense or humour. I hope the right roles come along for him
as he's entertaining to watch and has got everything required to become
a major star.The plot unfolds in a fashion that renders a summary both unnecessary
and unwanted if you're planning to see this, but after the initial
set-up it progresses at a decent pace and with escalating tension.A special mention is required for the soundtrack. The electronic score
is one of the film's major strengths and is perfectly judged.An entertaining and self-aware mix of action, suspense and dark humour,
the Guest has a retro feel without being old fashioned (a quality that
is encapsulated by the score), and features decent performances.
