No wonder Will Smith didn't return; he must've read the script. IF
there ever was one.I cannot recall a film I have seen in five years that I didn't think to
myself: "I HATE THIS MOVIE" over and over throughout. And that started
approximately five minutes in and all the way to the end.Independence Day: Resurgence was one of the most horribly spliced
together movies I think I've ever seen. Scenes just began and abruptly
end and then back and forth to the point you have no clue where anyone
was or cared who lived or diedincluding all the countless self-
sacrifices. And apparently, I'm not alone as probably one billion
people die in this film and yet, barely anyone blinks an eye and even
continue on with their lazy jokes that never work.The movie takes place in today's time, 20 years after the 1996 attack
and believe me, if you didn't know the original took place in 1996,
they'll remind you 12 times. The acquired alien technology changed the
face of the Earth, but made everyone even dumber than before. Sure enough, the aliens return and supposedly, humans are ready, but
not really and things kind of, sort of fall into place to try and
combat the returning aliens. (I wrote that sentence all over the place
and if you're unfortunate enough to see this, you'll understand why.)Gone was the heart of the original. Vanished were characters with
depth. And worst of all, a coherent story was lost someplace  if it
ever existed. The only two things that remained were some of the
original's characters who didn't even seem to want to be there and the
speeches in the most inopportune times with zero meaning or punch.I did laugh out loud at more than a few scenes due to their absurd
attempts to make us care and at other times, I flipped off the screen
on how continuously angry I got. The movie was so ridiculous at times,
I kept expecting Adam Sandler to show up with some of his just as lame
jokes and fall-down pranks. But even he and his sordid career are,
laughably, above this mess.Not only should this movie be avoided, but it should be pulled from
theatres immediately or, at least, come with a warning: If you loved
the first one. Go home and watch that. Forget this ever existed.***Final thoughts: "We had twenty years to prepare. So did they" is the
movie poster's tagline. I disagree. The real tagline should've been:
"We had twenty minutes to both write a script and edit the film. We
apologize."
