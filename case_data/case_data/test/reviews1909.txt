Don't Expect Much.

I like a good all star cast, but in this case,the jokes that are giving
here feel very forced, and like they are trying to hard. There are some
descent performances by Anna Kendrick, and Dennis Quaid is also
memorable in his role, but everybody else are all so overly written, to
the point that they are not has memorable.Several couples are expecting a baby, it shows how they are dealing
with it in there own way. The Dudes Group serve little purpose to the
film, the poster and the trailer make you feel like there a big part of
the film, but not really, that is what annoyed me the most. It's not a
bad movie, not great either.And Brooklyn Decker is a little memorable has Quaids wife.
