Messy Plot and Underutilized Great Actors

'INSURGENT' picks up shortly after the events in 'Divergent' with
obvious intentions to maintain, if not, speed up the momentum of the
franchise. There's no doubt how fascinating the 'Divergent' universe
is, and while it shares almost the same elements that made many of the
YA franchises today, successful, the movie has its own unique facets to
separate itself apart. Unfortunately in Insurgent, those elements
aren't effectively explored and utilized.Once again, movie makers fall prey to this mentality or should I say
practice, that seems to highlight the film's visual panache, but
dismisses the utmost importance of effective storytelling. I think I've
gone redundant here, but to be honest, Insurgent is no different, and
if you'd allow me to make this honesty, even brutal, this Divergent
sequel tracks a deteriorating trajectory, and you can imagine how the
franchise is set to get even worse, knowing the last book of the
trilogy is going to be split into two movies. This doesn't surprise me
at all, given the fact how film makers has been consistently regarding
these popular franchises as merely cash cows.In Insurgent, the plot thickens, and not just that, it branches out to
several sub ones. That's when the film begins losing its grip around
the central story, giving way to subplots that don't make sense at all,
if not barely. As she searches for allies, crossing one faction's
territony to another's, our titular heroine, Tris, finds herself in a
cat-and-mouse chase with the enemy, in this case, Jeanine (Kate
Winslet)a name that Veronically Roth seems to suggest to be perfect
for a character she molds as a super-villainess that embodies terror
(am I being sarcastic? of course I....am. Lol..)and her loyal erudite
followers. Tris maintains reluctance, but when Jeanine turns toward her
loved ones, our heroine succumbs and surrenders herself to the enemy.
(this is so new).INSURGENT draws in more actors on its payroll to play new characters,
but barely utilizes them up to their full capacity. In the end, it's
Shailene Woodley that mostly does her job as the central character. On
the film's key moments, she undoubtedly shines, only her efforts aren't
enough to place the movie's charm to the same level as hers. No thanks
to the chemistry the film seems to suggest Four and Tris have, because
I don't think I felt itit was missing. The action sequences are well
played, I must say, and the visual effects borders extravagance, but
against a weak and unfocused narrative, INSURGENT is a film you better
just wait to come out on DVD, instead, and not one to waste time and
money on. (not unless you're planning to critique it the same I do)
