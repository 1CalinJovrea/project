The worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.

In the sequel to the movie where KaTris shaved her head, Allegiant
opens up what seems to be literally a day or two later... Except she
has a full head of hair somehow.ALLEGIANT!!!!My experience with this series is not the greatest. The first movie -
Detergent - was awful. The next movie - Insufferable - was awful again.
The third movie..? Allegiant was absolutely disgraceful.The first half of this movie was just about okay. I would rate it 6/10.
Then the second half plays and my brain starts getting blended. I
cannot even begin to explain the IDIOCY from these stupid characters!
Tris is an annoying little *****! If you like strong female leads, this
movie is NOT the movie you will want to see.If you like movies with real emotion, this is NOT the movie you will
want to see. Here you will see characters IDIOTICALLY expose themselves
to their enemies, get shot, die, their friends barely shed a tear and
then forget them for the rest of the movie.If you like natural movies without stupid Sci-Fi ****, this is NOT the
movie you will want to see. Here you will have girls in glass tubes,
then somehow the glass shrinks and turns into a gooey liquid and
suffocate these girls like they are in condoms. (?????) I'm not even
lying. That **** is in this movie. I could not stop laughing.This movie is atrocious. Watch The Hunger Games instead; a series that breaks the YA stigma and
is well directed! You're not even going to like this film if you're drunk. Only one or
two moments here can truly entertain an alcoholic. It's *that* bad.I recommend watching this movie if you are held at gunpoint and your
kidnapper forces you too.1/10.
