Superb Psychological Drama/Character Study/Political Thriller

Ignore all the political diatribes from the haters. This a superb
psychological drama/character study about a woman who, like the Gene
Hackman character in The Conversation, begins to realize just how
immoral her job is. This is not a propaganda piece, but given how
polarized and divided the country is right now, there are now some who
would see a political agenda in Jaws. Chastain gives a brilliant
performance as the overachiever who is great at what she does, but
seems to lack any moral compass. Yes, the film takes a dim view of
lobbyists, but people across the political spectrum have complained
about the over-influence of lobbyists in politics. A limited release
doomed this film at the Oscars, but it's Best Picture quality and
definitely worth your time.
