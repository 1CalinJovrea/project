Going to be the most hated and yet underrated film to come out this year - Korine at his finest

Mr. Korine is a strangely unique director that uses this film to bore
you into understanding how a generation growing up with MTV and girls
gone wild has deeply mutilated the pursuit of happiness with nihilistic
extremity Â— however his satirical exploration leaves you uncertain
whether to laugh, cry out in horror, or stare in disbelief at its
overwhelmingly artistic beauty.I watched this opening night and was shocked at how good of a movie it
had turned out to be. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I walked
in so it turned out to be a nice little treat, but to my disbelief when
I got home I began reading up on it and all I could see were tweets and
posts about it being the "worst movie ever made" and "absolutely
disgusting soft core porn". I couldn't believe that these people
watched the same film I did.As far as performances go there isn't much here other than Franco. The
four girls do a decent job, the most notable being Selena Gomez
although her character wasn't in it for a lot of the highly regarded
scenes. James Franco is the star of this film. His performance is dark,
uncomfortable and most of all hilarious. He hits it out of the park in
the movie managing to make people unsure whether to be uncomfortable or
laugh. His character is narcissistic and insane, yet you like him. He
brings so much humanity to a place it shouldn't be.Aesthetically, this movie is absolutely brilliant. The cinematography
is fantastic. No matter how you feel when you leave this movie there is
no denying how well shot it is. The lighting is beautiful and adds this
feeling of darkness you might normally find in a well made horror film.
Normally I wouldn't appreciate that very much but it was so properly
executed with the great editing and slo-mo sequences. No surprise from
the sound department either; the sound design and music brought to us
by the brilliant Clint Martinez (Drive) makes what seems like a
never-ending soundtrack that compliments the visuals masterfully.Under all that the movie still manages to hit its theme, just in a way
that a lot of people will miss and I believe this is the key to
enjoying the film. It's meant to be boring. The use of repetition is so
excessive it leaves a mark. No matter how much fun these girls are
having it feels very dull and boring. This is the point! If you think
for a second what you're seeing on screen is supposed to make you feel
excited than go watch Project X. You're not intended to feel how the
girls feel because they don't understand. Throughout the film you
should feel uncomfortable, disgusted and at times sad. This film (to
the right audience) should be as much a horror film as it is a dark
comedy.Spring Breakers is a unique experience featuring lots of depth and
style. This film will most likely be the most hated and underrated film
to come out this year. I apologize on behalf of the general public Mr.
Korine.(8/10)On a side note:The film has been said to support rape culture. I know it can be hard
to understand for some people but sometimes film - like a person - uses
sarcasm. This is the case. The film shows lots of naked females having
fun, very much trying to replicate spring break culture in Florida
however the film isn't a mockery of spring break, it's about the
marginalized kids who have been brought up on Disney princesses and
MTV. The kids who grew up with role models like Paris Hilton and
Lindsay Lohan. The film isn't meant to focus on girls losing their
innocence but instead girls searching for something and realizing it
isn't what they thought it was. Spring Breakers is going to cause a lot of disagreement regardless.
After reading this you will love or hate it all the same; what I won't
stand for is people being unwilling to look past the surface and see
this film for what it really is. Be sure to check out my review site: thejoshlreviews.com
