I thought it would be good, I thought it would be good, it was not good

I was hyped up to see this as was my wife who is a sci-fi lover. We
both were very disappointed. The story went no where, and was slow
getting there. The picture was well made in technical terms, the
effects were great and Ed Harris stole the show at the end. The only
other character that held my interest was Tilda Swinton who was
terrific but underused. The movie didn't seem to know what it wanted to
be. The action was so unbelievable, at times it tried to be realistic
and then tried to be a comic book. Plots holes are so numerous all the
way through. The train itself became a parody and was so predictable as
was the ending. Do not be fooled by the high rankings, this film was
just a mess.
