Why the hate? A pretty good movie, definitely recommend it!!

Don't read any of the reviews, I don't understand why the hate. It was
a pretty decent movie, had some plot holes but very much watchable and
you'll definitely like it if u watch with an open mind. A father
looking for her kidnapped daughter is not something new but its not a
typical movie where the father just goes berserk and kills off all the
bad people. The father just acts like a normal average person would. It
is not as good as prisoners was but definitely doesn't deserve to be
rated so low. The story moves back and forth which i find is pretty
cool, but some people might not like it as it can be a little confusing
at times.The acting is superb and the movie is a little slow to start off but
overall, i would definitely recommend this movie!! Watch for yourself
and decide!
