Carried by a Breakout Lead Performance, Happy Death Day Utilizes a Familiar Premise to Deliver Lots of Fun

Every negative review for this movie is going to point out that this
movie is built around a concept that we've seen before. Our protagonist
is forced to live through the same day again and again. Groundhog Day
and Edge of Tomorrow (both excellent movies) made this idea popular and
for some people, they won't be able to get past the fact that this
isn't brand new gimmick. I don't have a problem if movies borrow from
other movies, they just need to do it effectively and put a fresh spin
on it. Happy Death Day certainly accomplishes that. At the beginning,
the journey hits the first couple of familiar notes but when Tree
starts to realize what's happening, that's when the movie shifts gears.
They aren't afraid to play with Tree's tragic end day after day and the
movie functions for whole periods as a straight comedy. Luckily, this
movie is really funny when it wants to be. The writers know enough to
play with certain genre clich√©s and there's a surprising amount of
tongue-in-cheek humour here. The marketing for this is a little
misleading, it makes this movie look like a traditional slasher movie
when it really ends up being a mishmash of comedy, mystery and horrorOther than the living the same day plot point, Happy Death Day centres
around the mystery of who Tree's killer is. The movie throws a bunch of
obvious red herrings at you right off the bat and I was glad they took
it a less obvious direction. I don't think they overplay their hand
either, there are a couple of hints here and there but I think you'd
have to be pretty perceptive to guess the twists and turns that Day's
plot takes. If I had one complaint, there was a point where they looked
like they were heading towards a very sentimental resolution that could
have been corny. Its a case of me wanting that for these characters.
They bypass that though and keep going and while I understand the
decision, I might have preferred that wrap-up instead.Another turnoff for certain audience members might be Tree's
personality as a character. She's a real b!#@% when we first meet her
and I'm not exaggerating. The first time she meets her killer, I wasn't
feeling sorry for her. But even when she's at her worst, she still has
a certain charisma that you want to keep rooting for her. Writing
characters that aren't perfect and are selfish that you want to follow
is an art that so many horror movies get wrong. I liked how Tree grows
(no pun intended) and by the end I really wanted her to find a happy
ending somehow.I don't often get to really discover actors and actresses. Most of the
movies I watch are pretty mainstream and by the time someone becomes a
lead, you've probably heard about them from somewhere. I wasn't
familiar with Jessica Rothe at all but she anchored this movie as Tree.
This is a stand up and take notice kind of performance, she's
multi-faceted in handling both the drama and the comedy in this movie.
I hope this movie is just a stepping stone to bigger things for her and
I think the last time I walked away from a movie so impressed with an
actress I didn't know was Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street.
Israel Broussard is easy to like as Carter, he's easy going enough that
his character's relationship with Tree builds up organically. Rachel
Matthews is funny as Danielle Bouseman, she's playing a very
stereotypical character (stuck up sorority rich girl) but she nails it.
Ruby Modine is sweet as Lori and Charles Aitken is appropriately slimy
as Gregory Butler,I couldn't believe how charmed I was by this movie. I didn't plan on
going to see this, it was a very spur of the moment thing and walking
out of the theatre I was blown away. Happy Death Day isn't the best
movie I've seen this year but its the biggest movie-going surprise of
the year for me. It features a great turn from an up and coming
actress, a good mystery, some well placed meta humour and a willingness
to play within its central conceit. The marketing for this movie
doesn't show how creative and fun it is and I would urge you to give
this a shot. We've come off the summer blockbusters and we're still too
early for the awards contenders so if you're looking for something to
check out, Happy Death Day is an extremely fun hour and a half at the
movies. Also, make sure to show up on time, there's a gag pulled with
the opening credits that hints at what's to come.
