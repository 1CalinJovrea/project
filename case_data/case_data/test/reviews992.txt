Great looking and funny cast.  Plot is secondary but that's not the point anyway....

Mitch and his crew protect a crime ridden beach, encountering murder,
drug dealing, blackmail and romance. Brody is perfectly cast and played
by Zac Efron, as washed up "vomit comet" Olympic swimmer (Ryan Lochte
esque) who blows his career by vomiting in the pool during the Olympic
relay. Now he finds himself down on his luck, offered a job on a
reluctant Mitch's lifeguard crew. Mitch challenges young Brody with
inventive belittling nicknames and endurance course antics. It is an
amazing thing to see the fitness challenge between the equally
impressive Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Somehow, I really believe they
could carry two refrigerators on their shoulders. Ronnie is a new
character actor, and is incredibly funny as the "IT" lifeguard recruit
and love interest of "slow mo" hot girl with daddy issues CJ. Priyanka
Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is
buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear
to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie.
The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous
laughing throughout. I love this kind of humour, no it's not high brow
and the plot has holes but it's so much fun to watch. Recommend!
