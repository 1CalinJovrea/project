Nice adaption from the book, but...

One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was
the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe
even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie,
my expectations were very high.On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent
visuals and well directed.On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the
characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The
movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the
story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a
bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get
really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in
my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice
adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the
book.
