A seriously fun and unexpected ride!!

I was fortunate enough to catch this at a local screening in Los
Angeles recently and I have to admit that this film took me completely
by surprise! I knew some details before going into see this film: Low Budget, quick
shooting schedule, etc. so I was preparing myself for a bit of a tough
ride. I was sooooo happy to see that this was not the case AT ALL!
Smart dialogue, fluid and intimate use of the camera, great characters
and a storyline... it all comes together to really surprise you! Being a bit of a science nut, I also loved the fact that this storyline
was ahead of the curve on a newly introduced theory making the rounds
in Physics. I won't say anymore for fear of spoiling the ride, but
trust me... this is a very well done film! If you still hold onto your sense of imagination... if you still
believe that anything is possible... if you still love going to movies
for a sense a magic and love a good story... this film will not
disappoint!
