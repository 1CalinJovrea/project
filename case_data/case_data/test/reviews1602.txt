Compelling and Enthralling from start to finish.

Truly excellent film and definitely Ocsar worthy material for both the
film and the actors. The entire cast are amazing.As Cumberbatch says near the start of the film "are you paying
attention". You should pay attention, Alan Turing deserves your
attention, his story deserves to be told.I went to see this at the London Film Festival last week and I am going
to be one of the first ones in the cue to see it when it comes out next
month. It is an excellently paced and executed script that has you
gripped from beginning to end. The whole audience were laughing and
applauding and crying in places, including the man next to me who had
to borrow a hankie from his wife.The film switches between the drive of the team of code breakers to
solve the Enigma code, young Alan Turing and the events after the war
that destroyed his life. It is truly heartbreaking in places, and Benedict Cumberbatch's
performance as Alan Turing is outstanding. He really deserves an Oscar
nomination for his performance.It has been a very, VERY long time since I enjoyed a film so much, that
when I came out of the Cinema I wanted to turn right round and go back
in and watch it again. A lovely script that had you switching back and
forwards between tears and laughter.I know some wanted a more in depth and in detail look at Alan Turing's
life and have commented frequently that this does no focus enough on
his sexuality or the events after the war.In this case I think less is more, this film highlights the man and the
mind. It shows us the genius that was destroyed by a society that was
seriously homophobic. It brings to life the man behind the facts and we
laugh at his interactions with his fellow code breakers and cheer as he
proves his theories and our hearts break as we watch him try to cope
after his court case.One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Go and see judge for
yourself.
