pure script-less crap

Folks, if you can't think of anything else but destroying a teddy bear
as a result of a script-less 2h nonsense in which 2 idiots argue
nonstop for unknown reasons, just quit making movies and go back
working for McDonalds. The worst crock of manure I have ever seen in my
whole life. Material for a 2 min short with a funny teddy. Oh crap, we
don't have a long enough story for a film, let's say Mark and Mila keep
fighting over nothing for 1 h. That covers up pretty much 80% of the
time. Still not long enough? OK, the cute teddy bear dies, a sick
maniac rips him in two =) how about that? Just perfect for children.
Almost there with time? OK, teddy bear is revived =) What a great idea
wow. The ultimate concept. I would like to catch the idiotic teen who
wrote this moronic story and torture him for a couple of hours, just as
he did to me. Stay away from this junk folks and overall don't let your
kids watch it, it's stinky puke put together without ideas, no script,
no nothing. Only a pinch of sadistic stupidity. Hate is everything that
this smelly swill can produce.
