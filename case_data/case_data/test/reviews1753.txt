One Of The Funniest And Most Violent Action Films In Years

I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action
films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up
with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I
can't stand that watered-down "no-blood-no-swearing" gutless kiddie
fare that is being served as "action" these days. I know the real thing
when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I
hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being
shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two
of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and
'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read
some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally
bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film
is nothing short of bat-sh√Æt crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James
Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that
never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated
Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that
interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much
that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film
(with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown
in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to
'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for
marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously
ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check.
Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar
winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark
Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some
instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral
intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards
and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John
Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only
antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for
action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the
balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated
movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to
teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:www.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html
