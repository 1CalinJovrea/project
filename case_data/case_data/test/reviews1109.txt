Excellent thriller & mystery

Movie with what most appreciate, a good story. At times you have the
impression that something creepy gonna happen,but it is thanks to the
excellent mixing common sounds. Scenery and light fit perfectly with
the whole story and evoke the atmosphere of mystery.Much of the action is in the morgue of who's missing body of a woman.We
found out who is the killer very early, as well as his motives. He is
not responsible for the disappearance and then we wonder why would
anyone else took the body and is the woman actually alive. You might be
bored at start, but this is the movie where is every detail important.
Explanations for some procedures and rounding of the story we get
through the small '' flashbacks ''. Absolutely we can not assume who
could be the missing piece of the puzzle until the last scene. Also, I
noticed a good characterization of the spouse. Mayka is a powerful and
smart, selfish and dominant ... In addition to her √Ålex don't have much
space to achieve except perhaps professionally but that is also
controlled by Mayka. With such an attitude is not hard to imagine that
something will break. The detective have his personal story.From my
corner what will astound you is how far one man is willing to go for
revenge and '' Rough justice ''.
