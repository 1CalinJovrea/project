Good splatter body horror

I rated this movie only six out of ten due to the too linear and
predictable plot, but it would deserve more than that. Everything
starts when the main character finds a clown costume and wears it for
his son's birthday party. The troubles begin when he tries to take it
off. The wig has become his own hair and the cloth seems glued onto his
skin. After a while he discovers that that's not a costume but the hair
and the skin of an ancient child-eater demon which has already started
to permeate his body and his soul. *SPOILER* He obviously starts
killing and eating several kids before he gets stopped by his own wife
while she tries to save their child who was about to be eaten by his
father-demon-clown. *END SPOILER* The good thing about this movie is
that it manages to create an anxious atmosphere and it makes you feel
afraid to get your body hurt. You'll start thinking about being in
something that gets stuck on you, changes and disfigures your body and
your mind. There's also a lot of good old splatter scenes where you'll
see half-eaten kids and regurgitated human bones. A particular note
goes to the kids' playground scene, where the director manages to
convert a funny and colorful place in a horrid and spectral hunting
field.
