Heartbreaking Portrayal of Love and Loss During War

I first read "Testament of Youth" during university and was captivated
by the emotionally moving real-life story of love and loss during war.
The memoir spurred me on to read more about Vera Brittain, particularly
during the World War I period that is the setting of "Testament of
Youth." Having read her diary "Chronicle of Youth" and "Letters from a
Lost Generation" long before watching this film, I had formed a strong
attachment to Vera Brittain almost as if she was a personal friend.
Reading her words, it is very easy for anyone, particularly a young,
studious person to relate to her and the blossoming romance she
describes between herself and her first love, Roland Leighton. As such, I had extremely high expectations for this film, and was
skeptical that Alicia Vikander and Kit Harington would be "my" Vera and
Roland--I had such a fixed idea of them in my head. Fortunately Alicia
and Kit's performances met my expectations. They had wonderful
chemistry and the relationship as portrayed captured the essence of
Vera and Roland: the intelligent, witty banter, sweet/innocent
flirtatiousness, passion and angst. This relationship is at the heart
of the memoir and is the driving force for much of what occurs during
and after its commencement, so it was very important for this
relationship to be portrayed accurately and to be emotionally moving
for the audience, which it certainly was for me. Supporting characters played by Taron Egerton (Edward) and Colin Morgan
(Victor) were also wonderfully portrayed, which was a relief as the
relationships with her brother and friend are extremely important in
the memoir as well, and just as emotionally moving as the romance
between Vera and Roland. As far as the other aspects of the film are
concerned, the stirring scenes at the hospital where Vera volunteers as
a nurse are gripping and faithfully portray the tumultuous wartime
experiences that Vera describes in her memoir.The highlight for me was the poetry of Roland which is interwoven
during key moments in the film. This is a lovely element to the story
that I found very touching and it provides a beautiful, emotional
backdrop for key scenes. I really hope this film spurs those who haven't read the memoir/have
never heard of Vera Brittain to go on and read "Testament of Youth."
The book certainly lingered in my mind for quite some time after I had
first read it, and the film likewise recaptured those feelings for me.
