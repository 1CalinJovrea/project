Pretentious, depressing and boooooooooooring

I love cinema and I love movies. But, boy! that one was hard to take. I don't usually write negative reviews, because I like to spend my time
and my words on the movies that I love and not on the movies that I
hated. But since this movie has such a high score on IMDb (more than
8!) and some people are calling that crap "a masterpiece" I felt forced
to write something about it. Science-fiction movies are not my favorite, but if they are amazing, I
can really love them. I loved Blade Runner, Alien, Matrix, and
Interstellar, to name a few. Those movies are masterpieces!Arrival is pretentious, depressing and super boring, and, as somebody
said over here, it has more holes than a Swiss cheese. The script has
many flaws, and nobody seems to notice that. We are not stupid, you
know? The "aliens" (those ridiculous giant squids with elephant skin)
say that they need the humans every 3,000 years. Why? Nobody bothers to
explain that. Then, a professor who speaks many languages is supposed
to translate the "language" of these aliens that sounds, as somebody
also said over here, something like "jfhjkdfgkdkjhakjagfjgfhj". So
ridiculous!All the characters -with the exception of the one of Louise- are
completely empty. And we only feel for her because in the beginning her
daughter dies, but she becomes quite annoying with her suffering face
and her mascara on her eyelashes (who would bother to paint her
eyelashes on a moment like that?). Who are the other characters? a
bunch of "nobodies", and we really don't feel for them. In a moment I
thought: if the aliens kill all these people, who is going to care? The
future-husband: is he a physicist? his role is completely superfluous.
Then: the "bad guys" are, of course, China, Russia and other
anti-American countries, who decide to cut off the communication and
attack the aliens. Boooooooh!Some people say that this movies is deep and "intellectual". Well, if
you want deep and intellectual, go read some philosophy books, and
don't waste your time on a stupid pseudo-
intellectual-pseudo-moral-and-pseudo-science-fiction movie. Arrival is so boring that I got really distracted by Amy's ugly and
pointy nose. I almost fell asleep and I never ever fall asleep in
movies. So, at the end, what did these aliens do? They almost caused the
Earth's destruction and "blessed" Louise by making her learn their
language, which makes her see the future -like a curse-, and know the
horrible death of her daughter as a teenager. Such a treat! I would give "Arrival" a zero, but since the music was good I give it a
1. If this movie wins any award at the Golden Globes or at the Oscars,
we can say that Americans finally lost their sense of good cinema and
art. Greetings from Madrid!
