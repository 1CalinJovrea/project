It's a disaster movie, a great one

Come on people first it's a disaster movie so get over yourselves. Who
wouldn't want to be rescued by Dwayne Johnson. AS an actor he is very
versatile and this movie is no exception. His performance is flawless.
Paul Giamatti's performance, small as it is, as the Cal Tech
Seismologist is spot on as well.There were the typical cheesy scenes you have in disaster films but not
over the top where you roll your eyes and can't believe they made the
actors say that. and the special effects were believable. The idiots
who stand at the beach even though the tsunami warning is blaring, the
old couple hugging in the impending doom. Cheesy yes, but if they were
left out you would be asking 'where are all the cheesy lines it's a
disaster movie after all". The devastating destruction scenes were
definitely believable. The film of course centers an a select group of
people and how the disaster brings them together, I thought it was well
put together.The movie starts right off with action, reminded of the opening scene
in Cliffhanger.This disaster movie about a huge earthquake in California hits the
major issues including a tsunami.The locations seem to be accurate IE Route 198 about 70 miles back.
That is often were the flaws in these types of movies occur: names of
routes, buildings, directions etc. I live in SoCal and the LA info
appeared on track, I don't know San Fran at all so I would have to
differ on that location.And thank goodness the jerk off gets his just rewards and the good guys
are all OK, well except for poor Kim.Cute new Australian actor,Hugo Johnstone-Burt is perfect in his role
and and you have to love his little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson).I repeat who wouldn't want The Rock to direct you to safety- 'just get
up against something sturdy...triangle of life'
