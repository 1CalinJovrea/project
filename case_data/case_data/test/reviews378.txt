One of the worst movies I've ever seen

This movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. There is no story line,
and every single one of the "grown up men" in excessively creepy. The
jokes aren't funny and undoubtedly the best performance comes from
SHAQ. I failed to find any humor in this movie and the film seemed to
drag on and on. It was really hard to find anyone likable in this
movie. All the characters were stiff and uninteresting. I'm a fan of old Adam Sandler movies, but I feel that he has lost his
comedic touch. This may be his first sequel, but I truly hope it's his
last. Maybe it's time to retire Mr. Sandler.All in all, do not waste your money on this awful movie.
