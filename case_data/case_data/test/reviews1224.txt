A good entry into the Marvel Universe

Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away
from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a
spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in
Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little
repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only
hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel
Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's
friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they
simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep
continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little
impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons
(even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident
when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their
turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and
proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better
prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft
become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt,
even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every
column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm
not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his
intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its
simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when
a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in
effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take
advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for
themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to
help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor
who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little
hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for
cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as
a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these
but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to
watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.
