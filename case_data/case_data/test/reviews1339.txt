Truly bad

Those poor, poor actors. How to work on such a script? Was it written
by a 10 year old? Was it fan-fiction originally?This story had no flow whatsoever. Not only was it immature and clich√©,
it didn't even have a proper script formation. The scenes were
unconnected. The dialogue, especially at the beginning, had no real
purpose. You could bypass the first half hour of the film with no real
problem. Not to mention that the characters are really, really, badly
written. It is amazing how writers and directors think that in order to make a
respectable rom com these days, all you need is two white leads who
fall in love in the end, a goofy best friend, corny music and dialogue
and you're pretty much done. Just know that sloppy can only get you as
far as forgettable.
