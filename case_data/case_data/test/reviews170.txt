"I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?"

Ang Lee takes Yann Martel's much acclaimed novel and turns it into a
collage full of masterful imagery and dream-like visuals, which remains
at the core a profoundly simple tale of spirituality, in a manner which
might leave you either with a wry smile and shake of head at what you
just experienced or with a euphoric feeling equivalent to the one you
get after seeing a magic trick. The thing with this magic however, is
that it won't leave you for quite a long while and it might even make
you question your most core beliefs. Or the lack of them.I don't believe in God but I do believe in the power of stories,
imagery, art in it's most simple yet beautiful form and most of all in
the power of words. I believe in the power of cinema, the moving images
that can move you in more ways than you can imagine. That can transport
you into another space and time, into a World full of possibilities. Of
everything. Of nothing.And come to think of it believing in God may not be that much
different.'Life Of Pi' is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement in terms of visual
effects and images but it's real beauty lies in the story that is so
simple in it's depiction yet so profound in it's impact.There are scenes of such wonderful amazement that words fall short
often. Right from the beginning credits to the poignant scene when Pi
leaves his lifeboat just after the ship-wreck and watches the mammoth
ship sink underwater, the heart-pounding introduction of Richard Parker
on the lifeboat, the surreal dream sequence of Pi, the many sunsets and
nights at sea, the mesmerizing scene with the jellyfishes and blue
whale and just so many other scenes that each one can be paused and
made into a collection of brilliantly picturesque wallpapers. Such
brilliant cinematic quality is very rare and it needs to be experienced
on the hugest screen possible. It's why we go to the movies for. Ang
Lee's direction is minimalistic and focused. Gentle and caressing. He
does not make movies. He nurtures a baby and lets him out to play with
us when he deems fit.The end is somewhat abrupt in it's flow but nevertheless compelling in
it's effect. Suraj Sharma as Pi is very good. Tabu impresses in her
short role and Aadil Hussain is effective. But like it's always in
almost every movie that he does, it's the brilliant Irrfan Khan who
etches out the older Pi with an absolutely touching performance. 'Life
Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a
shining crown jewel in this oceanic, gigantic world of cinema.
Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't
happen very often."I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?" "The one with
the Tiger." "And so it is with God."I'm a believer. In something not very different from God I think.And yes, always "the one with the Tiger."
