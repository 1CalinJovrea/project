Massive let down

It's a really good example of how a terrible script can completely
destroy a movie. There are too many things which make no sense to list,
but the key issues are:For a film that seems so keen to virtue-signal about white ignorance
and racism, it does nothing to explain to us Fawcett's theories about
the people of Z. Who were they? How did their civilisation operate? Why
did they disappear? Surely these explorers would have built up far more
of a picture from the surrounding tribes, artefacts, and previous
finds. There is a tiny smattering of these things, but in 2h21ms
nowhere near enough to build up a mythology. Therefore it's difficult
to see why this obsesses Fawcett. You literally get more detail from
the quests in the Indiana Jones movies.Instead it focuses relentlessly on the most tedious and dangerous
aspects of the trips, their suffering, or switches back to London with
almost every old man of course a stiff- upper-lip racist and sexist
clich√©. Imagine a more insidious General Melchett from Blackadder Goes
Forth and you won't be far off.There is an extremely cringey attempt to insert a modern feminist
perspective. At one stage, Nina wants to go on the expedition. Her
reasoning? She found an important document relating to it. This
apparently makes her equal to Fawcett's many years of soldiering and
survival skills. It's clumsy and anachronistic. The trip could very
well kill them both and so would leave their children orphaned. Surely
a more logical argument would be whether he has to go at all. He is,
after all, a father, and has responsibilities at home.The First World War section adds absolutely nothing and captures none
of the horror of the battlefield. It's all just tally-ho chaps, almost
Hallmark channel-like. Just awful.Sienna Miller, Robert Pattinson and especially Charlie Hunnam wring
what they can from such a sparsely-written script and should be
commended for that, which is why this isn't a 1.Don't be fooled by the title - it's not about a lost city or even a
lost man. It's a lazy and pretentious destruction of what could have
been a thrilling find.
