The horror is having watched the original and seeing this

Leave it to Hollywood to try to take a great original film and jazz it
up with their politics and false polish. First let's toss in an interracial relationship and class structure to
give everyone a teaching moment. Then lets change other details to make
things seem even more compelling, dramatic and extraordinary. That's
because the original film, which was great, just wasn't amped up
enough.In the original film we watch a detective who has had a friendship with
the DA. There are questions about "what if" regarding a current between
them but, what drives the film, is the retired detective haunted by a
crime he could not solve. A beautiful woman is raped and murdered in a
terrible fashion and her lover is overcome with incredible sorrow. His
reinvestigation into the murder also connects him with his loose end in
his search to answer both questions. And the cast and script is
riveting.In this film that doesn't happen. The person murdered is the daughter
of one of the investigators, which goes unsolved. And then a team
member returns many years later to reopen the case and question about
the grieving mother and former team member and her zeal to find the
murderer.I give it 1 star because I have to. I give it another star for the fact
that I've seen much worse. But it is a tragedy that this film tears
down the greatness of the original. On the bright side it isn't as
pitifully bad as Spike Lee's Oldboy remake, which could be one of the
worst ever. This is along the level of the remake of Spoorloss into
"The Vanishing." Rip the essence out of what makes the movie great and
try to throw your spin on something that really doesn't need fixing at
all.
