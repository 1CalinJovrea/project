Oh, what it could have been !!!

A movie that could have been great if not for the obvious flaws that
drag it down. Let me break it down by sections:Story, Screenplay & Dialogues: A very promising premise that promises
much more than if actually offers on screen. A razor straight story
line that does not deviate from the obvious and every scene follows a
predictable path. Offers no surprises, thrills, twists or turns. A
scrappy screenplay only serves to drag the pace, especially in action
sequences...where you are itching for the mega fights only to be let
down. The director tries Chris Nolan / Inception'esque trip down memory
lanes, only to falter without generating any emotion from the audience.
Absolutely horrendous dialogue. Completely uninspiring. Scenes where a
single look should have conveyed the emotion powerfully has been
diluted with meaningless words. More worse as the viewer can even
predict what is going to be said!Action & Animation: Very good, but could have been much much better.
More slo-mo sequences wherein you can have a classic view of the
behemoths colliding are missing trying to generate pace, but does not
reach its mark. Most sequences happen in night/underwater adding to a
jumbled rumble feel.Characters: Tame and insipid. lack of character development leaves the
viewers emotionally detached and not able to 'connect' with any of the
characters. Notable exceptions are Elba and Pellman. Both the lead
characters are eminently forgettable and do not make a impact. Director
should have watched Independence day or MiB to understand the
importance of character development. A leaf out of Real Steel would
have lifted this to greatness.Overall: Still a good movie. Watchable once with minimal repeat value.
The Jaegers are awesome and just for that I rate this 7/10.
