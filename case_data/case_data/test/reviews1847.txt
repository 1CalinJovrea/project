There Is Another Untold Story Within This Interesting Work

There's a story behind this movies existence that is as interesting as
the film itself. It's disappointing to know that scenes involving the
original story writers daughter (played by veteran Eileen Atkins) were
deleted prior to the films release. Unfortunately, all that's left of
these scenes is a montage of pages from her mothers original manuscript
shown under the end credits - using these notes in this way can prove a
little confusing for those unaware of the origins of these writings -
as it tends to appear as if the films story was based on factual
characters (while I'm sure many were indeed based on very real people
and for the most part the instances portrayed were founded on some
terrible historical facts). The author of the original story, Irene Nemirovsky, was tragically sent
to her death at the hands of the invading German army following bitter
fighting during the occupation of France in 1942. Her husband, before
he also was executed, gave their daughter Denise his wife's
manuscripts. Denise, for emotional reasons did not read her mother's
writings till an astounding 60yrs later. She eventually had them
compiled into a novel that was published in 2002 - becoming an
international best seller. Story rights were then sold for production
as a screenplay. Denise sadly died just before the films release. To
play the main protagonist producers cast Michele Williams (My week With
Marilyn '11) mother to the late Heath Ledgers daughter. Considering
some of William's earlier roles she is nothing short of remarkable -
turning in a convincingly measured performance as the repressed Lucile
Angellier. This is more than a conventional wartime romantic movie as it deals
realistically with the shocking impact of oppression and the
devastating consequences it brings to all involved. Perhaps had the
film makers paid a little less attention to the screenplays various
sexual intrigues, they may have been able to treat us to those deleted
scenes detailing the fascinating real life story - involving the
writers daughter discovering her mothers work all those years after the
event!. Director and co-screenplay writer Saul Dibb along with
collaborating writer Matt Charman - join forces with director of
photography Eduard Grau to create some remarkably atmospheric scenes.
One well executed sequence featuring endless lines of displaced French
families fleeing the relentless onslaught on foot, is a sad and
dramatic sight.Those who remain in their homes are met with enforced billeting of
German Officers - this brings out the worst of human nature with
neighboring villagers sending notes 'rating' on their fellow neighbor's
to gain favour from the Germans - a shocking act indeed. Music plays a
key role throughout the film with a romantic piano soliloquy composed
by Alexandre Desplate played throughout. The exciting accompanying
action score is contributed by Rael Jones. Overall this is a sincere
portrait of a dreadful time in human history and while the the script
may falter in several situations it's far more thoughtful than some
other offerings along these lines. Performances are strong with a
sterling cast of professionals working at their peak.Note: This film is remarkably similar to an earlier production, staring
the great Maria Schell "So Little Time" '52" - this marvelous classic
film has recently been released on DVD in England and is more than well
worth locating.
