Keeps all the charm and fun of the original

'Pitch Perfect' was a bit of a sleeper hit. I hadn't even heard of it
when two people I knew told me it was their new favourite film in quick
succession. It didn't sound like my kind of a movie but I thought I'd
give it a go nevertheless. To my surprise I found myself really
enjoying it and so was quite pleased to see they were making a sequel.
Sequels are notorious for losing the magic of the original,
particularly comedies which seem on a hiding to nothing most of the
time. However, I found myself enjoying this one just as much as I had
the original. Nearly the full cast had returned (always a good sign) and there were a
few adjustments to the amount of lines particular characters were
getting, determined by how popular they were in the first. The
character 'Fat Amy' who was a real fan-favourite in the original had a
very noticeable increase in lines. Elizabeth Banks took over the
directing role for this one, in her first full feature film at the
helm. I think she did a pretty good job for the most part. One thing
I'd suggest she got wrong though was the final performance by the
'Bellas'. It simply wasn't good enough to justify winning the World
Championship. In fact one of the few other performances we actually see
in full by 'Das Sound Machine' was noticeably better. We were supposed
to be swayed by the crowd simply cheering louder for the 'Bellas' but
that wasn't fooling any intelligent audience member.This was one of the only real flaws though. Most of the jokes landed
very well, the singing performances were very entertaining and the
choice of songs throughout was spot-on and really got the audience into
a jovial mood. There's also a charm about these movies that can be rare
to come across these days. I really like this series and eagerly look
forward to the third installment.
