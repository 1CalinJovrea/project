Misunderstood ending.

A very well written story. All the reviews I have read seem to be
watching a different movie than the one I watched. I wonder if the
reviewers are even bothering to watch the film to it's conclusion.Spoiler Alert***************Do not read before watching the film.Spoiler Alert************************The entire film is told from the prisoner's point of view. He is in
fact guilty of creating a computer virus. He is being interrogated by a
artificial intelligence program.The program's objective is to get him to disclose where he hid the
thumb drive that contains the virus that will incriminate him. The
program is persistent and over time keeps breaking him down.At the end of the film we see the camera in the dome at the coffee
shop.We are reminded that everything that we have seen is a fantasy that is
playing out in his mind. He is still in the cell and he is still being
interrogated.By the closing scene, he is getting closer and closer to incriminating
himself for the crime he has committed. If the artificial intelligence
program does not know where the thumb drive is yet it will know shortly
because although the prisoner has been trying to hide that info he has
been unsuccessful. After all, the program has infinite patience. Spoiler Alert***************Do not read before watching the film.Spoiler Alert************************
