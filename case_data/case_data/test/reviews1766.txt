Carol is a good film, with a very important subject, and the script
never addresses it head on, rather with class, elegance and subtly.It's a great love and life story about one woman fighting for her right
to be happy and another trying to figure out how can she really be
happy. Each of them is the answer to the other.The script could feature more insight, but then again, the film is
supposed to be subtle and let the images speak for themselves. The
cinematography is outstanding and the score is downright superb.
There's a feeling, a certain atmosphere that makes the film truly
peculiar and one of a kind.But in the end, i think that it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and
Rooney Mara, as they give unforgettable, brilliant performances. They
are always perfect of course, but here there's something one of a kind
about their performances. Its not only the characters that fall in love
with each other, but also you who fall in love with them. Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of
kind performances.
