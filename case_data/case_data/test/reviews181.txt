This is a bit of an "updated version" of Mean Girls-think that movie
with social media. Mae Whitman's character learns from her neighbor and
star football player that she is her friends' DUFF-designated ugly fat
friend, a frequency among high school cliques. This does not go over
with her, and she freaks out and tries to improve things a little bit
while "changing friends." This movie does have a message-I won't ruin things by revealing it.
Anyone who likes high school comedies will like this. The cast works
well together, and you will like the school and teacher scenes. Overall
a funny and enjoyable film.*** out of ****
