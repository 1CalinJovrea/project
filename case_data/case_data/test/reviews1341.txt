Come to Laugh, Come to Cry, Come to Care, but not necessarily to Terms ...

"August: Osage County" centers on a dysfunctional family, rooted in the
plains of Oklahoma, as dry and bare as the heart of its remaining
matriarch who has nothing but 'belittling comments' to distribute as
wry marks of affections, giving a disturbingly ironic significance to
the oral cancer she suffers from pain-in-the-mouth, pain-in-the-ass.
We understand that Violet, Meryl Streep in another
(what-did-you-expect) virtuoso performance, let bitterness grow in the
heart of her three daughters, each one proving that there can be more
than one worst-case scenario.By the way, it's interesting that many dysfunctional families feature
daughters. I remember Woody Allen's dramatic masterpiece "Interiors"
was about three sisters struggling to give their life a meaning after
the deterioration of their parents' marriage and their mother's descent
into madness. Again, you had the practical and rational sister, the
easy-going one, and the tormented middle-child. I think there is some
Oedipal meaning to it, while brothers, protective toward their mother
tend to stand together, sisters are closer to the father, and are more
liable to be rivals either to their mother or for their father, which
is conflict-wise, more promising.The oldest daughter is Julia Roberts as Barb, the one who inherited her
mother's strong-willed genes, a strength that ultimately lead her
husband to leave her for a younger woman, and naturally, her daughter
Jean (Abigail Breslin) grew as a disturbed pseudo-rebellious teenager.
There's no excuse for her husband's behavior, but Ewan McGregor strikes
as the kind of decent guy who can only be 'accidentally' bad, and it's
as if Barb made such situation inevitable, as if there was an innate
incapability to express love in her heart.The other sisters are Karen (Juliette Lewis), the youngest and most
deluded one, who embraced life with an ersatz of optimism to better
cancel out her crappy past and came to the house with a sleazy Florida
businessman (Dermot Mulroney) the last of a string of boyfriends, and I
want to add : so far. And there is Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) who stayed
close to home and as a reward, suffers from the old-maid syndrome where
any attempt to express her personality is repressed by her mother. No
rewards to her good intentions except low self-esteem and bad luck (for
reasons I won't spoil) that lead her heart to her first cousin
(Benedict Cumberbatch).And in this drama whose witty and punchy dialogs are fueled by alcohol
and unhealthy rainbows of pills, pain-killers and anti-depressants,
each scene manages to be both entertaining and true to life, painting
the live portrait of a family collapse, whose warning signs were the
slow disintegration of its founding marriage. Basically "August Osage
County" is to Family what "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" is to
couple, and the film is driven by fantastic performances, all carrying
their level of pathos with talent and authenticity mostly from women,
but men have their words to say.Chris Cooper is the husband of Violet's sister Mattie Fae (Margo
Martindale), a lighter version of the infamous Hillary Swank's redneck
mother in "Million Dollar Baby", lacking compassion and empathy toward
her only son. Benedict Cumberbatch who'd make any heart melt as the
ill-regarded "Little Charles". And if poor Charles couldn't stand up
for his beliefs, at least, he'll inspire one of the most emotionally
satisfying moments in the movie, and established men as the Yin to the
film's dysfunctional Yang. Ironically, the only positive female figure
is Johnna (Misty Upham), the Native maid hired by Violet's husband,
Beverly (Sam Shepard) a once-renowned poet, a decent guy too.With these characters brought all together after Beverly's
disappearance, you have all the ingredients assembled for these great
family brawls, with their share of secrets, revelations and twisted
plot twists, and you have the local Oklahoman touch, making the film a
mix between "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" (it was adapted from a play by
Tracy Letts) and "About Schmidt". It's greatly written, full of
authentic moments such as the dinner scene, Cooper's graces and many
mother-and-daughters truth-telling moments  it's an ensemble movie and
I guess this is the role Julia Roberts should have won an Oscar for,
not Erin 'gimme-a-break' Brockovich.And while I saw the film, I thought I already had the title of my
review in mind, something like "one's end inspiring many new
beginnings", something about the necessity of reuniting to finally come
to terms with the past and take a new start. Yet, the film ends quite
abruptly, leaving too many interrogation marks. I don't expect a happy
ending again, but all the movies I mentioned had somewhat of a
resolution, a way for us to catch our breath and fill our hearts with
hope. I know "hope" is a big word but it's precisely because the movie
didn't leave much for optimism in the beginning than I kept having in
mind this "it can't be worse" feeling.I understand it was meant to be a realistic drama and in reality, many
problems are left unresolved, if only because most people chose to
escape or hide instead of facing their responsibilities, but maybe the
reunion was a way to put an end to it, maybe there had been enough
secrets in this family and it was time not just to let them out, but to
make it worth it. I will never see these characters again, so I wish we
had a few glimpses of what would happen to them after.Besides, Tracy Letts meant the film as a tribute to his background, to
show that Midwest isn't just populated by Rubes or Rednecks, like in
the movies, I'm not sure the ending would reconcile a perplexed
audience with the Midwest. I know it's not a requirement for a great
film, but after all the pain, and noises and stress, we went through,
even a temporary resolution would've been enough. Some characters' arcs
were meant to be closed  even temporarily
