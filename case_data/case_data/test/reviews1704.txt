Poor Sequel

Sin City was one of my favorite movies of the 2000s. A fun, creative
film noir cartoon with unique visuals and a style all its own. The
first problem you run into with this sequel is that it offers nothing
new. It's a stylistic retread of the first movie, only less impressive.
The visuals copy the first movie but somehow seem cheaper. The makeup
effects aren't as good either, with Marv's jaw easily twice the size of
the last movie. The action is weaker, with no memorable sequences and a
final showdown that is derivative of the first movie. The other big
problem is that the writing is very poor this time and the stories
don't flow well together. The Dwight story is lame. The Johnny story is
pointless. The Nancy story is impossible to take seriously, especially
the ghost parts. Sadly, this movie is boring, listless, and disjointed.
It's a movie that didn't need to be made. Still, it's always nice to
see Eva Green naked. That's something that never gets old.
