Cheap propaganda

"I had a purpose". The purpose of American soldiers occupying and
bombing foreign land is to serve the American dictatorial regime. An
attempt to present these farm boys who take the patriotic idea
literally or immigrants striving to get American citizenship in
exchange for service is just laughable. Cheap propaganda that is not
worth your time.
