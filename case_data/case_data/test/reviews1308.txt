Disappointed

I went into this knowing that it was rated above average for a horror
movie and came out feeling like I am on a totally different page. It contains all the clich√©s of a typical, low budget horror movie with
one-dimensional characters, a loose plot, weak acting, glaring stigma
towards individuals with mental illness, and more. The fact that it is
unable to hit the 1hr 30min mark should have warned me there was little
substance and I did not find myself invested in the characters or the
unveiling of the truth behind the situation. On a sidenote, there was
not much to look forward to with the scariest moments already portrayed
in the trailer as well. Terribly mediocre.
