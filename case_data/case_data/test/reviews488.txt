Great Movie ! Can't Believe all the Abysmal Reviews

I think some people are expecting WAY too much out of this movie. It's
a kids movie which has a lot of appeal for adults. It's one of the more
appealing kids movies I've seen in years. It's definitely geared more
towards the 8-12 crowd, rather than younger kids' movies (like
Despicable Me, which is also great). The language is a bit course at
points, but nothing too bad.I read all these horrible reviews and was not looking forward to it,
but it was SO entertaining! I was worried that it would be another
crappy Adam Sandler movie (I like him, but he has definitely had some
real bombs). But he did NOT try to hijack the entire movie like some
people suggest. He shared the screen well with the other actors.Sure, Kevin James was a strange choice as president but, again, IT'S A
KIDS MOVIE! While some adults can't handle the package delivery guy
from King of Queens being president, most of the target audience
probably doesn't even know who he is. And he is NOT playing some
bumbling doofus like in Mall Cop. He successfully pulls off the role of
a president who is stuck in a video game and I cannot imagine anyone
else doing a better job.All in all, the movie was very entertaining (better the the Minions
movie I took the kids too last month--snore...). How do you NOT enjoy
seeing Pacman gobbling up cars and people like dots on the streets of
New York City. Each game was parodied just the right amount. I wouldn't
have wanted 90 minutes of any one video game, but I think they are
successful in giving you just enough of each video game "battle" to
keep in interesting and not boring. It's exciting enough for kids that aren't familiar with the old- school
games, but gives some nostalgia (and some subtle grown-up humor) to
keep the adults entertained.Sure, no one is going to win an Academy Award for this film, but it is
funny, entertaining and an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 45
minutes.
