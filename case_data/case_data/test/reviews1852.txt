In the Age of Stupid,

a potty-mouthed bear is the pinnacle of funny!This is a pretty lousy bromance film. The only difference is that one
of the friends has been substituted by a talking teddy bear. This could
have some interesting and funny consequence, but the bear just behaves
like a regular idiotic person... I guess people nowadays consider funny a teddy bear talking dirty,
humping humans smoking pot and get wasted...I could not smile once during this whole tragedy... And the worst
thing, is that the film wants to be more than it should be and teach
most of us men that we should not be immature and should face the
responsibilities of life such as getting married and having a family,
because this is what makes us happy. Blah!!!!!Pirate it! It is not worth the price of a ticket or rental!
