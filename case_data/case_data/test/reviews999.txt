Terrible, just terrible.

I wish I could have those 108 minutes back. This was just bad. Written
by two terrible writers. Directed by an animation/titles guy. Acted by
a grown man pretending to be 12. Costarring a female him. How is this
considered entertaining? Everyone sounds exactly the same. Tons of time
jumps to dress up the bad storyline. It's like a cross between Van
Wilder, Kill Bill, and Striptease. If this is at all a reflection of
what comic book fans want to see, I'm truly disappointed. How this
possibly made over 10 to 1 in box office is unreal. Is this the end
result of the internet vs reading real books? Zero imagination. Zero
delivery. Zero quality. Worse than Thor 2.
