Landing In Africa...With A Big Thud!

I guess you could say Adam Sandler's Blended has a heart as opposed to
Will Farrell's Anchorman 2 which doesn't? That postulated, for this
viewer anyway, Anchorman 2 kept me in constant laughter while Blended
hardly manages an occasional snicker. It's good to see Drew Barrymore
and Sandler back together as they've had, I think, two previous
pairings that, perhaps, had a modicum of chemistry. Here that pairing
seems strained, perhaps because of Sandler's character needing to be
actually funny since that is what Blended is obviously trying for. The
laughs are truly spaced out which is to say way too many fall flat.As the story progresses a forced blending of Sandler's and Barrymore's
families get thrown together. The premise which this springs from is
abysmal. To make it more picturesque the blending is an African
romantic getaway of which Sandler's boss was to take with Barrymore's
business (Closet Queens, ha ha) partner. The African thing seems,
mostly, bizarre as well as well as heavy handedly plied; poking fun at
quite likely every possible tasteless stereotypical way. That forced
nature comes off as a total nonsense (i.e., not funny). How hilarious
is Adam Sandler riding an ostrich? A real kneeslapper...Not.One gets the feeling Sandler has lost his way, if not his best comedic
center; kind of like someone who knows he needs to get back in the game
while he's throwing something on the proverbial wall with a Hail Mary
to hope it sticks. It slides off with a splat constantly.As you can gather this is not a particularly good Adam Sandler movie.
Looking back, maybe those were, in fact, rarer than one realized.
Still, the man had that post Saturday Night Live "next big thing"
talent at one time. Personally, I don't believe you just lose that for
good. Times do change, but talent adapts and with Sandler there needs
to be a big "tune-up" which requires the right vehicle of which this
movie is, mostly, a polar opposite. These two are capable of so much
better it just has to be said. They're not the Tracy and Hepburn of
comedy, but this is purely a wasted effort. Sandler's deadpan, dour if
you will, comedy needs something that fits and if he doesn't find it
his time may have passed is the most serious takeaway though.
