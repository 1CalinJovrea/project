Visually excellent though slightly too long

This movie is - without a doubt - one of the most visually spectacular
that I have ever seen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in that department
with the likes of Watchmen, Prometheus, Sunshine and Kosinski's
preceding effort - TRON: Legacy. Also (like TRON) the soundtrack is
excellent and very well used throughout, enhancing the action and
adding depth to some - at times - distinctly average acting
performances.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that's not a bad thing in this case, in
fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower
sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he's really not on
screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga
Kurylenko's statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her
acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her
character's actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the
best performance, convincing as the sad and confused Victoria,
unwilling - or perhaps unable - to confront the disturbing truth.At over 2 hours I think that it's too long by about 20 minutes. A
shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower
sections which I think hurt the movie's overall rhythm and flow.Overall, I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the
cinema, on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won't be the
same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough, but combined with
a clever (if not entirely original) script, a thumping soundtrack and
some exciting action, you should be entertained.
