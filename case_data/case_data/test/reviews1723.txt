Average story but good acting.

I was really excited to watch this after seeing the trailer, and not to
say that I was disappointed but I was kind of expecting a bit more. The
whole story basically revolves around her first love and whether she
should stay. Though I appreciate that it wasn't as lovey-dovey as most
young romances (or high-school relationships) tend to be, I would've
liked if there was more to the story other than that.The music element was pretty cool, and I wonder if she really plays the
cello herself, because it looked really authentic. Same with the other
actors in the band.The acting was pretty good, it wasn't spectacular but it was good
enough for the film. Moretz surprises me by the range of her
characters, as I first knew her from Kick-Ass which is profoundly
different. Blackley does a good job too, though I guess I didn't really
feel the connection between the two,and maybe that's why I felt that
there was something missing from the film. I didn't sympathize with
them and so thought that the film was just all right. Though the
parents had real character to them and they played the part of a family
really well.Another thing I noticed was that when Hall was a 'spirit' people still
tended to move out of her way and it was really obvious. There was this
one scene where her friend opens a door and she pushes it a bit further
as if for the person behind...which was Hall as a spirit. That was not
good. Do people actually see or hear her? If not, it should be
consistent throughout. And it also seemed as if she could touch things,
though people didn't notice.Read more of my movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com
