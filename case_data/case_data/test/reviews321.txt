What was he thinking?

This one is all on the Director. I don't know what he was trying to
accomplish but it failed miserably. The basic outline of the story
showed a lot of promise but it never came together. Its funny that one
of the reoccurring lines in the dialog between the father and daughter
focused on the word "gimmick" because it seemed as if the director
tried to fit every story telling gimmick he could think of into this
film. The result is a horribly told story. Constantly confusing.
Disjointed. Lacking any depth - you couldn't connect with any of the
characters. The story had no pace. You spend your time trying to figure
out what's going on....then asking yourself, why did they do that...and
then constantly hoping they can manage to pull their stuff together,
only to be disappointed in the end. The actors were a talented group. I
can't imagine how frustrating it must have been for them being stuck in
this slow motion train wreck.
