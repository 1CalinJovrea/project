Water and CGI does not an instant classic make

As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it's their
masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in
the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was
shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed
singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst
CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. A film that is over 50% GCI, should focus on making that part
believable, unfortunately for this film, it's far from that. It looks
like the original film was ripped apart frame by frame and the
beautiful hand-painted drawings have been replaced with digital
caricatures. Besides CGI that is bad, it's mostly creepy. As the little
teacup boy will give me nightmares for several nights to come. Emma
Watson plays the same character as she always does, with very little
acting effort and very little conviction as Belle. Although I can see
why she was cast in the film based on merits, she is far from the right
choice for the role. Dan Stevens does alright under as some motion
captured dead-eyed Beast, but his performance feels flat as well. Luke
Evans makes for a great pompous Gaston, but a character that has little
depth doesn't really make for a great viewing experience. Josh Gad is a
great comic relief just like the original movie's LeFou. Other than
that, none of the cast stands out enough for me to remember them. Human
or CHI creature. I was just bored through out the whole experience. And
for a project costing $160 000 000, I can see why the PR department is
pushing it so hard because they really need to get some cash back on
this pile of wet stinky CGI-fur!All and all, I might be bias from really loving Disney's first
adaptation. That for me marks the high-point of all their work,
perfectly combining the skills of their animators along with some CGI
in a majestic blend. This film however is more like the bucket you wash
off your paintbrush in, it has all the same colors, but muddled with
water and to thin to make a captivating story from. The film is quite
frankly not worth your time, you would be better off watching the
original one more time.
