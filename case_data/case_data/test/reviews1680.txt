Entertaining for the most part

I bloody love anthologies! While they can be a mixed bag in which some
are bloody awesome and some pretty damn terrible, the fact that each
doesn't last long makes it worthy a watch in my eyes!The Tales of Halloween has ten gruesome tales all based around
Halloween, of course (the most wonderful time of the year!)Most of them are fast-paced and involve classic Halloween staples, full
of references to infamous horror, but a few were too horror- comedy for
me. I prefer creeps over laughs, but there was enough gore to keep me
satisfied. A perfect watch for Halloween, though I'd have loved it if Tales of
Halloween had gone all out scary, dark and disturbing, but i'm sure
many horror fans will love this anyways. I'd recommend giving it a go, there's surely something you'll like.
