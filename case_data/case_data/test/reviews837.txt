There's a difference between a flawed protagonist and an antagonist

"My whole life, I've felt guilty after sex. Guilty for everything I'd
said and done to get there. But the thing I learned, is when you
actually care about the person, you don't feel guilty."My palm should be in my face at this stupendously ignorant and
completely illogical anti-philosophical piece of word gobble, but it
was physically impossible as my clenching of my fists were instead
turning my knuckles white while I was hammering at the stop button.Why I endured this travesty for almost an hour is beyond me. Possibly
because just before this tragedy of cinema I had enjoyed the flawed,
but overall quite endearing "The Rewrite".That story, as this one, follows a screen writer. And enduring this
story had me thinking back to a scene in "The Rewrite" where Hugh Grant
teaches his class that "any good story must be character-driven, not
the other way around."It is certainly true for "Playing it Cool" that its story drives its
characters, and its story is as clichéd and predictable as they come.
But that isn't necessarily a problem; I expect romcoms to be
predictable or clichéd, and I don't hold it against them if they do.
Rather I'd applaud them if they break that mold. All a good romcom has
to do is build likable characters that we may reflect ourselves in, and
then lead us by hand through all the clichéd obstacles using funny and
touching tricks to keep us entertained and engaged until we reach the
inevitable hooking up of our protagonist with his or her soulmate,
realizing their own flaws and having grown a bit. The End. A bit of
Kleenex in front of our smiling faces, and a more or less given 7/10 on
IMDb.The problem with this formula is that when you fail to build likable
characters, and you still count on that cookie-cutter storyline, there
really are very few redeeming qualities left. A couple of laughs,
perhaps, maybe some nudity, good actors, music. Not much reason to
watch till the end now, is it?This is evident in "Playing it Cool." It's a perfect example of how
important it is to have a true protagonist and not just a number of
antagonists ranging from devilishly evil to just mean-spirited and
spoiled, the latter being our "hero".The only redeeming qualities we're shown about our main character are
the ways his traits are not as repugnant as those of his "friends".
He's a liar, he's a cheat, and he is through-and-through utterly
disrespectful towards women. And the worst part is that it's not really
depicted as flaws. He's a remorseless egotist bordering on sociopath.
Kinda hard to feel any connection to him except a desire to connect
one's hands around his throat.It is really quite striking throughout the hour I endured how glaringly
obvious it becomes that these script writers (the real ones, not the
fictitious ones) truly don't have the first clue as to how love really
works. The first "meaningful" kiss in the movie is a pity kiss,
toe-cringingly pathetic. Or lead describes to his "friends" that his
infatuation isn't about sex or lust, it's about the interests, feelings
and whatnot that they share. One of the writers heard a line like that
in another movie, and threw it in here  thing is, at this point he
knows absolutely nothing about her. And then that horrible, stupid line
that ended my viewing of this flick.I realize you may be thinking that I'm some holier than though born
again Christian who can't stomach promiscuous sex and foul language.
But I assure you, I'm not. I enjoy women before, during, and after
marriage as much as the next guy, the more the merrier, and I can swear
you under the table. I just need my romcoms to be romantic, and at
least a bit authentic underneath all their cotton candy sweetness. And
that requires, at the very least, one protagonist. This flick has none.Romcoms are a dime a dozen, and I suggest you put your money somewhere
else. Anywhere else. The extra star is for decent acting.
