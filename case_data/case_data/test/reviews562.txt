An egregiously bad movie

As a computer science student, I went to see The Internship excited to
watch a movie about an internship at Google. And it's a comedy too, I
thought. Great!Well, once the movie truly begins (after rushing through introductions
for a few characters that are discarded for the rest of the movie), we
are met with the Googleplex, Google's office. Google's driver-less car
along with the Space Ship One at the entrance makes the movie look more
like an ad for Google (the rest of the movie makes you feel that this
is not necessarily a bad thing).But, filled with poor writing it quickly degrades in quality with some
very poor characters taking up most of the screen-time. The characters
are so gimmicky and caricatured that the movie loses any sense of
realism it held. While Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson try hard, there
really is not much in the way of funny dialogue or a plot for them to
work with. None of the characters have any depth, and the script is
pretty shoddy. I would give this a miss.
