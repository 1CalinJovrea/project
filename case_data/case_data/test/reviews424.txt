Torturous to Watch

Another movie in a long line of movies that believe it's entertaining
and humorous to present it's characters as being completely unfiltered,
and who came across to me extremely vile and despicable. It seemed the
characters were just trying to outdo each other as to who could be the
most mean spirited, lewd, crude, and outrageous.The story revolves around the Altman family patriarch dying, and the
remainder of the family being summoned by the Altman matriarch (Jane
Fonda) to attend the funeral. Additionally, she informs them that her
late husband requested that they all sit shiva for seven days, which in
Jewish tradition has the family remaining together in mourning and
greeting any family and friends who wish to visit to express their
condolences.For me, watching this repugnant cast of characters for seven days
seemed like seven years and became incredibly torturous to continue. I
wanted to write this review so I stuck with it to the end. but
otherwise I would have done something I almost never do and just walk
away and not finish it.Maybe there are those that like this "humor", but I would say carefully
heed the advice of those reviewers on this site that have issued
warnings. To me, it became cringe inducing and repulsive, and I
couldn't wait till it ended.
