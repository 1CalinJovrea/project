Not as bad as they are all saying

Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis
Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly
do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched
to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of
patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly
entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the
book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price
back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have
been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just
cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb
puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get
glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to
sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent
movie and Jolie should be proud of it.
