What was the Editor's Game?

Unfilmable, he said. OSC said that his "Pre-teen Sociopath Commits
Genocide On Unfortunately Named Space Ants In Space" novel was unable
to be filmed simply because the majority of the content takes place in
Ender's head. His feelings, the complexity of dealing with his
siblings, his resentment and burden of duty. So what best way to apply
this cerebral sci-fi to celluloid?Just ignore the thinky bits.Ender's Game, The Movie certainly cracks along at quite a pace, you're
not left looking at your watching and wondering how long before things
wrap up. And the acting is solid enough, complaints there. What doesn't
work is the adaptation itself, and the editing.Anyone who's read the books before going into the cinema will recognise
the framework of the story, but will wonder where all of the plot went.
Peter appears for all of one scene, solely to show that, yes, he's a
violent dick. Valentine appears more often, but mostly as a plot device
more than anything character driven. Valentine is nice, Ender likes
Valentine, Ender misses Valentine. Locke and Demosthenes? Never heard
of them, they don't exist in this version of events. The Mind Game, the
one that Ender plays throughout EGTB and mirrors his mental state and
thought process? Reduced to a two minute Flash game on an iPad and a
sequence of foreshadowing for later in the movie. The series of battle
games between the armies that slowly erode Ender's resolve as Graff
systematically changes the rules to break Ender down? One 2 v 1 match.
Characters are blurred together and virtually written out (notably,
neither of the kids Ender beats the hell out of die, assumedly to
garner audience empathy - and all the characters are at about twice the
age of the ones in the novels, maybe to stop people having to see a 6
year old boy murder another kid in the showers...) and the end result
is very different to the novels.And the editing. It's all over the place - when watching this movie you
will feel that it's an edited for TV version and that someone cut out
the wrong scenes. The first battle room scene ends abruptly, with not
even a discussion of what happened in it. Ender goes from being in
Salamander army to being given the name of a new army, to having a
whole new army who almost instantly respect him. Worst of all is Ender
wanting to quit the program, whereas in EGTB it took place over time
and was caused by Graff's increasingly gruelling changing of rules, in
EGTM it happens after one game, and the sudden jumps in narrative make
Ender look at best like a petulant child and at worst like a
schizophrenic:Graff: "Wake them up early for a game!" Ender: "It's 3am, we're playing
a game!" Ender's Army: "It's 2 v 1!" Ender: "Graff's changing the
rules! We can still do this, follow my instructions." Ender's Army: "We
won using a combination of sacrifice and improbable formations that
probably won't foreshadow anything later in the movie at all, hooray!"
Ender: "Everything is awesome!" Bonzo: "I am named after a dog and
therefore hate you, let me beat you up." Ender: "Oh no, I fought back
and hurt him, but he is DEFINITELY still alive. I hate you, Graff,
everything is terrible and I'm running away to Earth!"Although the film as a whole moves quickly, the story itself lurches in
patches of ten minute sequences, followed by jumps to the next patch.
Perhaps due to the nature of the novel, if you take out the internal
narrative and subplots this is what you get, but it seems strange that
on one hand the movie would take such liberties with the source
material, but on the other hand follow the set pieces so slavishly that
it would disrupt the flow of the story.As a sci-fi film in a vacuum, it's competent - for some reason it
reminded me of Stargate, with elements of The Hunger Games - but flawed
in places and has a very uneven and badly edited narrative flow. As an
adaptation of EGTB... it's a bit of a Bugger.
