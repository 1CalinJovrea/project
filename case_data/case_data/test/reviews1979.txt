8/10

Even tho i was expecting more action, I've found myself at the edge of
my seat at times. The characters were nicely developed. The dialogue
was as expected from a Tarantino movie. The story is 3 hours long, it
takes place mostly in a one single room and it's still not boring.
That's something not everyone can do. All of the actors we're perfect
for their roles and the acting was great as well as the character
design, all of the characters were memorable and well written. The
movie is divided into chapters in most of which a small twist takes
place that makes you more interested in the movie. I enjoyed the film
but my biggest flaws were the length and the spontaneous introduction
of a narrator mid- movie, that was a pretty 'out of nowhere' lazy way
to develop the back story, but oh well, Tarantino is known for making
risks and doing crazy sh*t
