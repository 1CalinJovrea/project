Unfairly overlooked little gem

This movie came and went so fast, partly I suspect because we've all
had our fill of reality TV, on TV! At least we seem to wish to avoid it
at the movies. In fact this film is not about reality TV, it's a much
bigger and more engaging piece, a real romance,talent and ambition,
bullying, and the insidious way people support it, depending upon whose
the bully. It's also about drive, hard knocks, mean spiritedness and
redemptive love. Excellent performances from the two leads.. Paul Potts
life really was leading up to X Afactor before X Factor ever
existed...there was always going to be a 'One a Chance'. Highly
recommended.
