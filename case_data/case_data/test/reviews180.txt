Story of Life from a Religious Perspective

Him is the God, the creator! Mother is the mother earth. Mother gives
form and maintains the structure. God first invites Adam (the old man).
Then from Adam's rib God creates Eve. Do you remember the scene in
which Man's rib was wounded and he was throwing up?Adam and Eve break the forbidden crystal (they ate the forbidden
fruit).Then we see the story of Abel and Cane. Cane kills Abel. Then mother's
house, the earth, is populated with various religions and various
ideologies. All of which pray God (or Him). But they become aggressive.
They start to betray the earth. And then the story of Jesus. Mother becomes Mary. It gives birth to
Jesus. But Jesus followers eat him alive. They eat his blood and his
flesh (wine and bread). And the story continues. The way the humanity
is heading, Mother earth is doomed.I liked the symbolism in this movie. But to me, as a semi-Nietzschean
thinker, mother is the real God. For God is not separated from mother.
God is mother's creation. Mother = Earth. I finish with this quote from Nietzsche:"Remain faithful to the (mother) earth, my brothers, with the power of
your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the
meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly
away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal
walls. Alas, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away.
Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I doÂ—back to the
body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human
meaning."
