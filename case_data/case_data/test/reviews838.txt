Drab, soul destroying, rubbish

I really didn't think it could get any worse after Into Darkness. Oh
yes, it did big time. I am not able to review the movie in full as I
turned off after about 1 hour or so. It's not Star Trek - full stop! I
would rather watch Enterprise, that's how bad it is. Please no more,
please!
