Sadly Disappointed

With the release of movie adaptations of classics like Snow White and
Jack and the beanstalk, both of which I was highly entertained and
thought it was simply amazing this movie was a sad let down. Pros: Visually stunning. Angelina Jolie's performance was spot on with
the most evil of classical villains we always knew. Cons: The most beautiful princess Aurora looks like the girl next door.
Why does Hollywood try to do that is beyond me. Mary Jane Watson
(Spidermans love interest) is supposed to be a beautiful actress and a
model. But again the movie portrays a girl next door look in ultimate
Spiderman. Elle Fannig's acting was not strong and in the end not
memorable in the least. It felt like she was there for the sake of
being there.Sharlto Copley acting left a lot to be desired. Was he supposed to
portray a loving farther and husband driven mad or a power hungry king
driven insane by his overwhelming need to destroy the one creature that
he could not bring himself to kill when he had the chance? If he was
supposed to potray caring scenes it never really showed. ______________
______________The King is portrayed as an evil man who begged for his daughters life
and could have easily returned maleficent's wings but instead chose not
to for reasons which are beyond anyones understanding. This is the
start of where the movie just becomes a drag. Maleficent curses the child to die in the original storyline and this
is the most important part in the story because of which the 3rd fairy
who did not bestow a gift alters the curse by making them sleep instead
of death. This part is totally lost in the movie. Watching a bunch of incompetent fairies nearly almost kill a child
before the curse can take effect is as much a mystery as why maleficent
would watch over the child and save it. Why the king would entrust his
child to faeries whom he dislikes is also as much a mystery as why he
would not send a nurse maid to care for his only child. The worst part of the movie is being subjected to watch the Princess
grow to 16 years old and marvel at the beautiful fairies (it feels like
pointless fillers). Also when the princess realizes whats going on one
day before her birthday, the 3 incompetent fairies again forget to
mention about what happened to Maleficents wings. The good fairies were
not incompetent, just funny in the original story and smart enough to
hide away the princess for 16 years. Why they made them look so
incompetent and negligent is beyond me.Once you get over the visuals you will realize its nothing more than a
chick flick geared at young children (visuals) and adults who are
romantically inclined. The most evil Disney villain for over 50 years reduced to nothing more
than a scorned women out to seek revenge for the betrayal. A loving
father reduced to nothing more than a mad evil greed driven man who
plunges himself into insanity with a overwhelming urge to kill
maleficent despite his daughter being returned safe and well. Many times during the movie I found myself thinking about what work I
have the next day or what needs to be done. This is something I have
never experienced when sitting and watching a movie on big screen
completely immersed in the plot. This is a far cry from Snow White and the Huntsman which was really
good barring Kristen Stewart's emo acting (emotionless) drawn from
twilight.
