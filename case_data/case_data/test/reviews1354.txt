Well done but stomach-churning

This is a very gory and bloody film and unless you don't mind watching
these types of films you won't like it. I've not seen the original so I can't compare the two. Elijah Wood is
an actor I like and he is excellent in this as the serial killing
maniac. I found it hard to get into the film but this is one film that
gradually improves as it goes along rather than fades away. Along with the bloody horror there are a number of really tense scenes.
It is the most unsettling film I've seen in a while. Maniac is well
filmed and uses some very interesting filming techniques. I can't say I
enjoyed watching it too much was a bit too sadistic for my taste.
However for it's type this is a very good effort.
