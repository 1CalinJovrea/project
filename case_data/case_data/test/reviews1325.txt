Like an updated Tom Sawyer novel about nothing and everything

14 year old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives with his mum Mary Lee (Sarah
Paulsen) and father "Senior" (Ray Mckinnon) by the River in Arkansas.
Their ramshackle boat house providing easy access to scratch a living
selling fish from the mighty Mississippi.Ellis is free to roam the bye waters in his boat with his friend
"Neckbone" (Jacob Lofland) who lives with his uncle Galen (Michael
Shannon). Galen keeps himself in beer by diving for oysters in the
murky depths, when not loving the ladies to his favourite tunes or
playing the guitar.This is a tough, real life day to day type of existence, well away from
the American lives you normally see on the big screen. It is a change
to see people that are struggling, yet largely content and portrayed as
loving their kids, caring about them as best they can and not turning
to violence at a moments notice.Stumbling across a boat stuck high up in the trees on a deserted
island, the boys believe they have found their perfect hideout. After a
while they realise they are not the first to find the boat.
Notwithstanding all the possible avenues the story could take, horror
or something sinister with the older man interacting with younger boys,
the story takes none of the conventional routes.Meeting "Mud" (McConaughey) we meet a perfectly formed complex
character, conversing in the usual but even more pronounced southern
drawl. Armed with a pistol and a strong independent survival instinct,
he starts to rely or manipulate, dependant on your viewpoint, the boys
to his main aim. Retaining or retrieving the love of his life "Juniper"
(Reece Witherspoon), his sole reason for being is to ensure her safety
away from the forces of evil, that he perceives continue to follow her.To give too much away would spoil the film but fair to say, the story
meanders and forks in the same way the Mississippi, ever present in the
background, continues to do. The delicate friendships and loyalties
that are built and called into question, are all beautifully and
believably portrayed.Tye Sheridan is strong yet vulnerable, experiencing the pitfalls of
young love and the upheavals of his home-life require him to trust
someone, whether he makes the right choices remain to be seen.
McConaughey is well cast and acquits himself well, with a thoughtful
layered performance that goes well beyond the stereotypes you might
expect. There is a sense of loss through the movie but it is never
clear what has been left behind, the ending in particular is
sensitively handled. Witherspoon does not get much screen-time but
makes the most of the scenes she has, portraying a character one step
up from trailer trash. However she remains a constant contradiction of
smarts and foolishness wrapped within a superficially simple yet
complicated persona.Matthew McConaughey has recently rescued himself from recent Rom Com
hell with a string of good performances in films that actually matter,
his recent collaboration with Scorsese in "Wolf of Wall Street" is a
good example. It is good to see his career resurrection and start to
get noticed again for his obvious acting ability. Director and writer
Jeff Nichol has coaxed excellent performances especially from his young
cast, whilst placing them in a believable world of which most audiences
have no previous experience Complaints, the character played by Sam
Shephard feels more like a plot convenience than reality and arguably
Sheridan makes it hard for his co-star to shine when his performance is
so strong and front and centre.Summary A hugely enjoyable film that perhaps defies comparisons and convention.
With a story that has time to grow and confound, there are many
pleasures to be had.Like an updated Tom Sawyer novel about nothing and everything, this
comes highly recommended.
