Puts the S in Stupid......

I'm not quite sure why Xander Cage returned, I just wish he hadn't. This movie is so low brow, you might mistake it for a caterpillar. It's
devoid of anything that looks like a plot or decent character
development. Instead its cheesy show off time with lots of tat's, juvenile bravado,
sparkly overstated jewelry and guns from "da hood". This is a film that
feels, in my opinion, like it was made by a 15 year old nick-named
"flipper" (as in hamburger flipper) and his gormless, pimply friends.
We all know thats not true but you get the idea.In short a genuinely excruciating experience that puts the S in
Stupid.....one out of ten from me.
