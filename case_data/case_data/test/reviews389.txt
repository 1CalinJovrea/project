Hotel Transylvania 2 (some spoiler ahead)

Today myself,mom and my younger brother were lucky to have seen the
preview of this movie before its worldwide release on Friday 16th of
October. Hotel Transylvania 2 is the sequel and follow up to the 2012
film of the same name where Dracula this time has made his hotel a
welcoming place for humans to stay at. This time around and Mavis and
Johnny(voiced by Selena Gomez from Wizards Of Waverly Place and Andy
Samberg from That's My Boy)are now married and have a son called
Dennis. But Dracula(voiced by Adam Sandler)is happy that Dennis is a
human and doesn't care who he is as long as Mavis and Johnny have a
healthy boy. Meanwhile Mavis and Johnny take a trip to California for a
few days without Dennis and of course this causes some problems along
the way as Dracula and his crew are desperate to make Dennis a vampire.
So is Dennis a vampire waiting to get his fangs or is he a normal
little boy like his father Johnny?Good: The animation in this is just as good as the original film its
dark and slightly colourful at the same time. The humor is very good as
well as the voice acting and Adam Sandler for me is better at doing
voice over work now than his live action films which are how shall I
put it boring and crap. So if I were Sandler i'd stick to animation for
now on. As for the rest they are all good too. Also I like how the guy
that voices the mummy sounds exactly like Cee-Lo Green(as he wasn't
available to do the sequel). The music is good as Fifth Harmony's Worth
It and the title song I'm In Love With A Monster are great songs but I
do prefer Becky G's Monster remix a bit better though to be honest with
ya.Bad: Is it me or does this movie feel like a parody of Twilight human
falling for a vampire,human has a child who maybe a vampire or not etc.
But still though this was very funny and I was glad to have seen this
film today.7/10Very good for the kiddies and for those who are die-had fans of horror
films(I don't like horror films but surprise surprise I liked this one.Also legendary voice over actor Mel Brooks is in this as Dracula's dad
Vlad and of course Dana Carvey from that god awful film Master Of
Disguise makes a cameo as Dana the co-coordinator for the vampire camp.
