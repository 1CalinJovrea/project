Cliché after cliché after cliché....

This movie COULD HAVE BEEN nice, interesting and exciting... but the
endless amount of clichés and plot holes just absolutely ruined it for
me...Not only did it contain quite a couple of unbelievable plot-holes (so
the driver/hit-man just got killed and nobody noticed?), but the most
annoying thing was definitely the endless number of clichés and
"deja-vus" in this film.... as if the director really tried to just
copy/paste all the standards from the genre....* Russian bad guys with heavy Russian accents * Russians = vodka and
hookers ? * The tech-savvy Asian FBI computer geek in the van with the
headphones on ? really ? * Computer Screens with lots of code on to
"make it look complicated" * Top secret files and top secret passwords
which after all are not that hard to find (the guy just called his boss
and got the password ?) * and seriously... no-one types THAT FAST * not
even to mention the final scene, which was just soooooo over the top :(There were just that many that i can't even think of them all ! and it
really ruined the film for me !Also, as another reviewer on this board mentioned, the trailer made
this film look much more "interesting" and "twisted" than it really is
! The trailer, with the tag-line "trust no one", makes it seems like
this would be a real web of double-crossing, spying, intrigues, etc...However, in the end, the good guys are good and the bad guys are
bad....This is just another, typical, predictable, cliché-ridden movie....
