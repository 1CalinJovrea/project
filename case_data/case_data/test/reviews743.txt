Great scenes with beautiful characters

I certainly blinked when I found out this movie was 3 hours long,
especially considering that it won the Palm d'Or where many winners
have a slow and painful plot. This movie on the other hand does a great
job keeping every scene riveting through great dialog and riveting
emotions. I would compare many of the scenes in this movie to Tarantino
scenes where scenes take on a life of their own. Cleverness and
awkwardness were dispersed in a way to make it seem real and ultimately
human. I felt wonderfully disappointed when certain scenes ended. The
actresses held nothing back in their body language and added much to
the moment-to-moment importance of their character development.
