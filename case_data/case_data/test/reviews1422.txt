Dark and violent look at Dublin's drug underworld

Be under no illusion, this is a really gritty, in your face, warts and
all movie about drugs, drug dealing and the people involved.It is set in Darndale, a somewhat socially problematic suburb of
Dublin, Ireland. The movie highlights the social lifestyle and
difficulties experienced by some of the characters and it charts their
story from childhood to present day.The opening scene and introduction to the characters is a fantastic
opening to this movie as it shows the viewer the beauty and innocence
of childhood friendships. It is a very clever and strong way to
establish a relationship between the audience and the characters from
the outset, a connection that you share until the very end.The movie has a balance between experienced professional actors and new
talent and they blend well and offer a sense of realism to their roles. This a dark movie with real and believable insight in to how
circumstances can lead people to make life changing decisions, for
better or for worse? It is most definitely a 'no holds barred'
depiction of how lives can change in an instant, where there is no
rewind button. The stark language is a realistic endorsement of what
life is like growing up in a housing estate such as Darndale, and it
gives the movie a true sense of credibility. The violence in the movie reflects the lifestyle choices that you face
when you buy into the drug dealing world where reputations and respect
come with a price tag. Where you may question or challenge someone's
reputation, be prepared to pay a high price. This is a movie that is worth seeing for sure and just allow yourself
to immerse into the lives of the characters from the outset and travel
with them on the journey through the story.
