Outstanding thriller

Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought
is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a
movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for
the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to
provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you
interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes
i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with
this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very
good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when
it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions
in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some
viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry
right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding
cast.
