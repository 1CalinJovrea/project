Unexpected... Bravo!

Going to watch a movie with Owen Wilson starring, you usually expect
some kind of comedy or romance. Not this time. I was really worried
that he would not be up to the task with this one, but this was not
true, not true at all!The movie was fascinating, completely plausible, filled with amazing
scenes that keep you at the edge of your seat. The things that this
family goes through were unimaginable but very well executed during
filming. Owen was that good that you could actually empathize with his suffering
and anxiety and put yourself in his position struggling for his family.
Pierce Brosnan was AMAZING! Just the right amount, just as much as
needed, to complement a really thrilling movie!Recommended for sure! Can't wait to see more stuff like that from Owen
Wilson!
