Entertaining Yet Uninspired.

Gold is, by far, the oddest film of the Oscar season. It's not good
enough to be featured with some other award-based films yet it is far
from being a bad film. It's just a very uninspired piece of filmmaking
that had an excellent script and a great cast to it, yet no flavor to
the filmmaking here. It is a standardized piece that serves as a
lackluster love letter to Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell without
ever really admitting it. Majority of this film is spent watching
McCounaughey's Kenny Wells as he maneuvers through businessmen that
want him to be put down, political groups that want to steal his
fortune and friends he can barely trust. It sounds like an amazing film
and it could have been had Gaghan not directed this film himself. Every
frame that passes, it feels like Gaghan was either worried about
feeling too much like Scorsese or worried that it wasn't enough like
Scorsese. Either way, we know where his influences lie here. Honestly,
you're better off watching The Wolf of Wall Street, if you're hoping
for something like that.Stephen Gaghan is a very talented writer, he's given us very layered
stories with very interesting characters but this particular topic
feels like it went over his head. It is never engaging enough to
sustain lasting power. McConaughey and the rest of the cast do a fine
job, nothing outstanding but fine nonetheless. This was probably the
most disappointing part of this film. Over the past 5 years, Matthew
McConaughey has given us more than enough reason to love his
performances. They're layered, they're relate-able and, most of all,
they're acted to perfection. This performance, in which he trades in
his slim physique for a bloated, overweight and balding man. Right off
the bat, this may have been a physically demanding role for McConaughey
and he does put his all into his performance but it still doesn't match
the caliber of his previous performances. His dedication is clear but
it still didn't feel like the great performance we thought he could
give in this film which comes back to the issue of Gaghan's direction.Overall, Gold is far from a bad movie. There are cool scenes in it that
are bound to interest you even if it's for a little bit. But this is a
film that comes down to a problem with the director. Gaghan, while
being a very talented writer, has a hard time determining his own
vision for a film that had many chances to be great but failed to
really capitalize on any of its strengths. By the end of the film, you
won't feel cheated out of your ticket money but I'm sure you won't feel
all that good about it either.
