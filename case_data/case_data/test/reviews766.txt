Worst Movie I've Ever Seen

This review contains spoilers.This was absolutely the worst move I have ever seen. I chuckled two
times in the entire movie and my girlfriend giggled MAYBE once. I
laughed my arse off at East Bound and Down seasons 1 & 2. This movie is
on par/slightly higher on profanity and vulgarity but FAR lower on
comedy. This pile of sacrilegious garbage almost had my girlfriend and
me leave (a first and we've seen some horrible films). In fact, if it
weren't for the other people in the row we would have left. And on that
same thought, of all 12 people in the theater 2 other people DID walk
out.This movie can be summed up as horrible CGI, a bunch of drugs, a bunch
of penises, and no humor. I wish I didn't waste 2 hours and $20 on this
garbage. I pity the human race if people seriously think this movie is
an 8 (the rating at the time of this review).1/10 is generous.
