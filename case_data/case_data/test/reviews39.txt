Pure Tim Burton

Tim Burton hasn't been making any of his original ideas since 2005. His
recent films are adaptations that most of them are not outstanding nor
creative like his own stories. Tim Burton's returns to his original
roots with this. Frankenweenie is based on a short he made decades ago.
He remade it into a full length animated feature film with sheer
campiness. It's great when it goes there but when it tries to be
emotional, it works in a short while but it is more interested to its
craziness and the storyline doesn't know where to go. The director may
return to his style but he still has his old flaws.The concept is fascinating. It sounds like it's going to be a
heartwarming family fun film. It obviously tries to capture the old
horror movies with black and white. Most of the characters are based on
iconic horror movie characters. Tim Burton is always highly imaginative
but somehow he's lacking something. In family films, he creates a
charming innovation but he couldn't bring enough depth to it. There are
things that could have been interesting. This is about a kid who brings
his beloved pet back to life. There could have been more genuine
cherishing moments of Victor and resurrected Sparky. There are times
like that but it immediately skims to the comedy. The storyline doesn't
quite know what to do until it hits to the big climax.The voice performances were good. Martin Landau's is probably the best
among them who gratifies and delights his character with his campy
accent that reminds you of his role in Ed Wood. The stop-motion
animation is simply majestic. The black and white effect makes it a lot
more fascinating. The character and monster designs are magnificent.
It's wonderful enough as a Tim Burton animated film.Frankenweenie suffers with the same problem of Edward Scissorhands.
Don't get me wrong, Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful film but there
is a little depth to its concept and serves an awkward climax leads to
an underdeveloped romance. At least there's an endearing performance by
Johnny Depp. Frankenweenie is fun but it's kind of empty in the end.
It's not bad, it just could have been better. The darkness of the film
could have been something affecting instead of an impaled cat. The sad
parts seem contrived for the idea's sake. The film messes around the
rest of the runtime. I guess the throwbacks and the filmmaking are the
only merits of the film. Fans of Tim Burton's dark and crazy vision
would enjoy. Since we don't see a lot of stop-motion animation these
days, I guess that what makes this appealing. To think about the story,
still not satisfying.
