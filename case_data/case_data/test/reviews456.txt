Come on! I just don't believe those ugly reviews

Well, hi everybody. This is my first time on this side. I always read
some reviews before watching the movie I picked. I'm a huge fan of
horror and comedy. I'm totally a movie freak.What's the whole deal about this movie? I couldn't stop laughing. That
humor salad was well served!These days its hard to have a good laugh on films, like Bad Moms. It is
a comedy! Free the tense. If you didn't, at least a little smile on
that supermarket scene you are cold! Katheryn hahn is the best!!!!ðŸŽ‚Overall, this is a very enjoyable flick. With very different touches of
humor.
