A Romance that does not feel very romantic

I was underwhelmed by Safe Haven, mostly because I cared little about
the characters for most of the film--except for the little girl, Lexie,
who was the high point of the film.I was going to rate it a 6 until the bogus ending, for which I am
deducting 2 points.The acting, overall, is okay. Still it is not convincing. The story is,
I think, the film's weakness. Besides the fact it did not endear the
characters to me, I felt that the actions of the characters were not
true to life, making their personality traits contradictory. Also, I
feel the story development was too slow.Finally, the beginning of the film and the end of the film feel like
they were slapped together from two different movies. For a better
first part, see almost any romantic drama. For a better second half,
see Cape Fear starring Robert Mitchum.
