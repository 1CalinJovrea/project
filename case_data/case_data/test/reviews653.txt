Mindless VFX, dull acting and no screenplay and story

Been cursing myself to have watched such mindless video game movie.Deepika Padukone is completely misfit and she looks awkward for most of
the screen time. Vin Diesel should stick to Fast and Furious franchise,
2002 XXX was much better. Rest of the star cast is assembled to just
please the producers "Shanghai Movies".There is no story, no screenplay, improper acting, it seems like
director has wasted his most of the time in VFX labs than on actual
story and screenplay.Disgraceful start to 2017, if you want to watch mindless graphical
action, better play video game. Disappointed to the core, save your
time, money and if you still want to see then be ready to curse
yourself...backed by big production house, critics and fake reviews
will start floating soon appreciating the movie, beware.
