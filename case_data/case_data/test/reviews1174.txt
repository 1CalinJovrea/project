LOVED this movie!!

I watched this movie on Memorial Day, and was reminded all over again
that freedom isn't free. So if you are a past or present member of any
branch of the US Armed Forces, or if your loved one has paid the
ultimate sacrifice with their life, fighting for our freedom, please
accept my heartfelt thanks.I LOVED this movie. Everyone did an excellent job with their character
 especially with Logan. So much feeling and emotion in his expression
and actions, even when no words were needed. I felt like I could see
into his very soul. I saw a young man who still can hardly grasp the
fact that he has survived 3 tours of war in the middle east, when many
of his comrades didn't come home. You can sense the depth of emotion
and turmoil, and can easily understand why it was often hard to just
find words to express himself. You can see the military training and
discipline, the steel resolve to control his reactions, even when
harassed by the town bully/ex-husband. There's also loyalty, concern
for others, tenderness, selflessness, willingness to work hard  he's
the man of every woman's dream! It's easy to see that Beth is a survivor of an extremely abusive
marriage. Even though she's now divorced, she's still not free from the
abusive and controlling ex-husband. She's very careful in how she
responds or endures his abusive threats, in order to keep him from
going into a greater rage and I cheered for her when she finally found
the courage to speak up and take control of her own destiny. Keith, the ex-husband, is easy to despise, for his hateful, snarly,
manipulating character and yet in the end we saw a little glimpse of
good in his soul as well a little glimpse of what he might have been
if he'd only been willing to humble himself and get help much earlier. I loved the happy ending, I loved the story, and I very much
appreciated that the producers kept it clean. I can't wait for the DVD
 this is a keeper!!
