Bitter-sweet, emotional and absolutely delightful

The thought of a biopic that charts the touching story of the creation
of a children's tale that has meant so much to so many over the years
instantly makes me think of Finding Neverland, a sweet film I'm very
fond of. In many ways, Goodbye Christopher Robin is very similar 
bitter-sweet, heart-warming, full of nostalgia; you could easily swap
Johnny Depp for Domhnall Gleeson and Kate Winslet for Margot Robbie
(although the characters differ greatly). Although this story behind
Winnie the Pooh doesn't contain quite the same childish magic and glee
that the story behind Peter Pan gave us, it's still a delightful,
emotional story told in a joyful, touching way.The film as a whole addresses several themes and it's really a bit of a
mishmash  it's not just about the creation of the Winnie the Pooh
books; it's about the impact of war, the troubles with early 20th
century parenting, tricky father-son relationships, the joy and
innocence of childhood, and the pain and price of fame. This all works
as both a strength and a weakness of the film; in many ways it's
wonderful to have such a wealth of topics and the variety keeps things
fresh and interesting. On the other hand, some themes aren't fully
explored to the extent they could be and it feels as though it's
missing something occasionally. It never really focuses on one theme
and so does tend to meander around all these topics, telling a vague
story; at times it seems to be more a series of scenes with just a
semblance of story. Of course this is because the story itself is
fairly simple, so it's nice that they enriched the plot with so many
themes; it just feels as though it could have benefited from a little
more detail.Nevertheless it's a film that's a joy to watch and brings with it a
load of emotions  sniffles and tears seemed to permeate the cinema.
This is down to a couple of things; firstly the characters and the
story they go through together; but more than that all the references
(some obvious, some subtle) to Winnie the Pooh and the rest of Milne's
work. From small quotations and images, to creating a little wooden hut
to house one of Billy's toys, there are plenty of nods to Winnie the
Pooh and these can't fail to bring a nostalgic tear to anyone and
awaken fond childhood memories. The childhood especially is heavily
romanticised and anyone can identify with Billy Moon in some way,
bringing to mind all the happiness and innocence we experienced as
children. This is all complimented by beautiful cinematography, making
the wilds of Ashdown Forest seem absolutely stunning and really
strengthening the magical quality of childhood and its inexhaustible
supply of imagination and charm. In fact it's this middle section where
the world of Winnie the Pooh is created that is the strongest part.There aren't a great many characters in this film, making it all seem
more intimate, allowing us to grow attached to the characters  though
at times this can be challenging. As excellent as Gleeson is, it can be
sometimes difficult to understand and empathise with him as his
character is so stiff and reserved; still Gleeson gives us a wonderful
contrast to this and how time with his son helps him to loosen up and
re-discover his 'inner child'. Margot Robbie's Daphne comes across as a
missed opportunity. Stunning and beautiful as always, it's hard to
imagine Robbie playing a detestable character, but this she manages to
do and do well. It's just the writing doesn't really seem to do her
credit as we aren't given a real insight into her character. Kelly
Macdonald and Will Tilston do shine though. Macdonald's Olive grounds
the film as the friendliest, least complex adult character and Tilston
exceeds all expectations you would have from a nine year old in their
first ever acting role. Sheer innocence and childishness emanates
effortlessly from his big eyes and little movements. He really is the
heart of the film and fortunately they make the most of him. Sadly
every boy has to grow up, but Billy Moon's 18 year old self played by
Alex Lawther fills the shoes of his younger counterpart well, giving us
the necessary angst and emotion needed.Perhaps not quite the early Oscar contender I hoped for and it lacks
some of the magic that I loved in similar film Finding Neverland.
However, this is still a great film, dripping with emotion, nostalgia
and a romantic view of childhood; exploring a wealth of themes and with
some excellent performances (particularly from the titular Christopher
Robin) and affectionate references to a childhood classic, Goodbye
Christopher Robin is a lovely, bittersweet film for the whole family.
Bring the tissues  this one's going to move you.
