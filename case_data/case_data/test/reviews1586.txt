I had more fun watching paint dry

I want 2 hours of my life back! It was tedious, linear, uneventful,
predictable, and dialogues often scrambled. This is not the worst film
I ever saw, but I've seen lots of films, and this episode is perhaps
the 4th worst ever. From top of my head I can name a few more bearable
things. Say, IRS. I mentioned drying paint before. Even hangover can be
more fun. Or toothache. Walking the streets alone, minding my own
business is immensely more fun. To spare myself from future torture,
I'll make sure to check the IMDb comments first, sorting them by the
"hated it" criterion. Why suffer? I just hope my comment will save at
least one person from suffering.
