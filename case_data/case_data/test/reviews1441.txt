The reviews does this movie no justice. it doesn't have to be the old story with no creativity.

I believe this movie would have been a master piece of a series due to 

the huge amount of event packed into 2 hours, but this is no criticism 

on how great the movie is and how the numbers of this site doesn't do 

it justice. 90% of the negative reviews comes under the lame excuse of 

"that's not how king Arthur is supposed to be". If you actually want a 

movie where you know everything already starting from the story, 

characters and twists then I'd call you the stupidest ever. Yes this 

isn't your typical king Arthur movie, and that adds even more to the 

awesomeness of it.amnt saying the movie is flawless, no movie is, but 

it was great starting from acting, animation, story, music tracks, 

everything. Again would have been better off it was a series and I 

hope there would be a sequel including the knights of the round table, 

sure Lancelot and some dramatic betrayal or even Arthur's betrayal 

himself to the kingdom.
