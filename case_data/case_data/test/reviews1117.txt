What exactly do these characters plan to do when the tide is low or bluntly, when they're too old to be running around a beach together?

The characters in Adoration (previously called Adore and Two Mothers at
various film festivals), belong in their own isolated little world that
is self-absorbed, irresponsible and one that I had little interest
visiting. French director Anne Fontaine (Coco Before Chanel) and
British screenwriter Christopher Hampton (Atonement) come to the
conclusion that some people are afraid of growing old and would prefer
to spend their days with those who are much younger. They abandon their
social responsibilities and families, so they can play together at the
beach. This is a film that seems divorced from any moral sensibilities.
In the film's production notes it says that the unjudging hand of its
filmmaker was deliberate. This film needed serious judgment: someone to
rewrite the underwritten draft of the script and to have a firmer
opinion on these terribly unappealing characters. Christopher Hampton's script, adapting from Doris Lessing's novel The
Grandmothers, lacks plausible psychology and context for the film's two
female characters and their love circle. Naomi Watts plays Lil, who is
recently widowed because her husband died in a car accident. She lives
by the beach, next door to her childhood friend Roz (Robin Wright), and
they lazily watch their two sons Ian (Xavier Samuel) and Tom (Animal
Kingdom's James Frecheville) catch the waves. Roz's husband is Harold
(Ben Mendelsohn), who is concerned that she spends more time with her
best friend than with him. He wants her to move with him to the city
because he's accepted a job as a teacher. The two boys have few
prospects besides surfing, so Harold encourages Tom to become involved
with a stage play. The only distinguishable traits of Lil and Roz are that they are two
Peter Pan figures, living an impossibly sheltered inner life. Roz works
at an art gallery (rarely seen) and Lil's inner life involves a yacht
company, where she is pursued by Saul (Gary Sweet), who she finds
boring. The film's romance isn't between the two women, they assure us
they aren't lesbians, but between themselves and each other's sons.
They romance the two boys because they're both resisting adult lives.
They reject future prospects with two older, more stable men because
they want to remain young and free (shallow). What is sympathetic or
attractive about that? It's not that this is creepy, though some might
think so, but that the relationship grows increasingly unrealistic,
selfish and short-sighted. It fails to make you understand the mental
attraction, particularly from the boy's side, besides the physicality
and the casualness of it, as one of the women describes it. Why would
these young, funky surfer dudes be interested in sharing their intimate
social lives with their mothers?One of the other fatal narrative choices made by Hampton is that after
initiating the romance, the film decides to fast forward two years into
the future. This dilutes potential conflict and reactions to the
relationships from the older characters like Harold. Fast forwarding
also reveals the limitations of the story's driving motor. The original
source material is composed of four short stories and like a lot of
films attempting to expand limited material it feels overstretched as a
full length feature. The love circle aside, there are actually very few
risks taken with the dramatic beats of the story. They seem predictable
to everyone except the leads. Tom starts spending time with Mary
(Jessica Tovey), a girl from the play he's working on. This makes Lil
feel old and worried he's not interested in her anymore. Why does it
surprise her that a young man would find someone closer to his own age?
The awkward time shift also means that a pivotal side character, Sophie
Lowe's Hannah, is belatedly introduced and is underwritten, with no
backstory or personal geography. The performances from some normally reliable talents do little to
strengthen our sympathy and help us understand the characters. Naomi
Watts and Robin Wright smoke, giggle and drink a lot but also come
across as a pair of juvenile airhead teenagers. Is this intentional?
Both Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville are given terribly
uninteresting and inexpressive roles, spending most of the film surfing
and being underserviced by flat dialogue. "I love her", says Ian with
laughable, deadening seriousness after his first encounter with Roz.
Behind the camera, Fontaine's only stylistic choices are the attractive
wide framing of a consistently deserted beach, and contrasting these
shots with a tighter lens in the household. This is an obvious contrast
between the freedom of the beach and the adult life. The film is
interminably long, poorly paced, and concludes with an ending that is
frustratingly detached from comprehensible human behaviour and personal
responsibility. What exactly do these characters plan to do when the
tide is low or bluntly, when they're too old to be running around a
beach together?
