Not only a failure as a remake, but fails on its own.

It would've been fine that RedoCop abandoned the themes of RoboCop, but
it didn't even get its own themes right.First, there's Sam Jackson's O'Reilly-esque character who constantly
defends the use of robots overseas. The real problem with American
media is that it tries to avoid controversial subjects like drone
strikes altogether.Secondly, there's the robots' use against foreign civilians. Rather
than show Americans the real consequences of drones, like innocent and
unarmed women and children being shredded and mutilated, the robots
shoot suicide bombers, and even the boy we're supposed to feel sympathy
for is trying to attack them with a knife.Third, the stand-ins for drones are actual robots. The most heinous
thing about drones is that the trigger is pulled by real humans, and
the targets are decided by our leaders with often little information
about what they're attacking.Fourth, there's the dehumanization of Murphy. He isn't a dead man
brought back as an inhuman monster like the original; he's a burn
victim benefiting from already-existing cybernetic prosthetics who
transforms with a whirl of the camera and some Sinatra. There's no
"lose the arm" moment here. Even as we find out that Murphy has been
sapped of his free will, Murphy is mowing down CGI robots to rock music
like a superhero. There's no real moment when Murphy turns into
RoboCop. He's normal at the beginning and just kind of fades into
RoboCop mode inexplicably, then fades out again just as inexplicably
later on.Fifth, the drones are supposed to come home, but they don't. RoboCop
only attacks two criminals before going on the revenge spree we want
him to. Detroit is hardly oppressed by his presence.Finally, Omnicorp builds RoboCop to get around the law that prevents
robots from being used on American soil, and spend a lot of money doing
so, yet they continue to focus on getting the law repealed. Not only
that, but they actually sway public opinion and get the law repealed in
spite of the fact that they promoted RoboCop as a human operator and
not a robot. Omnicorp furthermore seems preoccupied with making RoboCop
popular with the public and as efficient as a robot, but why? Their
target market for RoboCop is governmental. It's like Dick Jones said:
"Renovation program! Spare parts for 25 years! Who cares if it worked
or not?"RedoCop gets much worse when compared to the original film. The
original RoboCop looks like a gleaming weapon, but the new one looks
like he's wearing a black rubber suit. The Omnicorp of the original is
an imposing megacorporation filled with nothing but cut-throat suits,
whereas the face of the new Omnicorp is the avuncular and likable Gary
Oldman, and leader Michael Keaton, who doesn't wear a suit at all. The
dark humor is completely gone from this remake, and there isn't a
single memorable line. There's almost no profanity or blood for this
thoroughly PG-13 remake, either, and RoboCop doesn't start patrolling
the streets until an hour in.There are only two good things about this movie. It tries to establish
a relationship between Murphy and his wife (and fails, giving us only
two scenes of generic wife-love before he's RoboCopped, and one after,
before she spends the rest of the film whining and crying). The other
is a scene where we see what's left of Murphy with his robot body
removed. He's a head, lungs, and without reason, a dangling hand. Yes,
a hand and no arm or shoulder. It's the best scene of the movie, but
like every scene, just shows how poorly thought out RedoCop is.Overall, RedoCop is a boring and idiotic CGI explodefest meant for
children. Take that $13 of ticket money and spend it on the unrated
director's cut of the original instead. You'll get far more enjoyment.
