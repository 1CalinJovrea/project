An Acid Trip from Heaven

Underrated. That's the first word that springs to my mind when I think
of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest mystery cum comedy epic masterpiece.
There are many adjectives to describe 'Inherent Vice'; tragic,
hilarious, enticing, sexual and magnificent. Yet they do not do the
film justice. This is one to watch on the big screen for sure in all
its colourful glory.We are drawn into the film from the off, and are transported to the
groovy seventies where everyone is either tripping out or making love.
Joaquin Phoenix plays the eccentric Doc a private investigator and part
time pot head. His ex-lover Shasta Fey Hepworth played by Katherine
Waterstone with sexiness and charm asks him for a favour, he must
investigate the eluding Mickey Wolfmann. What follows is a cascade of
confusing, illuminating and ultimately wondrous scenes, all of which
make up a grand whole.Phoenix undoubtedly gives us a performance like no other. He is always
fun to watch and lights up the screen whenever he appears. From the way
his character moves to how he interacts with others he bedazzles us and
effortlessly. It's almost as if this is an actual person, the way he
embodies his characters innate quirkiness.You may be curious as to whether the supporting players are noteworthy
and they all are. From the brutish Josh Brolin playing a police cop to
the stoned laid back Jena Malone all of them bring something together.
They make this fascinating tale fell real and grounded which is
exceptional given that the further the film unravels the more the
audience begins to feel that they are high. If I was to just talk about
other characters then my review would be never ending Â– they are that
well realised.Now, many have taken issue with the films storyline. The further that
Doc embarks on his quest the more confusing all the plot points become.
But Paul Thomas Anderson is aware of this fact and he takes it into
consideration. Later in the film we see Doc filling out a white board
with all the separate names and connections. He stares at it in
bewilderment, just like the audience trying to explain the plot to a
friend. But do not fear this mind boggling plot has a purpose. You can
never second guess the film and it always keeps you on your toes.
Surely this is the essence of cinema? Everyone that worked on the film
must have realised that they have crafted something that will be talked
about for years, scratch that decades to come. It is very close to
other hardboiled detective stories like 'The Big Sleep', but this is
deliriously entertaining for audience members of practically any age
from teenagers to adults. It also means that to re-watch the film is to
gain further understanding of it. The fact that this film is in a haze
of smoke only adds to its grand scale.For a film just shy of 150 minutes it never feels bloated or
unnecessary, all of the scenes lead to somewhere. Whether that be one
of the funniest scenes in the film. As Doc remarks to one guy 'Does
that man have a swastika on his head'? To which he replies 'It isn't.
It is an ancient Hindu symbol meaning that all is well'. I do not
remember laughing this much for a long time.For fans of Paul Thomas Anderson it will come as no surprise that the
film looks awesome. Whether that be the neon glow of green from signs
or the over saturated orange faces, the colours leap off of the screen.
Dare I say it gave me joyous celebration enough to feel like a six year
old who had just been handed crayons and a drawing pad. Just like 'A
Most Violent Year' perfectly captured the dark look of the eighties,
'Inherent Vice' translates the seventies to the screen with mesmerizing
results. If only I had a time machine.The soundtrack only adds to the sense of fun which the screen offers by
the barrel load. Almost anyone anywhere in need of a good time and high
entertainment value would be a fool to miss 'Inherent Vice'.Paul Thomas Anderson has woven a seamless, energetic if not entirely
understandable film into a masterwork of art and beauty. Even if we are
confused at least it gives us more reason to come back to the film time
and time again why should we not be thankful? The screen shines
brightest with Phoenix at the helm, supporting characters and even
Reese Witherspoon are true acting talent to be reckoned with and the
cinematography will leave you drooling for more. It has to be said that
this is the most stunning film I have seen from the twenty first
century. The script is witty and devoted with loving care, the music
turns the cinema into a disco and most importantly the film always
intrigues and never ever thinks of the audience as dumb. If you do not
have the time of your life with 'Inherent Vice' then you may have to
reconsider whether you have had any fun in your life at all.
