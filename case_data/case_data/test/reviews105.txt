Awfully boring action flick that features more talent than it deserves.

The Gunman is the epitome of wasting talent. It has Sean Penn in a Liam
Neeson-type veteran badass role with Javier Bardem and Idris Elba as
supporting characters, which sounds great. The problem is the script is
an absolute disaster, and the movie gets worse and worse as it goes on.
It's just so boring. The story is Sean Penn's character and some other
guys get together for a contract killing or something like that, then
years later people from the job start getting killed off and Penn has
to figure out what's going on. First of all, there's only a handful of shootouts in this movie. You'd
think there'd be more of a focus on guns because of the title, but it
really is just another generic action movie with a stupid love triangle
and horrible dialogue. And even when there is an action sequence it's
just like, whatever, nothing I haven't seen before. Why in the world
Idris Elba is in this movie is beyond me. He doesn't show up for over
an hour into the thing and has maybe five minutes of total screen time.
Javier Bardem is completely wasted coming off of a magnetic performance
in Skyfall. And Sean Penn is really ripped. That's probably the biggest
takeaway you'll get from this movie.The Gunman is complete garbage and no one should ever be subjected to
watching this. It gets a 3 for potential and even that's being
generous.
