I created a profile just to warn you to not see this

***May contain spoilers***If you watched Before Sunrise and Before Sunset and you liked them, run
from this movie before you hit play. Yes, it is being rated well, why?
Because people think oh this is like a *real life* horrible
relationship - that makes it amazing. The two spend the entire movie
arguing. Celine spends literally the whole movie marginalizing
everything that Jesse thinks and feels.She is not only bitter the whole time but she is outright rude,
insensitive and cruel in some parts. Straight cruel. All the while,
Jesse continuously tries to please her and compliment her. It's
sickening. Celine's role in this film makes me downright angry. She
just invents reasons to be mad and you spend an entire movie listening
to a crazy, jealous, bitter old woman.I cannot summarize enough my complete and utter disappointment in this
installment of the series.
