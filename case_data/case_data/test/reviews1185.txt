Yeah I'm Thinking He's Back

Keanu Reeve is John Wick. He's a deadly and unstoppable hit-man, and it
shows. "John Wick" is short and to the point, but so much fun. At 1
hour and 36 minutes running time, there is never a dull moment in what
may be one of the best action films of the year. The film starts off quickly and never stops. It doesn't spend too much
time on the backstory or development of Wick's life, yet it still
succeeds so well in building up his character. Within the first 20
minutes, John Wick is called out of retirement when three robbers break
into his home, steal his car, and kill his dog. Even before the action
begins though, the film builds up so much suspense and gravity into who
this "John Wick" is, resulting in a satisfying and exhilarating moment
when his enemies realize he's back in the game. While the plot may be simple and straightforward, it works sufficiently
in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen -
stylized and awesome fight sequences where John Wick goes through
dozens and dozens of kills. Seeing this in digital IMAX really helped
boost the mood of the film; the intense sound design and visuals, the
slick fighting and choreography on screen. There's this one scene in
the film where John Wick assaults his way through a club, and all those
elements combined make it an absolutely incredible sequence to witness. Besides John Wick and his fighting, the film does set up a very
interesting world, thanks to all the other little details and
characters it brings in. There is an organized system of those on the
other side of the law, operating and exchanging "gold coins" while
staying at bases such as "The Continental" hotel; this definitely
allows room for sequels and spin-offs. Still, Keanu Reeves is the star of the show, and this is the best I
have seen him in quite awhile. Again, the story is straightforward and
audiences know what emotional journey to expect, but Keanu displays a
good amount of range in his portrayal of Wick that is still nice to
see. Just like his character states, I'm thinking he's back. "John
Wick" is an awesome and enjoyable action flick that I would recommend.
RATING: [8/10]
