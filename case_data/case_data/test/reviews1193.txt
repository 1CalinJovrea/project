Ronald Bond

This movie is somewhat watchable if you manage to convince yourself
that the hero is Ronald Bond, brother of the more famous and successful
James Bond. Ronald of course, unlike his brother, is not the suave
charmer and rascal type, but has more of a polish wrestler look and
demeanor. This makes for some light comedy when Ronald is shown to be
one of the few men that can't look smart and elegant wearing a suit,
which incidentally only make him look more silly and distinctly out of
place. Ronald also has to rely on fools luck more than skill and
intelligence to save his ill conceived ways of handling things. At the
start of the movie for instance, he manages to raze two entire blocks
of houses whilst trying to perform the simple task of taking out a bad
guy with a snipers rifle. Not only that, but he also manages to miss
the intended target.He then proceeds to chase said villain into a helicopter that takes off
and flies around over a huge crowd of people. Unlike his brother James,
who would simply have disposed of the bad guy and then asked the pilot
to land at some convenient location, Ronald finds it a good idea to
also try and take out the pilot at the same time although should he
succeed, the heli would undoubtedly crash into the crowd. Fools luck
saves him this time though.We get another show of his ineptness later on when he escapes out of a
window. Since the bad guys chasing him would have no option but to
follow him the same route, his brother would undoubtedly just turned
around, wait for them to exit and them pick them off one by one with
his Beretta. Ronald here of course just continues running and tries to
speed off in his car resulting in a car chase. Fortunately someone must
have called in a bomb threat because the city, Rome, is almost
completely devoid of people. I know this, because I have been in Rome,
and there's people and cars everywhere.Later on when a woman he has, like only an idiot can, fallen in love
with at first site gets kidnapped by bad guys he proceeds to go after
them in an aeroplane. His brother would of course just kept his
distance, landed close to where the kidnappers cars stopped, and then
snuck over to take care of business. Not so Ronald, he proceeds to
attack them with the plane itself, seemingly without a plan. After
failing miserably, as predicted, the plane crashes through a wood.
Sheer luck however, not skill, eventually makes it so that he ends up
at the same place as the baddies, most of them disposing of themselves
in a crash, and thus lets him save the girl.Ronalds plan for the end game has to be seen to be believed. After
finding out somehow where the bad guy has his bad guy compound, Ronalds
plan is simple; even though the villain knows his name, what he looks
like and who he is, he will just go there, waltz right in, hope to be
taken to the villain, tell him that he has come to kill him, and then
do so. That's it, that's the whole plan. For some reason bringing a
girl along also seems like a good idea.The villain first does the obvious to thwart this "plan": send someone
to dispose of this idiot en route. When this fails (on a train,
incidentally also most likely bomb threatened, because like Rome before
it, it's empty) this villain changes his mind for some reason, and
instead of shooting the fool right in the face on sight when he
arrives, proceeds to house him, give him a guided tour of his lair and
then hit him over the head and torture him for a while whilst revealing
some back story so ridiculous it must have had the writers rolling on
the floor with laughter. One can't help wonder what Ronalds contingency
plan was throughout all this. The plot on it's whole is incomprehensible and stupid, apparently all
the intelligence agencies in the world are about to pool into one giant
data base that NONE of all the experts that thus must have been
involved, with all their vast resources, have managed to find out is
controlled by the bad guy. Incidentally, on the plus side, the bad guy
also turns out to be an idiot who makes it only through luck. (watch
how he miraculously survives not only the explosion of a hand grenade
type watch (don't ask) thrown at him, but also the explosion of his
whole bad guy hideout. (no explanation is of course given as to how he
managed this) There's a fun sequence near the end that can only work if
we assume that said bad guy spent some time printing out Ronald Bonds
passport photo, as well as those of various friends and colleagues of
his, and spent what must have been a considerable amount of time
walking around a building taping these up presumable to unnerve Ronald
when he arrives there. He also apparently went out to buy a spray can
so the could spray "Bond" and an arrow on the wall. The latter implies
that his plan actually hinged on the certainty that Bond would escape
from the henchmen that captured him earlier on. There is however
nothing that shows that the henchmen were intended to let him go so
that he could reach this target, so why anyone would bother with the
printing, spraying and taping when the odds of Ronald Bond actually
getting there are extremely slim, is any ones guess.All great fun though but watching James Bonds brother clown and clumsy
his way through an adventure like this makes one long for an actual
James Bond movie, it has been too long!
