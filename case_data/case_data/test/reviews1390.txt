The secret life of pets

Whenever I got invited on a date to go watch this movie, I was kind of
skeptical at first because it was a cartoon film and I haven't even
watched the trailer. But whatever, free movie and yummy popcorn right? To say the least, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at
the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie. Even
though it was a kids movie, it had clues here and there about things
adults would do and even say. Which made it even funnier! I couldn't
give a bad review on this because I genuinely had a great time watching
it. I definitely recommend it to anyone, including kids and adults as
well Even if it's a cartoon film, it's definitely the kind to wait and
hope for a second version.
