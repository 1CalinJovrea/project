Had it's moments... Ultimately too benign.

Even though all the actors are great and talented, it's merely an okay
movie that will kind of hold your attention...A little context: I just finished watching all of The Inbetweeners (UK)
and absolutely loved it. One of the funniest yet relatable shows about
being a teenager (specifically a boy) I've ever seen. I almost died
laughing. The main character (Will) created just as many problems for
himself as the world around him.Perks suffers from a main character who's too benign. He's depressed
and introverted because he's getting over the death of his suicidal
best friend... And the death of his favourite aunt. Just pick one and
go with it.The script just reads like a generic film school outcast drama. Lots of
tropes. I was confused about what time period this took place in. I
assume it's contemporary but for some reason these teenagers are making
mix cassette tapes and own record players instead of cell phones. The
writers are trying too hard to make them quirky and lovable but none of
it rings true. They pick one emotion (angst) and really run with it.
There's a lot of stock-movie-bullying we've seen before, tripping the
dork in the cafeteria, ruining someone's books etc. the teens just
aren't written like teens. Real teens are more devious.The movie started to liven up with some humour when Charlie
inadvertently became some chick's boyfriend but it doesn't last long. I
suppose the book has a large following but I'm speaking as someone who
didn't read it and am coming into this with no preconceptions about the
characters.
