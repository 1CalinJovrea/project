Don't believe the hype, the worst sequel by far

Saw it in the theater yesterday, couldn't wait for it to finish. Became
very boring half way through, the plot is just childish and lacks any
credibility or seriousness. I know this should be a no-brain summer
flick, but M:I films always go for the shocks and suspense. It was
non-existent here, the lack of any seriousness meant that nothing
really moved me. Even the high-profile figure being assassinated didn't
really mean anything because it seems that the whole world forgot about
it the second after it happened. The first film had a somewhat complicated plot, a few really
breathtaking scenes and Tom Cruise young enough to deliver a fresh
performance. The second film had a really silly plot, but the no- CGI
motorcycle chase scene and Limp Bizkit soundtrack at least created some
legacy. The third installment had a forgettable plot, but a really
convincing bad guy played by the late Mr. Hoffman. The fourth film was
silly enough, but the Burj Khalifa stunts made by Tom Cruise really
stood out. This sequel has none of that. It relies purely on CGI and no
plot development, it seems like characters jump from place to place
without any motive or any explanation. I am aware of the fact that this
lazy approach sells tickets these days, but in order to have a mission
impossible really be a mission impossible it needs to have a context
where it really seems serious and impossible. People who watched the
first sequel remember that the Langley heist was introduced to the
audience, planning was made and execution was slow, but exciting. This
director could not deliver any of that. I hope they stop now, I guess in the next sequel they could go into
space or make Tom Cruise might fight a tiger in a cage. Even if he does
it will be a CGI tiger, or a CGI Tom Cruise. In a CGI cage, with CGI
blood.Big disappointment, really.
