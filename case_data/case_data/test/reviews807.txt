Beautiful set, terrible terrible film.

There was one thing good about this film: the set/setting. All else was
rubbish. The script left much to be desired, and because of this, the
acting seemed sub par. Miss Stewart looked like she needed to take some
anti-constipation medicine most of the time. Her fight speech near the
end made me hope that there was better acting to come in the last 20
minutes or so...The final scene...I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing
did. It was boring.I mist admit, after the troll scene, I fell asleep. I never sleep in
films, or rather I haven't since All Dogs Go To Heaven 2.
