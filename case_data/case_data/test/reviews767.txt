Biggest disappointment of the decade.

Let me start by saying that Maleficent has been a personal favorite of
mine when it comes to Disney villains. Throughout her many
interpretations, she has simply been Evil (yes, with a capital E). So
forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant.In this adaptation, she is reinterpreted as a good fairy (because she's
apparently not a human sorceress anymore?) that simply has a hissyfit.
She is certainly not evil - just angry for a little while. She even
ends up becoming a Godmother??Even King Stephen's character is butchered. Why does he go insane over
her? If he were really the bad guy, why wouldn't he have killed
Maleficent when he had the chance? What possible reason does he have
for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter?Speaking of Aurora, it's worth mentioning that she is relatively
alright, but still not too close to her original character. A petty
aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the
same color, which is really distracting. Additionally, they rehash the concept from Frozen, which is that 'True
Love' doesn't have to be from some man. If this trend continues from
Disney, all we'll see is sisterly/Godmotherly/family love movies where
Romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesn't end with
a "happily ever after" anymore.Overall, this film was simply horrible if you respected Maleficent as a
villain. If you did like Maleficent as she was, I don't recommend
seeing this movie. Even if you like the idea of there being no such
thing as Evil, I urge you not to see this movie. Don't support the
people who made it.
