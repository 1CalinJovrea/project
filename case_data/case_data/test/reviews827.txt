Great special effects, average plot, good movie!

This modern revisit of the witch-legend is not actually a bad movie. I
mean it won't be the "film of the year" but, if you are looking for
some nice special effects and a little bit of action, this film will
help you pass a nice evening!I found it enjoyable and not too long, and moreover, Vin Diesel is good
for this part. He always give his best in this kind of "badass"
character (Riddick, Fast and Furious).If I had to point out something not good about this movie I would say
that is too stereotyped, especially in the end, but, in the end, I
think it's worth spending 10$ to see it!
