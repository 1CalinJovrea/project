Funny and far out plot and it's a sexy tease.

"Keeping Up with the Joneses" is one fun and funny feel comedy drama
that seems a little unreal still it entertains! Set in Atlanta, Georgia
in an area that's nice a suburban couple Jeff(Zach Galifianakis)and
Karen(Isla Fisher)seem to have the perfect life then all of a sudden
their life is turned upside down by a new couple who move in next door
named Tim Jones(Jon Hamm)and Natalie(Gal Gadot). Soon strange things
start to happen and it's seems odd, but soon it appears that an
international spy plot might be going on! Aside from that this film is
funny and full of good one liners and sexy scenes especially the one of
Gal Gadot in the try on room with all of those sexy colored bras, and
Tim and Natalie even tie up and duct tape the mouth's of Karen and
Jeff's neighbors. Really a wild and crazy type of a film, probably not
everyone's cup of tea still it's worth a watch due to it's laughs and
sexy scenes a tease with two beautiful ladies in Gal Gadot and Isla
Fisher, so if your looking for a carefree feel good time then give this
movie a watch.
