Losing streak? Commit a serious crime to change your luck.

A disappointingly mild crime-comic caper yarn which didn't sound all
that intriguing to me when I first read about it.My only interest was in who directed it: Soderbergh, whose stunning
debut "sex, lies and videotape" enthralled me in the late-80s and
continues to, today. "Logan" has a plot that sounds more up the alley
of someone noted for directing rom-coms, and wanted to "mix things up"
a bit. Surely Soderbergh would elevate this material, right?Sorry, Steven; you've done better and far more intelligent fare than
this blah farce, rife w/ dingbat stereotypes. Devoid of much emotion,
"Logan" has little to recommend it despite a willing cast.Suffice to say, the plot centers around two brothers, the younger of
which masterminds a crime involving a former job-site at the Charlotte
Motor Speedway. THAT is as far as things go, interesting-wise. It will
take you about two seconds to solve how the crime will be perpetrated.As help, an inmate w/ the unlikely and silly name of Joe Bang is
enlisted, who in turns enlists his brothers (I think; characters are
given almost no back-story or explanation in this.) Bang sports a
blonde crew-cut and the information he imparts could have been passed
along via a napkin drawing. Yet the brothers agree to a plan where (1)
one brother sends himself into prison (2) Bang and Brother Elder are
smuggled out during a "riot" diversion and (3) Both enter back in
before anyone's the wiser, following the heist.The problem I have w/ this unsalted dud is the lack of build-up to
anything that happens. Everything comes off w/ almost no hitches; the
few "uh-oh" moments are defused by stupid track employees or convenient
plot-devices. The audience is expected to believe CMS has no cameras,
scant Security (despite CMS having its own Police force, we're told)
and that Charlotte is just over the state line from West Virginia,
among other ridiculous machinations going on.I give this 4 stars out of 10 for some attention to detail; when the
heist is over, we see via time-jumps the lengths the crew went through
to pull off their crime and cover their tracks afterward (a trick
Soderbergh showed us in "Ocean's 12.") Dwight Yoakam and the young
actress playing "Jimmy Logan's" daughter were a delight.But everyone else...meh at best, and miscast badly at worst. Much like
Soderbergh's "The Informant," his newest feature is really bland,
underwhelming, undernourished; I've a sharp sense of humor, and this
one's barely worth a couple of chuckles. There's little in the way of action, or grit, or wit to keep your mind
off the fact "Logan" drags on and on...and on, past it's deliver-by
date. There is a charming scene ripped right from "Little Miss Sunshine,"
which doesn't hold water: a little girl singing "Take Me Home, Country
Roads" in West Virginia will have PLENTY of company at a pageant.Nope. Not getting those suspiciously great reviews. "Logan" doesn't
make me feel lucky at all. More like someone whose best game at Bingo
night netted him three numbers in a row, counting the free space.
