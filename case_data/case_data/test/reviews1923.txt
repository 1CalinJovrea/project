Immensely disappointing.

While the idea behind the movie is sorta-kinda unique (Smart House,
anyone?), the actual romantic plot line was so poorly executed I
couldn't even believe it.I tried to sympathize with Samantha, really I did; at first her
character seemed very promising. But it turned into the most
stereotypical, bland romance ever. The number of times Samantha and
Theodore sighed only to have the other ask "What's wrong?" followed by
"Nothing, I'm fine" was way too painful. The interactions between the
two of them were so plain and boring and predictable that I found
myself not caring about either of these characters at all.By the end of the film, when Samantha decided to leave, I wasn't even
upset, or interested, or anything. It didn't feel as though anything
significant had changed or happened.I'm sorry but two hours of watching Theodore talk to Samantha/himself
was really hard to enjoy.Don't even get me started on the sex/cyber scenes. I understand what
they were going for. But again, just about everything in this movie was
so awkwardly executed, that simply knowing what they were intending to
portray was not enough.TL;DR I just don't know what to say. The previews for this film made it
look really interesting, something that might get you thinking... but
ultimately it was a depressing movie all around, honestly a waste of
potential, this could have been something great; instead it became a
weird and melodramatic story. They could have replaced the AI Samantha
with a real human being and in the end not much would have been
different. I'm not sure why this film has been getting the praise it
has, it was cheesy, it was awkward, it was obscene at times, it was
simply not enjoyable.
