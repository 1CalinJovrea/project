Don't understand why people hate this movie

As I was reading through the other reviews I noticed one thing. People
have split (mostly) into two camps. In one camp you can find those that
utterly hate the movie, and in the other one you find those that adore
it. Weird enough, there were very little that were in between the two
camps.Let's talk about why people hated this movie. From what I have read
those that hated the movie, hated it because:1. Because Godzilla was not center stage. "ugh incredible, I have to
wait to see Godzilla? Gawd what a draagggg.. like in Pacific Rim I
didn't have to put up with this, I want my money back!!". 2. And
because of the way he was designed. "Ugh, that design omg... they put
no effort in creating him".I for one have to say that I love the fact that Godzilla is not in
every-freaking-frame of the movie. The first half of the movie you
barely see him and in the second part you have glimpse of him and later
on entire scenes with our beloved lizard kicking ass and taking names.And I really love that! They managed to build up the suspense, making
Godzilla look very mysterious and making you say "oh look, there he
is!" and then poof, he disappears after a building. I had the feeling
that I was witnessing those events, like I was right there. This kind
of filming should be done more often, I find it a really smart and a
more spectacular way of shooting a movie. Of course, when you compare this way of filming with Pacific Rim
(because everybody compare the two) you'd naturally say that yes,
Pacific Rim has and advantage over Godzilla. But in all honesty you cannot compare the two because from my
perspective, Pacific Rim is an upfront, here is everything we have to
offer kind of movie. It is really generic, you are not surprised by
anything. But if you look at Godzilla, oh my... you really have all of
the suspense and intrigue that keeps you hooked and makes you want more
and more! I think that this movie would have not been as good if
Godzilla would have been non-stop from start to finish. It's really
refreshing to see a movie like this rather than the generic-action
movies like Pacific Rim, Transformers etc. that give you everything on
a silver platter and a lot of the times make you say *pfft, boring*.*Being mean* I think that the people that hate having to wait in order
to see Godzilla, are those types of people that have no patience, they
are those people that need action, lots of explosions, effects and
mindless fighting and a bad script. You have transformers and lots of
other such types of movies. If you have half of a brain you would
understand this movie.And concerning the design of Godzilla I think it's great. It looks a
lot like the classic lizard but with a couple of tweaks here and there. I myself was a big fan of the 1998 Godzilla (hey, don't judge... I was
7 years old back then, I didn't know better) and because I hadn't seen
any of the old and classic versions of this monster (except from what I
saw on cartoon network)I had to compare the 2014 with the 1998 lizard.
But I love love love the new version.Everything about this new Godzilla is great! From design, script and
shooting, everything in my opinion is an improvement to an otherwise
bland way of making movies like we have nowadays.So try to have some critical thinking and don't judge this movie
because you don't have everything thrown at you from the get-go.
Sometimes a little bit of mystery is good and in my opinion they were
just building the suspense for the sequel where we will probably have
more prim-time lizard action.Looking forward to seeing the sequel!!!
