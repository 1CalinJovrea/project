Suspension of disbelief? More like suspension of all brain activity

**** Major spoilers of the ending and plot of the next movie as well!!!
****A meeting somewhere safe in a post-apocalypse worldLeader: We need a cure for this disease. We need it now! It's gotten
out of control.Project manager: I have an idea. Let's build a maze.L: What for?PM: To study survivors. We will put them inside the maze and study
their brain activities under certain scenarios from a distance.L: Are you kidding? Why don't we study it in a lab, where we have
superior equipment?PM: Right. Maybe we can read their brain activities with
micro-transmitter implants. They can do voodoo magic I don't have to
explain.L: But why should we severely limit our technology? Well... fine. What
kind of a maze?PM: Enormous, at least a couple kilometers wide, with 100 ft high
walls. And it will reconfigure itself periodically.L: Reconfigure? 100ft?PM: Yes, we will build tons of moving massive stone walls, put gigantic
hydraulics, motors and generators. Energy needs and maintenance should
be negligible.L: *sigh* Where shall we build it?PM: In the middle of desert sir, where the working temperatures are
infernal, roads and rails are blocked, and transportation costs are
high.L: Not underground?PM: Of course not, because we will need a lush forest inside the maze.L: How will that work?PM: We will plant some trees and hope it will rain enough to keep the
green.L: And what workforce would build it? We have enough problems with
decreasing population already.PM: We will use as many survivor people as we can to get it done as
quickly as possible.L: Then what? Who will we put in there?PM: Teenagers.L: Why? Do they have some significance older people don't have? Why not
20 or 25 years old people?PM: I'll come back to you on that sir, but I feel like we should put
teenagers in there... Each month one at a time.L: Why one?PM: Because we will brainwash the rest and study them in a lab first.L: Why not study them in the lab in the first place?PM: But sir, then the maze would be unnecessary, wouldn't it?L: That's circular argumentation! *sigh* Whatever. Then what?PM: We will open and close the maze every day and release giant,
genetically modified spider-scorpion creatures every night to kill any
escapees. They'll be injected with the virus.L: Sacrificing some of the last of survivors of humanity we study and
invest lots of time in would be acceptable. And we might ignore the
danger of uncontrolled spreading of the virus I guess. So, do we have
them creatures in stock?PM: No sir. We have to develop the technology first and breed them as
well.L: I see. And that's the only way to study these teenagers? What about
their hormones? If we put them all in one place they'll populate like
rabbits.PM: See sir? We will put only boys in the maze. There'll be no girls.L: What?!? Why shall we halve the "guinea pigs" we have?PM: You haven't heard the best part yet. We'll put the girls in the
second maze.L: What second maze?PM: We'll build another maze just like this one, just as expensive and
elaborate, and put the girls there.L: And how long will we keep them there?PM: As long as it takes until they escape. Years, decades if necessary.L: What if they decide not to escape or those monsters kill them?PM: Sometimes science needs sacrifices sir. And if they decide to stay,
we'll help them escape after a while.L: Then why do we have to wait for years? What do we do in the
meantime?PM: I'm sure rest of the world can survive the virus in safe, isolated
environments until we've finished building the mazes and carried on
with the tests.L: Why don't we study those safe environments and the other survivors?PM: But sir, a self-reconfiguring maze with teenagers and monsters is
much cooler, isn't it?L: Only in a movie! Tell me what do we do with the escapees?PM: We'll study their biology with our equipment and develop a vaccine
for the virus in our labs sir.L: Then why don't we invest all our efforts into biological study
instead? Whatever. You're not much of a scientist are you?PM: No sir, I'm just a project manager. I worked as book author before
my career switch. Trust me, I know what I'm doing....and on and on...L: Sounds plausible, your idea is our best hope. It's a bulletproof
plan. Our governments, economy, transportation and communication are
collapsed but I'll ignore our scientists' opinions and give you as much
resources as you need. I got you covered. Let's start.Had they not tried to explain the premise, it would be much much better
for the sake of the movie.
