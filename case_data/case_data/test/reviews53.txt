It's a no from me

There just isn't the heart that was there in the mini series. In my
opinion. The actors were fine, but the story wasn't there. I believe
there is to be a next installment covering the (now) grown ups. I'll
probably watch it - if I've nothing better to do. It's simply not
Steven King's "IT'. ALso,they appear to have recycled the CGI lady from
' Mama' at one point : can't find it now, but look out for it.
"Beep,beep, Richie" appears once, so far as I can tell - a long way
into the film. Against all odds, I looked forward to this. But it's
another turkey. Steven King tells great stories - why do the Hollywood
mob insist on killing them? I truly think this was dreadful and not a
patch on the original. I hope to goodness they don't remake The Stand.'
