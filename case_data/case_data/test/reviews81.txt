A No Heavy Tearjerker, But Still Searingly Relatable and Sentimental

Coming on the heels of its commercially-successful predecessor, 'The
Fault in Our Stars', PAPER TOWNS is no heavy tearjerker, but it echoes
more affectionate and piercing sentiments, with its lighter, minimalist
take of its recognizable subjects.The film follows Quentin (Nat Wolff) , or "Q" as he is more popularly
called, a highschool boy who has been nursing an unrequited love for
the girl living next door, Margo (Cara Delevigne) since childhood. Even
after when they turn 12, when Margo suddenly becomes distant, "Q" never
loses the affection, and it only becomes even stronger when one day she
climbs again to his window, the way she did when they were still kids.
The next events follow an eager "Q" savoring the moment as he escorts
Margo in her series of "small revenge" against those she thinks have
betrayed her, including her ex-boyfriend. But the levitating moment
would only last overnight, because the next day, the ever mystifying
Margo, disappears.Mining on the same overly familiar material that dwells on both
coming-of-age and teenage romance territories, PAPER TOWNS pulls off
two easily-recognizable efforts: maintaining 'The Fault's charm, while
toning down its tragic notions. The latter of which, yields a more
tangible and heartwarming result, capable of conjuring a lasting tug at
the heartstrings. The credit for this goes to its equally-charming yet
capable actors, both of whom teeming with fresh and enigmatic
likability. It will also sound unforgivable to never pay regard to the
film's brilliant screenwriters who manage to cleverly highlight this
extremely familiar highschool tale's stronger and more relatable
sentiments, genuinely and sincerely enough, to bend fragile emotions
with crippling capacity."Q"'s road trip in finding Margo represents a bigger journey with far
wider scope and meaning, and it comes across as a process of personal
exploration that unknowingly liberates one self, toward finding the
deeper sense of their existence. Hardly that the questions thrown get
resolved, but the charming and sincere take of its proceedings, will
ultimately make the narrative arrive to a satisfying conclusion. This
doesn't mean it's able to satisfy its own queries, but the resolution
delivered are nonetheless, reliable and honest.PAPER TOWNS will come across as a witty, yet touching case of a 'lost
and found'. Much of it is spent in searching for the 'lost', a
liberating process that frees its seekers from every question that
unfolds in the wake of a previous other, but the 'found', though never
really answers any of the previous questions, will deliver a
surprisingly satisfying, and never less of a rewarding, answer.
