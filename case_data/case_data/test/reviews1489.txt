The music makes the movie soar....

Been hopelessly hooked, for the past several days now, to the
captivating selection of 1970s pop that forms the music soundtrack of
The Diary of a Teenage Girl. The film itself, about a teenage girl discovering and embracing sex
amidst the Bohemian surroundings of 1970s San Francisco, impressed me
for its rare honesty, its vibrancy, and the wonderful music soundtrack
that accompanies the film's moods. Phoebe Gloeckner's searing and much
acclaimed 2002 graphic novel comes to screen with a careful selection
of eclectic tracks from the 1960s-70s that make the film soar at times.
The film is not for the prudish and easily shocked though. And that
includes the nannies at the Academy who have completely shut out this
indie from this years Oscar nominations!
