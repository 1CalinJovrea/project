Apes are the better humans now?

What I do not like about this movie is the basic message: Humans in
comparison to animals cannot be trusted, they show no mercy, the
animals reach the higher ethical ground and should survive and reign
the world.How is the goal of this message achieved? First, the whole movie plot
is filmed from the perspective of the ape- society, their families,
their friends, their love and their sorrows. Unlike the perfectly
arranged classical Charleton Heston movies in the 60s which bore a
shock element in a dark post-nuclear, post-apocalyptic world, where
mankind destroyed itself, this movie aims at showing the worthlessness
of human beings. The little blonde girl whose father got shot dead by
Cesar, didn't loose a single teardrop for her father, but after a short
while befriends herself with the apes, starts crying for a dead
gorilla, who gave her a flower, gives water and food to the imprisoned
killer of her father, Cesar, and feels herself quite comfortable now
growing up as a monkey daughter in the sense of a Tarzan, yet in a
considerable lower social position. Second, other humans, except maybe for Woody Harrelson as a pittiful
leader of a small company, do not have character depth in this movie,
and are basically the enemies, and except for the little blonde girl,
they all die, either killed by monkeys, by themselves, or by a snow
avalanche.What a stupid movie! What a stupid message! Worthliness of human beings
is being shown here. Of course the human is bad from nature (described
as sinner), as the Bible tells us, but he is not worthless, and as Gods
creation is above the animals. Here you see the perversion of this idea
to the extent.Now to the ambiance: Cold, snowy, Alaska-like landscape, no cities, no
larger Human or animal dwelling places. Most of the time 5 apes and the
little blonde girl take the central part in the non-inhabited boreal
wilderness on seek of revenge.The fights: starting with a tactical nonsense Human uphill assault with
well equipped tactical weapons against spears and still being lost.
Only 3 humans and a silver-backed Gorilla get captivated, and after a
short interrogation get released by Cesar, but later become his
fiercest enemies again. Major explosions quite in the end of this
almost two hours movie. I spare to pinpoint the many flaws of the
fights there, just dumb.Better title in this case would be: "War for the little ape reserve in
the Northern Alaska (or whatever landscape it represented)"Cesar's portrayal - in the beginning: the good leader - in the middle:
the bad revenge seeker - at last: and the ugly Spartacus in the
workingcamp Conclusion of the movie: all humans dead (except girlie who
feels herself as a monkey) and the long exodus to sunny monkey land
next to a big evening-sun-bathed lake, where they all lived happily
there after,...oh no, not all, Cesar finally died from his arrow wound,
which he survived for the 1000 km trek through the deserts of death
Valley (or whatever location it represented), with a last glimpse of
his little monkey-boy playing with the little blonde human girl, he
died right in the arms of his Orang-Utan friend Murksy, Mopsy...forgot
the name. Bad.1/10
