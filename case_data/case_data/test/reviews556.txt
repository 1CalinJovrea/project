Some Brief Humorous bits surrounded by a surprisingly bad movie (based on the reviews)

My summary I think nails what Spy is. A few funny bits (e.g. Law's
character accidentally shooting the guy in the head, some banter
between McCarthy and Byrne) surrounded by a juvenile, predictable,
unintelligent, unbelievable and overall: really bad movie. Did I mention unbelievable? No I didn't but I will now: OBESE people
simply aren't athletic, at all (which is why they're OBESE in the first
place) much less "super agent" tactical operator athletic so this whole
movie comes across as contrived and unbelievable. Now if Spy were
actually a GOOD comedy, I could write off the unlikelihood of a fat
super agent as "it's just a comedy" but it isn't and I therefore
didn't. I normally don't waste time watching movies below 70% but was lured in
by the high ratings of Spy. My wife and I watched it and I completely
lost interest right around the time 50cent appeared. At this point, I
very clearly remember laughing at loud and asking my wife "how in the
hell is this thing a 7.5 out of 10 on IMDb?!" Spy is a 5 out of 10 at its very best but overall just awful and
deserving of a single star.
