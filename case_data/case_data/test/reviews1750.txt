Great film never saw a single trailer for it...glad I looked it up

Holy Moly, I see people talking about no one in the theater for this
and I know why, no trailers no advertising at all. I look everything up
before I go, as soon as I saw IMDb reviews and Gandolfini I knew I was
in. It's a dark twisty movie with equally dark and twisty characters.
There were gangsters and good guys and bad guys. However they are
anything BUT cookie cutter, run of the mill, you have seen this all
before good guys and bad guys. There are explanations' you see how some
of them end up the way they do, its not black and white. Crazy
outwardly isn't the most crazy in the room. The most violent characters
can also be some of the most kind. There is no typical in this film. It
draws you in and never lets you go. Keeps you guessing till the end.
