An entertaining flick that lacks the flair of the first movie

The first Now You See Me was a very enjoyable and entertaining flick
that boasted a good cast and visually impressive stunts. The second,
called Now You See Me 2, on the other hand was mediocre at best lacking
the 'wow' factor of the first. Still boasting the stellar cast of the
first movie with the added Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan, who
replaces Isla Fisher as the 'girl' horseman in the group, the second
act as it is so-called, tries hard to make an intelligent story. This
attempt backfires as the plot becomes bloated and too complex to
understand towards the end of the movie, and the tricks become
unconvincing.The Four Horseman, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney
(Woody Harrelson), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Lulla (Lizzy Caplan),
are hiding and the FBI are searching for them. They have been waiting
for over a year to return to the stage and the leader of the Horseman,
Dylan Rhodes, played by Mark Ruffalo, orchestrates there comeback. But
as there jubilant return seemed to be going smoothly, the stage is
hijacked by Walter Mabry, played by the magical Daniel Radcliffe. The
magicians are then sent to Macau, where Walter awaits them. His goal is
find and steal a computer chip with the ability to decrypt all of the
data in the world using the Four Horsemans thieving skills. Rhodes is
arrested as the FBI find out about his connection with the Horseman,
but he escapes and gets a call from Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman),
the magician he blames for the death of father, who says he is able to
help Dylan. But the deal can only be done if Dylan can get him out of
prison. This plot seems easy enough to understand, but as the movie
continues to develop, it becomes a whole lot more complicated than you
would've thought. The movies continuing story becomes implausible, in
particular the part about the computer chip. There are many things I enjoyed with the movie but there also seems to
be a little problem after that. As a whole, the visuals are really
good, but there are times were it goes a bit too far (back to
implausible). The cast and acting was good, but the characters are very
much the same as in the first movie. There is nothing new about them,
with the exception of Mark Ruffalo's character. We are given a better
and more thoughtful backstory about his past, and more emotional
understanding. Out of the horseman, Woody Harrison's character is the
only one whose past is even talked about when his brother comes into
the frame, which didn't really do much to the movie. I personally
didn't like it that much. I enjoyed Isla Fishers replacement in Lizzy
Caplan. She was a fun and provides some positive energy to the group,
which contain some boring members. She has a personality which some of
the characters lacked, but her role only took a bad-turn when she and
Dave Franco's character, Jack Wilder, entered a horribly-developed
relationship, which had nonsensical impact on the already bloated
story. As long as the team had chemistry, which they did, I was fine
with some of the minor problems.The tricks were impressive but I didn't find the 'wow' factor like I
did in the first movie. Also, as Thaddeus was a magic debunker, I
would've liked, even for a brief minute or two, for him to explain how
some of the tricks worked, which would've helped the audience, but also
expand his role in the movie, especially as he is such a great actor.
Continuing on with the tricks, I wish that they didn't all have to have
some sort-of CGI work on them. One of the things I liked about the
first movie were some of the tricks didn't require CG work at all
because they were entirely performed by the magician. Though I know
that the people performing the tricks are not magicians, they could've
at least applied some free-hand stuff for the actors to perform.Overall, the movie, despite its bloated story and extensive CGI work,
was entertaining and fun to watch. It has some resemblance to the first
movie, which I didn't entirely enjoy, and hope that if they do make a
third (I hear they are) that they make a more believable and different
story, continuing on with some of the great visual effects.
