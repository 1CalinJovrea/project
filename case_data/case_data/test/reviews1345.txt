Sacha Baron Cohen is a Master!

Sacha Baron Cohen is a Master Actor! No two options on that! His range
as a performer, is undeniable & indeed terrific. With his latest
box-office hit 'The Dictator', Sacha delivers a yet another masterful
performance, that exhibits his potential to the optimum. 'The Dictator' Synopsis: The heroic story of a dictator who risks his
life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so
lovingly oppressed.'The Dictator' is funny & entertaining, but its obviously not logical.
It has moments that are so absurd, that you might feel repulsed, but
'The Dictator' at least stays true to its genre. The Screenplay Written
by Alec Berg, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer & Sacha himself, is funny,
but crass & overtly crude, but it never loses pace. Larry Charles's
Direction is adequate. Sacha embodies Admiral General Aladeen & is simply masterful in here. A
Versatile, Marvelous Actor, who once again delivers beyond
expectations. Here's an actor who needs to be taken more seriously.
Being so good in a silly film such as this, proves how good he can get
in a film that offers a stronger background. On the whole, 'The Dictator' isn't the finest comedy you'd see, but its
entertaining nonetheless.
