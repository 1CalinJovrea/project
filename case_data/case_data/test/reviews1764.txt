This movie is cool

Warm Bodies is a beauty and the beast love story crossed with the 

typical zombie horror flick. The movie's pace is well done and the 

movie itself is well directed by the director of the 2011 drama 50/50, 

Jonathan Levin. He also wrote the screenplay, which he based on a 2010 

novel of the same name (Warm Bodies) by Isaac Marion.



The acting in the movie is glamorous, from both the humans and the 

zombies, and I did enjoy the makeup effect on the lead as he starts to 

morph from a zombie to a human. The movies use of humor is well timed 

and arranged as it is clever, when you feel it is getting a little too 

serious, out of nowhere jumps a comic line that lightens the mood. The 

other thing that you will enjoy is the Romeo and Juliet references that 

the director made sure were present and obvious, as the lead characters 

name is R which I believe R for Romeo and his love interest is named 

Julie which I believe is in reference to Juliet.



The thing that attracted me to this movie in the first place was the 

new idea of how the movie is viewed from the zombie's point of view; we 

also get to hear his thoughts as he goes through life being an undead.



Set in a post apocalypse era, Warm Bodies is more about open 

mindedness, the ability to accept that others can change. The movie is 

more of a romantic drama than it is about humans going all Resident 

Evil on Zombies.



The plot is about an unusual zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) who 

developed human emotions and craved for more. The humans during this 

post apocalypse era lived a barricade life away from zombies who have 

practically taking over the world. Part of the human settlement went 

out to get some supplies, during that time they ambushed by zombies, 

there R saw Julie (Teresa Palmer) and fell for her.



He then saved her from the others and made her stay with him during 

which more emotional attachment developed between the two till she had 

to go back to her people. But something new started among the zombies 

that one act by R caused a revolution.



The movies score jumped out at me as being bad though, that is from my 

view. The movie is cool, and the humor is really well timed and this is 

a movie that I can comfortably advise that you should see.
