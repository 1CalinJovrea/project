Such a cute film

My husband and I really enjoyed this. It's sweet and romantic. If you
like a movie without swearing and gratuitous sex, etc., this is a
feel-good story. Alan Alda was wonderful, and we enjoyed seeing him in
this role. Scott Eastwood was convincing as a PBR rider trying not to
become a has-been and working through issues of his own. There's action
for the guys (bull riding), and something for the ladies (bull riding,
and a flash of Scott Eastwood's nice buttocks-thank you for that-so
there's something for everyone. The actress who played Alan Alda's wife
was absolutely darling. Very romantic film about two people who had a
meet-cute and found their lives changed in many ways.
