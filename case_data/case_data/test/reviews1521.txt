Disturbing

This movie is tense, disturbing, with some heavy imagery, gripping, and
has great acting. It's not so much scary as it's disturbing - different
things, the way I see it. Watching it was an intense experience.
There's some lack of imagination in the underlying plot, in portraying
evil and how it acts through people, but I guess that this would be
asking too much of an already good movie. It lacks subtlety in key
moments. Decisive scenes where the main theme of the movie are
discussed are presented hurried way; they aren't properly explored. To
be fair, this shouldn't be generalized, though. But I do feel the focus
ended up being too much on the unfolding of the actions - a classic
goal to goal rather aspect to aspect sort of thing.The scarcity of good horror genre movies is really saddening, few
artists are willing to delve into the nature of fascinating subjects
such as evil and fear, but I'd say this movie is one of the good ones
and I definitely recommend it.
