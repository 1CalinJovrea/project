Edge of your seat

Brilliant film that executes the "alone in a cabin with a killer loose"
perfectly. We are introduced to a character who is deaf, which sets up
a lot of great scenes through the film, and gives our lead just another
insane obstacle to jump over. While we never learn the killer's
motivations, I don't think it was really important. All the tension
builds rather nicely, and the film is an exercise in great editing,
directing, and acting. Simple story, simple concept, brilliantly
executed.
