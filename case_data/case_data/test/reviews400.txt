I expected a semi-decent film, and that's what I got

When I heard the news that Total Recall was being remade, I was just as
disappointed as most were out there. However, I never hate a film based
on such a simple principle. Before the release, I was simply curious as
to what direction they were going to take with this film.I always rate a film on two scales: The technical aspects (an objective
scale), and if I actually liked it (subjective scale). I'm pretty
forgiving with science fiction films so I'll keep my review as
objective as possible.Pros: The futuristic world that has been imagined for this film was
well designed. Visually, the film is stunning. If you're the type that
reads into the quirky inventions you see on screen, this film is
littered with them. There were plenty of action sequences, and most of the time the film
gave us eye candy that we haven't seen before. It seemed as though a
general theme in the film (besides "questioning what's real") was
constant play with gravity. This may have been influenced by inception,
but the world turns upside down a few times, and it's visually
interesting.Cons: The plot. It was there, but not as deep as you would hope for a
"Total Recall" remake. There were a few cool things thrown in there,
but the plot was definitely not the strong point of the film.The action sequences. There were a lot of positive aspects to all the
action, but the movie seemed to rely too heavily on it. The movie came
off as one giant chase scene, and it became slightly repetitive after a
while. If you like a little meat on your plot's backbone, you may want
to lower your expectations a little bit before seeing this one. Conclusion: Try not to think of this film as a literal remake of the
original. Think of it as analogous to a band doing a cover of someone
else's song... in a very different style. It lifts the ideas from the
original film, and written source material, but takes a different spin
on it.In all, I liked it. I had my quips, but it's a movie that I gave a lot
of forgiveness. From what I recall, it wasn't a TOTAL mess.
