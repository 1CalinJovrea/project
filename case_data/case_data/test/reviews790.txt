Great visuals, completely ludicrous plot

Felt like leaving the theater for this one. It started off nicely, with
a hugely successful robot task force with moderate A.I. Then for some
reason funding gets cut and the head developer decides to go rogue and
install his untested super A.I. on a stolen robot.Hard to swallow plot #1: The robots can only be reprogrammed in the
presence of a unique key USB disk. The developer just picks it up and
takes it home, spends several days with it, and no one bats an eye.#2: Chappie is born with the knowledge of a baby. But miraculously he
learns the English language in a couple of days of exchanging a few
sentences with his "parents".#3: The bad guys let the developer, which they just stole and beat the
crap of, come and go as he pleases. No worries of him alerting the
authorities or his companies' own robot army. Which he doesn't,
inexplicably.#4: For someone so intelligent, Chappie is pretty dumb. He knows
shooting someone kills them but is convinced that knifing "just makes
them sleep".#5: After lying to manipulate the robot every step of the way, the "bad
daddy" decides to come clean and admit that in fact he can't prevent
Chappie's demise. Which obviously results in almost getting killed.#6: The same "bad daddy" then does a complete flip flop and puts his
life on the line to save Chappie. Which is going to die in a few hours
anyway. And not in any effective way I might add, he just decides to
become a sitting duck for some reason.#7: The factory where all the mayhem originated from is the least
secure place in the city. And absolutely no one, except for the
protagonist and the antagonist, are able to go to the command console
and sort things out. In fact it just remains abandoned in all other
times.#8: The childlike robot prodigy miraculously (again) is able to do a
feat no else had: transfer consciousness. With some banged up laptop
too.#9: Police is nowhere to be seen, and despite being perfectly possible
to restore the malfunctioning robots from the control central no one
decides to even try it. There's just frantic panic and cowboy stunts.There's more but you get the picture. To me the movie was painful to
watch. Every character seemed to be shouting all the time and have
complete disregard for logic. It was a dumb movie. The one nice thing
that temporarily took the pain away was the warm feeling you get when
you realize the robot is able to sacrifice his own life for the
survival of a human. So, 2 minutes out of 120. Maybe I should have
rated this even lower - but the 3/10 stands, because of visuals.
