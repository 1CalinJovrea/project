my 13 yo old and his friends got bored

hopefully, it is the last one in the series, i would say that Vin
(fatso) reached a new low, ridiculous plot, not that this is something
rare, but this one tops the ridiculous list. terrible acting by Vin,
everyone else is better than him, everyone! even the dancing bikini
girls, he is so terrible that the whole audience laughed and clapped
hands whenever he said his bs phrases. Donnie, my hero, was OK, but
seems that he was force to do some idiotic scenes, like the hand
grenades one, OMG! can anything be so bad? 10 good minutes in a long
bore of shooting and talking rubbish, wow.
