Such a let down

I went into this film with very high expectations, being a dedicated
lover of the graphic novels & the original film, I have waited a long
time for this film to come out.I will start with the positives, the film is as beautiful as the
original & stunning in its visual appearance. Mickey Rourke is
excellent as Marv yet again.Sadly, that is about all the good I can say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was
very weak & his character almost pointless, beyond being time filler.
The script writing was not as snappy as the first. The whole thing just
didn't flow as well nor feel as polished as the first, a real let down,
they could have made something stunning & just went for easy money
