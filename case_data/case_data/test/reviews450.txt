Horrible the movie was just so unrealistic that it sucked

i got pulled in at the start it turned out like any other mystery,
action movie all the clues and other attributes etc...but there was so many thing that just are so IDIOTIC that it pisses me
off. I have had so much tension on this from the book thinking it will be
amazing but it all went away half way through the movie.Spoilers: The part when she actually tries to make up the part of rape
and when she puts wine on her skirt and whatever was so STUPID, WHAT
ABOUT THE BLOODY CAMERAS YOU IDIOTS. And if you're going to say she
disabled them, the what about the actual fake rape scene. she sucked
his dick and was wearing lingerie for gods sake who wears lingerie
randomly. if they looked at the cameras to watch the rape then what
about the dick sucking and shirt tearing and pulling him in on you,
then pulling a knife out from under the pillow. But what finished it for me was the ending. WHAT MAN LIKE HIM IN THEIR
OWN MIND WOULD STAY WITH A MURDERING BITCH LIKE THAT AND STILL LOVE
HER. This was my opinion you don't have to agree but i just found it so
stupid.
