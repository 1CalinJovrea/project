Don't understand what the low ratings are about!!

This is a great movie! Shot very well and the main actress is amazing
for playing all seven characters. This movie itself is a little bloody
for me, but besides that I quite like it. I keep seeing reviews
indicating a lower rating, but I don't know why! This film is exciting
and has a great story line that makes you think about our current
situation in the world. It makes you wonder just how far human society
will go when technology starts to really become more advanced.
