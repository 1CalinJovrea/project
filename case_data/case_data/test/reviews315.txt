How is this movie so highly rated?

I created an IMDb account solely for the purpose of reviewing this
movie and to give it a more honest and accurate rating. It says it has
an 8.5 rating, but really it should be more like a 1 or 1.5, seriously.
What happened to people? Is this really the standard for a good movie
nowadays? I will spare you the suffering of going into great detail about every
little flaw in this movie. With that said, here are some of the reasons
why this movie sucks:1. No explanation of the events that have transpired to get to this
point. Logan has apparently decided to become a limo driver to make
money so that he and Charles can go live on a boat somewhere in the
middle of the ocean? Really? And what happened to the other mutants?
Supposedly there was some kind of "event" that I guess killed off all
the mutants and also stopped them from breeding more mutants. It's hard
to say because the movie makes no attempt to clue you in on what has
happened.2. No plot. Besides being lost from the very beginning, nothing really
happens throughout the entire movie to progress the story. Logan just
drives this little girl and Charles cross country while being chased by
some random bad guys who eventually catch up with them -- there's a
fight -- more driving -- they get caught again -- rinse and repeat.3. Who is this Wolverine clone? Where did he come from? how was he
made? what is he doing here? Want answers? You get none. He's just
there.4. Both Charles and Logan die in the most anticlimactic and meaningless
ways.The positives:1. Hugh Jackman
