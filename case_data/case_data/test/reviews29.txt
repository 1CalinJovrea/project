Best movie of the year

Wow! this movie was Amasing! ever since i was borned i have been
struggling with depression and Emo-ism. i have been trying to be glad
for twenty nein years now. thing were exiting in the cold war with
Nukes because i was waiting for nuclear annihaltion. because i was so
sad i looked to religion and prayed everyday to the Flying Spagetti
monster. papa Stalin didn't help me either. but then this movie came
and made me happy, the jokes, the humor hell even the emojis made me
happier
