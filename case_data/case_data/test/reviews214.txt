Insanely Good.

Beautiful, gritty, believable action. Like a Bond move on steroids and
as if that wasn't enough, starred by a beautiful woman. The sound track
had me whipping out my phone to get Sound Hound on the trail. A
beautiful story-line with all of the villains getting their just
deserts. Kudos to Theron.
