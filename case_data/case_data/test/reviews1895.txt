Unexpected to be good!

At first, when I decided to try watch this kind of 'genre', I thought
it was just another ordinary sci-fi story that will just make me feel
bored. But from the beginning of the movie, it started to catch my
attention that makes me crave to know more about it. The more I crave
to know, the story become so damn interesting! Yeah, I must say that
from my point of view, the story line is not clich√© and it has its own
'recipe' that stand out from one another. The idea is fresh and I like
the way they blend fantasy and reality to make it as a new flavor in
film history. I don't understand why most people critics about this
movie but in my opinion, this type of movie is something that deserve
10/10. The Dark Tower - the best movie I watch so far in 2017
