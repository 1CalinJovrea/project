total waste of time

I went into this movie without any idea about it.I just read Tom Tykwer
did directing together with the Wachowskis. So this _must_ be a great
film, right? No it is not. It was such a waste of time.The whole movie reeks of wanna-be intellectualism but everything is
totally hollow. There are several stories that are told in parallel.
Problem is, that nearly every one of these story lines is really very
boring.The is zero character developing, there is zero suspense in the whole
movie!! What happened to Tom Tykwer I ask? Okay, Matrix2+3 were crap.
But most of Tykwers films were quite good. It is really sad to see such
a decline in quality...
