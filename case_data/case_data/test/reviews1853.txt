Stupid Fuqua

I don't get it. This guy's delivered us some pretty decent movies in
the past. 'Tears of the Sun', 'Training Day', 'Brooklyn's Finest',
'Shooter'.So, what's happened here? Admittedly, he was hamstrung with a dire,
puerile script. But why get involved in the first place? The same goes
for the actors. Aaron Eckhart was saying he'd like to be more famous,
to have more control over his film choices. I can see why. Anything to
get out of doing something this bad. Not even Morgan Freeman can bring
the film any much-needed gravitas, even though he's the best actor
here.People talk about the depth of characterisation. Pardon? There wasn't a
single believable character in the entire film. They were all cardboard
cut-outs and stereotypes.In all, this was little more than a two-hour computer game. No... it
wasn't even that. At least with a computer game, you get a sense of
narrative. You also have some control over the outcome. This just
hobbled along from one CGI, blood-and-guts set piece to the next with
tedious predictability. It was like watching an episode of
'Thunderbirds', though without the tension and intelligence.If it's meant as a propaganda piece on the prevailing nature of
American might and spirit, it fails abysmally. In fact, King Jong Un
will be mightily reassured. On the basis of this, America will be a
walkover for him.
