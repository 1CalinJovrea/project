Terribly Overrated

I'm not a snob out to distinguish himself from the 97% Rotten Tomato
ravers. I was just really disappointed walking out of the theatre. I
don't know if I've ever seen a more self indulgent domestic weepy. The
film sets the viewer up with mountains of spoon-fed plot tragedy and
setback and then mines every last drop of melodrama and tears out of
such. Affleck's character is a flawless, blameless Everyman and behaves
so heroic it becomes impossible to feel for his plight. Williams is
terrific but barely on screen for ten minutes. What apparently is
intended to pass as compelling real-life dialog quickly becomes mundane
and boring. Likewise, our younger protagonist is a teenage lothario
having far too good a time to be awarded compassion. The non- Hollywood
ending comes across as pretentious, though it certainly comes as a
relief.
