A highly entertaining 80's style action thriller

I thought Wingard's last effort You're Next suffered from too much hype
and it didn't entirely work for me. Now he returns with an action movie
of sorts with some slasher elements thrown in with The Guest and this
is a home run. It is a slick and entertaining action thriller that
hearkens back to the same kind of movies from the 80's with its own
modern touches along with a great soundtrack and a great performance
from Dan Stevens.Good: Dan Stevens is the glue that binds this movie together. He exudes
vulnerability and charm that you just can't help but like the guy and
yet he still retains some sinister vibes underneath that smiling
exterior. He knocks it out of the park and when things amp up he
delivers on that front also. I really like the family in this movie.
They were all likable and I was concerned for their well being which
isn't something that a lot of these movies tend to successfully pull
of. Maika Monroe turns in a strong performance. The direction is very
slick and it has a nice atmosphere to it. The action is swift and hits
hard without going too over the top. The music is another plus with its
80's style synth pop that makes every scene that much more enjoyable.Bad: The movie never truly surprises with its twists and turns and it
is a pretty straightforward thriller.Overall, it doesn't do anything new, but it does so in style with great
performances, slick action, and an awesome soundtrack.
