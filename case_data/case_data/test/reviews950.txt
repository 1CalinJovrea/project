Lousy Movie, Pinky Promise

This has got to be THE worst premise for a movie ever!!! Mall security
guards vs trained army of assassins??? Mall security guards win??? Are
you kidding??? You have Antonio Banderas and Ben Kingsley, both of
which are great actors. They decide to be in this truly awful film???
What were their agents thinking? They are deserving of much better
roles in REAL movies. Security is low budget all the way through.
Poorly written, ridiculous concept of a script. The sets are laughably
cheap. The supposed "Mall" is obviously not a mall at all. All the set
design in this film seems cheap and unrealistic. With the exception of
Banderas and Kingsley, ALL the other actors are terrible. Like a
student film. The characters are weak and one dimensional. The
cinematography and editing are good but the story and cheap sets pull
the whole thing down. I was actually laughing through this entire film.
It starts out bad and ends up totally absurd. I really don't understand
how this movie got funded and green lit. You would have to be a
complete moron to take this film seriously or care about these
characters in peril. Its a joke, a real stinker. Avoid watching this.
You will never get the time back and be truly disappointed.
