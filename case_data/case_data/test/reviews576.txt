A brilliant masterpiece of atmosphere and suspense

This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire
running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at
the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly
to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was
wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The
two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best
performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul
Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as
the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking
cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating
masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits
roll.
