When Men Cheat

When men cheat, what happens in this movie usually doesn't happen, but
it did for these three ladies, and it makes for an enjoyable watch. The
plot isn't filled with holes, and there are a lot of laughs, especially
out of what Kate Upton says because she's really only known for the
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Editions and therefore starts off playing a
bit of a ditz, sort of like Leslie Mann's character, who is the
insecure one of the group that's tricked into signing papers for her
husband's company that she's the CEO of.Enjoy this film with friends. It's the perfect buddy comedy even though
the cast is largely female and men aren't really a big part of it at
all. It'll be part of Cameron Diaz's best of collection in the coming
years.
