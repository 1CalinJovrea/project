Great Performances, But Has Some Pacing Issues

The trailers gave us the impression that this movie would be a joint
effort by both Steve Carell and Emma Stone, but this is truly Stone's
movie. She gives a really good performance here, and certainly leads
the film. I don't think it necessarily tops her Oscar winning
performance in La La Land, but it is a remarkable one nonetheless. She
brings a lot of the realism and the subtly to the movie, whereas Carell
adds the complete opposite. All the positives I stated before about
Carell taking on the role of Bobby Riggs was validated. He very much
has the Michael Scott-isms that make him such an unstoppable comedic
force, but he also incorporates some of the dramatic elements we've
seen from him before in movies such as Foxcatcher. And really, I don't
know if this movie would have worked if Carell was a co-lead. He is so
eccentric and so out there that I think the shtick would have gotten
old and annoying really fast had he been in as much of the movie as
Stone was. By making Stone the lead, you have a much more grounded
entry into the film, and Carell's performance is enhanced by it only
being a supporting role...
