Fine example of a well produced film

Robert Downey and his wife Susan Downey have hit a home run with this
picture. They understand that most of the events in any life are
accidental or arbitrary, especially the crucial ones, and we can
exercise little conscious control over our destinies. They understand
that the "Judge" and his lessons were about how to behave no matter
what life brings; about how to wade into the unpredictable court of law
and deal with whatever happens with grace, courage and honesty. It is
the film's best achievement that it communicates that message with such
feeling.The relationships portrayed were superbly acted by all. At one point
during the movie, while wiping away a tear, I looked around the theater
and saw dozens of people around me doing the same. This movie was a treasure for many reasons, but the best one, I think,
is that I could believe it. I could believe in its major characters and
their relationships, and in the things they felt for one another, and
there were moments when the movie was witness to human growth and
change. I left the theater feeling good and warm, and with a certain
resolve to try to mend my own relationships and learn to start
listening better . . . watching the movie, I felt I was witnessing
something rare and valuable.
