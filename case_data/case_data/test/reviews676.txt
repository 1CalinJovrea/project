Vomit worthy

I saw the trailer and really wanted to like this movie. Who hasn't put
some cool music on, put their ear pods in, and pretended their life was
a couple times cooler than it really was?But after about 10 minutes of watching, I felt nauseous at the thought
of how something with so much potential, with such good intentions,
managed to screw it up so royally?The music part was a good idea - but at times it felt like it was
washing out the plot and emotional connection to the action happening
on screen. Like if the music wasn't there, I would just be looking at
actors blinking at each other.Then the fact that every baddie (the character's co-workers in the
movie) seems an already over-done clich√©d archetype. The sleazy couple
we're boring to watch, Jamie Foxx just seemed pointless and
aggravating, and the others were annoying.The main guy (Ansel Elgort's character) seemed determined to take as
much acting clues from Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker. He spent
most of the movie pouting and smirking which didn't help or damage
anything. It just seemed like he was in the wrong movie - like we were
accidentally looking at someone go about their day who's just waiting
for their laundry to be done or something. He seemed like a nice guy,
but kind of came across as an idiot.Then onto his relationship with the girl. The guy literally sees some
chick twice, exchanges a couple of minutes of conversation. Then he's
shooting people for her, they're running away together, and she
apparently has no problem taking part in car chases and attempting to
kill people. The girl doesn't have enough lines to show any personality
whatsoever and there is no sense-able connection between the characters
- none. Not to mention the fact that after this 3-or-so day romance (at
the climax of which) the dumb-ass lead goes to jail for a couple of
years, during these years the girl apparently has no life of her own
and is sat there waiting for him with open arms like it was just
yesterday. Because...love?The least aggravating character in the whole movie was the old man he
was looking after and even that seemed like it was somehow overdone,
though I'd never seen it before.Lastly, the guy's name is Baby. And boy, do they go on about it like
they'd just discovered gravity. The young couple's longest conversation
centers around the girl not being able to wrap her effing brain around
the fact that the guy is called Baby - not because it's a really stupid
name, no, apparently it's the best thing since tinned tuna. Because
they're both music buffs and now they can ride around and listen to
songs about Baby. (This was the point at which I pretty much wanted to
claw my ears off.)I really don't get it - how does this movie have a 8.3 rating? Am I in
the wrong and missing something that's glaring everyone else in the
face? I feel like it would not have been impossibly difficult to fix
these faults and make a really good movie with this base - it feels
like the final cut of Medellin in Entourage that the director refuses
to change. Maybe I'm a cynic, but this movie blows.That said - there were things that I liked. The pace was good, the
modern-yet-vintage timeless feeling of the setting and generally
anonymity of the setting that focused only on the story, the other
characters besides the main guy (who would have done so much better
with some better material), the diner motif, even the conversation
wasn't completely terrible 100% of the time.
