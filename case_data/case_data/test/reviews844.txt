Below average action movie

I guess I'm kind of a traditionalist, because I like a story to build,
including the part where you get to know the characters at least a
little bit.I go into movies with an open mind and just let the movie unfold. I
don't read reviews, although I come to IMDb to see the genres of movies
and the rating. When I saw this had a 7 star rating I felt safe going
to it.I'm guessing if you are a young child or a teenager this was
interesting as this has all very young actors, which in itself isn't
bad, but add that to a lack of story and no character development and I
felt like walking out of the theatre about half way in, and the urge
was growing the longer the movie went on. However I was there with my
wife, we were in the a theatre with food service and I was enjoying the
coke and popcorn, and I didn't want to bother my wife.People get stuck into a living area surrounded by maze, people find a
way out in the end after battling some strange mechanical creatures,
find out in the end of the movie they were put there as an experiment,
and an obvious lead to a sequel as woman says next is phase 2. That's
the spoiler. Oh I forgot, there was the character who was mostly an
antagonist and the person who pushes to get out via the maze at all
cost.
