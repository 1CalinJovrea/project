100% worth the watch!!!!!

I have seen this movie twice now and I wasn't disappointed. Most of my
expectations were met. It is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable
movies I have ever seen! I am a huge fan of the Lego Ninjago TV series
and enjoyed all the references and in- jokes the movie made to it. The
first two Lego movies had better story structure but I honestly prefer
this movie over the Lego batman movie. In my opinion, this movie is
being picked on unfairly by most critics. The story structure is a
little all over the place but the pace of the movie is really good.
Also, the voice acting is amazing and the animation, soundtrack and
writing is awesome! But I feel the movie would have benefited from
giving the other ninja some more character development. The movie was
mostly focused on Lloyd and his evil father Garmadon and the other
ninja weren't really necessary to that plot. Also the editing was a bit
sloppy. All that being said. The movie actually worked. AND IT WAS
EPIC!!!!! I enjoyed this movie 10/10 but because of a few plot holes
and the strange story structure I rate the movie a 9/10. As someone in
their late teens, I highly recommend going to watch the Lego Ninjago
movie! It's a movie for all ages! It's got heart. It's hilarious! and
the characters are awesome!!!!!
