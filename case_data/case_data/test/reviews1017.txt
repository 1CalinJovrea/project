What a waste of a good story.

I cannot begin to list all the things wrong with this movie. Granted
the acting was very good, however, it was the longest 2 hours of my
life. I kept waiting for something 'good' to happen and it never did. I
believe this could have been a wonderful American story, but was
nothing short of a huge let down. Really disappointed in how much this
movie was hyped up. Painfully slow, and felt like two hours of literal
purgatory. I am sure that his true story was much better and could have
emphasized what his family was going through at the same time. Or
possible they could have shown what the news had reported about him,
and what the airforce was doing to look for him. Wish I could erase
this one from my memory. The worst part is I feel this man was done a
real disservice to his memory and honor.
