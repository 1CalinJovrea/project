2 Guns and 2 Actors...

"2 Guns" is an entertaining movie in which I liked both of the two
actors who are on leading roles and these are Denzel Washington and
Mark Wahlberg.Especially I liked the plot of this movie that kept me in tense and
this is a really cool feeling when a movie can make you feel it. In
this movie we have many action scenes, many gun shootings and of course
humor between the actors.Finally I want to tell you that if you want to see an entertaining
movie which will make you sometimes laugh and on the other hand make
you fell this tense I talked about previously, then you have to see it!
