Amazing

When it first came out I read the book, cried then went to see the
movie where I cried yet again. The chemistry between the characters in
the film is one of those which I don't think you see very often in a
film. Normally films which are based on books aren't actually that
similar but I thought it was fairly similar. I loved the story line and
the drama in the film. It's most definitely one that I would watch
again. I would recommend it to friends and family being the socialite
that I am. Typical college girl me. Sigh. Look I you want to rate the
film just watch it because I personally thought it was fabulously
entertaining. At times it was slightly boring and hard to understand,
although I would've liked a tiny bit more action. Just a little.
