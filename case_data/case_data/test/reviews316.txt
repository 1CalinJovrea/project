An unbelievable take on the home invasion horror

To begin with the good points some of the acting was good and the audio
portrayal of deafness was well done but that's about it. Onto the bad.
There were so many terrible decisions made by all of the characters I
didn't know which to root for by the end. The villain and the victims
had so many missed opportunities in their aims of kill or be killed
that their actions just became unbelievable. This took away any
suspense that other reviews have mentioned and left me waiting for the
credits to roll. If you are looking for a decent house invasion horror
then avoid this one. Although it has a different take with a deaf
victim there are many better films out there worthy of your time...The
Strangers, Funny Games, Last House on The Left to name a few.
