This wasn't Pan

've never hyped myself up for a movie more than Pan. I saw the trailer
the day it came out and watched every trailer since then. Well now I've
had my chance to watch it... And well...The best part of the movie was the credits. The music is catchy...
That's about it. The animation and graphical affects were alright I
guess. And some parts of the story weren't too bad. However the amount
of plot holes made me want to cry, the relationship between Hook and
Tiger lily, and Hook and Pan, and Pan and Tiger Lily, and all of them
with Blackbeard was poor. The best character in it was Smeeh, but that
was only in the first half of the movie, so anything past that first
half for him was garbage. When I sat down and started watching it, I was disappointed by the
beginning, but I sat through it anyway, in hopes that the second half
would be phenomenal... And I can confirm it really wasn't. Nothing in
the film made any sense. Nothing was ever explored or explained.
Nothing was ever adopted on to get the main characters into their
positions before we get to the Peter Pan that everyone knows where it
is Pan vs Hook. There was none of that.Hooks accent... Hooks freaking accent... Oh my god. It sounded so fake
it was painful. I hate writing this review, but I can honestly say I
don't think I've been more disappointed in the film... Whoever made the
trailers deserves the biggest pay rise ever, because the trailers did
look amazing, the trailer soundtrack was amazing. The movie did not
look amazing, the soundtrack was also not amazing...That's another thing, WHY WAS THE FILM A MUSICAL?! I didn't sit down to
watch this so I could watch Blackbeard sing songs that hadn't been
invented yet. Because I think three songs were in this film and every
time I heard one, I was more tempted to turn it off.Like I said, the graphics were good, the story telling wasn't that bad
and costume design was also pretty good and sets and stuff. But the
film as a whole makes me final thoughts 5/10
