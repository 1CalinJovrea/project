A handsomely old-fashioned sea-faring yarn that could do with a lot more character work, Ron Howard's Man-versus-Nature saga finds its own heart somewhat lost at sea

'In the Heart of the Sea' is not 'Moby Dick'. Instead, it is based on
Nathaniel Philbrick's non-fiction book of the same name, which was
itself drawn from real events surrounding the Nantucket whaling ship
Essex that was allegedly sunk by a giant sperm whale in the western
Pacific on November 20, 1820. Out of the 21 men who made it out alive,
only eight eventually survived the ordeal in the open sea, and there
are accounts from two  one, the ship's first mate Owen Chase; and two,
a 14-year-old cabin boy named Thomas Nickerson who waited 55 years to
write his side of the story which ended up lost until 1980.Even though young Melville's (Ben Whishaw) interview with the truculent
Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) bookends the film, let it first be known
that these scenes are in fact fiction, for there is no way that the
real-life Melville could have access to Nickerson's memoir, since the
book 'Moby Dick' was published in 1851. Notwithstanding that it is a
classical framing device for a tall tale, there is no denying that
these portions are redundant and quite the unnecessary distraction in
between critical points of the Essex's doomed voyage, redeemed only
somewhat by Gleeson's performance of such dignity and sadness at the
dire circumstances that he had to confront in order to survive on few
provisions for 90 days.It is Gleeson's narration that brings us back to 1820 Nantucket, where
we are first introduced to Chris Hemsworth's Chase, a proud whaler
excited at the prospect of commanding his own ship. Alas, its business
owners who had before promised Owen his boat decide to make him
nursemaid Pollard (Benjamin Walker), whose only qualification is that
his father is the company's patron. Despite his frustration and his
wife's (Charlotte Riley) reservations about that particular expedition,
Owen eventually sets sail with George and the rest of the crew, which
includes his best friend Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy), the young
Nickerson (Tom Holland, or soon-to-be 'Spidey'), and George's cousin
Owen Coffin (Frank Dillane).As expected, tension soon builds between the experienced first mate and
the inexperienced but eager-to-prove-himself captain. In the first of
three major action sequences, George orders the Essex to sail head on
into a squall against Owen's advice as a test of mettle for the crew,
an ill decision that almost capsizes the ship and seemingly pits the
two men squarely against each other. Thrilling as that setup may be,
Charles Leavitt's screenplay gives the officer- versus-officer conflict
short shrift in the later acts.Losing no momentum, Owen soon chances upon the sound of whales exhaling
air through their blowholes; how Owen and his men kill and capture a
full-grown male is shown in exhilarating detail, as much as the later
operation to harvest its fats for oil is displayed in full gory glory
(especially a sequence where the young Nickerson is thrust down a hole
in the whale's head to scoop out the prized sperm oil). Yet, bad luck
immediately after forces George to bring the Essex into uncharted
waters to hunt for pods, and the last of the big-bang sequences you'll
get is the encounter with the big one, described by a Spanish captain
the crew meet on a stopover at Atacames who lost his arm and six other
men as measuring almost 100 metres in length and whose hide is
alabaster white.Howard and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle do not disappoint; that
single encounter is single-handedly the highlight of the entire film,
edge-of-your-seat gripping, breathtakingly staged, and enough to
silence the hubris of any man who thinks he is superior to Mother
Nature's creations. It ends with the Essex in flames and the surviving
crewmen in three whaleboats, and so begins a much more sombre and
deliberately paced final act which chronicles the harrowing aftermath,
with the men forced to brave storms, starvation, panic and despair. It
is here that we find out just what has been disturbing Nickerson all
these years  when staring starvation in the face, the men would be
forced to eat their dead shipmates or draw lots for one of them to be
sacrificed.Hemsworth's dramatic weight loss to play a sunken Owen is clearly
evident, as is the dedication by the other cast members to portray
their characters' afflictions with utmost realism. Yet, coming after
films such as 'Castaway' or even 'Life of Pi', we'd be lying if we said
it was new or surprising. Both of those movies however managed a deeper
emotional resonance because they gave us characters which we actually
care about, the same of which cannot be said here. Owen's obsession
with the giant whale that seems to be following them is never quite
explained, nor for the matter why the animal shown to evoke some sort
of mythical terror would do so. How the friction between Owen and
George gives way to mutual respect is also glossed over, and the same
goes for the discord between George and his cousin whom the former
lectures earlier for abusing familial privilege.In the absence of more compelling character drama, all we are left with
is an old-fashioned seafaring adventure and an ageless tale of men
forced to do the unthinkable in order to survive the odds of nature.
Being the consummate storyteller he is, Howard excels in both regards,
and there is never a dull moment in his film. Yet, as much as this
story of ordinary men pitted against their own moral fiber fits
squarely within Howard's oeuvre, it ultimately comes up much less
because it fails to define the men themselves, or their raison d'etre
for going at each other. Ironically, 'In the Heart of the Sea' could do
with a lot more heart at its core, seeing as how it wants to be more,
much more, than just the battle with the whale that was 'Moby Dick'.
