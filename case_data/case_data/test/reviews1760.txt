This film is just for fun.

Yea it might make you feel dizzy, you might get taken out of the
experience when you see a ridiculous excuse for a cut, but the movie
was an experiment. The people who created the film set out to do
something pretty original and I think the results are pretty good, the
story is trash and the effects aren't superb but it isn't like the film
is taking itself seriously. Play this at a party sometime, or with a
couple friends to show them this amazing attempt at a completely first
person film.
