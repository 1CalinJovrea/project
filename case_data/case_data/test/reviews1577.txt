Greatest Movie of 2017

After seeing this movie for the first time this Friday, I immediately
felt compelled to watch it a second time in a more thorough way (which
I did the next day). The movie is so well structured, with perfect
dialog, great cast (perfectly suited for their roles), outstanding
tempo and content density, excellent cinematography and an amazing
performance from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, that I feel forced to claim
this is the best movie of this year. Really Oscar award material. The
IMDb rate so far is completely understated (7.4 at the time I write
this review). A MUST WATCH.
