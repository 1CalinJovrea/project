The epitome of forced comedy

Why Him? is another entry into the "why these actors have to lower
themselves?" category of comedies. The same tired setup with the
repetitive jokes that lacks wit and fun. It is mind boggingly ludicrous
that Bryan Cranston couldn't get something out of this movie.Good: Megan Mullally is clearly trying her best here in the thankless
wife role. Zoey Deutch is really cute so there's that.Bad: It takes the situation to its extreme and it sucks the humor out
of the movie. Overly exaggerated scenarios that never work accompanied
by James Franco's overly stupid character does nothing to create a
laugh. Bryan Cranston is relegated to having an open mouthed look of
confusion on his face for the entire movie. The brother character
could've been taken out of the movie and nothing would have changed
that's how useless he is here. Keegan-Michael Key is wasted in a
thankless role. The movie goes on and on that it had maybe three false
endings that made it feel like it was going to be four hours long. They
also try to add a feminist message of sorts that feels shoved in there
when looking at the barrage of childish humor before then that it
doesn't work. Insert tired fart and sex jokes and we have the perfect
recipe for pain.Overall, skip this. Cranston just puts on a confused look and gets a
paycheck, Franco just curses and acts stupid, the rest of the actors
here have nothing to do, and the jokes never hit. It tries to have a
message, but it was too little too late.
