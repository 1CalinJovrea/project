An American Battle Royale!

In the future all wars have ended, but famine and poverty still remain
in a new North Amercia, which has been split into 12 Districts. To
appease the people, and pay tribute to the fallen, Capitol City have
devised The Hunger Games, in which 2 children from each District are
chosen to fight to the death live on TV.The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12, and
we see them whisked off to Capitol City - a pastel coloured "Willy
Wonka" style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes, have
bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they
are treated like royalty, and trained in readiness for the games.Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game
begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese
classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale' - but without as much blood
or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain
an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those "playing"
the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and "fun"
for the viewers.The film takes a long time to really hit its stride - the opening
sequences seemingly go on forever - and there is no doubt that this
film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale', as well as nods to the
original 'Rollerball' (in as much as war has been outlawed and violence
has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the
masses) and even 'Logans Run', but it has enough in it to make it a
stand-up, worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is
the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative, where
- in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their "Blood and
Circuses" - love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.The production is very good - the future Capitol City looks amazing -
whilst the acting ranges from excellent (the young actress playing the
lead role is very good), to screen chewing (Woody Harrleson eats his
heart out!!). The other thing about the film is its length - at almost
2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good
half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or
drama. Worth seeing definitely, but make sure you watch it in a
comfortable cinema (or else take a cushion!)
