Blade Runner 2049 - Movie Review: A New-Age Sci-Fi Classic

For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for
people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On
the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are
just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this
film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to
stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard
to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but
that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone.
For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie,
here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. Before dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character,
there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of
the events in the past, but even though that information is given to
you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the
first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set
out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story,
Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this
review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably
involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell
and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so
let's get technical. If not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the
best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of
the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind- blowing scenery
constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for
this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience,
the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly
detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent,
but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at
the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences
members will. Again, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford)
enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was
brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans
may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at
in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan
Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the
wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison
Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well
as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film
was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about
Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as
though the served the story quite nicely. In the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world,
but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a
possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are
those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is
1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often,
especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed
in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a
superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017,
and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot
of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across
the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long,
this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it
connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you
know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the
original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough.
