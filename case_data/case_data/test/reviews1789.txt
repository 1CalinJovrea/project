Like it, but not news anymore

The Lego Movie was very enjoyable, so was the "side" story about
Batman, but this one is kind of not news anymore, yes it is a different
Lego universe and yes it is fun for both kids and adults, but something
is missing to make it really good.Location, seating & time: Palads, KÃ¸benhavn, Denmark - Bio 1, row 8
