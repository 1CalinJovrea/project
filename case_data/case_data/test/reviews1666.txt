The critics must have been paid off, but what about the IMDb users?

Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of horror films. The trouble
is they are rarely good. This piece of excrement is even
miscategorized. It is not a horror film at all. There is no story,
there are absolutely no thrills, no scares, no characters of any
interest, and the cinematography is so dark throughout that it is
impossible in some scenes to make out what is happening. More than an
hour of the film takes place in one room. The actors mumble their
lines. The film is dull from beginning to end. Do not waste your money
on this impostor of a movie. What is Patrick Stewart doing here? He is
totally miscast as a Neo-Nazi. I don't think it is possible to add
spoilers to any reviews of this film, because nothing happens. This was
95 minutes of my life that I'll never get back!
