Crappy political movie

Worst film i have seen in many many years. The producer wants me to
like the "good guys" but they are tattooed criminal thugs and murderers
ruining their own life on earth.It seems highly leftist ideological crappy movie where all darker skin
people are left to their destiny on earth, while white people (and one
Indian woman) moved to this gigantic space station called Elysium. And
now the its so sorry for the dark skin people that they needs to invade
the evil "white" space station to get cured from various diseases.After the invasion is complete suddenly everyone is happy, and we can
all rejoice.Well this movie is the worst movie i have seen in at least 20 years.
Its really remarkable that people actually like this garbage movie.
