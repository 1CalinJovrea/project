"Well that escalated quickly"

Opening scene - girl driving - 30 seconds later she's hanging off a
revine, her car ready to plunge into the abyss.This movie is relentless - it is a hard-core disaster movie with almost
zero characterisation and 100% action-driven chaos with Hollywood's CGI
department on overdrive.And it makes absolutely no apology for this - nor should it.The fireworks kick in from the start and never let up - buildings
tumble, tsunamis flood, and heroic Dwayne Johnson, amusingly
invulnerable to any form of damage (the man doesn't suffer a scratch),
does his level best to save the day as a well-placed search and rescue
veteran.Sure the water effects are a bit unconvincing (Hollywood still doesn't
seem to know how to create convincing white froth - it always looks
like what it often actually is; smoke) and there's no real need for a
'villain' in the story, but who cares.This is Hollywood at its blockbuster best. A brainless loud thrillfest
which engages the senses (if not the mind) throughout.Enjoy it for what it is. If you're watching it, you know what to
expect.
