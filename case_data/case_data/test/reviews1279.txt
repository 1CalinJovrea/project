Brilliant

I have been on IMDb for a number of years and always rate the movies i
watch. I have not written many reviews,however i think i needed to
write this one. This film is brilliant. I haven't read the book but the
story was excellent and having read reviews i am disappointed with the
negative reviews of this masterclass in story and film making. Do not
be put off folks, this was a real thriller mystery and deserves a big
9.the acting was superb,and having been in a drunken state myself for a
time they couldn't have put it more realistic. Enjoy its really good,
please check my review scores before taking my opinion,i don't like
crap as you will see.
