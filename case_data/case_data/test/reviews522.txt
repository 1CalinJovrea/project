Paul Walker would be proud!

Furious 7: Without a doubt, this is the biggest fast and furious movie
to date. Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car
scenes are even faster, and of course, "The Rock" is bigger. Furious 7
was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker
was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed
and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue
and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car
sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he
dedicated his life to.What I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to "The Rock's"
lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly
as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his
entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass
he is if for some reason you can't already tell. It is amusing still,
but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few
helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and
love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows
Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main
villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never
really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in
the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets,
he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can't ask for
anything more.The action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest
buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically
fly a car straight through three of them and you can't ask for more
than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should
know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not
an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin
Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end
shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time. The acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They
all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure,
some may not consider it "real" acting but the actors did their part
for the movie and you can't ask for anything more. Also, as I said
earlier, Paul Walker's send off really was tremendous and many of the
audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the
end as we all listen to the song "See You Again," which I think might
be nominated for an Oscar for best original song. If you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown
in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a
movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend
you see Furious 7 in theaters. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com
