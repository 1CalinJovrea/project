i cant tell you how bad this movie is. it reminded me of a weekend at
Bernie's but that was a lot funnier and everything about that seemed to
gel where this didn't. if you want to watch a funny movie.. this isn't
it. I found the some of the characters to be very annoying and not even
funny. I couldn't watch all of it due to it being that bad.
