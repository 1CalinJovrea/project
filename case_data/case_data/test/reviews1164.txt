Excellent - Definitely would watch it anytime.

I have been a fan of the Men in Black movies since the original
released in 1997. When MIB-II was finally out in 2002, I wondered why
it took so long as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith seemed to work so
well together, and their characters had that just right mix of
complementing but contradicting personalities.Jones has long been a favorite of mine with some other highlight
performances being the delightfully crazy villain in Under Siege (1992)
and the hard nosed cop in The Fugitive (1993) and U.S. Marshalls
(1998). His ability to make a facial expression the equivalent of the
picture's 1000 words imho is up there with Humphrey Bogart.Smith has distinguished himself in action, comedy, and drama films
alike. He is a quite versatile actor whose movies I will gladly check
out just because he is starring.With MIB 3 coming another 10 years after MIB II, I once again wonder
what took so long. While Jones's part as "K" is not so prominent as in
the prior releases, he does well as the present day character. Smith
follows the formula as "J" although the interaction with old "K" is a
tad forced.The pleasant realization is that Josh Brolin performs admirably as the
past, younger "K." Brolin is certainly a fine actor in his own right,
but his effective portrayal of Jones' character is nothing short of
remarkable. The key to the plot is that Brolin is "K" before whatever
happened that turned "K" into such a detached curmudgeon.Also juicy was the villain's part done by Jermaine Clement as Boris
(the animal).Besides all the action and suspense you expect with the good guys vs.
bad guy alien stuff, and the touches of comedy here and there to break
it up, there is a dramatic and quite poignant and touching twist that
comes out of nowhere that answers why "K" appears to be such an
unemotional person, and why "K" has such regard for "J." Top quality
actors and performances, well done script, yeah, this one's a keeper.
