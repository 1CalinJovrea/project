Wish I had known before I watched

This is a complete spoiler, so don't read this if you don't want to
know. I wish I hadn't spent valuable time watching this film. It's
simply soft-core porn. I am not a prude or homophobic... but so much of
this movie was devoted to perversion (the uncle and his book buyers)
and titillation. I just wish I had watched something else. I admit it's
wonderfully made. The storytelling was superb. But, icky.
