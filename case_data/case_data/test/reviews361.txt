A bit depressing! 6/10

Review: What a, surprisingly, deep movie! I was expecting an upbeat,
fantasy movie but it turned out to be slightly depressing but
interesting at the same time. Anyway, Lewis MacDougall plays a young
kid called Conor, who lives with his mum, played by Felicity Jones, who
is suffering with cancer. Whilst being bullied at school, his grandma,
played by Sigourney Weaver, tells him that he has to live with her, but
he just wants to stay with his mum, who has to go through severe cancer
treatment because everything that the doctors have tried, hasn't seemed
to work. Conor then see's a magical Yew tree, Monster, who promises to
tell him 3 stories, only if Conor tells him the fourth, so everyday at
12:07, the tree appears, even when Conor moves to his grandma's. When
his dad comes over from America, he tells his Conor that he is unable
to live with him, so Conor is forced to stay with his grandma, against
his wishes. After the tree tells him the final story, Conor tells the
tree his final story, and he finds out that his mum also saw the
magical tree, which saved his life, and made him face his inner demons.
Its quite a magical story, which does have some touching moments, but
it's quite slow and there wasn't enough scenes with Conor and the tree.
With that aside, the tree did look amazing, and Liam Neeson's voice was
perfect for the role. Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver also put in
emotional performances, along with the young Lewis MacDougall, who was
talking to a green screen most of the time, so he had the toughest role
of them all. Although I found the film to be touching, you do have to
be in the right frame of mind to watch it, because you are left feeling
quite glum when it's over. It's still worth a watch, mainly because of
the tree, but the director could have installed some lighter issues to
lighten the mood. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by J.A. Bayona, who also brought you
the Orphanage in 2007, and the Impossible in 2012. He also directed a
couple of episodes of Penny Dreadful, so he is obviously coming from a
dark place, hence the way he made this movie. I always like seeing kids
being kids, so it was hard to see Conor having to handle adult issues
at such a young age. On top of everything that was happening at home,
his school life was also hard for the young lad, so he really didn't
have anywhere to turn. That's why the tree really was Conor's saviour,
and I personally think it was the saviour of the movie. I also think
that a lot of people was expecting more from the film, because it
didn't smash the box office, as expected, but I didn't hear many
negative reports about it.Budget: $43million Worldwide Gross: $46.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their fantasy/dramas,
starring Lewis MacDougall, Sigourney Weaver, Felicity Jones, Toby
Kebbell and the voice of Liam Neeson. 6/10
