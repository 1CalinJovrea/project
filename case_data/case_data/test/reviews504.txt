You Need To Abandon The World's Logic To Enjoy This

If you are expecting this movie to be realistic and logic, then you are
making a huge mistake. Put it in your mind set that these peoples are
video game characters/anime/superheroes and everything will start to
make sense.I was somehow thought that this movie is going to concentrates more
about Han's death and there's some interesting plot that leads to the
event. But nope, thats not how it went as it pretty straight forward
action movie with no surprising plot and twist.For the action, I could not imagine what would they brought after those
tanks in the 6th movie. And I was not disappointed, free fall cars,
tower to tower car jumping and the regeneration power of Dominic
Toretto! Talking about the crazy stuff in the movie, how the heck Dom
is not dead after he drives his car off the cliff? In every movie I see
people is sure to die unless the get out of the car somehow. How the
heck a Somalian terrorist get a military grade helicopter and a jet
powered Predator drone? And how the hell a 23 years old hacker girl can
just develops the God's Eye thats are so powerful that CIA become
absolute? Seriously guys, you need to abandon the world's logic and watch this
movie as if you are watching The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Expecting
this movie to be realistic and logic is a great mistake.As for the send off scene for Paul Walker, its truly an emotional
moments in the movie. For the people who is not a fan to this movie or
doesn't even know who Paul Walker is then they probably doesn't get it
whats going on here. But for me, I barely holding my tears as I watch
it. What a long journey it is~ For Paul
