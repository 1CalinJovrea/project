A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun

'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed
by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's
definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger
on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up
falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't
quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff
in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best
performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage
daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys
Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who
will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny,
thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It
is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two
trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than
I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way.
