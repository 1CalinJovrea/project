A great buildup, a very disappointing ending.

Immediate reasons why I did not like this film: the trailers were
misleading, we were given very little time with many of the main
characters, and there was no good climax for the buildup the audience
was given.I think most would agree with me when they say that they went into this
movie thinking it was going to be a terrifying adventure deep into the
catacombs encountering demonic spirits. That plays on two things:
claustrophobia and the fear of evil, which has been done before, but is
nevertheless a pretty good formula for generating fear. That's not what
you get from this film: instead, you get a sort of mishmash between
National Treasure and Don't Look Now with a dash of "the power was
inside you all along!" This film is not about opening a portal to Hell,
it is not about fighting off evil spirits.There are many characters whom we get little time with--Papillion and
his friends--and things that seem important but are never explained.
The strange dark-eyed girl who walks out of the nightclub, the creepy
choir, the girl who stalked Benji, the hooded figure, the screaming
statues...what is their purpose? We were never given an explanation for
Benji's or the Mole's murders. In the end, Scarlet figures out that
part of the reason they are trapped is because each of them has
something tormenting them inside--her father's suicide, the little
brother drowning, and the bastard child--and when they admit it, or
accept it, they escape. We got a glimpse of Papillion's torment, but it
was never explained, nor were Benji's or Papillion's girlfriend's.
There are simply too many things left unexplained at the end of the
movie. Speaking of the end--abrupt. That's what it was. The movie abruptly
ended when I--and everyone else in the theater--assumed that we were
just getting to the climax. "Finally, now that they understand what to
do, they can confront whatever is tormenting them." Nope. The three
remaining characters recite what their worst memory/fear is, climb out
of a hole, and they're back in Paris, safe and sound. That's it. There
is no devil, no demon, no cult, no evil stalking them. Some people may
try to explain this away by saying that the theme of the movie is that
the "x" was "inside of you all along", whether that "x" was power or
fear or demons, but what it boils down to is poor characterization and
storytelling.
