Highly recommended

If you've been following Mr. Anderson's relatively short career, you'll
find more of the same here: a film that is full of quirkiness, which I
find to be parables of the troubles we encounter in life. I came to
this film without any expectations, having read nothing about it in the
news so I was pleasantly surprised that the main protagonists are a
couple of tweens. Any fears of mine finding a sappy or saccharine story
were vanquished and replaced with wonderment following the journey of
the two main characters. Both actors didn't seem to have formal
training but this didn't stop them from serving the story well. It is
down to the genius of Mr. Anderson capturing their human performances
which are nothing less than beautiful.I can't recommend this film highly enough!
