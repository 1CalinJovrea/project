Puzzling at times, but not the disaster some are making it out to be

I can't deny that I had high hopes for this film and it disappointed me
on many levels, but I do think some of the previous reviews are
exaggerating just how bad 'The Snowman' is. The film is messy, even
puzzling at times, and very frustrating to watch. It lacks focus and
struggles to find its feet early on. It also contains some baffling
individual scenes that contribute nothing to the plot or film as a
whole.It improves as it goes along and, contrary to what a lot of others have
said, I thought the ending was relatively well done. The film is more
of a mystery than a horror and it did keep me interested and guessing
until the end... though I'm sure the stunning Scandinavian scenery did
the film a lot of favours in terms of watchability. 'The Snowman' is
disappointing, but it does have some pluses and is not as bad as some
are making it out to be.
