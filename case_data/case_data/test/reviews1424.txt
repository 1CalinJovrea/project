Great Movie! Never read the book

OK so I postponed watching this movie due to the harsh comments it had
gotten from many people about how it wasn't worth watching and I have
to say I completely disagree with them! I watched this movie and loved the story and will admit even got
sad/happy at points following the characters growth and change in the
movie. It took me to a place that I had never thought about and I will
say that, that is something when there are so many movies out these
days. For those who give it crap for not being like the book I do have to say
that look at most any book to movie series i.e Harry
Potter/Twilight/Hunger Games there are things that have to be left out
or reworked in order for a movie to go through it will never be EXACTLY
the same. Some things just don't work in the movie world. Again I loved this movie and would love to see a sequel come out of it.
(Yes I do plan on reading the book anyways.)
