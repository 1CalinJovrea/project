Critics are too harsh

Don't get me wrong, no movie adaptation of a novel is going to be
perfect and make everyone happy, but I feel as though the critics have
been way too harsh on this movie and it's actors/actresses. Though,
this seems like a trend with YA movies, beside Harry Potter I tend to
see critics rip and tear apart teen movies like birds feasting on a
dead carcass...I swear they all get together and decide to do it as a
group. (just saying) Anyhow, I wouldn't say TMI was perfect, but it was
the first in the series and I hope they get a chance to fix their minor
mistakes and release City of Ashes. I enjoyed that book and would love
to see it brought to life.The actors: I did not see anything wrong with any of them save the
actor who played Magnus Bane, he wasn't terrible, but definitely lacked
the personality that he had in the books. His character always made me
laugh and I guess Godfrey Gao kind of fell a little flat and almost
mechanic on screen. I thought everyone else fit well and acted well, I
don't see the issues that many others seem to see. I'm no film critic,
but I am a fan and a lover of movies.The Plot: Although most of the movie seemed to stick with the book they
surprisingly changed a lot at the end. For example, Hodge telling
Valentine to lie to Clary and Jace about being sister and brother
versus Hodge actually believing that they were brother and sister after
Valentine tells him this. I guess I can understand why they did it, but
it, to me, did not have that gut wrenching "oh crap!" moment I felt
when reading the books, even though as a reader I hoped and kind of
figured it wasn't true, especially when the character of Sebastian
shows up, it all starts to piece together from there. Though, I cannot
understand why they did it...the incest reason? In case they never made
another movie? Fear of confusing people? I don't know, I wasn't a fan,
but the changes like this one definitely did not ruin the movie for me.I enjoyed the action sequences and even thought the "cheesey" romance
scene in the garden was kind of cute, I thought the kiss between Jace
and Clary was pretty passionate and personally felt as though Lily
Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower had good chemistry. (I have to admit I
liked Jamie already from his role on Camelot) Well, this is just my
opinion and two cents I just really hope that the movie itself does
well with the fans and that a second film is made because I, for one
will be devastated to see such an amazing series from such an
incredible author be shut down after only one movie. :(
