Soul destroying drivel......

It was inevitable that the sequel would be imminent out within a couple
of years to keep the memories of the first film fresh in people's
minds.But my memories of that film were of this reboot being a complete waste
of time, but with a decent set piece involving snow, and nothing more
than a Michael Bay produced cash machine with no soul.The turtles face a new challenge when Shredder escapes from custody and
joins forces with Baxter Stockman, a mad scientist who plans to use a
serum to take over the world. Along for the ride are Bebop and Rocksteady, two dimwitted henchmen who
provide plenty of muscle. Luckily, the turtles have their own allies in April O'Neil, Vernon
Fenwick and Casey Jones, a hockey-masked vigilante...... As the pizza-loving heroes prepare for battle, the notorious Krang also
emerges to pose an even greater threat.And this time it's pretty much the same, apart from the fact that there
isn't a decent set piece in its ridiculously long running time, in
fact, you'd be hard pressed to call this a actual film as it has not
coherence, no narrative, it just goes from one place to another, and
for a film focusing on giant Ninja Turtles, it's one of the most boring
experiences I've had at the cinema this year.It's a CG nightmare, with soulless, hate worthy characters spouting and
idiotic script to lifeless looking CG characters with attitude.It's as if Bay has just made one long commercial for toys, cars and
clothing, and we've had to pay for the pleasure. But Bay has really outdone himself with this one, it's actually worse
than Age Of Exhaustion, and by looking at the box office for this,
people are becoming tired of his action movies.Really, if you were a fan of the Turtles back in the day, seek out
Secret Of The Ooze, at least it has Vanilla Ice in it.
