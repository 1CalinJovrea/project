Grobian movie.

Is all about abusing, killing and this is done by a 12 years old in the
entire movie. What can I say, this kind of movie shouldn't be on
market.Where is the comedy in a movie that is all about disturbing images
involving teens? In the music? Oh well, you need more than funny music
to point out a funny situation. You must have a really twisted mind to
find this even a movie.
