"That's My Boy" does not deserve lingering hate from Jack and Jill

This is the funniest movie Sandler has done in a long time, simple as
that. I get that people were PO'd about Jack and Jill, and I'm no
fanboy of Adam Sandler.. it was incredibly bad. The ratings and reviews
of this movie seem to me like lingering hate from that, or from people
that gave up on him long ago. Maybe I'm wrong, either way I doubt that
anyone who liked his earlier stuff or Grandmas Boy, Hall Pass, The
Hangover, Horrible Bosses etc.. wont' like this.The cast varied greatly from many well known actors and actresses to
current top stars and new faces, they all played their parts really
well.Adam Sandler has redeemed himself, That's My Boy is hilarious.
