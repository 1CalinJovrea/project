Boring, Uneventful & Slow

Steve Jobs has one of the worst movie titles in film history. Of all
the names for the marketing team to come up with, this was the weakest
one. If the Ashton Kutcher movie hadn't been released already, I am
betting the farm this would have been named Jobs. That being said, the
movie plays REALLY long- and until the ending, it's a talky bore.Michael Fassbender plays the title role, and although he's a fine
actor- Christian Bale (the original choice), should have been cast.
Nonetheless Fassbender does what he can. We witness how the co-founder
of Apple is during three behind-the-scenes unveiling's for his product,
all before the 2000s. When watching the movie, I was reminded of The Iron Lady with Meryl
Streep as Margaret Thatcher. Both that film and this center around a
famous public figure, but the movies aren't really about them or told
as biopics. They are more personalized and experimental. Streep's movie
is really about how a woman deals with dementia and her love for her
husband. Fassbender's movie really is about how a man deals with
narcissism and his love for his daughter. Both films are uneven and
messy because the focus is too grounded in emotion, when the audience
is more interested in their overall lives and not just these niche
moments. Because of this, both movies are not that interesting to
watch- but are elevated by strong performances. Streep won an Oscar for
her role, and Fassbender will be nominated.Kate Winslet, with an uneven accent, plays Steve Jobs' assistant who is
the only person who can really stand up to him (well, that's a lie-
since Seth Rogan and Jeff Daniels also have cat fights). I was a little
annoyed with Winslet's personality, and awful hairdo. She starts
getting on my nerves when she threatens to quit unless Steve can patch
things up with his daughter. Any professional knows not to mix business
with personal- and her job is to work for Apple, not be a therapist.
Winslet is okay in her scenes, but her character is unlikable. If I
were Steve Jobs, I would have fired her.Then there's the business of Lisa- the daughter, and I guess the TRUE
emotional back-story for the movie's purpose. Forget that I'm worth
billions of dollars, I better run after my little girl and remind her
that I plan to invent the iPod for her songs and that I remembered some
dumb painting she made on the Macintosh when she was 5. The daughter is
also unnerving because Steve Jobs was paying child support, and didn't
love the Mother anymore. He owes nothing to his daughter if he doesn't
wish to donate- but he attempts to show he cares, and she eventually
folds in the parking lot (which looks just like the parking lot in the
Tom Cruise movie Vanilla Sky).Steve Jobs is talky and overtly uncinematic, so I was restless when
viewing it. There is nothing happening but a lot of nerdy white people
talking really fast and using big words to impress folks. Oh, sound
like The Social Network all over again? Well, Aaron Sorkin wrote that
too. He's not a good screenwriter- he's an elitist who has a big
vocabulary. But he sucks at creating characters that are believable.
Fassbender and Daniels aside, this movie is one of 2015's biggest
disappointments. FINAL GRADE: D
