A slightly better sequel, but still a failure in taking advantage of the premise

I hated The Purge because it took an interesting premise and it
resorted on making a cliché home invasion movie that in itself was all
just stupid people doing stupid things. This sequel actually has the
premise of Purge night throughout the city with multiple characters
which sounds much better. Now this sequel definitely shows a lot of
promise, but it falls apart like the original thanks to clichés and
dumb characters.Good: Frank Grillo is the one good part of the movie. He takes charge
and is great as an action hero. I would have watched the movie if it
all about him.Bad: The movie once again doesn't do much with the premise. It expands
to a wider setting of the city, but it just focuses on dumb horror
clichés doing dumb things. You have characters out and about on Purge
day mere hours before it starts when they should have been inside a
barricaded home since the morning. Add to that that aside from Grillo,
everyone is either just boring or annoying so there's not much in terms
of people to root for. The message of poor vs rich here is very heavy
handed and the movie violence isn't that effective and mostly relying
on poor CGI.Overall, while it is a tad better than the original, it still suffers
from lackluster violence, dumb characters, and a predictable plot.
