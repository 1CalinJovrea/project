Washington nails it

Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80â€²s TV series The
Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open
window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to
Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence;
for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word.
Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold
something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin
at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you
understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set
in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a
regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage
prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into
something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within
him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her
nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly
brings on the pain.Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these
sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every
murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue,
and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his
victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even
timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or
less.And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that
begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to
see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew
openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that
McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian
mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this
stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really
matter?As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic
strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi
Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers,
and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her
character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting
part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and
she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book
Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more
extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who
pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and
to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a
small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches
"blink-and-you-miss him" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like
Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines
(though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met
with cuts in the editing room).If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled
personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really?
The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but
isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin
characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel
Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous
vengeance.- See more at: www.mediumraretv.org
