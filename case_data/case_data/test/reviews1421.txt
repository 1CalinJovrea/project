Disgrace

Before I went to go see it, I already knew it couldn't compete with the
original. But this actually was worse than I expected. What was great
about the original just like Terminator is that it was grimy, dark and
although robot cops offcourse aren't that realistic they we're not
beyond belief.This pushes everything, RoboCop has to weigh at least a couple of
hundred kilo's but it runs like Usain Bolt. The way it jumps could
easily make him a star NBA player. If you are a fan and actually wanted
to believe this could be real, this alone ruins it completely.Then there are the "let's-make-him-modern-and-cool" errors. Why paint
him black, he's not Batman. Why does his visor light up red, he's not
Cyclops and he has thermal vision so, he doesn't need a light. Why does
he have to recharge at least 10 times during the movie, did Apple make
him?The Human Hand Pffff, Why GOD why? Taser The original Robocop had part off his awesomeness because of the
automatic Desert Eagle. Everyone wanted that gun. This one has a taser.
A taser,... really?
