Cold November night flick.

Stuck In Love is the perfect film to be placed in my November film
category. This category is specifically for films that make you feel
good, make you shed a tear or two and are full of clichés. 'Stuck In
Love' is all of these things. I will start with the plot: The film is
based on a broken family where the father played by Greg Kinnear
(typical dad actor) is still head over heels in love with his ex wife
played by Jennifer Connelly. His two children, Sam and Rusty, played by
Lily Collins and Nat Wolf have responded to the divorce in different
ways and the film follows all four characters as they fall in and out
of love. The script written by, and directed by Josh Boone (new comer) is
clichéd to say the least. He uses various quotes from literature to
make his characters seem intelligent and interesting. Personally, I
love these sort of characters however, I understand other viewers who
would find these characters pompous and not very relatable. Now on to the acting which I think was rather good. Characters who
really struck me where Rusty played by Nat Wolf. I feel like he really
excelled in the whole second kid syndrome. I didn't necessarily find
his characters a refreshing and new character, although I found he
played the part extremely well. Kudos to you man. As for Lily Collins,
compared to her other work I think it's safe to say she's making better
choices. I mean what was abduction all about? I think her character was
more interesting, she played the douche bag girl which was interesting
as it's usually the douche bag guy. Logan Lerman was well Logan Lerman.
He wasn't the central character which, I think made me like him more.
But hey, what can I say? He's totally adorable but nothing to call home
about. Greg Kinnear is also Greg Kinnear. I'm pretty sure he plays the
exact same dude in every freaking film. I swear William the dad from
Stuck In Love is Steve the dad from The Last Song. I love Kinnear and
would love him to just do something a little bit more interesting and
out of his comfort zone.Overall, Stuck In Love was a clichéd film from clichéd land. But
everybody loves a clichéd film now and then? I really enjoyed it. Josh
Boone is going to direct The Fault In Our Stars which makes me feel a
little relieved and a little excited. Stuck In Love scores 6 Kayne
Faces.
