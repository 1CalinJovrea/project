It was okay...

The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't
leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it
didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an
official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman
are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old
thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was
already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as
important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is
especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not
knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to
happen and why.This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There
are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in
general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies
have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new
direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about
the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in
this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established.
Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We
are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the
events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they
are now?In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off
so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The
cast is very large and impressive. You don't see "good acting". You see
fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand
story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they
all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws
and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the
hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where
they lose control.The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much
chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding
with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing
slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and
this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only
perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and
efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has
many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's
completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes.
She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and
we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role
but a very important one.I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more
affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different
sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt
humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about
anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I
haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of
them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always
critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially.
The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly
inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and
it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no
surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many
references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left
unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through
and make an actual decision and get all the details right.So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't
have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story.
