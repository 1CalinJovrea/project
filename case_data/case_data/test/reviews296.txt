It has potential!

The idea of the movie is really good, but I feel like they didn't get
where it should have gone. I felt it was a bit slow, and then at the
end there was too much going on. The actors in the movie was really good, they did a fantastic job, and
kept it interesting. I think otherwise I would have gone out from the
theaters. The Sandin family was put together really good, so the
casting director did a great job. But the rest of the movie, I'm not
sure what to say about it. It was good but there was something missing.
I didn't see why the teenagers who were looking for the "bloody
stranger" was acting so psycho. They war jumping around laughing and
killing, did they escape from a mental institution? IT was just weird,
it din't fit in. The Polite Leader did a great job, he was really good
actually, the villain you despise. With some changes in the script this could become something really
really good. I still recommend you to see it, because of the
psychological aspects! 7/10
