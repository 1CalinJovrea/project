Predictable and not very funny

Pakistani-born actor and stand-up comedian Kumail Nanjiani has made a
film about his own experiences dating a non-Pakistani girl. His family
members didn't accept the fact that he loved his girlfriend, and kept
on setting up dates with Pakistani girls, as is the custom in that
country.Instead of a drama about the consequences of these culture clashes,
Nanjiani made a lighthearted film, following the classic screenplay
structure of the romantic comedy. Boy meets girl, falls in love, has to
overcome all kinds of setbacks and problems, is rejected by the girl,
but keeps on trying, and ultimately succeeds in winning her love.
Everything is so predictable that the jokes must be really good to make
up for the unimaginative screenplay.Unfortunately, they're not. I counted one really good joke (about 9/11)
and a handful in the category 'not bad'. But overall, this movie lacks
the wit and humour that you'd expect from a film that was praised at
Sundance. The jokes are flat and the running gags, like the endless
parade of Pakistani marriage candidates, are boring.So, the film is predictable and not very funny. That wouldn't have
mattered if Nanjiani had turned his own experiences in a really
heartfelt drama about how in some immigrant communities traditional
parents try to arrange marriages for their unwilling offspring. And how
this can lead to devastating consequences, like parents disowning their
children. In 'The Big Sick', this fact is presented in the offhand
manner which of course is typical for comedies.The theme of arranged marriages in immigrant communities made me think
of the excellent German/Turkish movie about this subject, 'When we
leave'. That film was like a punch in the stomach. 'The Big Sick' is
like listening to someone trying in vain to be funny.There is only one thing I really liked in this film: Holly Hunter's
part as the mother of Nanjiani's love interest. The way she completely
played everyone else off the screen, for example with a wonderful and
completely unexpected outburst of grief-induced anger, was absolutely
great.
