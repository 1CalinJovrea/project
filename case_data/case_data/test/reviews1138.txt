Best film in this genre I've seen for a long time ..Sexy and Funny

This is my first review and after watching 'The First Time' I thought I
would write this ..'Aubrey (britt Robertson) meets Dave (Dylan
O'Brien)after a house party in an alley way they immediately hit it off
and even though Aubrey is in a relationship with a guy who doesn't
understand her she begins to fall for Dave . The acting is this is
really astonishing the chemistry between the two main characters is
second to none , feels so real . Britt Robertson is so sexy and funny
too , amazing actress. Dylan O'Brien is super talented in this funny
romantic comedy. Wish there were more movies as good as this and as
well acted.Would highly recommend 10 out of 10 from me .. LOVED IT !!
