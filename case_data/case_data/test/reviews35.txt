Extremely over the top yet strangely relatable

Depending on which age group you fall in will determine your enjoyment
for Project X. Project X does so many fundamental things wrong such as
sub par acting and glaring plot holes. However, for a film that on
paper seems absolutely terrible I could not stop laughing and really
enjoying this movie.Project X isn't so much hilarious as it is entertaining. This movie
will really appeal those who can relate to the plot somewhat. As an 18
year old that has thrown parties when my parents were away the film
struck a chord with me. I could feel the main character Thomas's
anxiety when he realized he had no control over his house and that's
why I feel many teenagers and even those in their early 20's would
really relate to this film.Project X might not be worth 10 dollars to see it in the movie theater
but if you go with a good group of friends the 10 dollar ticket will
seem more than worth it. I really enjoyed the film for personal reasons
but I can see a lot of movie goers detesting it. 6/10
