MAMI Film Fest Review: The Florida Project.

Childhood is the most important & innocent chapter in each of our
lives. Its where we begin to understand what the world is all about.
Its where we learn to speak & when to speak what & hope to get into a
school where education makes us realize how the world functions. Now imagine, a Childhood in a purple painted, unclean Motel in Florida,
which, incidentally enough, is close to Disney World, a dream of every
child out there (mine too as a kid, and I did go there). But the trip
to Disney World isn't possible for all & 'The Florida Project' is about
such kids, who despite knowing there is magic awaiting for them, have
no option but to create a world of magic without any fireworks.
Writer-Director Sean Baker delivers one of the FINEST films ever on
childhood & shows us a side of a America, not many us usually stumble
on in cinema. And guess what, this realistic & affecting film, is among
this year's very best films!'The Florida Project' Synopsis: Set over one summer, the film follows
precocious 6-year-old Moonee (An Astonishing Brooklynn Kimberly Prince)
as she courts mischief and adventure with her ragtag playmates and
bonds with her rebellious but caring mother (A Fantastic Bria Vinaite),
all while living in the shadows of Disney World.'The Florida Project' is about creating the magic in the world you've
born too. Moonee, the protagonist, is foul-mouthed, brash &
adventurous. She may not have a school to go to or a family to support
her needs, but that doesn't stop her from being fun. She finds her joy
in spending time with her mother or creating a ruckus with her ragtag
playmates (who also live the same life as hers) or bullying the Motel's
Manager Bobby (Willem Dafoe, In A Career-Best Performance). She also
binges in ice cream & sometimes, a pizza (minus pepperoni, despite that
being the topping she craves for, but its expensive). Moonee makes the
most of what she has & reminds us how childhood is what we make out of
them. With or Without money, with or without education or, with or
without, of course, Disney World.Baker & Chris Bergoch's Screenplay touches upon the bleakness & the
monotony on the lives of the poor in America, with gut-wrenching
honesty & believe it or not, laugh-out-loud humor. YES, you read that
right! Despite the nothingness in the surroundings, 'The Florida
Project' uses humor, for the most part, to tell its story. We watch the
children go through the same old routine of life, but its shown with
innocent humor & a sense of immovable circumstances. Baker & Bergoch's
Screenplay is simply excellent. This is an important, affecting &
heartfelt film, that really makes you think about kids out there & how
one should help the underprivileged. And its done with a hammering
impact! Baker's Direction is outstanding. His work is among the year's
most compelling efforts. I seriously hope the Academy is brave enough
to honor Baker & Co., for their exceptionally fine work here. Alexis Zabe's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic setting with
great results. Baker's Editing, also, is perfect. Art & Costume Design
are fabulously done & add to the authenticity. Performance-Wise: Willem Dafoe steals the show. Dafoe, an actor par
excellence, delivers a career-best turn as Bobby, the Motel's
Manager/Father to all his residents. His empathizing connection with
Moonee, is the film's emotional core. Subtle & Masterfully Restrained,
Dafoe redefines the power of Acting with his stellar work here. He's
Oscar-Worthy from start to end. Academy, do him proud! Brooklynn
Kimberly Prince is astonishing. She brings Moonee to life with right
mix of innocence & brashness. Bria Vinaite, as the mother, does a
fantastic job. Her portrayal is natural to the core! Valeria Cotto,
Christopher Rivera & the rest lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'The Florida Project' digs deep & takes a piece out of
you. This is a brave film, that unfolds in sheer power. Two Big Thumbs
Up!
