Terrible to BDSM Community and to Women.

Another sad movie with a generic plot with the Mary Sue / Gary Sue
relationship. A relationship so horrid that it reaches a limit when
rape is involved. This book turned movie is a mere reminder that
'Hollywood' will create anything without investigating the rather
obvious 'unusual behavior' -- which, lets be honest here, isn't unusual
until you put a married man and a girl who cannot bite her lip for the
life of her in the same room. It is more than evident there is no
chemistry on set, and off set. Jamie, you could have done so much
better. Dakota, no, just no. Thank you, EL for your horrible outlook on
BDSM and your plagiarized mistake of a 'book'. You truly have given
writers everywhere a reason to wish they'd never written, and a reason
as to why actors never wish to take part in anything that relates to
this horrible mess of a movie.
