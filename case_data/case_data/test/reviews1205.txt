Pretentious rubbish.

Pretentious rubbish. Factually wrong; old people slipping into early dementia lose their
short-term memory, while their long-term memories stay largely intact.
This is quite the opposite of what happens in the film where the
characters played by Caine and Kline claim to have lost their long-term
memories. And, please, spare us the "joke" about peeing. This feeble "joke" is
used not once, but 3 times!The character played by Fonda is muddled and confused. This film has no structure, no humanity and no sense whatsoever.
