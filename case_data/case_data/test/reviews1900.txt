First ever review: "Artists" trying to out "artist" each other

By the time I reached the end I felt like I was a third person in a
room with some actors and Hollywood people trying to impress each other
with how artistic they could be. Johnny Depp makes sure to remind the
viewers that he likes to be strange, the conversation between Depp's
character and Parks seems like they are ad libbing and trying to one up
each other with each line to see who could say the strangest thing.The movie is basically a joke on the viewer. One of those, you had to
be there, types of things that was probably funny for a few minutes. I
see that the whole movie took only 15 days. I am not surprised because
I think if they had taken any longer they would have realized that
maybe it wasn't such a good idea.I'm sure people who like the movie probably like it more because of
reviews like this and how I just don't "get it". I get it, you took a
funny ad, made fun of it, had some viewers say that it would be funny
if it was a movie, then had fun making a horrible movie. Doesn't make
it any more entertaining for someone watching.Usually I can tell when a movie is about artists trying to prove how
artistic they can be when the main character is a writer. The main
character as a DJ threw me off.
