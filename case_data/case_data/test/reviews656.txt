Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this

I've seen B-production movies that were more entertaining, or at least
more realistic, than this. Things that happen in this movie would be
interesting to children under 10 years old and retarded people. Humor
is horrible, dialogs are made of recycled excerpts from other movies.If you wanna good action comedy watch Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) which
is an amazing movie, or any sequel of Lethal Weapon. Those movies show
how an action comedy should look like. For a start, one needs a proper
script-writer, not an amateur. Without a good script even good actors
can't excel.In this movie Ryan Reynolds is very boring and Samuel L. Jackson is
irritating and pitiful. The only thing you look forward in this movie
is to press the stop button and go watch something interesting.
