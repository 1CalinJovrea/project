I loved it

Jon Favreau is Chef Carl Casper working in a restaurant for a boss he
doesn't see eye to eye with. He ends up leaving his job after he
becomes fed up with the menu and receiving some bad criticism from a
food critic. He exchanges insults with the food critic via Twitter and
of course it goes viral and Carl's reputation is really on the line.
He's also having some problems with his own personal life after he and
his wife split and he is trying to build a relationship with his young
son. The story follows Carl as he looks to get his career back on track
and build stronger bonds with his loved ones.The whole cast was very likable and easy to relate to, Carl and Tony
had a very funny working relationship and are then joined by Carl's
son, Percy when they get the food truck going. Then we have smaller
roles for Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman and
Sofia Vergara...some cast list that.This is certainly a feel good film, I couldn't help but smile when
watching. There was some lovely looking food on display and a great
soundtrack to boot. Although it was mostly a comedy (and it was pretty
hilarious in places) the film also had some heated arguments for
dramatic effect, I felt this worked really well to show the viewer just
what the characters are going through. Overall it was just a fun,
unique film.A really enjoyable film, heartwarming, feel good fun, one of the best
films of 2014. 9/10.
