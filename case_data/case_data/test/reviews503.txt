Completely Inaccurate

I understand that movies never completely match their books, it's
impossible. but with this one, literally nothing is right. they
completely took the characters and story line and totally changed it.
the books are amazing and this movie didn't show them any justice what
so ever. but what upset me the most, after getting used to everything
and being semi okay w it, was the ending. it actually ended, leaving no
room for either of the sequels to take place or any of the magical
things that happened in those. Things didn't end okay in the first book
and it's ridiculous that they altered the story. it's basically like
they took the original story, and changed every thing to make it their
own.
