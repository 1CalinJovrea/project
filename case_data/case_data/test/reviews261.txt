Life/less

Billionaire industrialist Damian Hale is master of his universe, until
he encounters a foe that he can't defeat.......metastasis. His only hope is a radical medical procedure called "shedding," in
which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After the
procedure, Damian, now called Edward, starts a new life in New Orleans,
but he's haunted by disturbing images. When he delves into Edward's past, he learns that some will kill to
keep it secret.Tarsem Singh isn't the greatest director in the world, by a long-shot,
but his previous films have shown us that he is a visionary. The Cell
was a load of old cobblers, but when we went into the mind of the
killer, it was gloriously bonkers. The Fall is his masterpiece, beautiful, subliminal, but again, bonkers.The Immortals was a horrid affair, but it's set design was beautiful. Here, I wasn't looking for much, other than something luscious to look
at, and Kingsley is always good for a slice of ham, but I didn't get
anything other than déjà Vu to other films, the Island, In Time,
Paycheck and Face/off (and Kingsley, even though he's in it for a short
time, is ironically the best he's ever been for a very long time).It starts well enough, and the concept is sound. Like another film not
dissimilar to this 'In Time' the film is telling you, if your rich, you
can proverbially live forever. With 'In Time', time was literally
money. In this film, if you are poor, you can sell your healthy to help
your family, and if you're rich, you can buy it and have your soul
somehow transferred into a good looking Ryan Reynolds type body.And as soon as the transition is complete, this is where the film falls
flat on its face and loses everything it had going for it, which is
ironic seeing as this is the exact point where Kingsleys' character is
given a new lease of life.But the biggest problem here is Reynolds, I like the guy as an actor,
and even though he's made some poor career choices over the last few
years, he always breathes a bit of life into the whole proceedings.But here, he's totally autonomous as young Damian, and he hasn't put an
ounce of effort into copying Kingsley's traits for effect (that's why
Face/Off worked so well).So for the rest of the film we see Reynolds almost begrudgingly try and
build a relationship with the wife and daughter of his new body's
former owner.Goode turns up every now and again as Basil Exposition doing its best
Agent Smith impression, and when we finally get to the rationale as to
why this was done and how, you couldn't care/less about what happens to
anyone.With virtually no advertising campaign on its initial release, it's no
surprise that this soon vanished from cinemas.A Worth/less, soul/less dud of a film, but Kingsley is brilliant.
