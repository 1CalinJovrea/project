A Sequel That Reaches Its Full Potential . Great Action Thriller

I almost didn't bother with this sequel . The first movie was close but
no cigar down to rather lazy and ill thought plotting and since this
movie was also written and directed by James DeMonaco we'd be getting
more of the same except this time with an inferior and unknown cast .
That said one thing that really intrigued me was the large shift in
positive votes . The first movie had an average vote of 5.6 while its
sequel had an average vote of 6.5 along with many of the comments
stating just how different it was from the original film , a film which
incidentally could hardly have been called original itself The only real criticism I can level at TPA is that it's rather
derivative and owes a lot to Anabasis by Xenophon , a very old story
that Walter Hill made a career out of reworking and which recent Brit
thriller '71 made use of . A good story never grows old whether you're
a Greek army trapped behind enemy lines in 400 BC or a young couple
trapped in a city centre where the laws of the jungle are about to be
enforced the dilemmas facing the protagonists remain the same I had to double check a couple of times to check if there were two
different writer/directors called James DeMonaco because I had hard
task to believe the film maker who wasted so much potential in the
first movie was the same one who crafted this heart stopping thriller .
Everything wrong with THE PURGE is corrected here . Gone are the
idiotic choices characters make and in their place are simple acts of
misfortunes . Okay some bits seem a little contrived such as cars
breaking down at the most inopportune moment but it's the same sort of
cinematic convention you see in every /any thriller or horror movie .
The characters are unlucky rather than out and out dumb and boy does
misfortune have it in for these characters that you actually get to
care about Another massive improvement is that you can almost believe this
scenario might take place one day . I say almost because it's something
of a stretch thinking Pat Robertson might be American president but
this would be his ideal Utopian view of America and TPA does play up to
all the more extreme elements of an outsiders view of America , gun
culture , red necks ,the radical Christian right , rabid nationalism
and corporate greed where money can buy you absolutely anything , all
summed up by a very effective montage sequence at the closing credits .
The politics of the film are not subtle but are superbly well done .
There's perhaps a danger of taking it all this too seriously but TPA
does deserve some credit for bringing this to our attention and wears
its heart on its sleeve as to what's wrong at the heart of America And so ends one of these very rare films - a sequel that surpasses the
original and by a wide margin too . Okay let's be honest and confess
THE PURGE was no great shakes but TPA is one the most effective and
thought provoking thrillers I've seen Hollywood produce in a very long
time and after seeing THE PURGE I thought I'd never say this but I am
really looking forward to THE PURGE 3 when it's released next year
