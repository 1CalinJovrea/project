Drowned out by mixed reviews from people expecting gold and can't appreciate really good silver.

If you stopped for an hour and dissected this film you WILL find
problems, like how the audience is meant to root for borderline
sociopathic criminals or how the structure isn't what they're used
to... HOWEVER, if you go in just expecting to be entertained and if you
have a particular fondness for hustle movies, this is one enjoyable
movie. The charming but not over-the-top humour consistently keeps the
story entertaining and by not following the usual structure of a movie
this kind, and ultimately the one the trailer promised, it offers
something new to the mix. I can see the multiple twists as a turn off
for some expecting a deeper film but if you know what you're in for I
think the multiple twists in the film's final act will
one-after-another bring a smile to your face and even have you
laughing. Will Smith harnesses his charm to success in this flick and
Margot has effectively proved herself as not being a one-hit-wonder.
This is not a bad film, though I do believe your enjoyment hinges on
your expectations when going into it. Don't expect the next Ocean's 11,
expect a charming, funny, well acted, smartly written, hustle movie
that will undoubtedly be drowned out by mixed reviews from people
expecting gold and can't appreciate really good silver.
