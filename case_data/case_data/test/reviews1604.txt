Bad, bad, bad

I usually don't review movies, but I saw this one yesterday and I just
wanted to share my thoughts here, maybe I'll save some poor soul from
destroying his evening by watching this.As a child, I was a huge Jules Verne fan (I read at least 50 books; I
read The Mysterious Island at least 15 times), so when I saw the poster
and the IMDb summary I decided I MUST see this movie... boy, what a
disappointment!The scenario is soooo hollow and unconvincing, I'm 99% sure it was the
result of a brainstorming between a 5-years-old and an intellectually
challenged 8-years-old: they mix things up, they jump from one subject
to another without any apparent connection, the dialogues are
unconvincing, etc. Hell, even my 6-years-old nephew has more coherent
ideas!About the acting, OMG! I never thought The Rock is a great actor, but I
saw him in a few movies and he was more than OK; in this movie he's
just mediocre and insipid. And Michael Caine was a HUGE disappointment:
how could a 2 times Oscar winner and 4 times Oscar nominee get so low?!So, my final advice: avoid this movie at all costs!
