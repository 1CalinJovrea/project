Painful to watch

I will begin by saying I had high expectations for this moviewho
wouldn't with such an incredible cast? But, as sometimes happens when a
gaggle of acclaimed actors convene for an Oscar-destined drama, it was
incredibly unpleasant. Centered on a dysfunctional family in the boondocks of Oklahoma,
August: Osage County cannot be faulted for lack of honesty. The plot
piles on heap after heap of horrific familial revelations, everything
from a sister and brother engaging in an incestuous relationship to a
fourteen-year-old smoking pot with and kissing a 50-year-old man who
also happens to be her aunt's fiancé. Nearly every character, especially those of Meryl Streep and Julia
Roberts, is extremely unlikable, selfish, and antagonistic; the
post-funeral dinner scene in which Meryl Streep's character
systematically offends and curses at each member of the family is so
unsettling and drawn out that I had to leave the room mid-way through.
Every family has at least one member with a similarly over-dramatic and
aggressive personality and many families have equally sad and
unfortunate problems, so in that respect August: Osage County is a fair
and candid representation of family life. But with that being said, the sheer number of conflicts presented is
gratuitous. It makes a mockery of the hardships real families face
every day, sensationalizing them to the same caliber as the Jerry
Springer Show. Every fight, every divulgement of secrets is so
exaggerated that I could not keep myself from laughing at the
outrageousnessJulia Roberts' inane cursing rant about fish had me
alternating between incredulous laughing and appalled discomfort. Of course, the acting is phenomenal on all counts (how else did I come
to despise the characters so vividly?), but quality acting can only
carry a film so far. The plot, the story of a disturbed family of
narcissistic, morally unsound people leaves so much to be desired. I am
thoroughly unsatisfied, a little frustrated, and so grateful that my
family is not like that.
