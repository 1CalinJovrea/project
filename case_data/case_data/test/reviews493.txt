This movie....

This movie as nothing like the book. The only part of the movie that
was similar to the book was the beginning when Margo and Q hung out in
the dead of night. Besides that, the movie completely mixed up the book
and took away some pivotal scenes that were also portrayed in the book.
I do like both Nat and Cara, but the whole movie seemed pretty bland.
Radar and Ben were funny characters and Lacey was a completely
different person than who she was supposed to be in the book. I'm
amazed that the movie received a 6/10 from viewers. If they had read
the book, I'm sure the reviews would be different. When The Fault in
Our Starts came out as a movie, it was very similar to the book and the
acting was also engaging. Throughout Paper Towns, the main characters,
Margo and Q, didn't really seem interesting or captivating at all. I
was really hoping this movie would be great, but unfortunately, it was
not.
