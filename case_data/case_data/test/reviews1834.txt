Great movie for younger children and for adults with a positive outlook.

Did not want to watch this movie after witnessing all the 1/10 and 2/10
reviews. My two girls convinced me to watch since they were so
persuaded by the trailers. The movie was actually better than I
expected. Most importantly, my 6 year old and 9 year old truly enjoyed
it and came out so happy afterwards. That's what matters most. I would
personally rate the movie between a 6 -7 stars, however a 9 is well
deserved to try and bring it back up with all the negative ratings.
This movie really has a positive influence on the child's mind. I may
even buy it on DVD as well. * This movie did have similarities to
another movie we really enjoyed - "Inside Out".
