An absolutely outstanding depiction of a truly horrific event.

I am always relatively confident that I'll enjoy the work of
Christopher Nolan based off his pretty decent track record, however
this gripping re-imagining of one of the darkest moments of World War
II stands as not only some of Nolan's greatest work but one of the
greatest war films I have ever experienced.Dunkirk does not necessarily tell the story of any one particular
character, but rather adopts the event itself as the films vehicle,
resulting in an experience which uses its characters to portray the
event rather than the event to portray its characters. This is
presented through scenes taking place at different stages of the
evacuation across the land, air and sea, creating a distinctive setting
for each, but culminating in the same final conclusion. This being said
despite Dunkirk's focus not necessarily being its characters, I did not
find a single character performance in this film lacking or
inconsistent with the tone or setting presented technically. In
particular Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and debut actor Fionn Whitehead
gave especially memorable performances consistent with the striking
spectacle Nolan presents. As is expected with Christopher Nolan's films the visual presentation
in Dunkirk has few rivals, the set pieces are outstanding with the use
of breathtaking establishing shots to highlight the true historical
scale of the real life evacuation. Action is presented in a smooth
focused manner utilizing a few precise shots rather than an explosion
of two second jump cuts we have come to expect in modern day action
movies. There are multiple sequences which portray the pure fear,
claustrophobia and disorder present in those final weeks of the
evacuation and it is this ever present tension that will keep you
engaged for the entirety of the run-time. However it is the sound design which truly made this production a
masterpiece for me, delivering one of the most realistic
representations of the terrifying sounds of War. Gunfire had a
distinctly different tone to other films, being delivered with sharp
crack, explosions where accompanied by a deep base and the famous
'Jericho Trumpet' made by the Stuka's presence be constantly reminded
and portrayed the sense of helplessness present at Dunkirk perfectly.This is only enhanced by Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack embedded
across the entirety of the film. Alongside Inception, Dunkirk showcases
the exceptional talent Nolan & Zimmer have for combining meaningful
score with striking imagery to create a distinctive emotional response
from their audience. Through the skillful incorporation of an ever
presenting droning base, screeching guitar strings and ticking
timepiece the continual sense of urgency and dread felt by those both
on land and sea is enforced across the entire film by this excellent
soundscape. As a result I highly recommend that should you be given the
chance you experience Dunkirk for the first time on the big screen, as
the combination of a cinema screen and encapsulating surround sound
will leave you with a truly memorable experience. Even though this is a film a majority will go into undoubtedly knowing
the final conclusion, Dunkirk is an experience I highly recommend
everyone consider, presenting a defining moment of modern history in
one of the most technically accomplished and memorably striking ways,
Dunkirk will undoubtedly go down as a hallmark in film-making for many
years to come.
