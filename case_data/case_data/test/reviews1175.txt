A diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unites to
explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it
is beautiful. Cut off from everything they know, the team ventures into
the domain of the mighty Kong, igniting the ultimate battle between man
and nature. As their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they
must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong.What starts out as a well oiled, climactic first act with a big big
promise slowly meanders its way more and more through second and thirds
acts that constantly keep the viewer less and less involved in any of
the struggle, culminating in a very underwhelming finale.Unfortunately this film is one of those that relies a little too much
on its eye candy and whilst you way (or may not) be entertained by the
big set pieces and the wonderful design and look of the monsters, the
more you think about it the more the movie sticks out as uneven,
terribly fragmented in almost all of its departments with many basic
story threads not working.What I will say is that Vogt-Roberts nails the monsters. We'll later
touch on the CGI quality, but on a level of scale, fear, imagination
and action he is almost constantly delivering. The fights with Kong are
always shot in a wide, sweeping shot that turns around him and holds on
for long. Those are absolutely incredible, they are sophisticated,
beautiful shots to which sounds adds a real savage nature and together
bring a real enthusiasm for the audience to the fights. Moreover, the
various other monsters from the island are all interesting creatures
and all feel part of the island.Furthermore, the director shows off quite a drive in his first act. The
journey to the island is riveting and build with constantly good
editing and witty cinematography choices that always keep us oriented
in what's going on. The first full blown action sequence is amazing,
really absolutely stunning. He places the camera in the most
interesting places and it throws us into the world and the size of
Kong.But, after that it is all downhill. The emptiness of these characters
slowly reveals itself and once we're at the end of the second act it
just becomes forced scene after forced scene of romance. The more it
goes on the more it seems to completely fall apart, by the last action
sequence the suspense of disbelief has totally disappeared, characters
are doing stuff that is out of their abilities, the set pieces become
ridiculously bloated, the green screen CGI becomes almost unacceptable,
the amount of explosions is borderline parodic and you're left uncaring
of anything or anyone, there is no interesting struggle by the end, the
climax is underwhelming. Many choices of setting and build up seem
really out of place, the whole dynamic that evolves at the end in
(without spoiling anything) where they find themselves and where they
have to go is shallow. Capping it off is one of the worst characters
and portrayals I have seen in a motion picture ever, John C. Reily is a
travesty every time he is on screen, there is no contribution he brings
to the story and weakens it because of his terrible dynamic that is
neither funny nor interesting.This was definitely a weak day at the theater for me, the first act
revved me up, it was really good and had a charm to it, it managed to
build excitement very effectively. Sad it is that it didn't deliver on
that promise and gave us a pretty mediocre blockbuster.
