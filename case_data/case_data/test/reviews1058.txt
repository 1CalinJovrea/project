Very disappointed at Disney.  Is not Maleficent is Terrificient.

The movie is not worth, keep your kids from seeing this movie unless
your want them to be disappointed and very confuse. Is a terrible
change of something that was a beautiful master piece. Incredible to
see and believe that the own owner of the Sleeping Beauty (Disney) is
destroying what everybody has come to love for generations. I was very looking forward to see the movie since Disney has a good
record on movies, although some of the last one has not been very good,
including this one. But for example if you saw Frozen you though Disney
is back to creativity and beautiful long lasting history that passed
thru time. This movie Maleficent is not one of them, you won't be attract to even
repeat it nor less read it to your daughters as a bed time story Maybe
if Disney Management could use the imagination so much they promote to
young ones they could it come up with a new history no one has ever
heard before and could sell it. But for what reason will Disney
Corporation will destroy what is already a proving time after time
years after years mom to girl, princess to princess beautiful story,
where the Prince rescue the Princess, The King Father and Queen Mother
love and protect their daughter and the bad witch lose and is destroy
by the goodness. And them the Prince and Princes Leave Happily Ever After. If only Mr. Walt Disney were alive to see of what His Disney World has
become.
