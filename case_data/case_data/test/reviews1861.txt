Watch. Don't think.

There is nothing sophisticated or clever in this film. All very banal,
and of course full of unrealistic sequence of events.Nevertheless, Banderas plays quite well, and the film is generally
enjoyable.Best watching this in the background of doing something else, or while
relaxing from a long day of work.
