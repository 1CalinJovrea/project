A Future Sci-Fi Classic

Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the
ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put
together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas
in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes
or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical
questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might
sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of
sexuality that the movie becomes something different.From the moment, we arrive at Caleb's estate something seems very
off-putting, he clearly is hiding something. And for the entire movie,
as we explore his compound things slowly get more off-putting and
stirring before boiling over during a wonderful climax. The deception
between the two human characters is what makes the movie exciting, both
men seem to be playing one another for unknown reasons. And as Nathan
begins to understand more and more of what really is taking place in
the house the tension rises and secrets unfold. Characters motives and
beliefs are slowly unraveled and some seem more logical than others,
but that's why the movie works, every character has sound reasons for
their actions. The movie makes strong arguments for both sides of the
A.I. equation.However, the movie might be too slow for most audience members, as I
said this is a movie where ideas shine not action sequences. Not only
do ideas shine, but the acting out of the three leads is incredible to
say the least! But it's this move (moving away from action and letting
ideas flourish) that makes Ex Machina shine and worthy of being labeled
a future sci-fi classic!
