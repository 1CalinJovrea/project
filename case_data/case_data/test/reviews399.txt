The Loneliness of Power

First we had "Mrs Brown", a film about the real-life relationship
between Queen Victoria (played by Judi Dench) and one of her servants.
And now we have "Victoria & Abdul, another film about the real-life
relationship between Queen Victoria (played by Judi Dench) and one of
her servants. The subject of the first film was the Scottish ghillie
John Brown, whose friendship with the Queen proved controversial
because it gave rise to rumours that the two were having a sexual
relationship and even that they were secretly married (hence the
title). I don't think anyone believed that Victoria had married her
Indian-born servant Abdul Karim- nobody ever called her "Mrs Karim"-
but their relationship was nevertheless controversial. In an age when
the supremacy of the white race was widely taken for granted, many
British people would have regarded a close friendship between their
Queen and an Indian, especially an Indian of humble social origins, as
quite inappropriate.The film relates how in 1887, the year of Victoria's Golden Jubilee,
Abdul Karim, a clerk from Agra, was one of two Indians selected to
present her with a medal on behalf of the Indian Government. By the
Queen's wish the two men remained in England as her servants and a
close relationship grew up between her and Karim after she asked him to
teach her Urdu (or, as she referred to it "Hindustani"). He became her
confidant and she gave him the title "Munshi", meaning "teacher"; this
was a reference not merely to his role as a teacher of Urdu but also
implied that he was, in some sense, her philosophical and spiritual
guide as well. (She was deeply impressed by his devotion to his Muslim
faith). His closeness to the Queen, however, made him unpopular both
with the senior members of the Royal Household (who resented the fact
that a man they regarded as their inferior was being treated as their
equal) and by the servants (who resented the fact that a man they
regarded as, at best, their equal was being treated as their superior).
Karim was also disliked by Victoria's son Bertie, the future Edward
VII, and as soon as the old Queen died he was shipped back to India on
the new King's orders.Much of the criticism of the film has been political rather than
artistic; director Stephen Frears has been accused of whitewashing
colonialism and of depicting Abdul Karim as excessively servile. Yet it
is a matter of historical record that Victoria was deeply attached to
Karim and deplored any attempt to denigrate him, and indeed Indians in
general, on account of their race or skin colour. The film's depiction
of her as a sort of proto-anti-racist is therefore, to some account,
historically accurate. And as for allegations that Ali Fazal played
Karim as "too servile", he was, after all, a servant. It would have
been very unwise for him to have treated the Queen, who was both his
employer and his sovereign, in anything other than a deferential
manner.One might well ask why, if Queen Victoria was an anti-racist, she was
happy to reign over an Empire founded upon the idea that all men are
not created equal and that the white races had the duty to export, if
need be by force of arms, their supposedly superior civilisation to
other parts of the world. That would be a good question; all I can say
is that the Victorian age did not see, as our age sees, a contradiction
between a belief in the moral rightness of the British Empire and the
belief that one should treat individual members of other races with the
same courtesy and respect that one would extend to Europeans. The
standard "white man's burden" justification for imperialism strikes us
as being at best patronising and at worst hypocritical. At the time it
did not necessarily strike people in the same way.There are a few historical errors. In a scene set in 1887, Liliuokalani
is described as "Queen of Hawaii"; in that year she was still a
Princess and did not become Queen until 1891. Victoria, who was
regularly kept briefed by her ministers and who had access to
government papers, would have been a lot more knowledgeable about the
causes of the Indian Mutiny than she is shown here. Giacomo Puccini,
born in 1858, would have been much younger in the 1890s than the
character played here by the 68-year-old Simon Callow. By the time he
became King, Edward VII was nearly bald; Eddie Izzard shows him with a
full head of hair. The representation of the film's central theme, the
Victoria/Abdul relationship, however, seems to be relatively accurate.As with "Mrs Brown", one of the film's main themes is the loneliness of
power. The two films explore the thesis that, having lost her beloved
husband relatively early in life, Victoria needed to form intense, if
platonic, friendships with other men to support her in her immense
responsibilities. I didn't think that the film was quite as good as
"Mrs Brown", if only because Fazal never makes him quite as strong an
individual as Billy Connolly did with his portrayal of John Brown. Some
of the supporting cast, Callow being the worst offender, tend to play
their parts as caricatures. Probably the best is Izzard. Some have
complained that his portrayal of the Prince of Wales as a bad-tempered
bigot is at odds with the image of Edward VII as a well-loved monarch,
but I have long suspected that, beneath the fa√ßade of avuncular
geniality which his subjects saw "Bertie" was actually a rather
unpleasant individual. Dench, however, lives up to her normal high
standards, making Victoria a regal figure but also bringing a measure
of both humour and pathos to her portrayal. She shows us the woman as
well as the Queen. 6/10
