A kinda fun little story

The F Word also called What If is a romantic comedy about a man named
Wallace who can't quite decide when friendship ends and love starts and
that puts him at odds with the already in a relationship Chantry. The
story follows both as they continue their friendship but you forever
see that chemistry throughout and I mean you really want him to say
something to her. The movie is a satisfactory watch, it is far from
great but it still walks down a well trodden line at least with some
quirkiness and some fun characters too. The movie can feel a little too
niche at times but manages I feel to make itself fun and bubbly and
manages also to add in enough romance within the laughs to not make it
over the top going for laughs.Daniel Radcliffe plays Wallace and he does an OK job but I did feel he
can be just a little shaky at times. Ever since Harry Potter I have
always wanted Radcliffe to do well and really find something that can
bring him to a different phase of his career away from the wizarding
world, this isn't it but it gives us signs that he is well on his way
to having a great career in his post teenage years. Chantry is played
by Zoe Kazan who does the same kind of job that Radcliffe does, neither
really eclipse each other and that is good because the chemistry runs
well through that, we see enough of both characters lives and emotions
and it makes them more accessible to us on a connecting level. I liked
the addition of Rafe Spall as the partner of Chantry, he gives a funny
performance and mixes things up well, I felt he was going to be a
little funnier at first but all in all he is still a well made
character and played well by Spall too.Michael Dowse directs and I can't say he does a fine job but he still
manages to create something alright, I wasn't too keen at times in the
way he makes the movie look but he at least gets the pacing right. The
movie is written well and even won a Canada Screen Award for best
screenplay, I wouldn't say the script is anything special or new but it
does run along nicely as a piece and really tries hard to make
something work between all involved. The movie can in it's style seem a
little too entwined with the modern day "Hipster" society through such
things as Chantry and her friends knitting, Wallace and his friend
Allan (Adam Driver) looking through antique shops and the general use
of alternative and indie music although the feeling does not take
anything from this as a movie. As Rom-Coms go this doesn't stack up all that well with other one's, in
fact it is basically the same as many others although this movie does
at least try to be original in its humour and that I can credit it for.
The laughs aren't massive in this I have to also add although I think
many people will see this as charming comedy rather than the laugh out
loud type, they talk about faeces a lot for some reason but it still
feels charming though. So in the end this movie is one that probably
won't rank high on many peoples lists of great romantic comedies but
that doesn't mean it isn't worth a watch, it's actually not a bad movie
at all and if you're the kind of movie viewer who is a hopeless
romantic or just loves romance, this is pretty fun.
