Unfortunately this got "The Best of Me"

I believe all of Nicholas Sparks's movies are based on his
books/novels, and they mostly center around Romance, Passion, and
Tragedy. Sparks must be running out of ideas because to sum it up, "The
Best of Me" was wayyyyyy to long, very predictable, and monotone to the
point that it was listless.Due to the fact this movie was so drawn out, I had such a lack of
interest, that while I was watching it, I was thinking about all sorts
of things, like what I'm going to do the next day, what to pick up at
the store. The producers dragged out the flashback scenes in a way that
you had no idea as far as the direction of this movie. There was no
correlation regarding the younger lead male character and that person
twenty years later.The ending: Even though I was half concentrating on this movie, I still
predicted the outcome regarding the conclusion.Nicholas Sparks has had some great movies "The Notebook", "A Walk to
Remember", Dear John", but I would recommend taking a pass regarding
"The Best of Me".
