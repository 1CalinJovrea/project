Yes.  It really IS that bad....

Some users claim this movie is getting flack because it's compared to
"Bridesmaids."No. They're giving it flack because it's a bad movie. Period.I mean, WOW. No story line. No character development. Bad acting.
Countless clich√©'s. And worst of all, absolutely NO humor at all. You
know a comedy is in serious trouble when people defend it by calling it
a 'dark comedy.' It's funny, but you just don't 'get it.' Yeah, right.
That's why it died swiftly at the Box Office. I think most viewers 'got
it.' But what could they "do with it?" Nothing. OK. I warned you there were "spoilers" in this review. Are you ready?
Alright. Here goes: "Bachelorette" is basically two hours of F-Bombs, drugs, drinking,
vulgar sexual references and debauchery tied together by nothing
resembling a plot. There. That's the entire film. I just saved you five bucks. If you DO decide to rent this (or you're unfortunate enough to bump
into it on Netflix), you'll quickly discover what everyone with more
than two brain cells already knows: Leslye Headlan is a no-talent hack
who couldn't write her way out of a paper sack.There is honestly not even TEN SECONDS of redeemable humor in this
travesty, and it was a colossal lapse of judgement for Will Ferrell to
even touch it with a ten foot pole.Kirsten Dunst can only hope this train wreck won't become the coda for
an otherwise successful movie career.
