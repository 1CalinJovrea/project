A fitting candidate for the sewers of Bangkok

Welcome to the one of the most unpleasant motion picture viewing
experiences you are going to have this year or any year for that
matter. This movie celebrates the principle that by simply writing
checks, you can avoid accountability and responsibility for causing a
massive freeway pile up of cars and trucks that probably resulted in
fatalities or in numerous life threatening injuries of many innocent
people.The movie tries to build laughs by depicting two scenes of astonishing
cruelty to animals involving a decapitation and suffocation by pillow;
there is also a reference to the fate of two other animals that takes
place off screen which does not make the knowledge any less unpleasant.
A scene with an invalid elderly person in the span of a few brief
seconds amply illustrates the selfishness and self absorbed nature of
most of the characters populating this movie. There is no comedy or humor in this movie or any laughs. There is a
total of 3 minutes of glorious film in the 100 minute run time. This is
90 seconds of Heather Graham's luminous presence and artful grace and a
90 second sequence inserted into the end credits scrawl. The latter in
a bitter twist of irony is a laugh out loud funny sequence that
belatedly hints at what this movie could have been. My negative opinion of this movie is not about my lacking a sense of
humor or tolerance for outrageousness or edginess in a film. It is
simply about wanting to see a decent comedy made by intelligent
filmmakers. Instead, this movie is what you will find in abundance
floating in the sewers of Bangkok where the movie begins and should
have been left to rot.Save your money and do not allow the howls of derision from genuine
comedy lovers to be drowned out by the laughter of the filmmakers and
actors with lucrative back end deals tied to the box-office gross as
they strut their way to their banks to cash their checks. My 15 bucks
is a goner, yours does not have to.
