A must see

Now that is a movie that everyone needs to see. It relates the life of
three women, but in their tracks the life of millions of blacks who
have contributed to American culture and success.The cast is outstanding, the music off the hook. The cinematography
spotless. Dream-like. The right combination of colors and light. A
beauty.It also shows that intelligence connects beyond gender and race. I am
referring to the roles - one/played by Costner and 2/ the part of Glenn
Allen that show that true intelligence fosters tolerance, and it brings
the human race forward.The story is touching, and it might spark a love for mathematics in
you--even if you come from anti-nerd matter!No need to mention that the trinity Spencer, Monae, Hensen are as
bright as the stars they are trying to reach in the movie. Costner true
to himself is an incarnation of tolerance and genius as i remembered
him in the Bodyguard. And the guy who plays Glenn Allen is candy for
the eye: these two remind us that there are some nice folks out
there--and that intelligence breaks all barriers. Truly stimulating for the mind--one of the best movie I have seen
lately (after SPOTLIGHT, same level)This movie deserves all possible awards;for it is just "avant-garde",
in the style, the content, and the strength it oozes!Came out the day of my birthday--Epiphany. That has to mean something!
Support that gem of a movie!
