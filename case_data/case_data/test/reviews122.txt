Tulip Fever just wilted into ridiculousness

Oh, how the mighty had fallen for this nonsensical romance. Even the
great actors and actresses such as Alicia Vikander, Judi Dench and
Christoph Waltz couldn't save this historical period romance misfire.
Even Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne is involved in another follow-up
misfire (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets). Perhaps there is
more to meet the wilted tulip in its detail; Talk about on its crappy
Fifty Shades of Grey-styled sex scenes between Vikander and DeHaan
which NO ONE is buying it (not sexy and spicy) and probably the
chemistry is very muddled and confusing at the same time. Even the
screenplay from the acclaimed screenwriter, Tom Stoppard is completely
wasted.Making matters worst is the execution of the film which is messy and
crappy at the same time. Plus the dialogue and the performances is
laughable and wooden. Truly this unfortunate misfire which anyone could
be thinking that the film is Oscar-bait is not worthy of an Oscar and
instead serves as a big embarrassment to the cast but not Alicia
Vikander, Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz for there are some
good-quality films that are involved that can make them forget their
participation in this wilted movie mess and probably this terrible
historical nonsense garbage is just added to the worst movies of 2017
so far.
