More holes than a colander

Much like similar teen girl action movie series this one kills itself
early on by introducing so many holes that the house of cards that they
then try to build has no foundation. Before the credits are even over the story makes less than no sense.
Having destroyed civilisation in a world war (ok) Chicago survives. The
survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city,
300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5
factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call
them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace. So none of that makes sense, and much like Hunger Games, having built a
nonsensical premise we now follow a teenage girl as she turns into a
super-soldier capable of jumping of buildings fighting off trained
armies single-handed (using a cheap looking paint-ball gun). All the
while with her buff and perfectly capable new boyfriend doing as little
as possible to help her. Oh and I forgot a quick detour while we ride a pointless zip wire
through some buildings for absolutely no reason than to try and spend
some of the left over special effects budget.And occasionally Kate Winslet pops up, but is shot from funny angles
all the time while they try to make her baby look less visible. Not
that they need to as her bad blonde hair is distracting enough.All in a total waste of 2 hours. Just go and watch Twilight or Hunger
Games for the same movie done slightly (but not a lot) better.
