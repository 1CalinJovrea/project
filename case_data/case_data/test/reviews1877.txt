I Saw It And Hated It

I saw this movie with a few other people who came in (mostly teenagers)
and none of us were scared. We were all miserable after seeing this.1. This is not a horror film. This a movie that tries nothing new or
different in it's scare. I never once got scared during this. This is
just filled with jump-scares and that's it. That didn't leave any
impact on me and just became annoying after a while.2. The story could've been done well but this movie gets so boring. We
have to see these characters Facebook messages, watch the computer
buffer and see their text messages. That drags out the movie with
needless padding. This wasn't scary it was long and loathsome. Plus why
don't they get offline? Yes I know the ghost told them they shouldn't
or else one of them dies but at the same time someone is going to die
anyways so what's the point? For a movie that was suppose to be
creative it's very uninteresting.3. The characters are all hateful. I didn't once sympathize with anyone
in this movie. They all have to play 'Never Have I Ever' and one of the
characters biggest worries is that his buddy soled him out on the cops
for weed. That's his biggest worry? Two people were already dead at
this point so why did he say that? The issue he should be focusing on
is that one of you is going to die.I am not going to waste my time explaining how bad this movie is and I
thought the ending was terrible but I won't go THAT far with spoilers.
Just watch Chronicle for a good found footage movie or It Follows.
