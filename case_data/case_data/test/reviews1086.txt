The Best Wolverine Movie, Hands Down!

This is a wolverine movie aimed at adults and definitely not for small
children. The story is set in the future and Logan is taking care of
Charles Xavier who has grown old and is incapable of taking care of
himself. Logan, himself is now older and his health is slowly
deteriorating as well. A young girl mutant enters their lives which
sets off a story, which is not about super heroes fighting bad guys,
but one that is on a more human level. "Logan", is a beautifully made
X-Men film that deals with themes of importance of family, loyalty, and
ultimately how Logan himself deals with new found emotions which he is
experiencing for the very first time in his life.This is the crowning achievement in Hugh Jackman's role as Wolverine.
It is the movie he and director, James Mangold had always wanted to
make. It is a dramatic work of art and for X-Men fans, has plenty of
action and special FX which are a definite cut above anything that has
been seen before in Wolverine/X-Men films.A MUST SEE FOR ANY FAN AND A GOOD ENOUGH FILM TO STAND ALONE FOR
ANYONE!!
