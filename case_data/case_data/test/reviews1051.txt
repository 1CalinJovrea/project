Noomi Rapace's sharp portrayal of identical septuplets, as well as an
inventive and intriguing concept, almost save this dystopian thriller
from its clich√©d villains and some ludicrous plot points. Though each
of the seven identical sisters is supposed to be unique (one slutty,
one brainy, etc.), they're sketchy at best. Rapace brings as much depth
as she can to them in the little time each holds the screen. Starting
with a provocative premise, What Happened to Monday? ultimately becomes
a violent search-and-destroy mission, with one brutal attack and death
after another.
