Brought Tears To My Eyes!! It was THAT GOOD!

I was looking for a nice romantic flick to bring my girlfriend to so it
could set the mood for the evening. Well, that plan failed and I ended
up bringing my ex to the movies to see it instead. It really touched me
in a deep way that no other love story has in the past. Sounds kinda
corny, but for me, it touched on some areas. Well, needless to say, we
held hands all during the movie and more later.Okay, so I read up on the reviews before coming to see this movie and
they all made it sound like a boring box office flop, BUT reviews can
be very deceiving because this was a diamond that was tarnished by
viewers who had NO clue what a romantic flick this really is about! So
my advice to you is to go and see it with an open mind and heart and
let the movie just unveil itself to your heart and mind and see what
happens... best wishes!
