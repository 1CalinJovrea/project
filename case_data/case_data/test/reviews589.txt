A Non-Stop Heart Pounder!

There were scenes in this movie when I literally felt as if my heart
was going to pound its way out of my chest. Among other scenes I'm
thinking of the extremely quease-inducing one where the Dwyers have to
leap from one building roof to another to escape those trying to kill
them - and as part of it they actually have to throw their young
children across the open space from one roof to another. I could barely
watch that scene. And has there been a more horrific scene filmed than
the one in which young Lucy Dwyer (who can't be more than 10) has a gun
put to her head and another in her hands and is told she'll be killed
unless she kills her father. There are several times in this movie
where the title seems to be the only possible conclusion. Surely
there's no escape for this family."No Escape" is set in a fictional country in southeast Asia. All we
know from the plot is that it borders Vietnam. Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson)
has taken a job with an American company in that country, only to find
that virtually the moment he arrives, a violent anti- American
revolution breaks out and he and his family are being sought out along
with every other American, and every other westerner. It's sometimes a
disorienting movie, set in a large city. Having visited the Chinese
cities of Beijing and Changsha, the portrayal of the city seemed
authentic. China is a peaceful country, but everything was chaotic
enough that I didn't venture out too far on my own for fear that I'd
end up hopelessly lost. Jack and his family are running for their
lives, disoriented and lost, with danger potentially lurking around
every corner. The atmosphere was great. It's truly one of the most
intense movies I've ever seen.The performances from the leads were all superb. I haven't seen Wilson
in too many serious roles, but he seemed perfectly cast as Jack, and I
was very impressed with Lake Bell, who played Jack's wife Annie, with
whom I was previously unfamiliar. The children were fantastic. Played
by Sterling Jerins (who was Lucy in the above- mentioned scene) and the
even younger Claire Geare, they didn't miss a beat. There was no
"irritating child actor" thing going on here. Jerins and Geare hit the
mark perfectly. Pierce Brosnan rounded out the main cast as some sort
of British agent who helps the Dwyers in their desperate attempt to
escape.This is one of the best suspense/thrillers I've seen in a very long
time. To the extent that it has weaknesses, perhaps it started out a
little bit slow - but only for a few minutes, and once the action
starts it doesn't stop. It also might have been helpful if the
revolution had been a little more clearly explained. All we know is
that there's resentment against this American company Jack has arrived
to work for. But those are minor weaknesses. I haven't really come
across too many movies that have literally kept me glued to the edge of
my seat. This one did. (9/10)
