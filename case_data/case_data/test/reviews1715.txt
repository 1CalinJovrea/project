I think its time to accept the reason Stephen Kings books adapt so poorly to films

OK, so if you have read any of the other reviews you will see a lot of
"Another Failure to adapt Stephen Kings Books to Film" or "Yet Another
weak movie based around a Stephen King Novel" well I say enough. There
is a reason that SK's novels don't adapt to film well and that is
basically because they are dull, average and (To quote family guy) he
must be the least imaginative writer of this generation. He waffles and
builds characters in the same fashion that most of us interact with
each other. Hidden within writing is the ability to construct
characters that you are likely to find in Maine, he does not go far
afield. As you learn of these people a eerie presence builds up
spotlighting at something dreadful. At the great reveal it all just
does a Bobby Ewing dream sequence. A giant spider, a devil, Alien
Craft, a possessed car, a demon dog, a disaster at the nuclear power
station blah blah blah. The Bachmann books were cool for their time but
this is not that. This is a movie based around the books, not the
books. Sit back relax watch without prejudice and in all its not a bad
film. Try to ignore the stupid few who think this is an adaptation of
Stephen Kings Books and how those books played out in individual minds.
Like the voices the give old comic strips, it will never please all of
us because our internal dialogue has chosen already. See it
