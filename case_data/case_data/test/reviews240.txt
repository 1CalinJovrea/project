I agree with many others - don't waste your time or money!

You gotta be kidding. What was this? I know everyone is looking for
something new, fresh, different in their story lines but this wasn't
it.This movie is really bad in every way. It was listed as a
comedy/drama/horror. Definitely labelled incorrectly. Maybe a
fantasy/horror, even though it did not instill fear. Not fair to
release a movie and list it as something it is not as the viewers
expect something totally different and they don't get it. If I want to
view a comedy I expect it to be one.And I know this is a very small point and does not affect the outcome
in any way but I am so tired of watching movies that when taking place
in Canada they have all Canadians speaking as if they were in the movie
Fargo. Small or large I would at least try to make everything as
accurate as possible. If a movie has a lot of errors it gives one the
impression it was just thrown together. It was very distracting
listening to the ridiculous fake accent. Maybe this was the comedy
portion.The worst ending possible. There were many ways this movie could have
ended. Are we to believe this is how everyone's life continued? No
attempt made to correct anything? Why not just stop the movie half way
through.Justin Long sure has been in a lot of stinker movies as of late. He
should be more careful when choosing work in the future or his career
will soon be gone.
