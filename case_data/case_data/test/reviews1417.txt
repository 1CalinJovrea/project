Jeepers Creepers is Back!!

I enjoyed the one night event the film had with fathom events! The
movie was really good, had some cringe worthy moments, but was overall
awesome! Yeah, the CGI was terrible, but the practical effects were
incredible! The film is by far the scariest of the series, but the
first film is forever the best! I still can't wait to own it on Blu-ray
though, and watch it again for a second viewing! And I will watch this
film every year with a marathon of all 3 films!!!
