All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet

In "All the President's Men", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through
their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then
President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty
tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In "Spotlight", a
similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic
proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by
comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed
by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes.
Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton),
Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin "Marty" Baron (Leiv Schreiber),
Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James)
work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe
called "Spotlight" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston
Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse
scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other
ground-breaking stories.The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is
jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty
Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the
Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and
learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell
Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father
John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing
children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of
authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to
see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is
more to the story. The "seed" is similar to the break-in of the
democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually
revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots
against perceived political enemies.The Spotlight team is headed by Walter "Robby" Robinson (Keaton), a
no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's
wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story.
Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell
Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who
acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of
Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the
victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian
agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they
are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names.
Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The
question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in
similar criminal behavior against minors.On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer
(McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims
possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip
from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team
that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved
with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then
appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic
priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every
clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The
investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book
over several years are listed as "on leave due to illness", "on
administrative leave", or other designations of inactivity after only
one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider
these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If
true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly
covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic
Church, all the way to the Vatican.This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban
reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching
institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular
high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as
Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the
story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As
horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often
boys because they were less likely to "squeal" because of the shame,
the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the
priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by
offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were
minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to
other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing
widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that
not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts
of the country, it was happening internationally.
