a disappointing, middle-of-the-road comedy containing a cast with so much more potential than delivered

With a cast that includes Kirsten Dunst, Lizzy Caplan, Isla Fisher,
Rebel Wilson, James Marsden, and Adam Scott, I had a lot of hope for
the Sundance film Bachelorette. What I didn't expect was with this
talented of a cast the result would be a lifeless comedy that has some
semi-humorous moments, but ends up as one of the biggest wastes of
potential in recent comedy history.Bachelorette tells the story of Regan (Dunst), Gena (Caplan), and Katie
(Fisher), three girls who are bridesmaids in their high school friend
Becky's (Wilson) wedding. From the start, the objective of trying to be
a raunchier and more ridiculous Bridesmaids is laid out with the set up
of the wedding and the focus on the three bridesmaids. However, while
succeeding in being raunchier and more ridiculous than Bridesmaids,
Bachelorette doesn't have half the heart or spirit as the far superior
Kristen Wiig comedy.Quickly on we establish the strong personality differences between our
four girls. Becky, the bride, has grown up quite a bit since high
school and her steps into marriage have her partying less and wishing
for a very quiet bachelorette party. On the flip side, Gena and Katie
are two girls that are looking forward to the chance to party at a
bachelorette rave, Gena making sure to pack her cocaine in a baby
powder bottle and Katie drinking whatever she can and popping whatever
pills she finds. And finally, there is Regan, who couldn't have been
casted any better than Ms. Pole-Up-Her-Ass Kirsten Dunst.What I mean by Dunst being casted perfectly is that there is absolutely
nothing redeeming about the character of Regan, much like Dunst's
performance. She walks through the steps and says the lines in the
script like a bitch robot trying to make a quick payday. And while
Caplan and Fisher are type casted as well (the smart-ass and the dumb
party girl), it is Dunst's Regan that is absolutely the toughest part
of this film.When actually stepping back and looking at these three characters, it
makes almost zero sense that any of the girls enjoy the other two's
company. They constantly fight, bitch, and mock each other and reveal
each other's darkest secrets in a series of angry moments, drunk
mishaps, and stupid speeches. All of these are written for seemingly
comedy purposes, but they make each of the characters so dumb and
self-centered that it is hard to like or cheer for any of them.After a botched stripper show at the bachelorette party, Becky goes off
to bed leaving the three bridesmaids to drink, do drugs, and,
ultimately, rip the bride's dress. And thus, the film goes from the
story of the wedding to a wild night of trying to get the dress fixed;
sort of a mash between The Hangover and Bridesmaids. But what is so
frustrating is how dumb these girls are. For example, after ripping the
dress, they drag it around the city trying to get it fixed, having it
reach the pinnacle of places you wouldn't want it to inhabit: a strip
club bathroom. The irrationality is not humorous. It is outlandish and
dumb making you think how easily these situations could be avoided
instead of making you laugh at the screen. In fact, the entire film
could have never existed if two of the dumb girls hadn't stepped into
the bride's dress together and ripped it in the first place.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit:
