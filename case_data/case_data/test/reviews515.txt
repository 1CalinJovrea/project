Excellent movie. Clean entertainment for kids.

We saw Sing at a free preview organized by the makers and AMC. I really
enjoyed watching the movie with my kids. I appreciate the fact that the
makers did not resort to toilet humor to generate laughs. The
entertainment was clean. There were no unnecessary sexual references.I like kids movies that inspire and Sing managed to do that. It
encouraged kids to get over their fears and try against all odds. All the characters were lovable and unique in their personalities.
Movie also had some very good music. Length of the movie was just fine
for kids. My kids sat through the whole movie and did not get bored or
restless till the end. Everybody in the theater seemed to have a good
time. Nice feel good movie to watch with the kids. Go for it.
