might be perceive as provocative  but...

I've not yet read the short story so i will not compare.But i do not understand all the bad critics left by some of the users
(but i do respect them). Some are blaming the acting, others the story,
the dialogs... But the most important here lays on the film itself and
its photography: look at the space occupied by the different characters
because from clear barriers it get twisted imperceptibly all along the
movie. The subject of the movie is not young adults who can't face the reality
of an outside world or some older women not able to deal with their age
(close-ups are still great and really narrative by themselves), it's
also not about decorums and society, because it can happen and fate or
destiny have nothing to do with it; it's just about a part of a life
story, not ordinary but quite unstoppable.There is more than a parallel to make with Brockeback Mountain with the
movie, the characters, the story line, the making, the sound... And it
didn't seem to bother years ago... We do not have to relate to appreciate, enjoy this slice of life that
tells everything with its title "Alone" or even "Perfect mothers" and
"the grand mothers"...
