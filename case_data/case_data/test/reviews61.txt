This is Power Rangers movie, not an X-Men

They ruined all x-men movies you ever seen I saw all X-Men movies, i am
fan of X-men, BUT this one was really awful. I can't even know how to
describe this crap. Can't believe this movie was 2.5 hours film that
was actually got into production. Its an insult of xmen movies. Its a
Power Rangers movie not X-Men.First of all, Script is just awful. "Oh good to see you" - "long time,
where you'v been" - and lets hug for 15 minutes and say how good to see
each and one of them, like you are watching some kind of TV series like
Friends or somethin'.Second: If you want to go and watch x-men crazy fight scene movie, you
will end up with super power guys use there super power to mimic the
fight at the end of the movie. All fights are 20 minutes + - of almost
3 hour film. Magneto do nothing in this movie, even in final fight
scene, he is up in the Air and thats really it. Everything looks cheap
plastic, there is a moment that they are on hill and guess what, its
like someone make a polish on this hill, its looks so cheap you can't
believe it. You fill the Studio...Third: all this movie was like made up for a sake of movie. You wont
see a Mystique for a long in this movie, She decide tolook a like a
girl (Jennifer Lawrence)... Or The budget for CGI was not enough.Fourth: Logan / Wolverine - Hey ))) he is there for 1 minute. yep that
what you will got. 1 awful minute that he is running. He is in this
film just for saying that he was there. Nothing added to the film from
his appearance. Fifth: i can understand that they want a new crew and remake all this
thing, but guys, from good x-men movie, it becomes some superhero mess.It was just unnecessary movie. They ruined all x-men movies you ever
seen Storyline is just for kids Channel. Anyway, i just felt so disappointed they just ruined it. thats it.
