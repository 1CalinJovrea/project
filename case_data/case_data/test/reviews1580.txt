Simply stunning

I understand why the casting is problematic , and I was hesitant about
watching it for a long time, but after reading a lot about Lily's story
and watching interviews with the cast I decided to give it a chance
today.I was overwhelmed by emotions for the whole time.Eddie Redmayne
is amazing in this movie, seriously.Phenomenal.Alicia Vikander really
deserves that Oscar, her performance is also remarkable.It's visually
stunning.The whole movie had this very special atmosphere that sent
chills down my spine , in a good way.I could see that Eddie really put
all of his heart into this. This movie is about unconditional love.Of
course, above all, it's about Lili's journey , but the bond between her
and Gerda is beautifully portrayed. (Don't worry, there will be no
spoilers here) I think the ending was great.Simple, but meaningful.I was amazed by every single second of this movie.
