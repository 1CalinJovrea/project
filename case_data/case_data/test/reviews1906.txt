Solid acting, fun, and fast-paced...great job!

Eisenberg, as I'm sure many will notice, is beginning to develop his
own typical character: the quick-witted, arrogant-yet-jittery, young
smart guy. But instead of running facebook, this time he's one of the
top magicians in the world. And he's perfectly cast for it.The movie follows 4 magicians or illusionists in various stages of
their careers, as they all receive mysterious invites to join up. After
meeting, the "Four Horsemen" go all Robin Hood, robbing banks and
stealing from CEOs as part of their shows, and giving the money away to
the audience. The Incredible HulkI mean, Mark Ruffalo, plays the FBI
agent trying to lock them all up, while Morgan Freeman plays the
narrator explaining everything to youI mean, the ex-magician trying to
debunk the magicreally, that's just a clever way to get Freeman to
narrate stuffPros: - Everyone puts on a solid performance. No weak points
acting-wise, great job on casting. - It's fast-paced, the action never
hits any dull parts. And even the small romance scenes don't drag on
long enough to take away from anything. You're pretty locked-in from
start to finish. - Particularly great scenes between Eisenberg,
Ruffalo, and Harrelson in the first half of the movie. - Great ending,
if you've been paying attention. Cons: - You wish there was more dialog between Eisenberg and Harrelson.
- The 2nd half of the movie might move a bit too fastagain, pay
attention. - Somebody thought this was a Marvel movie for like 5
seconds, and had The Hulk fighting Gambitwaitis that a bad thing?...Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you
shouldn't sleep on. It clocks in at just under 2 hours, but it won't
feel that long at all.
