If there were any doubts that Tom Hardy is one of the best working actors today...

...Locke provides irrefutable proof that he is. Tom Hardy is absolutely
captivating in this role, and he has to be. It's all about his
character Ivan Locke driving in a car. That's the setting. All forms of
dialogue are from Locke and from calls he gets ingoing and outgoing
through the car. The weird thing is, you don't even notice it after a
while. Everything flows so smoothly and Tom Hardy's performance
completely captures everything you'd expect from this character as he's
experiencing these dilemmas - you believe every word out of his mouth
and every subtle nuance in his expressions. Tom Hardy owns this movie
and Locke really is the perfect vehicle (literally) for showing off his
barebones acting chops.The story itself is that Ivan Locke is a construction worker who just
got off his shift and is now driving back, but then gets some calls
that give us insight into what he has going on in his personal life and
his work life and how Locke responds to this information as it gets
progressively more stressful. It's incredible that a movie at only 82
minutes can go through such a roller-coaster of emotions, and as short
as it is the movie still flies by because you're so drawn to the
character. One of the voices is Locke's coworker voiced by Andrew Scott
(Moriarty from Sherlock) and even as a voice-over his performance is
totally convincing and his back-and-forth with Hardy is electric and at
times humorous. His wife and other parties bring drama into the
equation and as things start falling apart for Locke it dips into
psychological thriller territory.Steven Knight deserves much credit as well for having written and
directed the film. It's so smooth and sleek, from the highway shots to
the few overhead shots of the city at night. It's beautiful and adds
the ideal atmosphere for this one-man show to maneuver in. It's a
wonderfully written movie, wonderfully directed, perfectly acted
(seriously, this is the performance of Hardy's career), with a spot- on
supporting cast of voices. Locke is a mesmerizing movie from beginning
to end. If you're a Tom Hardy fan or a fan of good cinema in general,
you're doing yourself a disservice by not watching Locke.
