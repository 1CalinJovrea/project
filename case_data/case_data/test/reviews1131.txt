Great Action Film with Many Twists

In New Orleans, the former smuggler Chris Faraday (Mark Wahlberg) has
regenerated and raised a family of his own with his wife Kate (Kate
Beckinsale) and their two children. Chris works in installation of
alarms and his father in locked in prison for smuggling.When his brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) dumps in the sea
water 10 pounds of cocaine that he is smuggling for the drug lord Tim
Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi) to escape from the custom officers, Chris is
forced to pay Andy's debts to protect the youngster and his own family.
Chris leaves his wife and children under the protection of his best
friend Sebastian Abney (Ben Foster) and travels in a Container Carrier
to Panama to bring counterfeit bills and raise the money to pay Briggs.
But Briggs and his partner want to force Chris to smuggle drugs and
will use his family to reach their objective. Meanwhile Chris is
betrayed and gets in trouble in Panama."Contraband" is a great action film with an engaging story that
combines action, thriller and drama. The cast is excellent with Mark
Wahlberg in the lead role and Giovanni Ribisi is almost unrecognizable
in the role of a cruel drug dealer. The plot has many twists with
betrayals and the cinematography in New Orleans and Panama is
wonderful. The ironic conclusion is a sort of contemporary "The Sting".
My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Contrabando" ("Contraband")
