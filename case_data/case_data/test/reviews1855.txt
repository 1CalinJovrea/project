Man Of Steel Is Enough For Any Man (or Woman)

(My first review on IMDb EVER. I don't know why I feel so strongly
about defending this movie.)As a summer tentpole, Man of Steel delivers. It's sprawling, feels
epic, and is loaded with enough booms and bangs to keep the popcorn
going. But don't let that distract you from the story: the origin is
properly managed, and although it does look back to Donner's take on
Superman II, it's been given a fresh spin. Let's face it, he's called SUPERman. They've made him out to be a god
on earth, and the action is adequately OTT to address it. This isn't a
movie that's meant to be taken seriously; if you can believe a man can
fly, you should be able to appreciate the outrageous action. This is clearly not The Dark Knight, but you'll at least leave the
cinema with a hint of a smile on your face, and feeling that the money
spent was actually worth it.High spot: Seeing Russel Crowe as Jor-el. What a fella. Low spot: The
last 20 minutes fell a bit flat - but they weren't dull. Feels like:
Big, loaded with thrills and spills.
