This movie raped my Intelligence

This movie is atrocious beyond words, and the first movie from which
I've ever walked out (an hour and 17 minutes into it). The session was
full of giggling middle-aged women, wetting themselves with
anticipation - I cannot believe this book and movie has appeal. Are
women really so bored, so desperate, that this is what gets them off??
The acting was appalling - I guess that's the end of Ms Johnson & Mr
Dornan's careers. And I wouldn't be surprised if the actors who refused
the role of Christian Grey are secretly relieved they had the sense to
reject it! The script was laughable. No chemistry between the two
leads. As for the 'eroticism'.....it was completely lacking. Stilted,
awkward, poor cinematography, cheesy scripting. Just terrible. Do not waste your time or money with this.
