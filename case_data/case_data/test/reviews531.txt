Matthew McConaughey is MAGNIFICENT

I have felt this before, this feel of being taken aback seated
speechless for a moment after witnessing something epic. It took me a
while but then it dawned upon me that this is what I felt when I first
watched Daniel Day-Lewis portray the Academy Award Winning role in
LINCOLN. Undoubtedly in the most outstanding performances of their
careers Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto are my favorites thus far
for bringing home the goods at the Oscars for the nominations of Best
Performance of an Actor in a Leading role and supporting roles
respectively in the bio-drama DALLAS BUYERS CLUB.If you had suddenly being told that you have only 30 days to live and
that you have to make peace with this information how would you react?
Rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) wakes up in hospital to
this news which is shared with him by his attending physician. Woodroof
who has been diagnosed positive of the HIV virus reacts to this
revelation in anger. In fact it is this anger that fuels him to the
distances that he reaches out for survival. Woodroof who was initially
treated with the drug stated AZT did not respond positively to them.
Instead the needle happy bull rider tried experimenting with
medications and drugs to concoct his own special brew of HIV anti
bodies, Strangely these events did lead him to certain discoveries that
attracted the attention of the legal system whose waking wish was to
shut him down. May it be money, may it be his human instinct to live,
Woodroof along with Rayon (Jared Leto) did not give up which invariably
resulted in the opening of the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB ; a business that
dealt the FDA unapproved medication to HIV patients.Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallee has difficulty in controlling the
rhythm of the screenplay and is wobbly at first. Trailer trash sex
scenes and orgies and drugs engross the first hour of the movie which
although has relevance to what Woodroof is all about did not contribute
much to what the movie is entirely discussing about. Once Jean gets his
feet firmly on the ground for a good 45 minutes with the actual matter
the screenplay derails yet again when the battle between life and death
becomes a political tussle in between Woodroof and the government. For
starters the entire political involvement is abruptly handled with I
would say less than 5 minutes of screen time and top of that to the
audience it breaks rhythm and direction of the true struggle of
Woodroof and Rayon. What keep this loosely driven motion picture in balance are its two
lead performers. The weight losses alone show the commitment and the
help of makeup and hairstyling simple accentuates the entire
performance even further. It's been sometime since a movie of this
caliber has been in our midst. There is no room for excessive CGI. No
room for artificial imagery and what we see is pretty much what goes on
in front of the lens.VerdictExquisite work on the part of the leading men. McConaughey and Leto are
on a whole new level. It's a slow paced bio-pic so don't expect
intensity instead expect detailing and finesse. A movie only for the
lovers of the genre. I repeat only for the lovers of the genre.Nominations-Best Motion Picture of the Year -Best Performance by an Actor in a
