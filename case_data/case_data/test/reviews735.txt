Realistic but not much point

End of Watch is a cop drama dealing with more of the perspective side
of cops and view their daily routine as to what they do. Starring Jake
Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. While you've got your disbelief suspended,
you'll want to also note of the film's found footage gimmick and shaky
cam, which asks us to buy that snappily-edited multi-camera scenes are.
It's hard to see why director David Ayer  who wrote the similarly
lurid but far superior Training Day  bothered with this presentational
quirk, since it has no bearing on the plot and is pursued too
half-heartedly to be remotely convincing. Presumably it's just designed
to fire the adrenal glands of kids hopped up on the phoney spontaneity
of scripted reality shows and army recruitment videos.Anyway, Brian and his partner, Mike (Michael Peña), ride around
busting, having unimpeachable blue-collar integrity and endeavouring to
clear the scum off the South Central mean streets. After a rewatch of the film, I must counter with the film is better the
second time around. We are witnessed to more and I have noticed small
clues that I have not noticed on the first viewing. What makes the film
a success is the gritty realistic violence as well as the chemistry
between the two leads. We can see why this film has become cult status
and is well liked.
