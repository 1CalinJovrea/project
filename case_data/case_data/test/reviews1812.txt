Enjoyable comedy caper rip-off of Ocean's Eleven

Steven Soderbergh is arguably the king of comedy capers, especially
when it comes to the leading comedy-heist flick 'Ocean's 11', and once
'Logan Lucky' made an appearance, thus ending Soderbergh's
"retirement", it was a flick I just had to see.All-in-all, 'Logan Lucky' is an entertaining and well-executed comedy
heist film with some brilliant characters and a smart conclusion...
much like 'Ocean's Eleven'... in fact, too much like 'Ocean's Eleven'.
For those who haven't yet seen the 2001 heist film, 'Logan Lucky' will
be a more appealing watch due to its intriguing structure, creative
character development and quirky tone to the crime genre, however those
like myself who have seen Soderbergh's fantastic 'Ocean's Eleven' will
just see this film as a near-enough rip-off of the project with no real
unique take on it, apart from it being set in West Virginia / North
Carolina with a blue collar family leading the caper, rather than a Las
Vegas suave- fest. But despite it all, as I say above, this film is
still an entertaining watch and gives us a break from the over-the-top
summer blockbusters that are starting to become the bane of the
cinematic industry.Channing Tatum and Adam Driver both have a real chemistry as the
fictional brothers in this flick, with the support of Daniel Craig's
Joe Bang in the mix (with a rather entertaining accent in all
fairness), likewise to Seth MacFarlane for his rather interesting
English accent which he actually pulls off quite well. The characters
are the strong point of this film, with interesting character arcs and
smartly-executed development through flashbacks and narrations, always
undertaken with a comedic twist.I think one other slight drawback here was that there was no real
villain or obstacle to overcome (the heist aside), there was never
really much of a reason for them to hit the speedway other than earning
a bit of cash, whereas in 'Ocean's Eleven', we had Andy Garcia, who was
truly despicable and someone we were hoping would get ripped off...
that level of hate wasn't really present with any character in this,
but once again, this aside the characters were still interesting enough
to keep the film running.Finally, if you have seen 'Ocean's Eleven', then you have a pretty
clear idea on how this is going to end, admittedly there is a small
part in the end which caught me out a bit and left me clueless until
the reveal, but it was pulled off in a similar manner to Soderbergh's
"predecessor" (as of such). I have nothing against this film, and I
thoroughly enjoyed it, but obviously it's level of uniqueness failed
when it came to story and structure, but the engaging characters and
humour helped it stand as a great watch.
