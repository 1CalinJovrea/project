Poorly marketed film that has its moments

'Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' is a fun little movie that has
sadly been marketed rather poorly and was probably doomed to fail from
the get go. It's been a box office flop but it isn't a fault in the
quality of the film. It's a case of the main characters being scouts
(most movies about scouts would generally be aimed at a younger
audience) and yet the movie being R rated and alienating the people the
title would suggest are going to enjoy it. If they were going to go with the R rating then they needed to take
full advantage of it, which they do in certain scenes but certainly not
in an overall sense. This had the potential to be a 'Superbad' type
movie with lots of clever and yet vulgar dialogue that would keep the
audience (an adult audience) entertained throughout. Yet throughout the
dialogue constantly feels like it's making its jokes for a younger
demographic. The only time they really make use of the R rating is in
the violence and the odd bit of graphic nudity. The dialogue was the
key let down in this sense and the only way they could have pulled off
the R rating to make this a box office success, and even then it would
have been far from a sure thing.Box office failure aside though it's actually a rather enjoyable film
for the most part. While most of the humour might be a little bit tame
in nature, it is still often funny enough to keep you chuckling if you
buy into it. It never really works as a genuine horror movie (I don't
think it was ever meant to either) as there never really feels like a
genuine threat to any of the characters. Plus I think most people
accept slow moving zombies are rarely scary to anyone in this day and
age. There's nothing "must see" about it but if you do find yourself in
a position to watch it I think you'll be pleased enough with what you
see.
