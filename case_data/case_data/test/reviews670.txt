A boring end to the Taken franchise

I love the first Taken. It is a well done revenge film with Liam Neeson
playing the role of Bryan Mills with some gravitas along with its
surprise skill of pulling off the action hero role. Then there was
Taken 2 that pretty much goes for the cliché action movie route that
was chock full of idiotic moments that just destroyed what this
franchise could have potentially been. Now we have Taken 3 which is
more Taken 2 than Taken with an extra dose of dullness, seizure
inducing action, and a stupid and cliché plot.Good: Liam Neeson gives it his all. God bless him, but it wasn't
enough.Bad: First off, the action is terribly edited. It is edited to have
each punch to be seen from ten different angles and it is just torture
on the eyes. The action is indecipherable most of the time and it is
also very underwhelming. Add a very cliché plot that is basically The
Fugitive, but done way worse. The supposed twist is so predictable that
leads to a very lame climax. Maggie Grace does nothing and Forest
Whitaker reprises his role from The Last Stand apparently and collects
a paycheck.Overall, it is a terrible end to this franchise that thankfully means
this will be lay to rest for good.
