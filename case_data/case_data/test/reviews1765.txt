This movie is HORRIBLE!!

If you're looking for a thriller where the protagonist sacrifices her
"friends'" lives in an effort to steal a few bucks from a deranged
blind man, then this is the movie for you. She cries out to God for
help after two of her friends die (one which is presumed dead) and does
not let go of the money she's stole for the ENTIRE movie when the man
that loves her does everything in his power to help her get free. Then
the writers makes it appear as if she's defeated some sort of evil when
she could've freed herself and sought real justice for the woman that
was held prisoner. This movie has NO protagonist... No one to root for.
I wish all of the characters died or ended up in prison.So remember kids, if you love money enough and you're willing to do
anything for it, to include letting your friends die, then you will
succeed in life.
