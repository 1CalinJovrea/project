Rush brings intense racing action

DIRECTION Ron Howard is amazing. His camera work here is absolutely
incredible. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and
the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring
alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The
backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough
1970′s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so
many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars
giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on
the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is
also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is
exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some
dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is
that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people
can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.Grade: ASCRIPT The story follows two F1 drivers in the mid 1970′s that don't
always get a long but have a mutual respect for one another. It centers
around British driver, James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. Peter
Morgan's script is brilliant and Howard brings it to life in some
really great ways. In essence, both characters are the protagonist and
the antagonist of the story. The film explores Hunt and his immature
ways but at the same time makes him very likable. Then the story
switches to Lauda and his quest to live his own life outside the big
family business, yet again making him likable. However, at the same
time each take their own turn in being the "bad guy" and showing you
qualities that make this person flawed and unlikable in some ways. But
then the movie brings it back around showing you why these characters
are good characters to root for and the mutual respect they have for
one another. It's the competition that drives them in this story. What
makes it so great though, is that the audience really gets to choose
who they want to root for. They build up and tear down each character
so flawlessly. The use of narration at the beginning and at the end was
a perfect choice as well. The ending becomes a bit sentimental and hits
the buttons that you'd expect from Howard and company.Grade: APERFORMANCES Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth are amazing. This is
perhaps Hemsworth's best as he portray's James Hunt in some incredible
ways. He's the dangerous driver that has Tony Stark mentalities in
terms of partying, women and being extremely likable. Yet Hemsworth
shows some depth and some emotion here as well which this character
calls for in some ways. Brühl, who you may know from Inglorious
Basterds, almost steals the show. He's the Austrian car genius who
becomes famous for knowing how to make the cars lighter and faster,
thus making him part of the Ferrari team. One can argue he's the bigger
lead here as he narrates a good chunk of the story and brings in some
great perspectives. Brühl's performance is spot on though and brings
life to this character even when Lauda is more deadpanned. Olivia Wilde
is good here although her character is a small role. This is about
Brühl and Hemsworth and they carry the movie extremely well.Grade: A+SCORE Freakin Hans Zimmer. The dude is on fire lately. A lot of people
like to criticize Zimmer for having score's that are similar or nothing
new but they work. His score for Man of Steel added a lot to that film
and his score for The Lone Ranger was about the only good part of that
movie. And his score for Rush was really great, again. It added a lot
of intensity to the racing moments and has become something he's
perfected. The score here is more laid back and in the backdrop though
many moments but when the action ramped up, so did his score as well as
your emotion.Grade: A-FINAL THOUGHTS Rush was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Given the
sports stature of F1 in the U.S., I didn't have much expectations but
Ron Howard usually delivers and he does once again. The cinematography
is gorgeous and makes it visually very exciting. The performances are
stand outs which makes the story feel so alive in many places.Overall Grade: A
