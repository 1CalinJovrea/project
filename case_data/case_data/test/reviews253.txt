Not bad... But disappointing

Although MIB3 wasn't necessarily a 'bad' movie, it certainly wasn't as
good as it could have been. It seemed, while watching the marketing
plugs, like they were going to bring the big guns and bring back all
the funny stuff and cool special effects, but they just fell short. The
original was quite good -- Funny, a little scary, cool characters, good
stunts, very original. Part II was just bad. So, if you are going to
wait 10 years to do a three-quel that nobody really was dying to see
because part 2 was so bad, then you better make part 3 REALLY good --
Right? Well -- It wasn't REALLY good. It was OK. I wanted to love it, but I
honestly only barely liked it. It was lacking the things that made the
franchise 'cool.' There was no talking pug, no funny pawn shop guy, no
real interesting or funny aliens at all. The lead bad-guy alien was a
somewhat interesting character, but no real personality. Nothing that
made you want more of him. And other than him, there was hardly any
other aliens in it. One little stint in a Chinese restaurant, but
nothing rememorable. No funny ones. I just don't understand not making
more characters like the ones that made the first such a hit. And even
Wil Smith wasn't funny. He was funnier during his promotions on talk
shows than in his movie. He just seemed to walk through the whole
thing.ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to see it in 3D. None.I hate to say it -- But the special effects were awful. With technology
today, most special effects are seamless. As an audience, we now
'expect' good effects. Half the time, it was very obvious when they
were using backdrops and green screens and had super-imposed stuff.
That's just a deal-breaker in today's movie-going world. The one truly redeeming quality it had -- and it was good -- was Josh
Brolin playing the younger K (Tommy Lee Jones). He was spot on and did
a great job. But even that isn't enough to carry a movie that wants to
be a summer Blockbuster.Bottome Line -- Rent it. It's worth seeing if you have it lying around
the house and have nothing to do, but not if you have to pay full
price, and nothing you have to run right out and see.And this is from a fan of Wil Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin.
