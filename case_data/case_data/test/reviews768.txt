Superior sequel

The first film was a generic home invasion flick with a gimmick that
reduced the 'all crime is legal for 12 hours' concept to essentially a
narrative countdown clock device - a family must survive for such and
such more time and the film wasted a decent premise. The Purge:Anarchy
rights the wrongs of its predecessor and delivers on the high concept.
The characters are thinly written, but played with adequate skill by
the actors and a more than decent performance by Frank Grillo as the
lead. The satire is about as subtle as a round of bullets to the chest
and the film never feels comfortable during the few moments the story
calms down to spend time developing the characters, but this was made
for visceral thrills and B grade enjoyment. The mayhem is relentless
and while the low budget certainly reduced the amount of arson to a few
fleeting glimpses, the violent set pieces are staged with enough wit to
make this sequel a nice surprise.
