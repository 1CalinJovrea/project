OK but not the best .

Now I know a lot of people are bashing this movie apart. Basically
people are going to see this movie thinking that its following the
mythology of Hercules. That's what most people were let down by,its
more close the mythology but this flick is based on a comic book (I
never read the comics but I know this because it was on Wikipedia,its
called Hercules : The Thracian wars by Radical) The story was well
paced and good, maybe goofy at sometimes but it was well put and solid.My only problems with this movie were the short run time (1hr,38
minutes) and the 3D. The runtime could have been extended so we could
have more things explained in a better time frame but it had to be 98
minutes long which I thought was disappointing because I wanted to see
more of the movie but I never did. I mention the 3D was bad and not too
good. It was basically good at some points but not all the time and I
was let down with 3D because my cousin pressured me to see it IMAX 3D
the IMAX format worked well with that awesome crystal clear imagery and
kickass surround sound but 3D was bad. We paid $40.00 bucks to see it
in IMAX 3D besides it would be better if it was just in IMAX 2D or
regular 2D. So all in all this movie is not the best but it is a good
attempt from Paramount and MGM and kudos to them for that. Hell, its
better than the Summit version with Kellan Lutz ewww.
