All the tween horror a parent can stand

All the "tween horror" a parent can stand.10-13-17. I just watched the new Netflix movie The Babysitter. I have
to say it was a fun, campy, coming of age horror that is lacking today.
With McG directing, it's a good mix of real life, comedy and horror
that make for an entertaining good time. From the beginning you're all
in with the 12 year old boy who lead who has a bully, a girl as a best
friend and parents that still think he needs a babysitter. Fortunately
for him, his babysitter is a bit of a beautiful bad ass. Too bad she
also dabbles in the occult. And that's when the fun starts. Good deaths
mixed with humor are what make this movie a good watch that keeps you
engaged the whole time.
