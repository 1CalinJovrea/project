Folk as Art

Folk Art is art that is not defined by your traditional academic
notions of what art should be, whether technical or aesthetic. Folk is
an old word, from old high German, basically meaning people in general. "Maudie" is a movie about folks, especially one very important central
figure who happens to be a folk artist. Maud Lewis is her name, and
it's very likely she never classified her art by any term whatsoever
during her life, much less folk art. Her art is just something she did."Maudie" is a sweet little biopic movie that at times is a bit
disturbing. The disturbing aspects are subtle. The creators/directors
gloss over some of the finer points of her life, with some alterations
of the truth. However, the important questions are asked, literally,
during the movie. It's up to the viewer to see these aspects, or not,
and take them for what they are. Your reactions or discernment thereof
may depend on prior knowledge or research of the subject.What is clear from almost the outset the movie, is that Maud and her
husband led a difficult life - not quite but almost abject poverty. Yet
Maud filled her life with beauty through her art. Flickers of relative
fame touched her life briefly, but it was not until well after her
death in 1970 that full appreciation was recognized, not that she
really cared about these things."Maudie" is a small movie with big performances by the mains,
especially Sally Hawkins. In my opinion, her performance as Maud is the
best this year so far, but I can guarantee right now that you will hear
her name come Oscar time next year. Ethan Hawke is also exceptional as
her husband Everett, although the role itself is a bit more static. The
supporting cast - mostly unknowns - does well in more cardboard cut-
out roles, but Matchett, a Canadian actress who you might recognize
from some American TV roles does a nice job as one of her earliest
patrons.Will you like this movie? I don't know, but I loved it. It is what it
is, not an action movie, but a small art-house drama/biopic of a very
interesting and amazing person who lived most of her life in obscurity.
This movie affected me not just during the viewing, with tears
streaming slowly down my face, but well after. The tears that came were
not only sad but also from joy at her creations, but most of all they
stemmed from my belief that beauty and sweetness deserves beauty and
sweetness and, well, Maud had very little of that in her life.Many biopics have been made of famous people that rose out of obscurity
or extremely challenging situations or disabilities to achieve
greatness and renown. What really interested and touched me about
Maud's story is there was no rise.(Interesting side note: Maud sold her paintings during her life for a
few coins to a few dollars at most. Now her paintings are selling for
six figures)
