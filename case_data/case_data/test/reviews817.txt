Hollywood is committing suicide

They are pushing so many sequels, prequels, reboots and offshoots that
the cash-in is going to make Hollywood collapse unto itself. Who needs
any more reboots?? One more X-Men and the world shall vomit unto
itself. I have the remedy for what ails Hollywood though: Go to
Unoriginality Anonymous meetings and force yourself to try to write an
original script People should boycott all these nefarious cash-ins Ban
JJ Abrams from anywhere near Los Angeles (and his ilk) No more Morgan
Freeman either Give Samuel Jackson an integrity infusion etcAs for this film: A group of cash whore actors gather in a film studio
to parody the original dignified metaphor that was King Kong. The
actors make jokes that are hilariously funny. Then they run away and
ambush and attack Jurassic style. Then they go somewhere and there are
a lot of explosions. The enemies are ugly, and they also fight each
other, so it's OK to kill them. After two hours the film ends. The film
is marketed to kiddies, kiddies-in-brain and China (via the token
Chinese eye candy or in this case plain vanilla useless whatever..)Did you hear? Kong called his agent in New York City, USA at the Empire
State Building to ask his images be erased from this turkey and demand
that his agent get him better work going forward. The agent wouldn't
take his call however. How could he? He didn't recognize the caller.
That isn't King Kong after all.
