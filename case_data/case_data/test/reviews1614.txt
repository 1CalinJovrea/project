Contrived, tasteless, unfunny

Really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, as supposed Rusty
Griswald attempts to bring his family together by locking them together
in a car for a week, and remaking his original trip to Hell, aka Wally
World.A variety of gross-out gags follow, each more tasteless (and therefore
more boring) than the one before it, as the family is followed by a
seemingly obsessed truckie, goes swimming in an open sewer, and, in a
pointless vignette, visit supposed Audrey and her husband on a lavish
farmhouse- and while this audience member wondered why Rusty has become
even more stupid than Chase was in the first film. Subplot involving son's romance with a cute girl traveller was
potentially amusing, but her character disappears after only a couple
of scenes. The youngest son needed to be tasered, he was such an
obnoxious twit; completely irredeeming character. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo's characters put in brief cameos in
the film's penultimate scene, as does the Wagon Queen Family Trickster,
looking as grotesque as ever, in this far too self aware rehash/
reboot. Seemingly every other scene's climax was given away in the two
trailers, which made me feel as though I had already watched the film
before. I give this film a 3/ 10, one point for each time I chuckled during
this film's seemingly never ending run-time.
