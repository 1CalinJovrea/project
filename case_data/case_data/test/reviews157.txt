An epic anthology horror flick with ten spooktacular tales of frights
and fun from eleven visionary directors, Lucky McKee, Darren Lynn
Bousman, Adam Gierasch, Neil Marshall, Mike Mendez, Dave Parker, Axelle
Carolyn, Andrew Kasch, John Skipp, Paul Solet and Ryan Schifrin. Not
only has this movie got great directors, but it also has an all star
powerful cast feat - Caroline Williams, Robert Rusler, Adrienne
Barbeau, Barry Bostwick, Lin Shaye, Pollyanna McIntosh, Marc Senter,
James Duval, Nick Principe, Alex Essoe, Tiffany Shepis-Tretta, Noah
Segan, Barbara Crampton, Stuart Gordon, John Landis, Felissa Rose, Jose
Pablo Cantillo, Kristina Klebe, Cerina Vincent, John Savage and many
more. The soundtrack also features Sean Spillane who is known for
2011's The Woman soundtrack. I watched it twice in cinemas and Hell, I
even pre-ordered the special collector's edition when I wasn't earning
very well, because that's how much I love this movie. An extremely
excellent horror anthology which is truly one of my favorites!!! This
Bluray/DVD Boxset comes with a CD soundtrack and a Special Features DVD
disc, with dozens of bonus materials with interviews, and short films
featuring Kane Hodder, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bailey Smith and more.
I feel like a million bucks having this boxset in my collection, and
it's definitely a must own if you're a collector of films!!!
