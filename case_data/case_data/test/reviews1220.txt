Jeffrey Dean Morgan Delivers A Super Performance!

Based on the allegedly haunted Dybbuk box, 'The Possession' is a fairly
interesting watch, that works in parts & Jeffrey Dean Morgan Delivers A
Super Performance! He's in Complete Form this time around! 'The Possession' Synopsis: A young girl buys an antique box at a yard
sale, unaware that inside the collectible lives a malicious ancient
spirit. The girl's father teams with his ex-wife to find a way to end
the curse upon their child.'The Possession' works in parts. The second-hour is pretty good, but
the First-Hour is slow & not very engaging. The Climax stands out, its
spooky & nicely done. Juliet Snowden & Stiles White's Screenplay works
in parts. Ole Bornedal's Direction is a plus-point. Cinematography &
Editing are good. Performance-Wise: Jeffrey Dean Morgan is up for top honors. He's in
Complete Form this time around! Kyra Sedgwick is decent. Natasha Calis
delivers aptly. Madison Davenport & Matisyahu support well. On the whole, 'The Possession' is a fairly interesting watch.
