Denzel in a wig and goofy glasses.... and that's all

Denzel Washington, whom has yet to prove himself to be a high-caliber
actor, continues to choose 'wrong' roles that just aren't very
interesting.One of the problems here is the overly-familiar
'defense-lawyer-who-rises-from-the-ashes' story-line. We've seen it,
it's been done. Yet here it is again, regurgitated like digging in the
trash for the scraps of a meal you ate last week.As an actor, Washington must focus on portraying a character who is
credulous and likable rather than just trying to show the audience how
great his acting range is (which isn't very great), this time using
'shock value' by donning an afro and some over-sized funky glasses
which mostly makes Denzel look like he's fishing for an Academy Award
(which he won't get).A film which is not particularly well directed with Denzel offering his
same old acting schtick. Court is dissolved. Next case.
