Surprisingly Tasteful...Pun Intended

I heard the hype. How this film was "so horrific" that people left
midway through the film after being so repulsed, they were physically
ill. I went in with the - negative - expectation that this was going to
be a gore fest. SPOILER: it's not. What we have here is a particularly
grisly, but effective coming of age story, a genre the French have a
penchant for. For a film about cannibalism, it's surprisingly subtle
and is generally a slow burn that builds tension well. I found the
performances uniformly strong, especially from Garance Millier. Her
transformation from shy and socially awkward to animalistic and
unhinged is a joy to watch. The atmosphere is well developed,
especially those incredibly effective party scenes that perfectly
capture what it's like at a wild college party. And I have to say, for
such a twisted film, it's surprisingly sexy. Again, thank the French. No, it's not for the faint of heart and yes, some of the imagery is
quite brutal. It could've have fleshed out - heh - some of the
relationships between certain characters better, but overall, I'd
recommend this to people with open minds and strong stomachs.
