Funny's Cousin

I watched this on cable last night. My friend who suggested we watch it
told me she'd heard from many that it was very funny. I did not think
it was funny at all. We watched about half of it (maybe the good parts
were in the second half?) Doubtful. As soon as the girl projectile vomited I just sorta knew it was going
to be awful. NOT because I don't like silly humor. Actually I love
it...when it's done right. But this in my opinion was just done wrong
and I did not laugh once whereas clearly this was meant to be a comedy.
I loved Rebel Wilson in Bridesmaids. She was hilarious. I was hoping
she would make this more entertaining but that was not the case. I don't know what it is with Hollywood lately. It's either vampires or
glee club. Its a little too much already. I would have liked to have
watched this movie with people who claimed it was hilarious and have
them explain to me what about it was funny. I just did not see it at
all.
