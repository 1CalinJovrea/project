Sprint to a dull crawl

Quickie Review:After the events of 75th Hunger Games, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is
rescued and brought to District 13 where the rebellion is brewing. Now
she must become the face of the rebellion as both sides use propaganda
against each other. Meanwhile, Katniss is overwhelmed by balancing her
responsibility to the people of Panem with her desire to save Peeta
(Josh Hutcherson). Mockingjay Part 1 is strong when it comes to the
acting talent involved and showing the behinds the scenes propaganda of
war. However, the decision to split the story into two parts has really
hurt this movie by making it feel incomplete and filled with
overstretched melodrama. While it is not a complete failure, it may be
better to hold off watching this movie till Part 2 is released.Full Review:I never read the books but I enjoyed the last two movies in the
franchise, especially Catching Fire. While I can't say I was aching to
go see Mockingjay Part 1, I was interested to know how the story
progressed after the cliff-hanger of the last movie. I was concerned
that splitting the story into two parts may have been a detrimental
choice, unfortunately my concerns were legitimate.I know I'm coming off really negative but there are definitely some
gems in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Donald Sutherland
as President Snow, were the best part of the movie. Watching them clash
and play strategic moves against each other was intriguing. The rest of
the cast do a good job in showing how they have been affected and
changed by this war. This is the first time we see the world outside of
the actual Hunger Games and District 12, which helped enrich this
movie's universe. Uniquely we get see how propaganda plays an important
role in the war. I can't remember the last war movie that delved into
that aspect. On top of that, these propaganda pieces were very moving
thanks to the rage fueled words of Katniss and the fear mongering of
Snow.A lot of the problems for this movie stem from the fact we are spending
2hrs on half a story. This led to us having an entire movie where
Katniss keeps crying and moping about either Peeta or the people of
District 12 being dead. The feeling that the movie is overstretched is
only compounded by how several scenes are just a rehash of a previous
scene, for example the recording of a propaganda (3 times) and multiple
scenes per character sulking about the people suffering. Look I'm not
heartless, I understand those are devastating things to happen to a
person, but we want to see the story move forward. I can honestly say
that apart from Katniss becoming the face of the rebellion, there is no
significant plot development since Catching Fire. There is all this
slow build up but that's all it is, a build up to an end that is
unsatisfying. Essentially this is a 2hr preview ad for Mockingjay Part
2, and quite frankly I felt mad about this when I left the cinema, and
that doesn't happen often.The pathetic cash-grab moves by studios to split the movie into two
parts is the root of all the problems for Mockingjay Part 1. To fill
the run time the movie is stuffed full with melodrama without much
weight to make you care for long. All the momentum that the previous
two movies had built has now come to a dull crawl. I'd recommend
skipping this movie till Part 2 is released and hopefully enjoy a more
complete story.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector:
