Rough time watching this!

Not sure why people are rating this so high. They try way too hard to
make it funny. It was predictable...characters were stereotypes and
there were weird long pauses after 'jokes' I guess for the audience to
laugh? Which not many did. There was a scene in the trailer that wasn't
even in the movie?!! Like what the? I wonder if they spent most of
their budget getting Scar J or she owed someone a massive favor!
