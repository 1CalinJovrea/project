See It

See ItIf, like me, you have been reluctant to watch this movie fearing that
it would amount to a long victim impact statement you can relax. The
filmmakers did a good job of showing the extreme horror of the events -
the images of the injured are realistic and graphic - without
over-emphasizing the pain and suffering caused by the perpetrators of
the crime. The actual victims could probably best decide this,but I
think the average viewer would feel that the violence was realistic but
not over-done.The story, writing, and acting were all strong, but not spectacular.
The tone of the movie worked for me. Though fairly long, it moves along
well and is somewhat suspenseful - difficult to do when everyone knows
the ending. Some reviewers objected, but I enjoyed the
documentary-style production. The movie is never slick and sometimes
used shaky or grainy images that look like news footage. For me, this
enhanced the realism of the film and did not distract. As someone who
is familiar with the actual locations I think they got them right. The
music - if there was much music - was not melodramatic or obtrusive. I
didn't like the ending credit music much, though.The film was well cast and the performances by Kevin Bacon, John
Goodman, J.K. Simmons, and others were good to see.The biggest criticism I have is that the film is ordinary and typical
of most crime dramas. The characters are believable but not
particularly colorful. Mark Walberg's character and the other
authorities behave predictably. There are no surprises, and it seems
like the filmmakers were not interested in uncovering any new or
unusual aspects of the events. Possibly this is due to respect for the
gravity of the material. The pressure to not offend anyone must have
been substantial.A scene that I especially liked was the interview of the criminal's
wife by the authorities, where a Muslim-speaking woman with a head-
scarf conducted the interview. I wish there had been more of these two
actors in the movie. I also enjoyed the actor whose character was
kidnapped by the two fugitives. He was very believable as a regular guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time. The murder of the police officer
was also realistic and disturbing.I thought the scene of the actual bombing was handled well - neither
too much nor too little.I feel that shoot-out with local police was overdone, though, and
seemed out of place in the movie. It's as if the filmmakers felt
compelled to include an obligatory big action scene. Maybe they were.
The scene dragged on and at the same time I think they missed the
opportunity to make more of the running-over the older brother with the
car. The injuries to the bombing victims were depicted very
graphically, so why was it not likewise for the death of one of the
perpetrators? It would have been good to see the reaction of the
younger brother when he realized he killed his brother.Overall I think the filmmakers did a good job, especially given the
sensitive nature of the material and the potential to offend. Perhaps
after some time has passed other filmmakers will feel less constrained
and be able to go deeper creatively. For now though, this seems about
right.
