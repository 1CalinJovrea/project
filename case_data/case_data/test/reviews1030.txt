Frustratingly Stupid, Clich√©, and Disappointing

Where to start. I am a 17 and therefore have no right to compare this to the old Lone
Ranger radio and TV show. However, I have enough knowledge to gather
that this was an utter failure of a movie when compared. From the beginning, I was certainly intrigued. The framed storyline
told by the leathery-skinned, and broken English-speaking Tonto seemed
like a great way to introduce the story. Soon, after John's brother
dies, my attention span derailed, much like the steam engine in the
beginning. The tone seemed like it would be serious. And the director's couldn't decide if it would be.There were many intense, almost dark scenes that could have made a
great film about scandal and morality, and the soundtrack did its job
highlighting important moments. The betrayal of Tonto to his people,
the heart eating brutality by Cavendish, the corrupt greed of the
railroad, and the horrifying conflict between "Civilization" and the
Indians (including a devastating massacre by Gatling gun), all could
have made a fantastic film with the same dramatic caliber as "Bury My
Heart at Wounded Knee," but instead found themselves among ill-placed
jokes, a painfully cowardly "hero," and so much CGI, that I found
myself trying to find what was actually real scenery. An hour could have been cut from this as well, between a useless hint
of a love interest between the "hero" and his sister-in-law, the
captivity of the main actress (whose escape is never explained), and
dry, uninteresting humor that ruins any form of being a serious
storyline. Did we really have to see CGI cannibalistic rabbits, or Depp
and Hammer buried long enough to joke and be licked by a horse? And even in its length, the Lone Ranger still doesn't become the
legendary hero, or anything more than a over-honored weakling who shows
up just in time to save the day. I do admit, the classic train chase at the end did take on that feeling
of a Wild West show, but could have used a healthy dose of realism to
make it not so outlandish.The Lone Ranger was a disastrous flop, full of pointless scenes and
plot changes, weak and stereotyped leading characters, and a despairing
glimpse of what could have been a fantastic film. With its storyline
balancing tediously between a "Rescue/Revenge" flick and a "Moral
Justice" drama, the script could not have possibly fulfilled both ideas
to match the status of the legendary hero.
