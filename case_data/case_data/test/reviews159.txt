Personally, I loved it!

OK, so there were some parts when their morals were completely off but
I still loved this movie! I loved that it was a comedy but at the same
time it had its completely serious moments. And Zac Efron and Miles
Teller shined in this movie. Especially Miles. He rocked in this movie.
I love it when Miles does a comedy but has his serious moments like in
The Spectacular Now. And Zac Efron. wow, Zac Efron. He really showed
you that High School Musical is over. He really stepped up his game in
this movie. And Micheal B. Jordan, wow he was awesome. I've never seen
him before but I really liked him in this movie. So, if you are looking
for a funny, a little heartfelt, sometimes serious movie, this is the
one for you. I would watch this movie again.
