Hair pulling torture

I have not seen such a badly made movie in a really long time. The only
thing good about this movie is the actors. who did a good job in doing
what they were told to. But the story is a pathetic layering of a
typical family drama projected onto flying cars that is supposed to be
our future. The jest of story, we industrialize ruthlessly to shred
nature and then struggle to find a human emotion within ourselves and
wage a war to hold on to it. Pathetic, heard many times, over and over.
I am not sure if the theme was disguised as to give a facade of art or
was so poorly directed that it was not even strongly projected. Either
way, it gave me headaches. And the music was so grossly out of sync
with the picture, it made no sense remotely. The unnecessary loud
noises had not 1% context with what was happening on screen.
Ridiculously long, out of context, poor direction, senseless sound
effects, sorry picture of the story. sheer torture to sit through it.
