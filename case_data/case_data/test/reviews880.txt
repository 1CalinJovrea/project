Raiders of the Philosopher's Stone

"As Above, So Below" centers on two archaeologists and a group of urban
spelunkers who break into the catacombs below Paris. However, unlike
most naive tourists, they have quite the reason: they are in search of
an arcane philosopher's stone that purportedly holds the powers of
eternal life. Unfortunately, the group becomes trapped in a labyrinth
of caves that lead them deeper and deeper into the earth... and closer
and closer toward the gates of hell.Directed and co-written by John Erick Dowdle, who was behind "Devil"
and the apocryphally unreleased "Poughkeepsie Tapes," "As Above, So
Below" is, at its roots, an action-packed adventure flick melded with
the makings of found-footage horror, and, although at times ridiculous,
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wildly entertaining. The central crux
of the plot hinges on a mystical stone whose existence has been buried
(literally and metaphorically) by history, and the protagonist,
Scarlett (Perdita Weeks), the daughter of an archaeologist and alchemy
student, makes it her life goal to finish her deceased father's work
and find it. While this is admittedly fantastical and no doubt requires
a slight stretching of the imagination, the historical and mythological
aspects of the film still manage to be compelling none the less.That said, the real hook of the film lies in its setting: les
Catacombes de Paris. To date, I only know of one other film that takes
place in the ghoulish settingÂ— the slightly underwhelming "Catacombs"
(2007). While both films are very different in plot, they both share
the same pull due to their unusually extraordinary setting. "As Above,
So Below" also admittedly borrows elements from Neil Marshall's "The
Descent," but those who call this film a "found footage rip-off" are
way off base. Both films take place underground, yes, and "As Above, So
Below" does appear to borrow a couple of sequential elements from
Marshall's film, but they are complete tonal opposites. There are
plenty of wild and fun elements in this film, including secret
passages, trapdoors, tunnels circling in on themselves, and ringing
telephones 500 feet under the earth, but all of it is done in good
taste and manages to evoke some solid scares and an oppressive
atmosphere. The hand-held camera-work accentuates the explorers' sense
of disorientation, and one gets the increasing sense of desperation as
they venture deeper and deeper into the belly of the beast.The most obvious issue with the film is that it suffers from a
half-baked subplot surrounding the individuals' reliving/re-facing
demons of their past, which appears to have been an overarching,
perhaps even singular theme, but it fails to really ever take hold,
crumbling under the film's dynamic subterranean locale; quite literally
under the weight of the earth. I felt like this entire subplot(?) could
have been completely stripped from the script, and we still would have
had a solid, effective film here. I don't want to say that it juggles
too many themes as a result, because it really doesn't, but the
incorporation of this with the mythology of the film comes off as a
little bit harebrained. There is already enough Indiana Jones whimsy to
be had here as it is, so these sequences of characters facing past
demons are ultimately ineffective among the rest of the film's funhouse
attractions.Even still, I found this to be a wildly entertaining thriller and a
good, claustrophobic two hours at the cinema. It is not a great film,
but it is a well made film, and is especially a delight for anyone who
is as fascinated by the Paris catacombs as I am, or just subterranean
depths in general. It's claustrophobic, fast-paced, and at times
genuinely spooky; at other times, it's absolutely silly and edges into
Indiana Jones territory, but at the end of the day, I thought this was
a solid concoction of fantasy, adventure-thriller, and supernatural
horror elements. Take it for what it is, and it's rightfully enjoyable.
6/10.
