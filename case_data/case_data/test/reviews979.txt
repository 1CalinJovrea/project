Such a great movie!

I am not sure where all of the negative reviews are coming from. This
is a modern remake that doesn't need to be compared to the original.
This was such an awesome movie. I loved everything about it especially
the music. It is not a movie remade for black people. It is a remake
for all of our children to enjoy. Quvenzhane Wallis was an absolutely
adorable and amazing Annie. I personally find the original Annie very
boring. This movie kept my attention the whole time. Cameron Diaz was
great in her role and very funny. I think she truly made this role her
own. My 6 year old daughter loved this movie and has no interest in the
original Annie.
