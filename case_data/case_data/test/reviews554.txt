I think it's his medication.

In Babylon, Florida, Margaret Larkin (Sara Catherine Bellamy) is killed
by a masked individual early in the film. Her grandmother (Candy Clark)
knows Nathan (Josh Stewart) did it without a thread of evidence. At 40
minutes into the film the killer is revealed (not really a mystery) and
is haunted by the dead girl.The film felt like it was made for TV. The plot was rather bland. An
overly perky Rachele Brooke Smith is the only eye candy. On the plus
side, the special effects reminded me of "Beetlejuice." Not a bad film,
but not one you will remember.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.
