A predictable homage to "Alien," lacking the key ingredients that made "Alien" so terrifying.

"Life" being an "Alien" ripoff should not come as a surprise to
anybody; it's been marketed that way since day one. Compared to the
majority of what the genre has been spewing out lately, though, a
derivative sci-fi thriller can be seen as a breath of fresh air. And in
many ways, "Life" succeeds as one. It's fluidly directed, well-acted,
sporadically suspenseful, and thoroughly entertaining. The space
setting lends itself to impressive visuals and claustrophobic
scenarios, of which "Life" has no shortage. The problems with the film
lie underneath the surface.Part of what made "Alien" such a terrifying experience was its bleak
atmosphere. The exploration of a cold, desolate, seemingly
uninhabitable planet; traversing through the long, white corridors of
the ship; the lingering sense of unease, not knowing where the alien
was at any given moment. "Life" is more streamlined, its action taking
place entirely on board an indistinctive space shuttle. Some scenes
serve as clear homages to "Alien," such as David (Jake Gyllenhaal)
floating through uncertain corridors mirroring Dallas' maneuvering of
the airlocks, and one of the crew members being in isolated danger,
forcing the others to decide whether or not to assist them and risk
endangering the rest of the crew. These scenes work well enough to
generate a modicum of suspense, but their impact is severely reduced
because of the fact that we've seen it before. It's difficult to be
truly scared when you know exactly what's going to happen to who and
when.Perhaps the biggest issue with "Life" is its characters. None of them
have distinct personalities; we're hardly given a chance to get to know
them. Some of the most effective scenes in "Alien" were simply watching
the crew sitting around and chatting - we saw how they interacted with
each other under normal circumstances, we noticed their quirks
firsthand, we understood what their priorities were early on; so when
crap started hitting the fan, those subtle characterizations made the
tension all the more visceral and relatable. In "Life," we're
introduced to caricatures who spout bland dialogue and do consistently
stupid things. All we really know about them is their jobs, so you
don't feel an impact when any particular character bites it.Still, "Life" is too well-made to be completely dismissed. Sci-fi
horror fans will likely find enjoyment from a one-time watch, if only
for the constant callbacks to "Alien." It fails to break any new
ground, but it's a perfectly serviceable and moderately thrilling
addition to the genre.
