Pure garbage

I have no idea why so many people like this movie, maybe I have high
standards, but i have to say, all the characters in this movie just
don't mix. You can't have all the characters the MAIN character and the
story is just pure garbage.The only bit I liked in this movies was the part where Chuck Norris
flashes into the scene, other than that it's just a bundle of shooting
and screaming and nothing else really.The whole story didn't even have a feeling that something was
happening. The plutonium was considered a piece of candy that was
stolen and everyone was focused on being a 'badass'.If all mercenaries would be crying babies like this guys, how will they
ever survive a seeing a small puppy on the side of the road? In my
opinion it's just pathetic.At least the first movie had a topic, people were talking in their
native language, here everyone knows English, no matter where they are
from.Truly I give up, since most of this actors are some of my favorite, but
repeating old movie lines (I back, I'm coming back, You came back
enough), just makes them look like clowns.One good thing about this movie is that they did get the character of
Jean-Claude Van Damme right. He is a true psycho, but they just found
out this right now.Other than this, the movies deserve a 3 star rating, and this is
generous considering that the director of the movie just bashed all the
characters head on raw concrete with his amazingly stupid script.
