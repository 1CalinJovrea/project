Painfully Didactic & Political

A great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires,
regurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political
message, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any
minds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular
treatment preaching the current "hip" left-wing social platforms
without nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to
shed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their
current ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of
the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume
rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately
their party's) talking points.All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical
romance & coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal
diarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than
a great piece of art. The ratings, therefore, represent the extent to
which the audience agrees with its sermon rather than recognizes its
degree of unbiased (with respect to 21st century American politics)
aesthetic merit.
