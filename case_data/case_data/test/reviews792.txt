Awful!

I cannot imagine how this got so many high reviews! Frankly, my husband
and I sat there appalled at what we were viewing. Yes, it had wonderful
cinematography (the only redeeming quality), otherwise it was plain
awful.My husband was laughing at how bad it was, nothing made sense, even the
end left me feeling as if I just wasted 2 hours of my life. Nicole
Kidman plays an idiot, as she going off on her diatribe of why she had
kids, I was yawning, and I noticed the guy a row away was sleeping.
Dialogue between characters was weak, Uncle Charlie looked wide eyed
and crazy the whole time, surprise, he just came out of a loony bin and
has this weird fixation on his niece (which never makes sense at all).Good luck if you want to see it, I recommend highly you do not, we went
as we saw it had 7.6 on IMDb, we were upset we trusted this rating
system. Next time I might try Rotten Tomatoes.
