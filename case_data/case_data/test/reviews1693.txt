Were my expectations too high?

I wish I liked this movie more like a lot of moviegoers who are giving
it good to even great reviews, but I left the theater with a bitter
taste in my mouth I had to write this review to reconcile my feelings.Imagine a movie that takes from the glory of Gravity, Cast Away and
Apollo 13 which also tries to be as hilarious and groovy as Guardians
of The Galaxy at times but fails? You've got The Martian. The first 1/3
of the movie was quite engaging: An astronaut on Mars expedition team
gets left behind after a huge storm because he was assumed dead. But he
was alive and we watch him try and utilize every cell of his brains and
science savvy to survive until help comes. But once he gets out of
initial danger things get all too predictable and over-wrought. Couple
of annoyances: 141 mins. About 30 mins too long for the storyline.
There were too many mentions of Disco music the commander of the
mission left behind to ill effect, unconvincing supporting characters
on the Earth who seem to be just reciting a script, and some characters
the movie shouldn't have had whatsoever (such as Kristen Wiig). Did Matt Damon do a good job ? I thought so until they showed a body
double that didn't even resemble him and from there nothing he did was
believable unfortunately. Had Damon actually lost weight without using
a body double, I might have gotten more into the movie. But then again,
he is no Christian Bale. So I wasn't expecting it but a little weight
loss would have made him more convincing. A few good acting jobs came from Michael Pena and Benedict Wong whose
characters added to the storytelling instead of subtracting it in the
midst of too many unnecessary characters reciting an already weak
script.
