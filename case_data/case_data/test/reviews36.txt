Better than it has any right to be, this revisionist spin on the classic Mary Shelley creation finds its heart in the men behind the monster

"You know this story. A crack of lightning. A mad genius. An unholy
creation," intones Daniel Radcliffe's Igor Strausman, who warns us at
the start not to expect a literal re-telling of Mary Shelley's beloved
horror classic. Instead, as imagined by writer Max Landis, this latest
spin focuses on the relationship between the titular mad genius 
played by James McAvoy  and his trusty associate Igor who becomes
instrumental to his dream of re-animating the dead. Yes, though Victor
first meets Igor as a nameless hunchback at the circus, the latter is
in fact a gifted physician whose knowledge of the human anatomy makes
him invaluable to Victor's plan of assembling various organs into an
outer shell and introducing life into it.But even before that, Victor recognises something special in the filthy
clown with the rat's nest of a hair who rushes to the aid of a trapeze
artist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) following a near- fatal fall
during a show and manipulates her bones in order to save her life. So
Victor decides to give the destitute sad-sack a new lease of life by
first busting him out of the circus, where at his cavernous home cum
laboratory, he proceeds to drain the fluid from the young man's massive
abscess, fit him with a back brace, and give him the name of his absent
flatmate Igor whom Victor says is a morphine addict who has not been
seen for months. Igor is indebted to Victor, and so without much
question, assists his 'saviour' in his experiment to bring life to a
homunculus stitched from animal- part discards from the local zoo.If you're waiting for the iconic hulking man-monster to appear, let us
warn you that you'll have to wait until the very finale, which takes
place on a very stormy evening in a remote Scottish castle right next
to the sea. Indeed, this is less a movie about Victor actually creating
his monster and what happens afterward than about the process leading
up to that pivotal moment, which its director Paul McGuigan centres on
a debate between theology and technology as well as an emotional
complement in the bond between Victor and Igor. To introduce the former
into the narrative, McGuigan interrupts the scientific proceedings with
the entry of a moralistic Scotland Yard detective (Andrew Scott), whose
past has not only made him a man of unwavering faith but also obsessed
with stopping Victor's experiments he perceives as Satanic.It is also this said inspector who causes Igor to question Victor's
research, especially in the wake of Victor's Royal College of Medicine
presentation of his first hodgepodge Prometheus which unsurprisingly
does not end well. Not unsurprising too is how Victor is constructed as
both the emotional and moral centre of the film  though he starts off
subservient to Victor, Igor struggles with the ethical implications of
using science to achieve immortality, which ultimately leaves him
conflicted with the dilemma of sticking by the person who had rescued
him from eternal ignominy or following his own conscience. Igor also
finds his heart with Lorelei, who makes a somewhat amazing recovery to
help Igor find his centre of being.Though the romance is contrived, McAvoy and Radcliffe are actors with
charm and gravitas, and they make good use of both qualities to keep us
engaged in their bromance. McAvoy overdoes the mad-genius bit on more
than one occasion, but is on the whole appropriately brash and obsessed
to play the brilliant, extroverted yet socially bizarre Victor. At
least Radcliffe complements his partner with a nicely understated
performance, which expresses his character's anguished, good-hearted
and conflicted nature at various points. Next to Victor, Igor is a much
more straightforward persona, but Radcliffe does what he can to make us
empathise with the latter's plight.On his part, McGuigan keeps a tight balance between horror, drama,
romance and even a few spots of comedy, while ensuring that the pace
doesn't sag. No stranger to Victorian-era London from directing several
episodes of 'Sherlock', he forgoes more handsome evocations for a more
grimy and downbeat vision of 19th-century London that is more befitting
of the grotesqueness of Victor's creations. Oh yes, despite the rating,
you'd do well to note that some images are absolutely not for the
squeamish, in particular because the film does not shy away from
displaying the various organs of the body which Victor uses to assemble
his unhuman work of science.As an origin story, you could do much, much worse than 'Victor
Frankenstein', which is loud and messy all right, but has a quieter,
more grounded centre on its arguments of faith versus science as well
as a compelling relationship between its two lead characters. That's
provided of course that you're willing to accept a revisionist take in
the first place, with Frankenstein played as a soulless hulk that is
prone to violence but nothing more and relegated almost to an
afterthought right at the end. Like we said, this isn't about the
monster as we typically know it, but the journey leading up to its
creation, one that is undeniably intriguing in itself.
