Finding His Way In The Forest

Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent
headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with
a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt
that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information
was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending
an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would
not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting
thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with
comments such as "I really can't tolerate judgemental people".Recently I saw another Danish movie "The Hijacking" and was so
impressed with it, that I sought out this movie as it was also a highly
regarded project. I'm glad I did. The movie reflected the idea of a
rush to judgement and all the implications of how society reacts when
information is inaccurately reinforced.The title of the movie, "The Hunt" is symbolic of Lucas's hunt for
justice, but also feeling like the hunted. It begins with friends at a
hunting camp drinking & celebrating but this hunt is all a metaphor for
Lucas's life. Perhaps it was best expressed when his son got a family
heirloom hunting rifle and it was said that now he was old enough to
find his way in the forest. "The Hunt" is really about such a journey
and the forest was thick with assumptions, accusations, hatred,
betrayal, and a host of other thorns, briars, branches and such things
to trip up the journey. Having felt like he was being hunted through a
community's narrow rifle scope of understanding, Lucas's idea of
hunting is ultimately altered....and believably so.Vinterberg does a masterful job of story telling and in such a way that
we hear a morality tale. Yes, many times the information we are told in
the news is correct. But what if it isn't? What price is paid by the
victim and his/her family? If you want to watch a movie that is
different from the typical Hollywood variety and gives you reason to
search more deeply before believing what you see and hear, watch "The
Hunt" and see if you would find your way through the same forest that
Lucas traveled. Few of us would be able to do so....
