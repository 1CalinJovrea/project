Just not funny.

I kept waiting for it to be funny. What you get is St. Elmo's fire with
robots, 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past, and the end of the
world as we know it....except not entirely. As a buddy movie, it barely
connects. As science fiction it's not imaginative. It wasn't a complete
loss, though. Because I saw it at Cinemark and I had purchased the
refillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year, the wife and I got
two large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of $6. Sadly, that
was the highlight of the film. Just as I waited for The Butler to even
remotely connected to reality, for Two Guns to be anything other that
an insulting caricature of Texans, and Gangster Squad to be anything
other than gun play, I waited in vain for The World's End to get really
funny. It didn't even get more than slightly humorous.
