Effective and frighteningly plausible

Employing found footage in a way that actually makes sense in the
context of the plot, Creep is the story of an increasingly awkward
relationship between two men that feels frighteningly plausible.The film rests upon  and succeeds because of  Mark Duplass' excellent
performance as the type of person we've all met at one time or another;
someone a little bit too keen to be your friend, inspiring conflicting
feelings of suspicion as to their motives and empathy with regard to
their ill-judged attempts at social interaction. Seen through the eyes
(or rather camera) of Aaron, the only other on-screen character (played
by writer/director Patrick Brice), it's clear fairly early on that
something isn't quite right, but should he be worried?Despite an occasional reliance on cynical jump scares (presumably
included to ensure that the tension doesn't sag  the film is
dialogue-heavy) the suspense ebbs and flows nicely and keeps you
guessing as to where it will end up going. Thankfully, for a film that
always feels like it's building up to something, the resolution is
well-judged and perfectly executed.Overall this is a very impressive effort and marks Patrick Brice out as
a filmmaker to keep an eye on.
