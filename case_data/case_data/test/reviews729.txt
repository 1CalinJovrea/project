A Great Film

I saw this movie with a girlfriend. Normally we disagree on what we
see, but after watching Collateral Beauty we both gave it top marks.
After arriving back home we looked at some of the reviews from the
professional critics and couldn't believe the belittling comments some
of them had made. It was as if they had all agreed to slag off the
film, and have a collective pop at Will Smith. We even wondered whether
we were living on a parallel universe where everything is the reverse
of what it is here! This is a very deep movie, with some great acting,
especially from Will Smith. The themes were those that affect everyone,
Love, Time, and Death. And ultimately, the film hints at the collateral
beauty which we totally miss when bereaved, and rarely see during a
normal busy day. Should have won an Oscar for best film, and Will Smith
for best actor. And I think "Time" will prove the critics very wrong.
