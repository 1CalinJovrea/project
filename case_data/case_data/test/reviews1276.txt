Terrific movie from the makers of Gomorrah

I loved this movie. Gomorrah is one of my all time favorite movies (and
book) and I was really excited when I came to know that the same team
was behind Suburra. And they didn't disappoint. The movie almost
inspired me to learn Italian to appreciate the nuances of the dialog,
but even with subtitles, I was spellbound. I saw the movie yesterday
and HAD to see it again today. I have seen Gomorrah many, many times
and will often find myself watching only a specific scene from
Gomorrah. I can see the same happening here, particularly the scenes
that feature Manfredi. Manfredi is a true bad ass and his viciousness
is very effectively played by Dionisi. What a performance! Whats
interesting is that the REAL power brokers are never shown even once.
Samurai represents them, but you never see them. So its a movie that
features the mafia without ever seeing the face of the mafia.
Brilliant!I cannot wait for the TV series.
