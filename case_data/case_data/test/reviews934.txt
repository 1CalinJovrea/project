Moderately Enjoyable To Watch

All in all, the story line, chronology, acting etc in this movie are
okay, but too clich√© as most scenes are predictable. Keira Knightley
does not portray a natural chemistry in her role as a girlfriend or
mission assistant. I find the awkwardness of her scenes has drowned the
tension & intensiveness of the movie. At a positive view, Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) did a pretty good job. His
cool, humorous kind of charisma paid off in this movie. There were some
scenes where I actually felt funny & LOL.My initial vote for this movie was '5' & he is the reason why I added
'1' more vote.
