If you haven't seen "El Segreto de sus ojos" I beg you to stop reading
and go check it out, it is, in my opinion, one of those rare and pure
thrillers that keeps you glued to the screen for two hours. Yet,
despite loving the original, I wasn't going into this one ready to
bitch about it. I am someone who is very sniffy about remakes, but hey
if you have an fascinating premise that can be explored through various
styles and dynamics I am all for it. Especially in this case, I think
that keeping some of the core material and turning other parts
completely around could have made for a fascinating narrative,
unfortunately the American remake, with the exception of maybe two or
three ides, doesn't improve, explore or further the original in anyway
and sometimes even edges the shot-by-shot remake treatment.Look, this isn't a terrible thriller, but the emotional beats you are
carried through are just the same of the original, it really seemed to
be watching a cheap version of it. It is way too reminiscent of the
original and at some moments I really felt exactly when I saw it.
Whilst at other moments I kind of felt sorry for the remake because it
doesn't manage to replicate some of the amazing photography the first
one had and actually miserably fails: this film has some really,
noticeably cheap cinematography and editing.The performances are all kind of off beat. Julia Roberts is definitely
the best one, even though she also has some low points. The rest of the
cast is just flat honestly. Nobody even tries to come in and give it
some palpable passion. The film is also inconsistent with tone and I am
not sure they understood the fascination of the original because a lot
of the focus points are just sidelined or shoehorned in.That's also a real bummer, because the film does have just a couple of
good ideas that aren't simply built on. They tread too much of the same
ground and do it in a way that is simply too familiar. I can maybe
think of one thing that was improved upon and that is mainly thanks to
Julia Roberts' talent. The score is something that positively sticks
out and probably the purest good thing to come out of the film.In the end we are treated to a fine thriller that doesn't live up to
its potential and only manages to justify its length thanks to memories
of the original and the same emotions instead of relevant improvement
and originality.
