Not just a little bit(e)

I'll start off with the "good". I did like the effects. Do not forget
this is a low budget movie. I also liked the fact that this movie did
not go down the "found footage" route (see beginning for that-or rather
don't, if you value your time)! Also the dog and his owner are by far
the best things in this film! Character and acting wise, the dog will
shame anyone in this (and they/"actors" should be ashamed, even if the
script didn't give them a lot to work with).Instead of just trying to make this gross and disgusting (something
this also achieves and if that's what you're after you can file that
under "good" too), there should've been more thought of the dialog and
characters in this. Let me put it this way: If you'd sum up the IQ
(minus the one of the dog!!!) of the characters in this, you might get
a negative result (and I'm putting it lightly).Obviously in a movie characters have to do things/decisions that don't
make sense, have to "act" careless (though they fail to convince us of
any emotion in this one other than disgust), so the movie continues to
flow into one direction. But if characters go places even zombies would
take a look at and run the other direction (and they have no brain!),
you start to wonder if you are being punked as viewer of such an
assembly of moving pictures ... it's a good thing you can laugh the
pain away, because this hurts so bad ... so so bad! Who needs a beating
when you can watch something like this?You can answer that yourself.Not every movie needs characters the viewer can feel for, though there
is not a single one (again apart from the dog), that the viewer will
feel anything for in this one. Add to that predictability from start to
finish, "humor" that might be intended, but doesn't work at all ... at
least they (makers of this) can claim, that they added another argument
for those who are giving horror a bad rep ...
