Memories need to be shared

I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it,however I'm going to
review this movie purely on the movie. There is also a reason I never
read a book right before the movie comes out,I want to judge it on it's
own merits. I really enjoyed The Giver,it really made me feel. It
celebrated life and everything that comes with
it;love,joy,laughter,sadness and everything in between. Things we take
for granted like music. The story itself is pretty straightforward but
that's not necessarily a bad things. Most of the acting was good, Jeff
Bridges however was the stand out to me. Using black and white and
colour to show what the community is lacking was used well.
