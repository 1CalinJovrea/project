Biggest disappointment of 2015

I expected Age of Ultron to be a worthy sequel to the glorious
Avengers.When I went to the cinema I expected to see something
impressive and innovative.I was completely wrong.The movie is a
complete mess, with pointless filler scenes.Right from the beginning of
the movie they showed a combat scene out of nowhere and without ANY
explanations whatsoever.They showed Tony using his Iron Man suit when
in Iron Man 3 he destroyed all of them.How did Lokis scepter fall into
bad guys's hands ? In order to understand it you need to watch the
series ''Agents of SHIELD'', witch is completely unacceptable as far as
i'm concerned.Later on they show Ultron,Vision, and Scarlet witch whose
abilities didn't even explain ! How did they come up with that idea ?
Not all people read comics neither watch the series.Take me for
example, during the movie i felt so empty which was the last feeling i
expected from the movie.Even the finale witch was supposed to be
''epic'' was so anti-climatic and strange.Don't get me wrong, i LOVED
the first Avengers movie, however. this one is just a waste of time and
money.It is by far the worst movie of 2015 and the worst sequel i have
ever watched.
