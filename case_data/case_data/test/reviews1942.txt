Yawn of the dead.....

What could possibly go wrong when three best friends decide to join the
Boy Scouts? When bloodthirsty zombies invade their once-peaceful town, it's up to
kindhearted Ben, quick-witted Carter, and clown Augie to save the day. With help from Denise, a cocktail waitress, the boys must put their
scouting skills to the ultimate test to save mankind and earn their
zombie-killing badges.......The best thing about this film is the title, it sparks curiosity, and
then a slight fear of dread. After all Wright and Pegg set the
benchmark for comedy horror back in 2004 with Shaun Of The Dead, and
many people have tried to equal their success, but none have came even
close to matching the hilarity and genuine scares of the British
Behemoth.And here, it's depressingly similar.But the added bonus here is that we have young boys as the heroes of
the piece, and that's the gimmick, albeit throw in some pointless Dolly
Parton wet dream, and a Britney dance off, nothing new happens, and
it's just a case of the heroes running away from undead who walk
slightly faster than your average zombie.So it's the regular tropes horror comedies have to offer on display
here. Human organs hilariously put in zombies mouths, young men finding
their mojo halfway through the film, the token fat boy who keeps
falling over for no reason, the stoner one who always makes mistakes
and puts our friends in peril, and of course, the hero of the piece,
who fancies the heroine.............zzzzzzzzzzDavid Koechner turns up briefly as the 'chief' zombie, but there is
nothing new here, just the same, tired, toilet humour that we all have
apparently settled with.Well I for one certainly haven't, it's a terrible movie, and it's no
surprise that it bombed as badly as it did.Avoid.And that's scouts honour.
