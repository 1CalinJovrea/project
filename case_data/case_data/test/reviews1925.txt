Dying girl becomes inspiration for growth in this manipulative tearjerker

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is based on the novel of the same name
by Jesse Andrews, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was directed
by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a one-time assistant to Martin Scorsese. The
story is set in Pittsburgh and its protagonist is Greg Gaines (Thomas
Mann), a teenager who maintains superficial relationships with most of
the cliques in the high school he attends. A good part of the opening
scenes involve stuff we've seen before in countless other movies that
feature high school kidsthere are the usual geeks, Goths and that one
good looking girl on whom the main character has a crush. Greg also has
hippies for parents with his sociology professor dad dressing often in
a sarong and enamored with exotic cuisine, and a mother who is
perennially imbibing a glass of wine which undoubtedly helps her be
more sociable.Greg's African-American friend Earl comes from lower socioeconomic
circumstances and the family has virtually "adopted" him since
childhood. Greg dubs Earl a "co-worker," unable to call him a friend 
they spend a great deal of time concocting parodies of famous films,
often using Claymation or stop-action animation (perhaps the neatest
aspect of the film). Earl is a weak character as he basically serves
the function of being Greg's sidekickhe has little to do throughout
the narrative except having a temporary falling out with Greg over the
"dying girl" of the title.The "dying girl" is Greg's fellow student Rachelwhen Greg's mother
hears that Rachel has leukemia, she sends her son over to visit her and
they quickly become friends. Madison (the good looking student on whom
Greg has a crush) convinces him to make one of his quirky movies for
Rachel. Eventually Greg and Rachel have their own falling out over her decision
to stop chemotherapy treatments. Undoubtedly echoing the beliefs of the
films' scenarists, Greg self-righteously castigates Rachel for giving
up the "treatment" which he believes is the only thing that might save
her (why is chemo the only alternative for cancer victims in the
movies?). Trusting her own instincts, Rachel decides that the chemo is
only making her worse and decides to go off of it. Greg finally comes to his senses and I suppose realizes that not
accepting Rachel's decision was selfish on his part. So instead of
going to the prom with Madison, he brings the movie that he and Earl
made for Rachel, and shows it to her on her deathbed. Rachel, like Earl, is there to highlight Greg's coming of age story.
She's merely the "cancer victim" that helps Greg come out of his shell
hardly what you would call a "fleshed out" character. Andrews is
content to manipulate our emotions by stating the obviousthe death of
a family member or friend from cancer is always a sad story indeed.Greg's emergence as a more mature, less self-absorbed youth, now headed
for college, is the big lesson we're supposed to take from all this.
Somehow it's the idea of a dying girl in itself that leads the
protagonist to a great epiphany. I say a dying girl is a manipulative
trope and inspiration for growth should not come from the cemetery.
