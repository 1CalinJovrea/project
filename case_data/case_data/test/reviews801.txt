Too many clichés taken from too many better sources

The powers of the gods are dwindling and the gods are slowly fading
into oblivion. Monsters are being raised from wherever. Buildings are
sliding all around the place. And there is no reason to care about ANY
of it. Ares and Hades are villains just as we've seen in nearly EVERY Greek
mythology based storyline. I just want to pound my head against the
wall every time I see this cinematic flatulence.The love interest from the first movie is gone and instead of recasting
the part, they just kill off the character. Bobo the Owl makes another
cameo in this movie, playing the role of Wilson the Volleyball from
Castaway. The blue ents are gone... I guess the action figures must not
have sold that well.When the Titan emerges (and it is the ONLY titan in the movie), he
looks like the lava Titan from Disney's Hercules. The Titan shouts a
lot, but hell if I could ever understand a word he said.At least Perseus doesn't look like he came from the Jarhead Clan
anymore. But he is still an idiot. Zeus comes to him in the beginning
of the story to tell him that the world is coming to an end and he
needs his help. Perseus refuses because... get this... he refuses to
leave his son. Apparently despite having god blood in his veins he is
still unable to think far enough in advance to realize that if the
world comes to an end, he'll be leaving his son permanently.The roles of Hades, Zeus and Hephaestus were really good, but three
good performances just could not save this turkey from its bad writing
and a dreadfully boring plot riddled with clichés.
