It really is as silly as the premise.

I watched this even though I thought the premise was absurd. I went by
the reviews. The characters make the typical stupid choices unlike the Gieco
commercial.I don't think I can spoil this. A group of teens with no adults is what
this centers on. This is more time than I wanted to waste to warn the more sophisticated
horror fans to not waste their time. I wish someone warned me.I don't understand why people wrote that it was an old fashion horror.
There is no CGI, special effects, nor is it a slash and hack so maybe
that's what they mean by like the 70's.The only thing that reminded me of older horror films was the obvious
low budget.The acting was good enough ... but the premise is so stupid and
everything else was not strong enough to override that.
