An Orgasmic Audio-Visual Fair!

Here's a fine example of a film that may have an inconsistent and a
familiar screenplay, but still makes up for an exciting watch due to
its director Joseph Kosinski's extra-ordinary sense of creating
spectacles that feel like breathing artworks. The effective background
music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process
starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic
audio-visual fair, just like Kosinski's previous and debut film-
Tron:Legacy. He's more ambitious here, and more passionate. Although,
you can't help but recognize the influences behind the story-which are
some sci-fi epics I won't name here-and feel deja-vu; it still never
stops being exciting and interesting. Oh, BTW I suggest to listen to
Oblivion OST by M83 (amazing shoegaze/electronica band) before going
for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans Zimmer-Daft
Punk-M83 all together at once. And that's effing awesome!I wait for the day when Kosinski is handed an ambitious and promising
screenplay. That day, I believe, he will make a master-piece worth
savoring for lifetime.
