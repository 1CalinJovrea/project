Horrible movie, full of clichés.

This was a complete waste fo time. Here are the main reasons:1. The performance by the main characters was very poor and artificial.
2. The director did a bad job, as did the editor. 3. The main story is
weak and uninspired. There are clichés all over the place. Dialogue is
poor and boring. The whole story is completely dubious and it is hard
to take the movie seriously. 4. Historically speaking, the film
sacrifices the real events that occurred for the sake of extra special
effects. The fact that two cities were destroyed before anything got to
Pompeii is ignored completely. The 'fire rain' on Pompeii also never
happened, as did the tsunami. It simply made no sense to add everything
but the kitchen sink into this movie. 'The Gladiator' was fictional,
but it never claimed to be anything else. This film claims to be based
on real events, when it clearly isn't in the most important aspects of
what happened that day. In Pompeii, people died because they inhaled
the smoke, not because fire rained down on them or tsunamis washed them
away. The arena (stadium) was never destroyed by the earhquake and it
still stands in Pompeii to this day. Dubious to the extreme.Overall very very poor.
