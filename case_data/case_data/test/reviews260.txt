A very entertaining romantic comedy

Even though I'm not a fan of the romantic comedy genre, I tend to find
the films from that style more tolerable when they come from
independent cinema, because they usually possess an unusual artistic
varnish which suggests deeper subjects. Besides, these films usually
include more solid actors than the Hollywood stars whose routines we
know by heart. Ruby Sparks belongs to that type of "indie" romantic
cinema with a message, employing the clich√©s of the genre in order to
tell an apparently fantastic story, but with a solid core of reality
and valuable life lessons.The use of "magic" in a romantic comedy is usually an excuse to solve
situations in the most convenient way, without having to think too
much. Nevertheless, in Ruby Sparks, screenwriter Zoe Kazan employs the
fantastic elements as in indispensable basis of the premise. The main
characters has some "literary groupies" who try to seduce him because
of his fame; however, he's looking for someone to love him for
himself...and when he finally finds Ruby, it seems that his wish was
accomplished. But ironically, the main character can't accept her like
she is and he proceeds to "improve" her, which provokes chaos in the
relationship, and in his small universe of friends and family. In other
words, finding (or "creating") the perfect woman doesn't necessarily
lead to the perfect relationship. And from then on, anyone can draw
his/her conclusions about this film, which ended up being much deeper
and more ingenious than I expected.Having said that, Ruby Sparks occasionally falls into the typical vices
of independent cinema. The screenplay has some forced elements and
occasionally can't avoid a pretentious air which is characteristic of
the "Sundance syndrome". Going back to the pros, most of the cast
brings competent performances, highlighting Kazan. I think the only
weak spot is Antonio Banderas, who feels kinda forced in his character.In summary, I enjoyed Ruby Sparks pretty much and I recommend it to the
fans of the romantic comedy as well as to its haters, because it proves
that the genre can produce interesting and amusing stuff when it's in
the hands of filmmakers with talent.
