Great Action & Greater Laughs!!

I just saw a preview of "Hitman's Bodyguard" last night with my wife.
We are both fan's of action and comedy and went into this hoping it
would be as good as we hoped from the actor's involved. I am a HUGE Sam
Jackson fan and an equally big Ryan Reynolds fan. I'm glad to say that
this movie did not disappoint! I would've given this movie a 10 if only voting on the action and
comedy but there were a couple of plot points that were slightly
predictable. I don't feel these couple of things hurt the movie much
due to what the movie is being advertised as, which is an action comedy
and this is by far where it shines. I laughed harder during some scenes
of this movie than I've laughed in a long time during a movie. The last
I remember laughing harder is last year during "Deadpool". If you like lots of action and great comedy with actors with plenty of
chemistry and don't mind a significant amount of f-bombs, which if
you're a Sam Jackson fan I'm guessing you don't, then drop some cash
for a ticket. You won't be disappointed!!
