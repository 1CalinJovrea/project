Fast and Furious 6

The cars are one of the basic elements for action movies nowadays and
that's the reason for fast & furious's success. After Rio, Toretto's
family: Dominic, O Conner, Mia are now at Europa, and Hobbs ask them
for help because a Russian ex-military is planning traffic with a
powerful weapon; one argue is convincing: Letty is alive. Spectacular
sequences, big cars, London, and Spain Highways are the complement for
this movie. When we think that the movie is ending, takes places a
story change. One of the think that like me from the movie is that
between lines they promote the value of the family, and one dialog from
Toretto show this: "Do not turn your back on your family even if they
give it to you if". A excellent sequence introduce a Jason Statham as
a new villain for the next movie and explain how Han Lue dead.
