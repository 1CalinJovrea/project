Pretentious and dull when it's not being disturbing or disgusting

We went into this movie with high hopes for some sort of absurdist
black comedy, as it's being billed - and as many reviewers have
described it. Instead, we were treated to an overlong, pretentious art
project that felt more like an undergraduate student film created by an
emotionally stunted sophomore. All the actor's lines are delivered
deadpan, with no emotion, regardless of the situation. There is are a
few (very minor) chuckles to be sure, but they hardly compensate for
the overall deadly serious tone. It's dreary, poorly edited, and
contains some revolting scenes involving violent death and extreme
animal cruelty. Truly terrible and a waste of a great cast.Spoiler: The ending is.
