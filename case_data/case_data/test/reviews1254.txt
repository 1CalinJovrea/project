Makes "Elysium" look like "Sesame Street."

If you thought that Neill Blomkamp's "Elysium" was a bleak enough
dystopia, brace yourself for Bong Joon-ho's latest film. "Snowpiercer"
is what George Orwell would write if he wanted to set "1984" aboard the
mad Blaine the Mono from Stephen King's "The Waste Lands". Grim and
fatalistic, this picture packs a chilly, compelling punch.The apocalypse has already happened, with the planet transformed into a
frozen block of ice over the next twenty years. The last dregs of
mankind sought refuge aboard an ever-moving train (the titular
"Snowpiercer") barreling through the icy landscape. The central
conflict of "Snowpiercer" deals, of course, with a major class
struggle, with most of the refugees hunkering in the ghettoized tail
section of the train. The privileged few live in the front cars (I'm
sure any similarities to the basic concept of the bus boycotts that
started the civil rights movement are intentional), and the ragged
masses congregating in the rear are sick of the oppression, and
rebellion begins to foment.The de facto "Everyman" leader is Curtis (Chris Evans), a taciturn
fellow who quietly waits for the right time to strike. In the meantime,
he acts as a big brother figure to his friend, Edgar (an eager Jamie
Bell), while enjoying camaraderie with his fellow "tailies," including
sweet-natured mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer, an unexpected but
wonderful addition to a dystopian drama) and wizened elder Gilliam
(John Hurt, always expected and always welcome in a dystopian drama).
Almost immediately, this feels like a futuristic retelling of a drama
set on a train bound for Auschwitz.Indeed, any time the boat is rocked, Gestapo-like representatives from
the front come to admonish the poor, huddled masses. They are headed by
Mason (a wickedly over-the-top Tilda Swinton, who might very well be
the most fiery character in the film), who seems to relish in her
duties, which include forcing miscreants to shove their extremities
into the frigid wastes while praising the all-powerful Wilford, the
"Big Brother" figure of this story who inhabits the very front of the
engine. Wilford also seems to order the cherry-picking of certain
tailie children, never to return. Eventually, Tanya's son is taken,
which sparks the revolution, which encompasses the first half of the
film with vicious, "Oldboy"-esque brawls and rapturous moments of
rebellion (there's one scene involving a kid running through darkness
with a fiery torch; I swear, all it needed was a Vangelis score to
complete it!). Once they have gained the upper hand, the rebels enlist
the help of an drugged-up Korean engineer (Kang-ho Song) and his
daughter to help them in their quest for the front."Snowpiercer" is beautifully imaginative with its rather simplistic
story, and indeed, Bong Joon- ho gets to assemble a hodgepodge of
dystopian bleakness and utopian bliss. Full credit to the set designers
for creating distinct "levels" the further up the train our heroes go.
And indeed, the Holocaust references really do hit home as the film
goes on. One car, for instance, involves children being indoctrinated
about how great their glorious leader Wilford is with a Hitler
Youth-esque sort of rigmarole. Indeed, the fact that the cheeriest spot
in the entire train is the potential source for future atrocity and
oppression is made abundantly clear, and the pregnant,
propaganda-spewing teacher (a beamingly insane Alison Pill) is ten
times more terrifying than the axe-toting guards sent to subdue the
revolt.Chris Evans makes for a wonderfully stoic protagonist, and even though
the role could easily fall into bland territory, I feel that his
inherent "American"-ness that made him a wonderful choice for a certain
Marvel hero hearkens back to the days of Charlton Heston. That said, he
gets a heartfelt soliloquy in the end that stands as his finest bit of
acting to date. The rest of the ensemble fleshes out their characters
quite wonderfully; special mention must be made to Swinton's slimy
Goebbels-esque surrogate, Spencer's lived-in dignity that aided her so
much in "Fruitvale Station", and the appearance of a certain actor at
the very end that puts a face to Big Brother at last.There is naught a dull moment in "Snowpiercer"; by the halfway mark, so
much has been packed in, and yet at the same time, it never feels too
much. Harvey Weinstein wanted to cut twenty minutes of footage from the
film and add a voice-over. "Snowpiercer", like "Blade Runner" thirty
years before, isn't as inaccessible to audiences as one might think. It
knows exactly what it is, exactly what it wants to be, and exactly how
to show it. It may lack the spit-shine polish of "Blade Runner", but it
makes up for it in sheer grit.
