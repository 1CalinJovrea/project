Not as bad as they say, not at all

2015 may be the year of Steve Jobs in terms of movies. Michael
Fassbender is considered an Oscar front-runner in a film directed by
Danny Boyle, Academy Award winner for "Slumdog Millionaire". However,
there also already was a Steve Jobs biopic done 2 years ago. It has not
received favorable reviews as a whole and director Joshua Michael Stern
is fairly unknown just like writer Matt Whiteley. The main character is
played by Ashton Kutcher here and he got a Razzie performance for his
portrayal. I personally believe this was not justified. He did a fairly
decent job in portraying the Apple mastermind and you could definitely
see Jobs' mannerisms in Kutcher's performance. Also a thumbs-up for the
makeup department. Kutcher looks nothing like Jobs, but they made it
work.I believe that, as a whole, this was a movie that did not have really
many great moments, but it was solid from start to finish and even at a
massive runtime of over 2 hours, there were hardly no segments when the
film dragged. This has received a lot of unjust criticism. I personally
enjoyed the watch and it also made an informative impact as it tells
you a lot about the life and career of Steve Jobs. I myself never
worked with an Apple computer, certainly prefer Windows, so it's even
more impressive that I got to like this film. Thumbs up. Good job from
everybody involved.
