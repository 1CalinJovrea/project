Funny, amusing, one-time comedy

Daddy's Home is not classic comedy, it's one of those one-time, watch
on an airplane movie just to pass the time. Will Ferrell plays the
stepfather who's always wanted to be a father, clearly a wimpy kid in
his childhood that grew up to be a pushover adult that lives for other
people. Dusty Mayron played by Mark Wahlberg, a tough guy, no strings
attached kind of dad who is still living and reliving his adventure
years instead of facing his own responsibilities. It has its moments, Will Ferrell has his typical outbursts and the
stark contrast between the two father figures is enough amusement on
its own. It has its corny moments (especially near the end, although I won't say
what to avoid spoiling anything) that are almost cringe-worthy, but
otherwise I would say it's quite an enjoyable film, although good for
just the one-time watch only.
