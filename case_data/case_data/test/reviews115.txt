I did not like this movie at ALL. I've no idea why it has wound up in
so many Top Ten Movies of 2013 lists online. I wonder did the creators
of those lists actually watch it at all. In fact, there was nothing
redeeming about it for me and within minutes of it starting I wanted to
turn it off but I watched to the end, hoping that something - anything
- might happen. OK, so the cinematography and soundtrack etc. are
totally unoffensive, but in my opinion, it is grossly over-acted,
including the OT's childish whining. ("Oh-ka-aaaaay.") Their
conversations sound like a dialogue piece written by a high school kid
for homework and the delivery of it all is just so.... fake. This is a
'chick flick', so if that's what you're into, you might like this show.
Otherwise, you'll end up giving whoever suggested watching it a really
hard time. Probably for life.
