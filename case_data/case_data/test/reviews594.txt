A massive, formulaic disappointment, with a towering performance from Michael Shannon

Having developed a morbid fascination with serial killers over the past
few years, I was delighted to hear that Richard Kuklinski, one of the
most prolific and emotionless mass murderers in history, was to be
given the cinematic treatment. Not only was his story ripe for a juicy
adaptation, but Michael Shannon, the most consistently mesmerising
actor working in film today, was cast as the titular Iceman. Sadly,
inexperienced director Ariel Vromen, who up to this point had only made
two films I've never heard of, has delivered a by-the-numbers biopic;
one that follows familiar genre conventions and whitewashes Kuklinski's
story completely in favour of a formula that a mainstream audience can
comfortably follow.After being impressed by his towering frame and generally intimidating
nature, mob boss Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta), who is in the employ of the
Gambino crime family, takes the young Richard Kuklinski under his wing.
To get a feel for him, DeMeo tells Kuklinski to kill at tramp in broad
daylight, to which Kuklinski coldly obeys . Soon enough, Kuklinski is
carrying out mob hits for DeMeo, while telling his clueless wife
Deborah (Winona Ryder) that he is in finance. He meets fellow contract
killer Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Prongay (Chris Evans), who teaches Kuklinski
the benefits of using cyanide to carry out the murders, and then
freezing the bodies to rule out a time of death. But with DeMeo coming
under pressure from his boss Leonard Marks (Robert Davi) for a drug
deal gone wrong, Kuklinki finds himself and his family under threat.What might have been a fascinating insight into the inner workings of a
sociopath, The Iceman is nothing more than your standard
straight-to-DVD mobster movie. Completely ignoring Kuklinski's natural
instinct for murder (he was a serial killer long before the mob
approached him) and his reputation as a merciless and cruel man,
beating and killing men for the slightest of reasons, Vromen even adds
a family angle that is completely untrue. To give the lead character a
bit of recognisable humanity, here he is portrayed as a loving family
man, dedicated to his wife and kids as the mob close around him. In
fact, in real life Kuklinski was an aggressive wife-beater; a
tyrannical king of the household who regularly committed acts of
physical and mental abuse on his family.Artistic license is a right that every film-maker has when conducting a
biopic, but when there's a complex and fascinating story to tell,
however dubious some of Kuklinski's claims are (he claims to be
responsible for the murder of Jimmy Hoffa), then why make such drastic
changes if all you're doing is making your subject the same character
seen a thousand times before? Shannon deserves better than that, and
his unnerving performance is one of the few saving graces here, but his
character is reduced to nothing more than a standard mobster, seduced
by the lifestyle and cutting himself off from regular life. He was a
cruel, savage monster, who disposed of some of his victims by having
them eaten alive by rats (or so he claims), or in one incident, he
allowed his victim time to pray to God to see if he would answer his
prayers, before killing him (this scene is played out in the film with
James Franco as the victim).Plot strands veer off path and are offered no resolution, making them
completely redundant. Some are intriguing, such as Stephen Dorff's
appearance as Kuklinski's imprisoned paedophile brother, who hints at
Kuklinski's dark childhood and abuse. Others are not, such as DeMeo's
right-hand man Josh Rosenthal (David Schwimmer) who is given more
screen time than necessary, only for the story to fizzle out into
absolutely nothing, as does DeMeo himself. Given a longer running time,
a more experienced director, and ultimately more commitment to the
source material (various books and recordings exist of Kukinski, the
most popular being Philip Carlo's book The Iceman: Confessions of a
Mafia Contratc Killer and the TV movie The Iceman Tapes), this could
have been highly engrossing cinema, instead it's a crushing
disappointment, saved only by Shannon's imposing performance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
