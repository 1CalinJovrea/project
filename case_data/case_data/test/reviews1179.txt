When you love Movies you have to be careful with them, you might never get 'em again.

So I just Finished Nocturnal Animals and to put as bluntly as possible
I absolutely loved it and it might end up being one of my top 10
favorite movie of the year. Well it's basically two movies in one. One
half appeals to my lust for grim blood soaked, dark genre fare while
the other half plays like an interpersonal glossy drama that's just as
compelling. Both feel as if they could hold entire films in their own
right and grabbed me till the very end. It's much better if you go in
cold so I won't really say much more but if you love a good thriller,
crime drama or just good film making in general and it's playing near
you please do yourself a favor and let Mr Tom Ford take you on a trip
through some movie magic.
