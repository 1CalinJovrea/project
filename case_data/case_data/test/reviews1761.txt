Great Entertainment

The story behind this movie is so engaging that it is a perfect
platform for good performances and none of the players disappoints.
Hilary Swank has never been better: tough but kind-hearted, determined
but vulnerable. Tommy Lee Jones is at his salty, rough-edged,
believable best. Since Mr. Jones also directed the film it is not just
his rugged pioneer character that creates the authenticity of this
portrait the Plains sod-busters in pre-statehood Nebraska. From the
opening scene your senses are immersed in the grit, hunger, muscle-ache
and the incessant wind of this stark place that always seems to be on
the edge of disaster. The casting was impeccable, down to the smallest
role and especially for the non-speaking parts (that will make more
sense once you've seen the film.) I don't think the movie is without
flaws. There is one scene that I felt was unnecessary and presented the
male lead (Jones) out of character. If not for that I would have rated
this beautiful, riveting movie a 10.
