I feel like my IQ has dropped to 0; worst and dumbest movie EVER

This "movie" is TERRIBLE!! It's a disgrace. I can't believe that I
watched this "movie", I have never felt so angry and stunned about
watching a movie ever before. I really don't understand why Jason Momoa
and Keanu Reeves decided to play in this "movie". There is not one
positive thing to say about this "movie". It's pure garbage because:- For starters, we don't get to know any of the characters and their
backstories at all. They barely even talk, I think this movie contains
about 5 minutes of dialogue. And even that dialogue sucks. - The movie just randomly starts and continues without any explanation
about why this dystopia came about. Nothing ever gets explained?! This
makes the whole movie a total mess and utterly worthless. - None of the actors were convincing, they're actually very laughable
but at the same time painfully boring to watch.- This whole movie could have been made in half an hour, there is
almost no dialogue and literally nothing happens! Everything takes way
too much time, we see people walking, people walking, people walking
and a lot of boring desert shots. Oh and some hipster music. THAT'S IT.- I think the goal was to make some kind of art-house movie, but this
failed BIG TIME. This movie has no meaning to it at all. - After already 10 minutes it became pretty clear to me that this movie
was gonna suck. The movie is trying to be "different and weird" so
hard, it's just depressing and shameful to watch. - This is supposed to be a romance/sci-fi?? This is hilarious, there is
no romance and no sci-fi. The only category this movie can be linked to
is garbage. - I watched the entire movie, just to see if anything would happen and
if in the end the movie would make any sense; well NO!!!!!Please do not watch this movie, it will make you angry and sad. It's
absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, even Twilight would be a
masterpiece compared to this "movie".
