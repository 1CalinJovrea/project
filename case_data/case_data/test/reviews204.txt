Disney is making Marvel movies now.. ? its great to be alive

Big Hero 6 is another movie based on Marvel source material but isn't
like others recently released.. this one is also a Disney animated
feature. How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite
animated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid
depression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he
meets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney
character since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type
robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax
as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his
new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax
into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments
because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome
superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The
other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality
traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro
and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience
we can never have enough Baymax.I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy
also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped,
although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a
fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out
of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour
of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for
people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by
the end then something must be wrong with you!
