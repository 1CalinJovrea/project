Gave it a 1 so that hopefully Expendables 4 wont be pg-13

This movie isn't a 1 out of 10. Its an overall decent, okay movie,
maybe worth renting. BUT. The most beautiful aspect of the 1st two, the
realistically bloody action scenes were replaced by a completely
unrealistic vibe of NO BLOOD at all! If you want to see blanks just fly
into people and bodys flop like the NBA, then watch this movie. I see
on IMDb that Rambo 5 and Expendables 4 are announced. Please Sly make
these rated R and stay true to what you are good at. The final scene of
this movie would have been so cool if it had the vibe and rating of the
first two. Plot, story line, excitement, etc all stayed pretty good but
it was just missing that realistically violent aspect.
