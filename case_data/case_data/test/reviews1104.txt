James Dashner, Wes Ball and T.S. Nowlin owe the readers an apology!!!

*Warning, contains spoilers. Only read this review if you have read the
books and seen both movies..*I went into 'The Scorch Trials' expecting the worst since 'Maze Runner'
did such a horrible job with the story already. I didn't expect it to
be this awful. Why even bother making a book into the movie if you are
not even going to follow any of the story line? This movie had nothing
to do with the books, first off I have a question for Nowlin (the
screenplay writer) why call it the 'Scorch Trials' if there was no
TRIAL?? The book had a trial that the kids had to pass; this movie had
a bunch of kids escaping WCKD and running around in a desert. There was
nothing that was remotely a trial about it. This movie had me so angry
my eyes got watery and I had a migraine.Look, as someone who reads a lot of novels I understand that movies
can't perfectly portray the books, but to have the audacity to take
these fun, enthralling novels and turn them into a down-graded action
pile of garbage, that's insulting to the readers. Any person I know who
read the books and saw the movie was absolutely insulted and
astonished.Let's focus on the movie flaws here for a moment in case you're
wondering why I am so angry... ( if you care) 1.) Why do we already
know about the Right Arm in this movie?? That's not until the third
book. 2.) Why wasn't this a trial? What was so wrong with the MAIN plot
of the book that you turned into a movie? 3.) Why did the cranks have
roots? The cranks were supposed to have levels of being gone which made
them interesting and not just a bunch of cgi, moronic monsters. 4.)Why
was Thomas and Theresa incapable of having telepathy? 5.)How is it that
all of them are immunes but Winston was killed immediately after a
bite? 6.)Why was the scorch a desert? The scorch is supposed to be an
unbearable terrain where you cant survive for long, it's supposed to
show how badly the Flare effected the earth. 7.)Why did Nowlin feel
that Thomas having 'killed by group B' written on his neck wasn't a
fantastic edge-of-your-seat piece of the novel? I guess since he
skimmed the book and decided to write his own story he threw all of the
exciting and mysterious concepts of the novel out the window and make
it a movie of running around not doing anything with any real
substance.I really need those questions answered because my mind is actually
blown, I cannot believe that the Director and Screenplay writer had the
guts to call this movie 'The Maze Runner Series'I have two positives about the movie though. 1.) The actors were
absolutely fantastic who ever cast this movie was probably the only one
who read the books. That's what is super sad about this movie is the
casting was great, but the story was absolute garbage. It looked like
the actors read the books, and the director read the cliff notes. 2.)
The visuals were gorgeous, it's too bad that I was focused on the
failures of the writing.The craziest part about this series is if they had followed the books
at least with the main plot lines and twists, this movie would have
been bigger than 'The Hunger Games', but they decided to drop this
awful movie onto the readers and make them suffer.James Dashner, as far as I have read in your interviews you were okay
with this?? You owe your readers the BIGGEST apology ever! You sold
yourself out for the cash, and I was going to read your other series
but my friends and I will not touch anything you've written until we
receive an apology for getting us hooked on your novels, and then
approving this awful movie that had nothing to do with your books
besides the character names and the title. Your books had so much more
complexity to the story and the writer/director of the movie decided
not to use any of your actual plot line. Doesn't that make you angry
even a little bit?Wes Ball, T.s. Nowlin and James Dashner. Shame on all three of you. If
you've read the books please avoid this movie like the plague. If you
haven't read the books ( you shouldn't be reading my review lol) but if
you accidentally did please read the books, and skip this awful movie.
I could have covered at least 10 more disappointing points about this
film, but no one wants to read a 20 paragraph review, this review was
long enough. James Dashner, I await your apology for doing this to your
readers.
