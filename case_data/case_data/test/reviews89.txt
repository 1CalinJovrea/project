**** Most Pathetic Bond Movie Ever ****

Bond movies have lost the essence of it all since Daniel Craig stepped
in. I don't blame him for the poor script and direction though. It used
to be one helluva ride to watch a bond movie but now they have become
such a drag that i cant even believe that i'm watching a bond movie.
Wish they could get a veteran director to direct the new one at least
to retain the flavor of James bond. saddened that i've wasted 2 hours
on this pathetic piece of direction. It took off on a good note but
then the direction just kept me thinking when is gonna end for good
with the sad screenplay. Even the cast wasn't used to its full
potential. could have been a amazing cracker of a movie but turned out
to be a spectacular dud in the end.
