Actually a pretty entertaining movie

I actually thought this was a pretty good movie, despite the relatively
low ratings. Both McConaughey and Ram√≠rez played very well, also good
to see Stoll in this movie. The story was entertaining, never a dull
moment (unlike Moonlight, sorry, but that was really boring and I
believed the rave reviews...). Anyway, it was worth seeing it!
