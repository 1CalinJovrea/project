Behold, the world's largest conveyor belt

"People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put
his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the
assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we
plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds." - Jeffrey
Eugenides Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney
Company), "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is a gazillion dollar superhero
movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action
sequences in which powerful "good warriors" battle powerful "bad
warriors". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo
and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude,
Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate
candy factories.Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are
equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes
"talk", "reveal their personalities" and "share their feelings". These
scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama,
characters or continuity, but because "films are supposed to have these
scenes". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual
plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter.
Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the
illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a
factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.You can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around
our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who
ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst
actually totally adhering to clichés. This villain (spoiler?) is
defeated. Along the way, the film "comically" delivers its obligatory
"one swear word", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing
executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check
with global ratings boards.Marvel Studios has a history of roping in "irreverent" and "edgy"
directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies
without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, "Age of Ultron"
was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany
dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and
Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed,
everyone in Whedon's "Ultron" now sports the same voice. Every
character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an
ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of
flippancy, non-sequiturs and "cool dialogue" reeks of desperation; cool
stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a
pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation.
"Ultron" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with
CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing
cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and
again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors'
cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots'
sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then
again and again.Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest
conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the
self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to
every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product
obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps
expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the
fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle
is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected -
ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to
another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And
now that Disney's acquired the "Star Wars" franchise, we can expect it
to similarly start squeezing new "Star Wars" movies out of its
mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, "Age of Ultron's" chief
villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have
another "anti violence", "anti military" Marvel film which gets its
kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities.
Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing
to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property
damage loving green dude with magical pants.3/10  What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no
viewings.
