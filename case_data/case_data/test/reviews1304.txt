Too much fun and human darkness for one day.

Watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.It's a compilations of 6 tales, but they don't have the same type of
lenght, humor or darkness. Each one is unique.1) Airplane tale: fantastic, hilarating and surrealistic story to open
the series.2) Coffee shop tale: shorter, but dark and makes you wonder what's
"freedom" for some people.3) Road tale: excellent. A really LOT of violence and a little bit of
humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.4) Human limit tale: a man that's having a couple of really bad days
explode when he runs out of patiente. Great acting.5) Accident tale: 90% darkness. And the fact that could be a very
possible story makes it even darker. Shocking finale.6) Wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify. Hilarious for the most
part, but at the end, it will make you wonder to whom you are spending
your whole life with.Seeing this compilation in a theater for the price of one, its a damn
good deal if you ask me.Go watch it.
