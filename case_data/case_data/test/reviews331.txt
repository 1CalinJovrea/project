I'm never going to look at high school rom-coms the same way again.

I don't think I've ever felt so many different feelings in a single 90
minute period before.Before I watched this movie, I was so sure that I knew exactly how this
film was going to pan out; I'd written it off as 'just another rom-com'
before I'd even finished reading the title.I should never have pressed play. Honest to god. If I'd known that my
'favourite film' - a spot never before occupied for me - was about to
become The First Time then I would have turned and ran a mile in the
opposite direction. I mean, a high school love story? Pfft. But, the
thing is, this movie gets it. That's never happened for me before. I
mean, I'm a cynic, I'm a narcissist, and never in all my life have I
swooned over actors and on-screen romances, because they've never
really felt real. This film did. How is it feasibly possible for a
movie to capture the most charming, frank and unavoidably awkward
moments that life is really all about, and strip back a love story
until it hardly seems pretend anymore? Honestly, the acting, the
script, the chemistry, the soundtrack; this is what films should be
about.I just think that, speaking as a teenager who hasn't had a whole lot of
first times to speak of, it just makes me see things from a whole
different perspective. The first time - for anything - doesn't have to
be perfect, but I feel as if every other film I've ever seen has geared
it up to be that way. But here, every possible awkward thing that could
happen... happens. And the acting is so brilliant that it feels like
this film wasn't really written at all; it just feels so real. And even
though the end result - let's face it - was always going to be the
same, the journey that these two characters make to get there, with all
it's unexpected twists and turns, is what makes this film what it is.It's been a long time since I've seen a movie like this. And honestly?
I'd rather I didn't see another one like it; I don't think a movie like
The First Time can be done more than once.
