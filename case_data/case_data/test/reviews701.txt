Not as good as the "Bourne" trilogy but a good action movie!

The Bourne franchise started with "The Bourne Identity" back in 2002,
continued with "The Bourne Supremacy" in 2004 followed by "The Bourne
Ultimatum" in 2007. I do not consider "The Bourne Legacy"(2012) part of
this franchise because Matt Damon didn't take part in it and because it
has much lower quality in script and filming. "The Bourne Identity"was
one of the best action movies I had seen at the time and it really made
an impression on me. The sequels were almost as good as the original,
although they didn't have the same vibe. I will not go into details
about this year's film since I don't want to spoil your fun. If you
enjoyed the previous "Bourne" movies you will find "Jason Bourne" at
least entertaining.About the 2016 movie "Jason Bourne", it is an American movie directed
by Paul Greengrass(director of "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne
Ultimatum")based on a script by Greengrass and Cristopher Rouse, it had
a budget of $120.000.000 which definitely paid off in the movie
quality. The movie has a solid cast(Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia
Vikander), good plot, not so good script, no clich√© lines, great
action/visual effects, it has common sense and it does not defy logic
like most action movies do. "Jason Bourne" definitely lives up to the
expectations. In this movie we have Jason Bourne knowing who he
actually is, cured of amnesia, and battling an even larger enemy than
before. There are car chases, well choreographed fight
scenes,shootouts,explosions and everything else you would want from an
action movie. Even though we are used to seeing Jason Bourne being
chased by a government agency we still love it. Unfortunately, this
movie has a weak script and plot holes, it is far from the quality of
the "Bourne" trilogy. "Jason Bourne" still is one of the best movies
released this year and I would confidently give it a 8.0/10. I have watched over 1200 movies and this one is for sure a good one. I
advise you to go watch "Jason Bourne", you sure will enjoy it! This review may be altered by the fact that I am a "Bourne" fan.
