I am compelled to write a minimum of 10 lines so you avoid this movie.

I have written very few reviews on IMDb, I simply do not have the time,
but on this occasion things are different. This movie could have been
so good, yet it is truly awful. I am a total advocate of having fun at movies and suspending belief but
in this movie, even attempting to do that is interrupted by shocking
characters with shocking lines. If people reacted in real life like
many of these do in the movie, you could be forgiven for shooting them
on sight.The main character played by Taylor Kitsch is so annoying, so arrogant,
so stupid so utterly imbecilic that for him to be allowed in uniform
would be a slur on a nations entire armed forces. He seems to have
adopted a role trying to emulate bad boy comes good Chris Pine as Kirk
in the 2009 excellent movie Star Trek. But it doesn't work and he
displays himself as a complete and utter loser in every respect, and
frankly the screen writers should not work again. Every clich√© possible is thrown in, trying to make what is termed 'an
extinction event' funny. As aliens battle to use an earth array radar
to communicate with their planet and bring on the destruction of the
planet, the geek in charge of the array who knows everything about it
says 'what! are they trying to phone home like ET'??? Shoot that man!I am saddened that Liam Neeson's bank balance is so low that he needed
to take on his role in this movie. If he was that short of cash, had he
just put an ad on IMDb I am sure we would have all chipped in $5 each
to keep him out of this disaster. The boys and girls in the CG room did an awesome job, but it was so
unoriginal with all the trappings of Transformers that whilst
technically superb it was just all pointless. Just where have they
spent $200 000 000 ? It must all be in CG or was it the fee for
Rihanna? Whatever, the budget for this movie would have been better
spent on saving some third world country from economic disaster.At the end it becomes clear that whoever the military adviser was,
whatever their sins during the main part of the movie, should
definitely have been sacked and not paid. Our main character the man
who has led a team of misfits to save the entire planet is awarded
...the 'Silver Star', the third highest award the military can give.
Where was the medal of honour? the top banana, they must have been
limited as only one was given to our main mans dead brother, who did
nothing other than stand on the bridge of a ship and get blown up
(apart from also putting up with his cretin brother for which he
definitely deserved the award).In summary, totally disappointing. To base a movie on the Hasbro game
of Battleships was always going to be a challenge, are we now going to
face movies based on snakes and ladders and 'frustration'? Too many
agendas were hidden in this movie to ensure a politically correct
Hollywood ra ra ra conclusion. There were many points in the movie
where I totally wanted the Aliens to succeed and destroy the planet, as
it's occupants were proving that there was no intelligent life here. If
you are dragged along to this movie then maybe just put your iphone on
silent and play angry birds or some other garbage game to keep yourself
entertained, or better still play Battleships.
