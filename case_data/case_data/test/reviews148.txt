A Caricature of a Movie

Let me start by saying that I didn't like the first "Now You See Me",
but I would rate it a 6/10 just for the fact it was SOMEWHAT enjoyable.
The sequel is a movie that probably nobody asked for, but yet they did
it anyway. 2 hours of poorly directed and written nonsense.SOME vague spoilers ahead, though you won't care about them at all.THE PLOT The plot tries to twist and turn a couple of times, but it is
just a straight line. To try and spice it up they tried the twist with
Morgan Freeman's character, but nobody believed it, not even Mr.
Freeman.THE MAGIC A movie about magic should not be a movie about CGI, which
the first movie was and now the second. The Illusionist and The
Prestige were doing their magic tricks for the audience IN the movie,
for the crowd in that universe. This one does the tricks just for the
people watching the movie. Need to make someone disappear? Of course
there will be a cut. Need to make someone escape? They simply transform
into water. How? Who cares, a magician never reveals his tricks (hint:
CGI). THE LOGISTICS A bunch of random magicians can take over the whole of
London on New Year's Eve in half a day without preparation. They can
also somehow broadcast their tricks LIVE all over the world, on all TVs
in all city centers, etc.THE PANDERING TO THE Chinese MARKET Yes I know that "entertaining"
movies nowadays always have something for the Chinese market: a
character, a vase, a flashback scene, etc. But this one went all in:
mystical characters that know and see everything, they help the
protagonists without a second thought, etc. Oh and did I mention they
are literally going to China for some reason, just to show what a great
place it is?THE HEIST SCENE (FLYING CARD) God please make it stop. A 10-minutes
scene with a quintillion number of ways it can go wrong - everything
works out. How to prevent a heist like that? A single security camera
in the room and an underpaid guard watching it. Done.THE FEMALE CHARACTER Jesus Christ, don't get me started on Lizzy
Caplan's character. With a couple of attempts at witty lines about
misogyny and discrimination, her character was a caricature of a female
character.JESSE EISENBERG No.
