Long and boring

"Long and boring" are the first words that come to mind when exiting
from this film, which seems strange because a gangster film which is
boring is almost a contrast in words. Off-hand I can't think of another
gangster film that had less action, suspense, or drama. Apart from the
length and direction, the musical score is almost non-existent, which
in a film of this nature trying to recapture bygone days, is a cardinal
sin.Perhaps the worst feature of the film, though, is the acting, from
Johnny Depp's poor imitation of Jack Nicholson to the Irish accents
that come and go throughout the film. It's not all bad acting. For me,
David Harbour ("End of Watch"), Dakota Johnson ("The Social Network")
and Juno Temple ("Magic, Magic") stood out.This is a film you can surely miss.
