Amazingly Awesome!!! New Genre!

This movie is INSANELY awesome!!!If I could rate it a 20, I would, just from the shear story telling,
character investment and novel first-person POV, not to mention all the
video game tropes, puns, and long shots!!At least 90% of the movie are long shots, that's how well it was
directed!It contains a LOT of elements from Counter Strike, Modern Warfare,
Half- Life 2, Portal and Mirrors Edge, so if you like those games, you
should absolutely love this movie!It has a LOT of gore in it, so I wouldn't recommend it to the
squeamish, but if you're a high-octane true-blooded alpha male like
myself, you should absolutely love it!
