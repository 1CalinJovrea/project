Separate journeys VS just playing stupid jokes on each other

As fan of the original movies it's sad to see the extreme change of
direction here. The humor in the original movies were heartfelt and
funny, the effects were charming, and I think it even works today, in
its way. The effects in this one is more expensive, has more details,
but is much more comical, in a bad way. The comedy is about yelling,
exaggerated hip hop slang, and fast-paced, waaaay too easy jokes. In the original movies, Ivan Reitman was the real nerd-scientist who
outsmarted anyone in any room; Dan Aykroyd was the doomsday historian
who really had some fun lines in his movie-fact-based monologues about
evil; Bill Murray was a jerk, but he had a journey about improving
himself, that made him likable; And Ernie Hudson started out as this "I
don't care about anything as long as I get paid"-guy. This diverse
group found something together that created a friendship based on
real-felt trust, and they became a good team to hunt ghosts and save
people. There was a real journey there. I don't feel the journey on
this new one, I really don't.Because... I want the old comedy, not this lightheaded piece of
"refurbished material" (to use a non-angry term). The original movies
were about Individuals having believable comedic and heartfelt separate
journeys, while I feel this movie is all about characters playing
stupid, fast-paced jokes on each other. All the time.. When there are
some hints of emotions in this movie I don't believe in it..So much that I give it a 1. Normally the 1 is reserved, by me, for
zero-budget independent movies with actors with incoherent dialogue
delivering, and a photo that lacks the technical craft-ship to give us
a believable understanding of the surroundings. This one is made by
real Hollywood people, but you know what they say:You can't polish a "refurbished material"!Mic drop
