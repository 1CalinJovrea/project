Absolutely original, and very powerful

We watch at least 4 or 5 movies every week, and I have to say that this
is the best film I've seen in a long time. Brit Marling seems to choose
her films very carefully, and I'm coming to suspect that anything she's
involved in is going to be different, and very well done.This film is inspiring - not just because of it's content, but because
of the way it's made. Hollywood can NOT make films like this. They can
do a lot of things, but they can't seem to write scenes, scenarios, and
certainly not dialog like this. This feels like real life, and because
of this, it really effects you and draws you in. You really get to
know, understand and care about the characters, in a way that just
doesn't seem to happen in 'Hollyweird' films.I don't want to go into any detail about the film here. I just want to
say that it is truly amazing, unpredictable, beautiful, powerful and
worth your time.IMPORTANT: Be sure not to turn it off as the credits roll - there's a
great little additional scene at the very end, which ads another
dimension to the way the story wraps up.Truly excellence in film making. If there were more writer/directors
like this, the world would be a better place. He makes us think and
challenges us. Truly inspirational.My highest recommendation.Will Middle of NowHere, in some snowy, remote Canadian mountains
