Spring can be whatever you want it to be

I'll bet they have fun with this one in film studies. Spring can be
used as a personality test based on how a viewer perceives it. Do they
see it as a romantic drama comedy about star crossed lovers? Do they
see a satire poking fun at the gamut of movies about an immortal
falling in love with a mortal that they've only known for 5 days and be
willing to give up their immortality for love? Do they see an art house
style movie full of symbolism and bravo for abstract expression? Do
they think it's just stupid and makes no sense? Do they just see a
zombie shooting drugs in a church? Spring is a little bit of all of that. I was kept guessing only when it
related to what the heck Louise was. The rest follows the generic
formula for a romantic comedy that didn't really leave me satisfied
when it was over. I am not really ashamed to admit that I was hoping
she'd eat Evan at the end.
