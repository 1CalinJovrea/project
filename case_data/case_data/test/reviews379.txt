The only good thing about this movie is Benicio's acting...

It's hard to find a decent movie lately. Was another disappointment for
me, no surprise there.Don't be fooled by the cast. Sex, violent, a
little action is enough(!) for some apparently (judging by the high
votes). Not for me though...The outcome of the movie in summary; -You can have a good life with
drug business (with that great education background), get away with it
and have a happy ending! -Sharing is caring even If its your -so much
in love- girlfriend! -You can have two guys and a sweet life, if you
are a sexy pretty dumb blonde with issues; you don't even have to work!
-Running a cartel is easier than dealing with your daughter!You may also categorize this movie in 'fiction' genre, with that very
happy threesome. Seriously? A girl and 2 guys. Does it exist?? My vote
is Benicio only (ok, a little for Travolta and Hayek). Have to admit I
also enjoyed gorgeous Kitsch's topless scenes.
