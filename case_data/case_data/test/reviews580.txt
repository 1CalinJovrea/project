What the hell was that

I must admit when I first heard of the Hunger Games movies I had no
idea what all the fuss was about. I'd never heard of the books, so
wasn't that excited about the movies. Watched the first one and thought, "yeah, that wasn't too bad". Fast forward to Mockingjay Part 1, and I had already heard it was a bit
of a "filler" movie, and not a lot happens. "Fine", I thought. So I
suffered it, thinking part 2 will kick ass. Oh, how wrong was I, and so was my wife who, after watching the first
film, read all the books. She warned me that Mockingjay part 2 would be
pretty emotional, and it just wasn't.I don't know if it was my imagination but, as with other film series
like Harry Potter, it was if the actors were bored of the franchise,
and just not putting their all into it. I ended up not really caring
what happened to any of the characters. The action was flat and a
little dull. And as with part 1, the pace of the movie was deadly slow.
So disappointing. As my daughter said after the movie had finished, it seemed like the
slow sections of the movie needed to be sped up, and the fast sections
slowed down. As an example, where Katniss's sister, Primrose gets
killed, it was like, she's there, dead, move on. There was no big deal
made about it, which I understand was quite a big deal in the book. I
might be wrong.I'm always sorry to bad mouth any movie, because I know how much effort
goes into making them. My philosophy has always been, if a movie
entertains on any level at all, even it it's unintentional, it is a
good movie. IE. I'm not a film critic, I'm a film fan.But I'm sorry to say, remembering all opinions are objective, but I
found this to be a slow, tedious and wasted opportunity. I'm sad it was
one of Philip Seymour Hoffman's last films. It would have nice to have
ended on a high, no irony intended.
