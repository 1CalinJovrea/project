This Was Just Not Good

I'm a huge fan of the Coen Brothers. To me, cinema doesn't get much
better than No Country for Old Men or Burn After Reading or Raising
Arizona...you get the idea. So when I heard that George Clooney was
directing their next original script, naturally I couldn't wait to see
it. Fast track a year and a half later and here we are. Clooney proved
to me that it takes much more than a Coen Bros script to make it a Coen
Bros film. Suburbicon is one of the few films that will come about
where the talent attached to the project is so overwhelming and
plentiful but the final product is so mediocre and bordering on bad
that it leaves you scratching your head. The film is very beautiful to start off. The cinematography is very
crisp and extremely colorful which makes the setting of the 50s suburbs
seemingly pop even more so. The production design and basically
anything of a technical aspect is amazingly done here by traditional
standards. So why is Suburbicon falling flat? Very simple: Clooney is
woefully unqualified to direct a Coen Bros script as are most people.
This feels like it was made by someone who watched Fargo and Burn After
Reading a dozen times and decided to make this. It feels like it is an
imitation and, by the end of the film, that is all it turns out to be.
The cast is even really dull despite a fantastic performance from
Julianne Moore. Damon can't decide whether to play it funny or serious
and that really plays a big part in the violence of the film. It is
comically set up but brutally executed. It doesn't feel right at all
and it makes for a very tough watch.Overall, Suburbicon is a film that will probably leave your mind as
quickly as it came. It is a very forgettable film. It is a frustrating
piece of cinema as well because we will always be left with the
thoughts of what could have been. With the level of talent and star
power, Suburbicon has no business being as dull and ragged as it is
especially because in a technical sense, the film is great. But with
Clooney's misguided direction and Matt Damon's very erratic
performance, Suburbicon is a miss of the most disappointing fashion.
