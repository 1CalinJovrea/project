Excellent!

This movie was amazing!I am a fan of the Turtles - maybe not a die-hard fan like some people,
but I do love them dearly - and this movie made me laugh and kept me at
the edge of my seat! Initially, I heard the rumors about them being aliens, and since
nothing I had read since discarded that idea, I had been wary of
watching this movie. Another thing that made me wary was the first
image of their faces. It definitely caught me off guard and almost
scared me a little. Though, I think that was because I wasn't prepared
for it. But now that I have seen the movie, I understand completely and
it makes a lot of sense.Everyone fit so perfectly, and I loved the casting and storyline. I
can't wait for a sequel!
