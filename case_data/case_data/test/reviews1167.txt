The Man from UNCLE is a spy comedy that Hammers out a Cavill-cade of Hugh-gely satisfying laughs

When I first saw the previews for Guy Ritche's latest film, "The Man
from UNCLE"  a remake of the series of the same name  I decided to
approach it fresh. So I avoided watching any of the adventures of
Robert Vaughn's Napoleon Solo and David McCallum's Ilya Kuryakin.I mean, to do otherwise just would not be fair, since my exposure to
the original is limited to pop culture references. Why catch up to a
show from decades ago only to rip apart the new one? Why give myself
false nostalgia? That said, I cannot tell you whether this is a faithful recreation of
the original, a tasteful homage, or perhaps a complete bastardization.However, I can say that, as a Guy Ritchie action-comedy, it works. The
jabs at fictional representations of espionage are delivered with near
perfect timing. Even the languishing takes meant to ridicule the
tropes, stereotypes and clichés we have all come to see in every action
spy thriller do not feel drawn out. All of Ritchie's trademarks are
also there, from the diagetic sound that shifts to almost non-diagetic
levels as the on screen action becomes a musical montage  a music
video if you will  right down to the ubiquitous tongue in cheek,
deadpan humour.While I am sure the more eagle-eyed of viewers could play a game of
"spot the anachronism" (that tube frame 4x4 in the previews, for
instance), I would actually fault this movie as being too period. They
seem to have cherry picked all the things people imagine as from the
era. The result is that the clothes are just too chic, the set pieces
too on the nose.Then again, I guess that is the point: You are meant to fall in love
with the aesthetics of that period as interpreted by Oliver Scholl's
production design, and as captured by John Mathieson's cinematography.
The fashion, the accessories... even the cars. Especially the cars! How
could any depiction of the glamour of the sixties be complete without
one Jaguar E Type? Also, watch out for the cameo of a $38 million
Ferrari. Even with the attention to detail "Mad Men" put into shattering any
preconceived notions of the so-called swinging sixties, as well as
CNN's "The Sixties" television documentary series' unflinching look at
the social turmoil of those times, somehow I still wish I could have
lived back then.Or at least escape into the movie universe they have created.Because in our world where terrorist groups are committing heinous acts
of barbarity that would put any of UNCLE's supervillain enemies to
shame, where spy thrillers like "Homeland" had to up the ante because
reality is scarier than the fictional world they have created, where
the James Bond 007 franchise lost its playfulness long ago and just
keeps getting grittier and grittier, and where Donald Trump is the most
popular US republican presidential aspirant, the Cold War and its
Mutually Assured Destruction definitely seem worth pining for. I mean
what is the mere threat of a few megatons of thermonuclear annihilation
compared to the Donald? The movie is cast satisfyingly well enough, with Armie Hammer's Ilya
Kuryakin projecting a cold lethality that may have been a bit much.
Luckily, this is a bickering buddy movie, where Henry Cavill's Napoleon
Solo balances things out with borderline insufferable calm smoothness.
For something with a bunch of Brits speaking in American accents, I am
a bit surprised they toned down Gaby Teller's accent whenever the
character speaks English  I'm sure the Swedish Alicia Vikander could
lay an affectation of an East Berliner real thick.In all, "The Man from UNCLE" is an enjoyable comedy and an escapist
fare which just happens to be seemingly set in our past. I even rank it
as a solid tale of espionage, with the end reminding me of Roger Moore
as Bond, yelling to General Gogol, "That's détente comrade. I don't
have it. You don't have it."
