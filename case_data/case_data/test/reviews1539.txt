Disappointment all around

I was really looking forward to this movie even knowing that Abrams
will be directing it. And now I wish I didn't watch. It was just bad.
No other words for it.Everyone already said about plot being just a random rehash of previous
episodes. We've already seen all situations, all locations, all plot
turns. There's nothing original in this movie and it seems pointless in
general. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSome basics of the SW Universe are changed to accommodate the
characters. Now a guy who is not a Force-user can fight with a trained
Sith using a lightsaber. Untrained Force-user can use jedi mindtricks
with no training at all. Sith can feel a non-Force-user from across
considerable distance but not if the same man is standing 10 meters
apart from him. Stormtroopers see Sith have a fit if pointless
hysterics and calmly walk away from him despite his summons. Light Side
is a constant seduction to Siths. And so on and so on... It all feels
like a badly written fanfic.END SPOILERSAnd it is also filmed badly. In all Star Wars movies first appearance
of ship or a planet always was a momentous scene. This is totally lost
here. Also there are many unflattering camera angles, poorly
choreographed scenes, battle sequences are rushed and not always
thought-out. With modern technology and special effects it could have
been magnificent, but instead it's cheaply looking. I've caught myself
thinking that "A New Hope" looked better and more advanced than this
one.Maybe if you've never watched Star Wars you will like this movie, but
for those familiar with old episodes it most probably will be a major
let down.1 out of 10 just because it' impossible to give 0.
