A Ripping Good Yarn

Jeff Nichols' new film "Mud" is essentially a coming-of-age tale, but
it borrows liberally elements of neo-noir, Southern Gothic and
melodrama while being filmed as if it was based on some great novel
that was never written. It makes for a ripping good yarn that should
please a wide audience thirsty for drama with a bit of heart and some
sentimentality (without ever being sappy).The cast works extremely well together under Nichols' direction with
McConaughey delivering an Oscar worthy performance as a troubled man
hiding out on an island in the Mississippi River who is discovered by
two young teenage boys (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland in two winning
performances).You won't want much more spoiled before seeing it. Highly recommended.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com
