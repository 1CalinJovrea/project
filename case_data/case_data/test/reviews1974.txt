One of the Best Teen Love Films of Recent Times

I go back quite aways to A Summer Place and Parish,yet even as a senior
citizen I found The First Time to be a refreshingly honest and well
acted film highlighted by the performance of Britt Robertson, a young
actress who unfortunately is in the shade of Jennifer Lawrence and
Ellen Page...yet I hope she can find he way into the sun because she
has a lot to offer.The film, although light hearted, doesn't deal in mind numbing clich√©s.
It is about the real emotions of modern high school kids, who you
realize aren't that much different from the kids of my generation.It's nice to see a film where kids actually fall deeply for each other
rather than just fleeting sexual attraction.
