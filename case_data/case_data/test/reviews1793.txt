Jason Bourne's ancestor in China

Don't understand low rankings here. Eve at the beginning of the movie,
they say its a legend, so they do not pretend it is something more than
a action fantasy. Its pretty nice movie to watch, action sequences are
awesome. Story is not plastic, there is no clich√© like man and woman
"hate" each other and then love each other and similar nonsense.
Digital aspects, CGI can be smelled miles away but don't have any
problem with it. I do not think there are any boring, empty spaces in
the story, or phases you wanna skip during second or third watching.
Characters are very good, you can find your favorite player in the
field as well as you can be blown away by the sceneries, large scales
of shots, beast itself and the organization within the wall. The Great
Film.
