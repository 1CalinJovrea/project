Full Bore Zombie Frenzy

I know. I know. If you are anything like me, you are sick to death of
zombie movies. Many will rise to defend the sub-genre of horror. After
all, there are only so many tropes and monsters that you can explore.
In the same breath, one could say you are tired of vampire movies or
ghost movies, but the fact is that I would say I am tired of all three.
Maybe "tired" isn't the right word. I am skeptical. I have seen the
originals that created the structures, the next wave of zombie films
that re-defined what you could do with it, then every twist on the
genre directors could come up with, from comedies like SHAUN OF THE
DEAD to dramatic presentations like MAGGIE. Mostly, I am tired of every
indie film maker with no better idea then to do a zombie flick devoid
of imagination. So, it really takes a lot to impress me at this point,
which makes it all the more surprising that TRAIN TO BUSAN is able to
do just that.There are two major things that make this movie work incredibly well,
the action and the characters. The action elements of this movie is
what will get it attention from the largest segment of audience. The
fact that this is the first live-action film for the director is even
more impressive. He cut his teeth in animation and it definitely shows.
The movie has a kinetic sense of action and pacing that is straight out
of an action cartoon. The movie feels almost like a comic book or
cartoon come to life, in many ways. I could make many bad train puns
here, but the movie feel like a ride on a steam train. It starts off
slow and plodding, setting up the story, the characters and the angles
and the movie slowly picks up more and more speed, until arriving at a
fever pitch towards the end. That action is gripping and once it hooks
you in, it doesn't let go. You will be on the edge of your seat as the
movie takes you for a ride.I said, earlier, that the action would hook the largest audience.
Plenty of people just want an action-packed film and there is nothing
wrong with that, but I know my friends in the horror intelligentsia
will want a little something more on their plates, and this movie does
not fail to deliver in character. The plot is pretty straight forward,
zombies on a train, but what makes the movie really special is the
characters. The plot revolves around a workaholic dad who agrees to
take his young daughter to see his ex- wife. We see that the two have a
very strained relationship, which naturally evolves through the course
of the film. Along the way, we pick up additional characters. There is
the drifter that portends the action and plays a pivotal part. The
tough bruiser and his pregnant wife, who are important pieces in the
relationships that will develop and prove to be much deeper than they
appear in the surface. There is an a*hole businessman, who will
sacrifice anyone to save himself. To a less defined degree, the
baseball player and the girl who wants to be his girlfriend, who aren't
as fleshed out as other characters, but provide a few interesting
scenes.Many zombie purists will not like the direction of the zombies
themselves. At the risk of incurring the endless, tired debate of which
are the best zombies, you could argue these aren't zombies, at all.
They are "infected". They are much closer to rabid, chaotic horde of
the DAWN remake, or more so, WORLD WAR Z, than the shambling undead of
the original DAWN OF THE DEAD, or even THE WALKING DEAD. That last
comparison is an interesting one. For all the people on social media
complaining that the popular show is too slow, too boring, too
talkative and there isn't enough focus on the zombies, this is almost
the antidote. Full of action and full of zombies.The movie has two big things going against it for a western audience,
it's sub-titled and it's another zombie film. For that reason alone,
many will avoid it. They would be doing themselves a big disservice as
this movie is one of the best of last year and a great modern zombie
flick.
