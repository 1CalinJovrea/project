Not as wonderful as the last one but definitely worth your time

I enjoyed Before Sunrise when I first saw it, and thought it was a
clever, charming movie with an innovative approach. In my opinion
though, Before Sunrise was vastly elevated by being paired with Before
Sunset 9 years later.Before Sunset is an exceptional movie, much more melancholic than its
predecessor, but understandably so because the characters had grown up
and had to let go of childish notions of fairytale happy ever afters.
What makes Before Sunset so wonderful though is the notion throughout
that even though things went wrong it's never too late to fix them. Before Midnight is a different film to the previous two. In my opinion
it is about two people who, having made the mistake of losing contact
the first time, will work to make sure it never happens again. They
were never going to have a fairytale life because they are both very
complicated, and I liked the realism of how their relationship
developed as they got older. I strongly disagree with other reviewers who say that Before Midnight
can be watched without seeing the previous two. I criticised people who
did that for Before Sunset and would caution against it even more for
this one. Before Midnight relies on the idea that the audience
understands how complicated the characters are and therefore continues
to like them even when they do things which could seem nasty and
shallow. In summary, while my favourite of the three movies remains Before
Sunset, Before Midnight adds richly to the overarching story that has
been told, in real time over 18 years, of two characters that fans of
the series have grown to love. As a three part series, the Before
movies are practically perfect.
