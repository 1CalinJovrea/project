Successfully captures the feel of a Stephen King

Stephen King is at times a brilliant writer, and most of his novels
give a home-bred 70's vibe. There's the presence of raw indecency and
rotten attachments right beside the gore, and this movie is very good
at portraying that.I started watching this movie expecting to get bored at some point,
because Gerald's Game is an odd pick of a novel to make into a film. A
lot of the story revolves around the heroine spending hours alone and
restricted. In a book, the writer has the freedom to play around with
memories and weave them into the present, but was the director going to
be able to do that?The answer is, yes, he is, and he does that very well. Kudos to a
thoroughly entertaining experience, whether it was the 80's gore
effects, the commendable acting of Mr. and Mrs. Gerald, or the shifts
from almost comedic to certainly nauseating scenes. The only thing that bothered me was that the cinematography was a bit
dated, and nothing creative. But it doesn't mean that this movie is not
worth the watch, and it will be even more enjoyable if you haven't read
the book!
