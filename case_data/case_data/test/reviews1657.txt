If the 17th Century could make a movie

If people from the 17th Century could make a film about their deepest
darkest horrors - it would look a lot like this movie! The Witch
engrosses you in the time and place of its setting, it's a family
drama, a horror and a folk tale. All interwoven together into a macabre
ode of the times when people were frightened of the primeval darkness
of the forests and the inexplicable twists of their wretched fates.
Intense and gripping from the very beginning. With some of the most
amazing acting I've seen by the youngest cast members. Fantastic movie
for horror fans and a masterful period piece. I would recommend it
highly to horror fans and fans of history and good cinema in general.
