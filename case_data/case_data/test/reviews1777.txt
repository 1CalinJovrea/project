A Million reasons to see this movie

I saw A Million Ways to Die in the West 2 nights ago and man was it
worth the $9.50 I paid, saying this movie has a lot of dirty jokes in
it is an understatement, but they are funny and put in ways that are
relatable and make sense. While I can't say this is the best movie I've
ever seen, it's worth checking out because lets face it, if Seth
Macfarlane is in a movie, It has to have good dirty jokes. The only
reason I don't give it a 10 is the 1 plot hole with Clint and
threatening to shoot Anna and her dog because Albert was caught kissing
her, because we see her being a master at shooting why doesn't she just
shoot and kill Clint in the first place rather than allowing him to
have the control that he did? Movie villain logic I guess.
