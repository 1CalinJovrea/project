For Paul

When Justin Lin announced he would be stepping down as the director for
Furious 7 following Universal's decision to fast track the sequel
before the release of Furious 6, a lot of fans like myself were
wondering who could possibly replace him!? The franchise wouldn't be
what we've come to know without Justin, he has been around since the
Tokyo Drift (which is way too under-rated) and saved the dying
franchise from being released direct to video. Fast & Furious is never just about street racing but family & heist.
Before you hate me, watch the first movie and Fast Five again then
compare it yourself. You see the evolution of the characters and from
robbing trucks with DVD players to heisting 100million. Now back to Furious 7.. When they announced James Wan will be taking
over the franchise, a lot of us were worried as he was most well-known
for his work in horror genre, particularly SAW & Insidious.
Nevertheless James has proved he is perfectly capable of big budget
action movies, just look at the air drop or the Abu Dhabi sequence!Spoilers ahead..The film started off with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) talking to the
coma-tonic Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), promising to avenge him. Just pause
and think how he could have survived the fall from the plane!? If
that's the case I think Gisele & Han can too.. I mean they did bring
Letty back right?With all the hyped built up from the post credit scene of Furious 6, I
was genuinely interested to see how Deckard Shaw hunt down the team and
continue where Tokyo Drift left off. Instead we were introduced another
villain, Mose Jakande, played by Djimon Hounsou (which is unnecessary
and dull), Shaw was pretty much cast aside as a secondary character. We
never get to see the team from the hunted to the hunter as Shaw kept
showing up from time to time. Other than the impressive action
sequence, it didn't really add much to the overall story. Sean Boswell
played by Lucas Black showed up for 1 minute or 2 talking to Dom and
you would at least think he might want to avenge Han right? But no we
don't see him for the rest of the film.. I guess we just have to wait
for the sequel. Shaw brothers might be teaming up, you never know!Furious 7 was originally intended to be the first of a new trilogy but
plans were scrapped due to Paul Walker's untimely death and instead the
filmmaker decided it was all about making this movie for Paul. A lot of
moviegoers like myself were very emotional by the credit rolled. It
felt like the end of the journey with these characters you come to love
and it was the perfect send off to Walker's character, more importantly
farewell to Paul himself. The crossroad scene is definitely the
highlight of the film and the reason I am giving this an 8 out of 10.Part of me wishes they end the franchise here but with the highly
impressive box office number, a sequel is nothing but guarantee. . I am
very curious to see where the franchise is heading without the essence
of Paul Walker. It just does not seem right without one of the core
family member.. What do you think?
