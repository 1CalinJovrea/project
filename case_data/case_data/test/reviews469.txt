Realistic racing sequences but lame story

F&F movies were running out of story with all the silly crime and
fighting and overblown special effect type car chases so this movie has
one thing going for it getting back to pure and simple car racing with
some good scenery along the way. The Northern California race is
spectacular and exciting enough and looks realistic - not obviously
stunt man driven or special effect enhanced. Read that the actors had
to learn how to drive racing style for their parts so kudos to them.
But that's about all that is good about this movie.The story is lame and badly written. The revenge thing is so contrived
and you really don't feel for any of the characters. The romance is
completely sizzle free. As far as the British cast is concerned Imogen
Poots is a little out of place and the evil character played by Dominic
Cooper seems a bit nasty for no good reason. Dakota Johnson has a
insipid supporting role - wonder how she will do in 50 Shades? Aaron
Paul is a terrific actor and is just priceless on "Breaking Bad" but he
isn't right for this role. He doesn't have the cool edge and the rakish
looks required for this character. And the intense stare he gives now
and then simply looks daft. Watch it if you like to see this kind of racing but be warned the story
is bad.
