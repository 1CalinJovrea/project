I'll save you the time of going to see this one in theaters.

Geostorm is essentially 2012 meets The Day After Tomorrow meets
Armageddon. I couldn't find much original content in the plot. The
special effects were well done, but to really enjoy the movie it
required suspending disbelief more than I felt I should have to. This
movie was ripe with overacting and poorly constructed dialog to explain
away plot holes. This broke my immersion in the movie multiple times.
