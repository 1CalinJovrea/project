Depp shines, The Lone Ranger entertains!

Quite frankly, I was highly skeptical on attending the screening of the
hugely anticipated Johnny Depp, Arnie Hammer starrer The Lone Ranger,
primarily because I am not such a huge fan of western movies plus a
runtime clocking almost 150 minutes seemed to long to handle.
Nevertheless, I decided to give it a try owing to the Depp factor and
the director, Gore Verbinsky who has a pretty neat track record as a
director.I haven't actually seen The Lone Ranger T.V series which aired
from 1949-1957, so I pretty much knew nothing about the characters as
such and went in with a clean slate, which in my opinion is a good
thing as it removed unwarranted comparisons and biasness.Settling down in my seat and 10 minutes into the movie, I was hooked
on. A spectacular opening scene, where the outlaws make away with their
chief held captive and being transported on a train. The scene
introduces us to the principal characters of the movie namely Tonto
(Johnny Depp), John Reid (Arnie Hammer) and Butch Cavendish (William
Fichtner). Verbinsky establishes his characters smoothly and seamlessly
throughout the narrative which is definitely one of the high points of
the movie. The entire story unfolds as Tonto, recounts the tales of his
journey and how John Reid becomes The Lone Ranger. The two form an
uncanny team to bring Cavendish to justice, each in his own manner.
John believes in non-violence and the court of law and Tonto is just
the opposite. The two share an electrifying chemistry and Depp gets his
comic timing spot on as the quirky Tonto. Tonto, belongs to a native
American warrior tribe, who feels responsible for the death of his
fellow men and his family owing to a trade he made with two white
Americans he saved from certain death when he was a child. John seeks
revenge from Cavendish as he is responsible for the death of his
ill-fated brother Dan Reid.(James Badge Dale).Inspite of its length, the movie never drags or feels lethargic at any
point of time, instead it provides a good dose of laughter at regular
intervals and Depp shines in those scenes. The scenes where the Native
American, trades a feather or grains for everything he steals from dead
people or the scene where the white stallion chooses John over his
brother, and Tonton repeatedly tries to force the stallion to switch
the selection, Depp is just fantastic.Depp rises above his co-stars with his impeccable comic timing and one
liners. The best facet to his character is the fact that he is so
unpredictable. You never know what is he going to do next. Arnie Hammer
pitches in an earnest performance and nicely complements Depp. Despite,
all its triumphs it does have a couple of blemishes. It's
understandable that the entire writing revolved around the two
principal characters, John and Tonto and I'm guessing due to the focus
on these two characters some other supporting characters got sidelined.
The sub plot involving Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) and her relationship with
John is half baked and is not well developed. Similarly, Helena Bonham
Carter as Red Harrington is unconvincing as the deadly leggie and
neither does her character get enough screen time leave a mark.Barring the two minor hiccups, The Lone Ranger overall is a fine movie
which is high on entertainment value. I would definitely recommend this
movie to everyone who seeks a good time at the movies. Fun guaranteed!
