Excellent re-imagining of a classic

I have to say I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews I've been
reading. I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least
twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back
in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun.
Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the
point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary
(which I do on many occasions).I think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie. I
have seen the original and I loved it. Especially when I first saw it
as a kid, it scared the crap out of me. But we have to remember that we
are in a new age with different technologies and expectations. I bet
that if the original was released for the first time right now, it
would have been shot down even more than this "remake." Although I love
the original, the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people
who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It
wasn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it
out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would
watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.People are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable?
Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A+ and the
score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it
again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.This movie is not meant to be a remake of the first, rather a
reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open
mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You
will hate it, because they are not the same movies. Both were
brilliant, but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this
version a lot more than the old one. Acting by Levy was perfect, gore
was fantastic, scares were good, and the movie had my attention all the
way through.
