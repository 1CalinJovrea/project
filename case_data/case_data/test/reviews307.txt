Intelligent blockbuster that strikes the right balance between brawn and brain

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA group of people are seemingly randomly targeted by a roof top sniper,
and it doesn't take long for the powers that be to point the finger at
former war veteran James Barr (Joseph Sikora) who asks for the help of
only one man: Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a man with much specialist
experience who officially doesn't exist. Initially, though, he seems
convinced of Barr's guilt, with only determined young attorney Helen
(Rosamund Pike) fighting his corner. But as she and Reacher dig deeper
in to the circumstances surrounding Barr's arrest, they uncover a
tangled web of conspiracy that puts them both in the firing line.I've never read any of Lee Child's 'Jack Reacher' novels, but it's
testament to what a dedicated fan base they must have that there was
much consternation at the lead role being given to mega star Tom
Cruise, who apparently was unsuited to it on account of his miniature
size, with the novel version being notedly taller. While it's
understandable the fans might be up in arms at something like this, it
might have been a shame if someone else had been given the role,
because this is one of those roles where Cruise steps out of that
'movie star' persona his name always seems to generate, and is
genuinely rugged and convincing in a strong, silent type role that
requires him to be one of those 'outsider' types who's more of a force
to be reckoned with than anyone could let on.While with Cruise involved it inevitably becomes about spectacle and
scope, Jack Reacher is still an intelligent and intricate adventure,
full of twists, turns and red herrings, that doesn't play out the way
you expect it to and is all the more of a thrilling experience because
of it. In the midst of it's intelligence, it also aims to be relevant
and topical, with references in the story to rooftop snipers and
unbalanced war veterans, which are probably very much hot potato
matters in American society today. While catching us out with this
unexpected depth and substance, director Christopher McQuarrie, who's
behind the camera for the first time again after twelve years since
2000's Way of the Gun, never lets up of the thrilling action, including
at least a couple of exciting car chases, the odd injection of exciting
hand to hand combat and a neat little shoot out battle at the end.While fans of the books may have quite a big thing to nit pick about,
the casual viewer will be in for an explosive, thrilling ride that also
has the good grace never to insult it's audience's intelligence. ****
