Refreshingly original, brilliantly acted, thoughtful western/crime film

In a summer (or should that be year or decade) of vapid sequels,
remakes, and overblown superhero catastrophes, who would have expected
an entertaining, intelligent, well-crafted, suspenseful, character-
driven, modern-day western with a brain. Riding on Taylor Sheridan's
razor-sharp script and David Mackenzie's nuanced direction, Jeff
Bridges, Chris Pine, and (especially) Ben Foster (along with everyone
else who appears on the screen) inhabit this film as wryly humorous,
heartfelt, vicious, painfully tragic, and realistic members of a
society reaping the fruits it has tragically sown. Best film so far
this year.
