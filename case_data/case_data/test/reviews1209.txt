Tedious and overblown.

Skyfall was superb so this had a lot to live up to and it doesn't.There are so many loopholes; Q was afraid of heights so how can he go
in ski lift, London is very busy day and night so how can a helicopter
crash into a bridge next to the houses of parliament when it is
deserted, how does a car drive up a snow covered steep mountain side
without skidding, why do the walls of railway carriages brake up like
pieces of flimsy cardboard during a fight ? Etc.Then there is the quite gratuitous violence ( i.e. gouging a man's eyes
out.) Plus the ridiculous shoot outs where Bond fells 50 other gunmen
who all seem to be very poor shots.Which brings me to the plot - what plot ? This was so convoluted that
it seems to have been made up as they went along. I had enough after
the first hour but wanted to see how it ended - poorly.This film compares very poorly to either Hit-man or Bourne; Sam Mendies
seems now to be the director to avoid.I am sure this film will make a fortune but as the saying goes "If
million people like a stupid thing - it is still a stupid thing."
