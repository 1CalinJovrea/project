Inside out worst pixar movie

talk about lack luster in this movie and lack of joy , i had to endure
watching this movie which had an awful plot , about some little girl
with emotional center something goes screwy and she gets depressed and
almost leaves home only to learn crying is good at the end . like how
does that appeal to everyone ? talk about boring .The animated design
for the characters was good but seriously pixar get your stuff together
you had so many classic movies that would make this look like a piece
of crap e.g wall-e , Up , incredible , monster inc, monsters university
, brave, toy story1-3, ratatouille etc . Please bring those kinds of
movies with great plot and fire the writers and director who wrote this
movie . they should never set foot in the pixar company EVER!!
