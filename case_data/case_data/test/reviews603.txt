A story of redemption without much redemption

A story of redemption heavy on pain and short on redemption. Reese
Witherspoon produces and stars in this story of a woman whose
breathtakingly self-destructive behavior--drugs, adultery, degrading
sexual encounters, abortion--has brought about a crisis that even she
can no longer ignore. Desperate to break the pattern of her life, she
decides to set out on a 1000 mile hike of the Pacific Crest trail,
despite having little or no experience with backpacking. From her vivid
memories of her past misbehavior, we see that she is slowly coming to
accept responsibility for her past mistakes, and thereby moving beyond
them. But the viewer gets very little payoff for this long slog through her
lurid past. While she manages to drag herself back to a state of
normalcy, she makes no great spiritual revelations during her journey.
Her hike ends underwhelmingly at the Bridge of the Gods on the
Oregon-Washington border. She and the movie seem to understand that
there should be some greater significance to that, but they don't know
what it might be. And contrary to other reviews, the scenery in the
movie isn't "gorgeous," but for the Pacific Crest trail is quite
ordinary. It's a great mystery that the movie makers didn't at least
take advantage of that aspect of the story to treat the viewers to some
of the scenery of the West.In the end, there isn't enough compensation for the graphic and
disturbing imagery that the movie makes its viewers endure, making this
movie a missed opportunity.
