A Modern Horror Classic

Inspired by 70's and 80's horror, it follows is a refreshing
psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept.
The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the
score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe
to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on
music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches
above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are
interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern
horror films seem to forget the importance of character development,
its nice to see the genre hasn't completely lost it yet. There are
several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with
unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and
sudden imagery.The only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style,
the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film
to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its
outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film
leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for
a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your
back. An exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend.
