A 'must see' for Jason Statham fans...

Well, SURE, there are places where you must suspend disbelief (it's not
THAT easy to steal a car, is it?), and SURE there are plot holes, and
SURE there are times when you say to yourself "How did he know to go
there?" BUT...this is one enjoyable movie!The acting, the action scenes, and the eye candy (Statham for you XXs,
and J-Lo for us XYs) are all great. Oh...and a word about J-Lo. While
I've never been a great fan, the poor reviews she received made me
curious. Well, she was excellent...and hot as a pistol. That woman has
more sex appeal than 5 centerfolds. Patti Lupone plays her mom...very
well, I might add.Statham plays Parker and Parker-like characters in an intrinsically
believable manner; that is, marginal characters who live on the edge of
the law or beyond it (think "The Transporter" series) with an honorable
streak. He slips into this part easily, and like his "Transporter"
character, Parker seems little interested in sex. No...he has a
singular purpose here as he has had in previous movies: get the job
done, and no time for recreation. And once again, his singularity of
purpose rings true.There is, of course, violence, but we all have seen worse; my wife only
had to look away twice, and she does not enjoy these types of movies,
but goes to humor me (I agreed to see that dreadful "Moonrise Kingdom"
after all). But she liked "Parker"--her direct quote was "It kept my
interest"--and that was high praise for this kind of flick.And as Tosh might say: "And for that, we thank you."
