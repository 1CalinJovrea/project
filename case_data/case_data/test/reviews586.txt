'Alien: Paradise Lost'

It seems that in 'Alien: Covenant', Ridley Scott and his writers tried
to use the best loved elements from previous Alien installments to
appease those fans of the franchise who hated 'Prometheus' - but
perhaps also to camouflage their intention to make a far meaner and
less conventional blockbuster than what modern audiences (and studios)
are willing to accept in this age of superheroes. It was my impression
that what on the surface appears to be a very straight forward - and
some might even say derivative - retread of familiar story beats is
actually just a ploy to delve even deeper into the themes explored in
'Prometheus'. Because 'Alien: Covenant' not only continues to "dissect"
the creator/creation/creature dynamic: it brings the android David's
story-line to its perverse, if somewhat logical, conclusion.Now if you hated 'Prometheus', or just dismissed it as a dumb movie
where most characters are stupid and nothing is explained or makes
sense, you won't find much to like in the less conventional story
elements in 'Alien: Covenant', and you might as well stop reading this
review now (btw, if you still have questions about 'Prometheus', you'll
find a link to an article explaining everything by clicking on my
username). But if you DID like it - or at least found its maliciously
ironic religious subtext and musings on creation fascinating - you'll
probably find some aspects of 'Alien: Covenant' highly enjoyable. As
you might recall, the cycle of creation depicted in 'Prometheus' goes
as follows: the Gods (aka "the Engineers") create mankind - mankind
creates David - David in turn starts to experiment on his creators (the
humans) in order to create something new.The totally insane - and hilariously mean spirited -
continuation/escalation of that cycle in 'Alien: Covenant' (beware:
spoilers abound for the whole movie follow): David's ambition to make
the jump from creation to creator has grown exponentially; it now
entails nothing less than to exterminate the Gods, as well as
experimenting on them - which makes him kind of hard to top in the mad
scientist (or mad killer robot) department. By killing the Gods, he,
the unworthy machine and "2nd class" creation conquers
"Paradise/Heaven" and becomes the sole creator (humans are degraded to
the status of lab-rats), thereby closing the cycle started in
'Prometheus'.Admittedly, the film is uneven in terms of story and pacing - but I
admire its ambition. 'Alien: Covenant' is a fascinating hybrid which
somehow halfway through its running time turns from relatively straight
sci-fi and very familiar Alien terrain into a brooding, Gothic horror
film (at least for a while before it turns back into a more
conventional sci-fi/action film). In the Gothic part of the film, the
man-made monster/creature (David) has turned the table and assumed the
role of Dr. Frankenstein to make creatures of his own design. These
creatures - who appear to be the first actual Xenomorphs - reflect and
reveal who/what David really is and how deceiving his human looks are.
For although he inherited some very human traits from his creator
(emotions, curiosity, ego, the urge to create - among others) he is
still a machine adhering to a logic that is ultimately as alien (pun
intended) to a human being as the Xenomorph itself - and as lethal.
Which is why it makes complete sense that David is the "designer" of
this perfect, machine-like organism (Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who
created the original Alien, called it "biomechanoid" for a reason).In 'Alien: Covenant', David is the humans' - and humanity's - ultimate
adversary; in fact, for the purpose of the story told in the film, he
is the Devil (he even quotes Satan's famous lines from John Milton's
epic poem 'Paradise Lost'). Now if the Devil in this tale were to
create life in HIS own image (his REAL image - for David was only given
human features to make interaction with him more "comfortable" for the
humans), surely, he would create demons: and isn't the Xenomorph the
ultimate demon sprung straight from the darkest pits of Hell? That
'Alien: Covenant' is essentially a riff on Milton's 'Paradise Lost' was
the most surprising aspect of the film for me. David's story-line
follows Satan's (quite literal) ascent to Paradise, where he kills the
Gods and starts his own rule, thus turning it into Hell and ending the
age of man (and for those of you who think I'm reaching a little here:
the film's title was originally supposed to be 'Alien: Paradise Lost').
Now regardless whether you liked the film or not, you have to admit:
that's not exactly the texture of a generic, conventional blockbuster,
right?At the end of the film, David is aboard the spaceship Covenant - which
he has turned into a perverted version of Noah's Arch - and travels to
a new world where he plans to start his new version of Genesis. He
might even start a new religion: the Bible as written by a mad killer
robot with a god complex (just think about how crazy demented - and
completely wonderful - that sounds). Imagine the Lovecraftian nightmare
he will create and what creatures will populate "his" version of Earth.
I would love a sequel to 'Alien: Covenant' to take us there and finally
fully descend into madness. It would be the logical next step: after
the human protagonists visited an angry god in 'Prometheus' who wanted
to destroy humanity, and then discover that Paradise is empty and the
Gods are all dead in 'Alien: Covenant', they should next visit the
Devil in his newly created Hell. My suggestion for a title: 'Alien:
Genesis'.I still hope we get a longer - and more even - cut of 'Alien: Covenant'
on Blu-Ray, but as it is, I rate it a very solid 7.5 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/
