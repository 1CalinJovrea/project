Tour De Force!

The controversial film from Korean master Chan-wook Park evokes the
sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiche's "Blue is the Warmest Colour" and
Park's own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese
occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri)
who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim).
However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman
(Jung-woo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for
a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing
feelings for the heiress.The Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into
three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story
is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film
progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers
a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, it's a feast for the
eyes. The term "every frame a painting" gets overused, but it really
fits here. I'm not only talking about cinematography, which offered
plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and
set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical
score by Yeong-wook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and
the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes,
it never gets dull, it's very evenly paced throughout. I couldn't look
away for a second.One thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being
said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste,
they never feel out of place and they're not there just for the sake of
it. The relationship between the characters and the physical
presentation of it are integral to the film. It's a film about passion,
abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, it's an
atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists
at the same time. It's original and daring work of art that will stick
with viewers long after it's finished.Whenever Chan-wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared
to his masterpiece, "Oldboy". I don't think that "The Handmaiden"
surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved
himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. It's the
best film I've seen this year, one that I can't wait to revisit. It's
not to be missed.
