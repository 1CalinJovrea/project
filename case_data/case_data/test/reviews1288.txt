More than about a dog or its handler.

Some of you do not get it. Great acting and production hitting elements
that should have brought a tear or more to any vet been over there or
combat in Afghanistan or Lebanon.After 24 years from the Nam as enlisted through Gulf War I as a Mustang
Officer, and another 8.5 years as adviser in Arabia until 2006, the
movie hit home where few of you out there ever will go and some never
return.Arguing about PFC and/or the fact is is not blood-and-guts film are
pure armchair general comments. The screams and scenes of real combat
are not for any movie go'er who should this once great nation as the
price of personal freedom and the form of Government we once had that
the present anarchist mob seems to have forgotten.Until the move was over and the credits rolled, then I started to cry -
small price to pay for watching a film about those who serve in a
humane way which war is not. Those tears of mine are for those who no
longer can cry and criticize a movie that for once, does far more than
flipping Hollywood nonsensical gore across the screen for those safe
back home.We still are over there on 3 continents, so this film should have led
you all out there comfortably hacking at this film to ask why you are
not sharing the load with these brave men and women who are no
different than you save for one major element - character.
