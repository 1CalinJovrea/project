See it

One really has to wonder what the professional reviewers are really
thinking. We looked over the family movie list and barely decided to go
to this one based on lackluster reviews. Six out of six of us REALLY
liked it and found it deep and entertaining, and easy to watch. By all
means, if you are looking to enjoy a movie, go see this one.If you are looking for a connection to the original story, the
connection happens during the first 45 minutes and then seems to go in
its own direction. Big deal. The movie moves through characters
development, plot lines, and geographies smoothly, and does not reveal
its final hand until the end.
