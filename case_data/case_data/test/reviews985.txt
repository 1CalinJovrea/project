An interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire

The Founder is a biographical drama film starring Michael Keaton based
on the life of American businessman and founder of the McDonald's
Corporation Ray Kroc. Whether you love the McDonald's brand or hate it,
this film offers a compelling view into the way it has captivated us
all with its worldwide presence.In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) meets with brothers Dick
(Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald, the owners of
the hamburger restaurant known as "McDonald's". Fascinated by the
brothers' ability to have burgers and fries cooked in a matter of
seconds, Kroc suggests the idea of franchising the restaurant
nationwide, hoping to use this as a way to take control of the company
and earn money for himself.Featuring yet another terrific performance from the ever-versatile
Michael Keaton, his second best behind Birdman, The Founder is an
interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger
restaurant into a global fast food empire. It is fascinating seeing how
one simple idea - fast food - has changed the culinary world forever.
However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the misfortune the McDonald
brothers went through as a result of franchising their name and the
exploitation they received. I should also mention that the film
reminded me of the 2010 film The Social Network, with its similar plot
about one man exploiting a clever idea from two brothers for his own
financial gain.I rate it 8/10.
