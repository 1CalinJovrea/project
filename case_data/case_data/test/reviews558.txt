Best Cop Movie Ever...

This is hands down the best cop movie i have ever seen, nothing
depicted here is new, gangs, money, drugs, torture, cops, death,
etc...it is the way that its depicted that makes it stand out, the last
time that these issues were well shown was in SHIELD. Jake gives his
best performance yet, he really does stand out all the way till the end
him and his partner play amazing cops. You really feel the intensity
and reality of thee life of a cop shown through Jake's recordings, its
just amazing how it all feels so real...you will not regret watching
this film if you can handle it that is... This movie will keep you
glued to the seat till the very end. End of watch was a great watch.
