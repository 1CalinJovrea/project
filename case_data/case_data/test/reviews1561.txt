"David O. Russell does buoyancy better than anyone." - Joe Morgenstern,
Wall Street Journal, Dec 12, 2013.Buoyancy? Like a turd? This was simply a bad parody of the late 1970's
era wrapped around a non-compelling script. I am a very big fan of most
of the actors, but in this film not one of them connected with me or
were in any way appealing. I gave this so called film a rating of 2 out
of 10, because the only interesting part involved Deniro's appearance
and he wasn't even credited in the film. Wonder why? Perhaps Bobby knew
something I should have before overpaying for a ticket to see this
joke. I think the only only hustle here was performed on the audience
who should sue the so-called professional reviewers.
