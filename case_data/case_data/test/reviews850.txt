not horrible, not great.

saw 'the giver' last night at the fathom events screening. It was my
favorite book growing up when i read it in school and maybe the reason
I wasn't horribly disappointed was because it didn't even look great
from the previews. nonetheless, i watched the movie. having recently
read the book in preparation for the movie, the first thing that stood
out to me was how quickly they jumped into the memories. It takes about
ten chapters of the book to get there, and the movie gets there in less
than ten minutes. it cuts out all the build up of the book and
depending on how you like the speed of your films, this could be good
or bad. this could pinpoint to why the movie didn't completely work.
the script was rushed. it is definitely a case of 'when good actors
happen to bad scripts'. because of the nature of the script (or because
the nature of the movie, who knows?) the actors aren't given much to
work with. this may not be their fault as the whole point of the story
is a dystopian society where they don't allow you emotions, but to
watch actors have straight faces for 94 minutes isn't exactly a
pleasant experience. it leaves you feeling meh about the whole thing as
i did. shame.
