An OK movie that could've been shorter.

Here are the reasons why I think this movie is just a 5. 1. The film
should've been shorter. 50mins would've been enough. 2. Too many
unnecessary lines, it breaks the tension because it is funny/annoying.
Like Carla always stating the obvious, or Carla reading out loud or the
kidnapper telling where are his shotgun shells. 3. Where are the
highway police? Where are the police in general? Are they so inept as
to arrest the wrong person in the wrong van? (Ever heard of plate
numbers?) 4. Why leave your child if you are just going to take a call?
Take him with you. 5. If they were going to kill Carla anyway in the
van why not take the knife and stab her? They don't need her since they
are going to sell the kids anyway for 100K 6. A GT is a fast car. I'm
pretty sure they could have lost her when she took a wrong exit or when
they told her to take a different exit.With that said, the action/suspense scenes are great. You can feel the
tension, Karla's desperation to get her son back.
