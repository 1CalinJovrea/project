Stereotypes at its best (or worst)

I'm a big fan of thriller & horror movies where the threat are real
people rather than ghosts. Hostel, Saw, Wolf Creek are some of my
favourite sequels. The Purge, with its intriguing concept, was also one
of them... until I watched Election Year.Nothing wrong with the cast, movie style or effects. It's just that the
stereotypes have become so annoying in this third movie! It would be
okay if the director were able to make it more subtle, but since the
movie is dumb proof, the persistent displays of "LOOK HOW WHITE PEOPLE
ARE CORRUPT AND BAAAAD! LOOK HOW GOOOOOOD THESE POOR IMMIGRANTS AND
DARK-SKINEED PEOPLE AAAAARE! LOOK HOW EVERYONE WHO COMMITS MURDER IS
CRAZY - EXCEPT THE ONLY SANE, GOOD GUYS WHO KILL THEM." can get pretty
annoying.What was supposed to be a nice date with the person I dragged to the
theatre after months waiting for the premiere... became a stressful
session of torture to the audience's intelligence.
