Best Film of the Year so far.

This film connected with me on so many levels. It delivered in ways I
was not expecting. I was laughing, cheering, crying, and ultimately
walked out of that theater feeling more than satisfied. I want to go
see it again. Something that is great about this film is that there are
things you will pick up on more clearly through a second viewing, but
it is not required to fully enjoy the film. Like I said in my title, I
can say without a shadow of doubt that this film is better than any
other film released this year. However, I will follow that by saying I
have yet to see "Hell or High Water". So it's more like 99.9% sure. We
will see how it holds up against the remaining anticipated releases. I
do honestly believe it should be nominated come award season. This film
is phenomenal and if you do not see this film before you die, you are
doing yourself a disservice.
