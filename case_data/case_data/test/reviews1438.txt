Booze, dope, girls, jazz, speeding and shoplifting

Here's a confession: I've read the novel by Kerouac twice, but wasn't
rally impressed. I could appreciate the sense of freedom and endless
opportunities, and the effect this must have had on the generation of
the fifties and sixties, but I also found the story tedious after the
first few chapters. So I was curious about the movie: would Walter Salles be able to turn
this legendary but rather monotonous novel into a good film? The
answer, unfortunately is: no. In short, the films shows a bunch of
young people enjoying booze, dope, girls, jazz, speeding and
shoplifting. They go from one city to another, but it doesn't really
matter: wherever they are, they do the same things. After the first
hour, you start to hope for some story development, but there is none.
This is especially annoying because the movie goes on for more than two
hours. In the end, it's just a repetition of the same themes in
different settings. The film follows the book rather scrupulously, and I think this is a
wrong choice. The book needs more adaptation to make it suitable for
the big screen. More than anything else, it needs a plot. Of course, there are also positive things about the movie. It's a nice
period film about the forties. The acting is fine, with good
performances by Twilight-famed Kristen Stewart and especially Garrett
Hedlund, a lesser known actor who could be quite a revelation. This film will certainly not become as legendary in cinematography as
the book has become in literature. But then again, that's almost
impossible.
