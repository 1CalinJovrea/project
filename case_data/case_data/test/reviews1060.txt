Disgusting, lame, raw, pointless...

And this movie supposed to be a comedy? Who was the target group?
People with lower IQ level I guess. Nothing worked here. Script was
pointless, stupid with some odd jokes that make you only puke. Acting
was terrible. Of course what we expected after previous work "Bruno"
which was the most stupid and disgusting movie ever made. This one is
in some kind of way in same direction. I have no idea what was Ben
Kingsley doing in this rubbish. The role of the dictator by S.B.Cohen
is just unsatisfying and amateurish even for a comedy. Every next role
of him is getting worse. Maybe I won't watch his movies anymore. This
was too much for me. I don't want to waste more words to describe this
folly. Just avoid it.
