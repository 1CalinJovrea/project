a silly, romantic, fun, lovely slasher!

I'm not going to deny it, I adore slasher flicks. They almost never get
made anymore unless they're sequels or remakes, so when I saw this
pseudo-slasher, I was instantly excited, even though I thought the
trailer looked a little goofy. I had no idea the film was a horror
comedy, and great at giving us both. The one montage in particular is
absolutely hysterically funny. I thought the killer was a little
obvious, but it was a satisfying twist. tree was a great protagonist,
and I'm a fan of the lead actress, knowing her from La La Land and her
MTV show, Mary and Jane. A wonderfully fun slasher, with a cute romance
and a deliciously biting dialogue. I adored it.
