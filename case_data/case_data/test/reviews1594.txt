Its official. Movies are no longer about telling a story.

I am sure that the critics that write the reviews are paid shills
because anyone who considers that movie to be a masterpiece has either
never seen a war movie or is just taking money to lie to the public.Dunkirk was more spectacular than 7 or so boats, 3 planes and less than
300 men in a line on a beach. And whose idea was it to pay Tom Hardy a ridiculous sum of the budget
to once again hide his face and never actually do what he is paid to do
which last I checked was acting? It's obvious he was used in this movie
to give it some credibility just like they did with the Mad Max debacle
where he spent 3 quarters of the movie with a face covering on
preventing him from speaking. The noise was awful and apparently some of that noise was considered to
be music! Dull bass throbbing in every scene.Story? Lets not even go there. I can sum up the Story in one paragraph
although you cannot really consider it a spoiler because there's
nothing in this to spoil. "Trapped on a beach awaiting rescue but the ships keep getting
destroyed by dive bombers with only 3 planes to protect those ships.
Ends with Hardy finally revealing his face when he is captured after
landing his plane which has run out of fuel."That's it. Everything else in between is just noise. To the people who consider themselves to be critics I say this: If you
want the movie industry to become like the gaming industry where the
main goal is most profit in shortest time regardless of the content
then keep spouting the BS otherwise you need to start telling the truth
for once. Two hours of noise and it cost them $100 million to make? It's obvious
where that money went because these so called movie creators couldn't
even be bothered to use CGI to expand the number of men, ships and
planes to really set the scene. There was nothing in this movie and Tom Hardy was thick or corrupt
enough to be used as the marketing tool. Don't waste your money.
