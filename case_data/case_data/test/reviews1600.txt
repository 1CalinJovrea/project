A fascinating exploration of government control in the name of good

This had been out on Netflix for a while and I hadn't really been drawn
to watch it, but I am so glad I did.The film portrays a dystopian future where overpopulation has lead
those in power to create a one child rule, with chilling justifications
for abhorable acts in the name of protecting humanity.In a time when we already see more government interference and control
in our own daily lives, its not too far of a stretch to consider a time
when government might implement drastic measures to control population.This film is a horrifying example of the peoples need to never allow
this or anything like this, to ever happen.Well written and thought provoking, I would definitely recommend
watching this film.
