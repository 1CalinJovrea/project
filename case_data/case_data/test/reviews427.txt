Pleasingly Surprised....Thanks for the negative reviews

I was a bit skeptical after reading negative reviews of the film, but
my 4 year old still insisted we go. I am ever so glad we did. In fact,
we are scheduled to see the film a second time tonight with my niece.Here is my honest review.If you hated the original Annie or if you don't care for musicals, then
this may not the movie for you. As a person who was a huge fan of the
1982 version of Annie, I was so afraid that the film would overly mimic
the original. Instead, the film was not, as critics claimed, a "black
rendition"; It is a 2014 remake containing a multi-racial cast, with an
African American lead actress.The 11 year old Quvenzhane Wallis was just as spunky and memorable as
Aileen Quinn was when she played in the 1982 version. Cameron Diaz is
not Carol Burnett, so those who compare the two are not being fair to
Cameron. Instead, I was surprisingly impressed by Ms. Diaz. She
embodied the original role, while making it her own.Every actress/actor, song choice, story line, etc. gave fans of the
original a taste of the old, while presenting the timeless Rags to
Riches story of Annie to a new generation.I truly enjoyed this film. I am thankful for the negative reviews,
because my expectations going into the theater were so low. I wasn't
the only person who enjoyed the film. The sold out theater, burst into
clapping immediately after the show was over. I heard one woman say "It
was like seeing a movie and being at a play at the same time". She
could not have described the moment any better.Great Movie!
