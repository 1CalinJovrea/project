Don't go in for a casual watch

This was horrifying. Definitely not for everyone. Most horrifying thing
is that this really happened. I don't even know where to start.The movie is well made and told. It's really claustrophobic and it will
get under your skin. How horrible humans can be. There's no violence
here, but the verbal abuse and the way people are treated and at the
same time being watched by people who could have stopped it, is what
makes this story the more haunting.The actors do a good job here. Those guards, man. This movie is gonna
make you hate them and feel very sorry for the prisoners. It's all
acting, but you really get a grudge against those guards. So, the movie
did a good job on that. It gets you invested, but it at the end leaves
a bad taste in your mouth. Nothing feel good about it. One thing it
lacks is a main character. The first half is centered on Ezra Miller,
but he disappears halfway through. I think it lost something when he
was gone.It's a though one to watch and I don't think I need to watch it again.
No, once was good enough. Maybe it can do good and remind you of the
cruelty of us humans, and help stop these things from happening. But,
it's not an experience for everyone like I said and the cruelty is
almost overboard at times and a little over the top. I think it was
trying to chock people too much.Horrifying, but well made and acted. It dwells too long on some of the
most cruel moments and it's gonna make it hard to watch. So, don't go
in for a casual watch. You gotta be prepared to watch it
