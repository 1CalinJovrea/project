Legend of Tarzan -- Pulp Poetry With a Beating Heart

There's a moment in David Yates' excellent and emotionally resonant
Legend of Tarzan when George Washington Williams', played by Samuel L.
Jackson, goads civilized Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgard, just a
little too much. Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan erupts instantly and
spectacularly with a combination of physical force and gut-chilling
animal sounds and pins the American to a wall, then growls out the
words: "They have my wife, and their families." In this single small
moment, Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to
the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal
contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a
aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a
volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an
instant. Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates
effectively captures this duality  and in so doing delivers a film
that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to
the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted
before. The result is pure pulp poetry with a beating heart. Edgar Rice
Burroughs would approve of it, and 21st century audiences will, if they
can be lured into theaters to see it, be intrigued and satisfied by it.Legend of Tarzan begins eight years after Tarzan and Jane (a luminous
and effective Margot Robbie) have left Africa to undertake a gentrified
life in London, where Tarzan has claimed his birthright of John Clayton
III, Lord Greystoke. He is drawn back to Africa at the behest of George
Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a black American journalist
who is based on the historical figure who led the exposure of the
crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium. Williams recruits him to assist
in Williams' quest to investigate the suspected crimes of King Leopold.
Accompanied by Jane, the two men return to Africa where Leon Rom
(Christoph Waltz) has laid a trap for Tarzan that, if successful, will
result in Rom delivering Tarzan to Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who
seeks to deliver vengeance to Tarzan for killing Mbonga's son many
years earlier. Mayhem and adventure ensues.When Edgar Rice Burroughs was firing on all cylinders, his pulpy,
emotionally infused adventure novels were able to strike a mythic vein
that caused him to become the J.K. Rowlings of his day  the first
global superstar pop culture author, translated into 57 languages, his
books and characters embedded in cultures from Russia to Turkey and
Japan. At the time of his death in 1950 he was the best known author on
the planet with his works selling more than the combined sales of his
contemporaries Hemingway, Faulkner, and Joyce. Hollywood tried more
than fifty times and although the movies obviously met with success 
not one of them ever captured what the grand old pulp master had
created on the page. Yates is the first to do it; his Legend of Tarzan
stands head and shoulders above the Tarzan movies that came before
itand regardless of how it fares in the crowded summer theatrical
marketplace, it is assured of a place in cinema history as the Tarzan
movie that captured the heart and spirit of Burroughs' creation.It remains to be seen how 2016 audiences react. Has Tarzan's time on
the world stage passed, or is there indeed something mythic and
archetypal that can cause the character to come alive in the modern
imaginations? Yates and his team have given it an extraordinary "best
shot" and have created something of heart, beauty, and lasting value.
The editing of the film by Mark Day is taut and streamlined not a
moment is wasted and the story drives forward with energy and
commitment; Henry Braham's cinematography is cool and brooding in
London, and lush and earthy in Africa; the production design by Stuart
Craig is grand and evocative; and the music by Rupert Gregson Williams
is both emotional and pulse-quickening. Special mention goes to
screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer who updated the Burroughs
material, giving it unexpected historical gravitas, while excavating
from the pages of the early Tarzan books the core values that made them
unique. And the CGI wizardry is seamless, photo-realistic, and
effective on all levels.Give Legend of Tarzan a chance to work its magic on you. I don't think
you'll be disappointed.
