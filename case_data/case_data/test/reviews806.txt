Where's the fast forward button?

I went to see this movie last night with some girlfriends. We had some
cocktails beforehand and were primed to drool over the hunky men doing
their stripteases. How sadly disappointed we were. The lead actress had
one facial expression the entire time. The dialog was hardly developed
and gave me the feeling of bored students reading a book aloud with no
emotion. I eagerly waited for the next strip scene and while the
choreography was good, it really wasn't enough to make up for the rest
of the movie. There was no chemistry between Brooke and Mike and am I
the only one who was disturbed by Brooke watching her brother strip?
Frankly, I'm surprised at how many good reviews this movie received. I
really wanted to like it, even if just for Matthew and Channing. Even
though I went in knowing the plot was not the greatest (from someone
who saw it before me), I was surprised at how truly bad it was. Wait
for the DVD and use your fast forward!
