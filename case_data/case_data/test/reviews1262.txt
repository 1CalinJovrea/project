YOU, Just Got Hustled

How in the hell is this one of the most loved films of the year by the
critics? The answer is, you just got hustled. You just got hustled if
you paid to see this trash that is. The hype, the glitz, and almost no
substance whatsoever seems to be the main theme of this film, also
confused and senseless characters are another main theme.We have come to an age where film critics are set up in four star
hotels and wined and dined by the Hollywood film industry before red
carpet events in order to help them make record profits. The critics
and big film producers these days sleep in the same bed so to speak,
and that's why you can't trust most modern day critics anymore than you
can trust a two bit hustler, because really when you get down to it,
they are one and the same. Only money separates what is good and bad
for many of the pathetic sheep of society today.To me Bale was the only thing that really stood out in a good way in
this film. He delivers a highly consistent and believable character, in
fact I would say he was flat out great. Amy Adams was also pretty good
and Renner was again strong in a limited role. Did Cooper and Lawrence
even have characters? Their character's were so unbelievable and
terribly written that they just basically ruined the film for me.
Lawrence pulled off the terrible character fairly well, but I couldn't
help but cringe almost every time Cooper tried to play his terribly
written part. I always liked Cooper in other films, but here his
character is just too unbelievable, it's like he's an inconsistent
cartoon man or something. I've heard that much of the film was improve,
so perhaps the writing isn't all to blame.The plot itself is so tired and here almost completely pointless. I
would say that their is a two layered plot here and the inner hustler
is the only interesting aspect of it, however it isn't nearly enough to
save the film. The story lacked depth and the film had virtually no
feeling to it at all, the direction is totally jumbled in my view and
just went for appearance and flashy scenes. There really is nothing
here besides a few good performances and a half-ass inner hustler
aspect to the plot that mostly falls flat because of it's lack of depth
and consistency.Don't get hustled by the Hollywood hypsters, watch this film for free,
if at all.5.5/10
