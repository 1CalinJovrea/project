Slow and Tedious and very confusing, Also too heavy on the propaganda.

As the title says, i'm not a massive fan of this new film by Afleck and
i'll try to explain why.The film opens pretty interestingly enough. It gives a small tale of
what happened to the oil rich country of Iran i.e., the US installed
their own man and the subsequent revolution.THEN the film becomes a film about making a production of a sci-fi film
to rescue the 6 people trapped in Tehran. The action is painlessly slow
and often quite tedious.The question I ask myself is - what is this film about? It is
confusing.As said we have had the opening and then we meet the story of HOW they
are going to rescue the 6: but the story seems to be very much
PRO-West/USA and anti-revolution and anti-Iran, and I find this a
little disturbing.We have a depiction of Tony (Affleck) eating burgers and sharing
Hollywood information with his son (Plant of the Apes) and the myriad
of shots of Hollywood and the actors and producers - in particular John
Goodman. He's pretty great in the part and seems real in the role. But
it is all very much strange.The first we meet Tehran is when Tony is flying over Iranian airspace
(we meet this motif at the end also!) and he is told to put his alcohol
away a reference that no alcohol is allowed. BUT, WHY? This is an
ideological POV that we the audience are enveloped and ensconced. Then
we see many images of children ( the dialogue in the film is "sweat
shop kids") putting together the images of the 6 people so that they
can get captured - and tortured and "have their nails pulled out" -
This dialogue comes from the film.So, I don't want to go on with this and I hope you've got an idea for
why I do not like this film.
