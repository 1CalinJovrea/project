Great film but room for improvement

Although i thought the film was great, i did feel the ending let it
down slightly. the death of Gwen ruined it for me. it made the fact of
her going to oxford in england irrelevant. they gave you false hope of
spider-man going to england and maybe continuing his adventure there.
the death of Gwen was a little to full on for my liking. following the
death of Gwen makes the next spider-man film less exciting for me.their relationship is a huge part to the spider-man films and now thats
gone the films will never be the same. apart from that i thought the acting was brilliant and spider-man/peter
parker is played amazingly.
