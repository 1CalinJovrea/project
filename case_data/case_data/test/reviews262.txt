The Hangolders.

I went to see this film the second day after release and i wasn't sure
if it would be decent... but it was hilarious! It is The Hangover old
people's edition with lots of old age jokes that kept me and the whole
cinema laughing all the way through!I can see why Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman accepted this film
because they were brilliant! I had no idea Freeman could play a funny
role and Robert De Niro surprised me too with his great role!I feel all ages will love this as it is clearly meant for everybody to
watch. The only problem I found with it was that it had one of those
cheesy childhood plots where they link it with when they are older
ruined it slightly for me but it had to have some form of a plot so i
didn't mind at all.
