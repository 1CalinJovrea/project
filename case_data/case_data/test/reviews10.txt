I wanted to like it, but no

Reading other peoples' comments makes me a minority I believe, but
there was just something that didn't win me over with Moonlight. Don't
get me wrong, my favorite movie genre is drama and I really appreciate
deep and artistically made coming-of-age dramas too, but I could barely
contain my restlessness in these two hours. There was so little
dialogue (and even if it was there, it didn't bear any importance) that
it was difficult for me to get to know the characters, let alone like
them or care for them. Although the plot may be relatable to some
people, it just wasn't original. It felt like one clich√© was followed
by another. Maybe the main problem is that I couldn't wait to watch it, I read so
many brilliant reviews and eight Oscar nominations built up my
expectations. Well, Moonlight in my opinion was a disappointment and
even though I wanted to like it, it just didn't happen. I will still
give the movie a 3 because it is not a disaster, the acting is decent
and I appreciate the director didn't want to show another story of a
white and privileged man. Movies with this type of message are
important for our society, but I would not recommend watching this
particular one.
