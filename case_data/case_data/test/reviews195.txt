Good Action Movie

Reading the reviews i'm not sure why people were expecting this movie
to be like an Oscar winner or something? Going in I wasn't expecting it
to be an Oscar winner, if you were expecting this movie to be about a
Mexican cartel and not have violence in it then you know zero about
Mexican cartels and that is an understatement.Funny thing was i was expecting this movie not to portray Mexican
cartels in their real light, but after watching the movie, yup they are
as ruthless as the movie portrays and glad Hollywood portrayed them
like that instead of sugar coating the threat they pose to the world.If you are looking for a violent action movie based on an American drug
ring vs a Mexican cartel well you probably have one of the better
movies when it comes to that. If you are looking for gone with the
wind, sound of the music or something like that best look else where.
Me, I highly enjoyed the movie, it delivered better than i thought it
was going to deliver. People will complain about the violence but again
this is about a Mexican cartel, not the boy scouts. There is nothing i
hate more than a movie that isn't true to it's roots, but this movie
stays true to what Mexican cartels are all about when it comes to
business.
