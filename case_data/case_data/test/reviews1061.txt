Broke My Will Farrell Pledge

I wanted to go to the movies to have a laugh, so I decided to break my
pledge to never, ever go see a Will Farrell movie. Bad, bad, bad
mistake. There were more laughs in Kramer v Kramer. This was very
possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Gratuitous, nonstop foul
language in what had to a parody of bad comedy, no one could make this
crap on purpose. I would have left after 20 minutes, but my wife was
getting a nice snooze. When she woke up at the credit roll and asked
what she had missed, I said "Absolutely nothing." My new pledge is to
never, under threat of assisted suicide, go to a Will Farrell OR Amy
Poehler movie.
