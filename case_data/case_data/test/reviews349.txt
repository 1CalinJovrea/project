Worst Bourne Yet

This was the worst Bourne flick yet and there is no way I will watch
another one.What began as a refreshing alternative to the stale James Bond
franchise has become even less imaginative, and the latest installment
was nothing but formulaic schlock.Bourne staples: - Bourne living in a 3rd world country minding his own business when
something happens to make him leave his life and reengage with the CIA - Female CIA agent sees the good in Bourne while the evil white males
in charge conspire to kill him and infringe somehow on civil liberties
in the name of freedom - Bourne has flashbacks and finds out more about his past - Multiple car chases - Multiple scenes of Bourne taking out guys with guns in close combat,
in many cases taking their guns - Use of tracking devices - Use of hacking - Bourne outwits pursuers after arranging public meet - Bourne takes a train somewhere - Aerial shots of European capitals - Bourne races the clock- Bourne tempted to "come in" - Bourne is faced with another agent called an "asset" who is almost as
good as him and will never lose him in a chase but never quite good
enough to beat him in a hand to hand fight to the death - Bourne thumbs through old passports - Bourne fights on despite serious injuries
