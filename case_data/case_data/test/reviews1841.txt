As a fan of the musical, I had not to be disappointed with this
adaptation and I wasn't! I had the opportunity of watching it at the
premiere in Leicester Square in London, with all the huge actors, the
director, musical creator's, etc. It was really exciting, the actors sing better than I expected, and all
the photography added to the musical perfectly complete it for an
unforgettable experience. I can't tell anything bad. Anne Hathaway is very good, as well as Sacha
Baron Cohen or Hugh Jackman. The musical is fantastic. The movie:
terrific!
