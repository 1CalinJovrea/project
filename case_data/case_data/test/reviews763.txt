Cacophony... a jumbled mess

Coco Chanel said "Once you've dressed, and before you leave the house,
look in the mirror and take at least one thing off." This is what Baz
should have done. In The Great Gatsby's case, a lot more than one thing
should have been taken off or out of this film. It is Over The Top;
Bad. Too much fake CGI.In a major cinema complex in Sydney in Cinema 1 (largest theatre in the
complex) on the second night of opening it was bearly one quarter full
and even then a whole row of 10 patrons walked out after that silly
scene in the underground jazz club.It is a cacophony of nothingness. Too much fluff and tinsel. No
sympathy for any character could be felt.P.S. And the blinking green light... Yes, we can see it. Yes, we know
what it means. Yes, we are not dumb!!
