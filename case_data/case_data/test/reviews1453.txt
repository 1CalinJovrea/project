2nd worst mistake of my life

Having heard many things about this movie and seen the trailer, I
finally decided to watch is. Thinking back on my life, I believe I've made 2 HUGE mistakes : 1st one was marrying my now ex-wife. 2nd one was watching this movie.Filled with stupid "jokes", quotes and references this movie attempts
to reintroduce us to a newer version of the Ghostbusters movie I loved
as a child. Some claim, that this is "empowering women"... sorry, but
it does the opposite. It dumbs down the women, and I will teach my
little daughter, that women CAN be scientists... They DON'T have to act
SO stupid as seen here.
