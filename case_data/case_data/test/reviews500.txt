A drop that's up there

If you didn't have Tom Hardy on your radar up to this movie, you surely
will have him on it after watching this. There is another stellar
performance from James Gandolfini, whom regrettably we lost too early,
but this is Hardys movie through and through. With Noomi making an
impact too as the female lead of the piece.But while I am excited about the movie and others obviously are too, do
not expect this to be a fast paced ride that will be exciting in that
style. This is understated and subtle and slow burning. If you can dig
that, you will experience a great story, with great characters with
some neat surprises along the way. The deliveries are on the money (no
pun intended)
