All the hate???

I thought this movie was 2nd best possibly 1st in the trilogy. I hear
the term "no hangover" that's why it sucked or it was lazy or unfunny
but it was a serious drama/comedy the hangover series has a deep story
in 3 it all comes together the movie was great I have no clue why
people hate it but I recommend it. its a good time. also the hangover
part 3 had a lot of original things from the first one so when people
say it what out of plot or unoriginal then there Solly mistaken great
movie though I hate all the hate on it doesn't deserve the hate it was
well done. it even had done good at the box office and some decent
reviews so are these hate reviews all from one spam mer or?
