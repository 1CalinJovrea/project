How will Seth Rogen evaluate his films when he grows up ?

I can't help but wonder, (as a competitor of Adam Sandler for the most
juvenile smutty and profane movies ever made) what will Seth Rogen
think of his own work when he "grows up" and has children of his own
(if he can have children). If I were him I would be totally and
absolutely embarrassed, change my name and get a face-lift. In my
opinion, (- and I am not a prude), all the unnecessary swear words and
sexual references (probably to appeal to the younger kids) are a very
cheap and vulgar way of trying to becoming a movie star, and will
guarantee a very short life for his films. As a fellow Canuck, I am
embarrassed to learn that he "grew up" in Canada.
