Haunting, chilling slow burn horror flick, will stick in your head for a while..

Let me first start off this review with saying that if you are not a
fan of slow burn style horror films, this may not be your cup of tea.
This movie is not your run of the mill horror film, with cheap scares,
or tons of constant gore. To begin, let me just say that the atmosphere
throughout this entire movie is wonderful..something about the
locations they picked, and the general atmosphere that is just great.
The cinematography is simply beautiful as well. The shots used for this
film are perfect to set the tone of the movie. In a sense, this movie starts off rather slow. The pacing is a bit
slower than most horror films, but for good reasoning. As this movie
continues on, things get more and more dreadful, and disturbing. The
general idea of this film, is that two girls who attend a religious
boarding school are stuck there alone over their winter break, awaiting
their parents arrival. What seems like a normal place, becomes
increasingly disturbing and quite haunting. The way in which this film
builds up tension is very effective. Our two lead characters, Kathryn
and rose, are very different and not friends by any means, but they are
stuck together while everyone else has departed for winter break. Rose
seems annoyed with Kathryn throughout the movie, because she is
younger, and also a bit needy. As the film goes on, Kathryn's behavior
seems to get more and more strange. As the story unfolds with Rose and
Kathryn, another story is shown that seems to be happening at the same
time. A young girl, Joan, who is all alone, sits at a bus stop in the
winter weather, appearing cold and distressed. An older man who is
nearby for some reason, sees Joan and proceeds to ask her if she is
okay, or needs help, she is not very respondent to the man. After some
convincing, she agrees to go with him and his wife who is waiting in
their car nearby. They proceed to drive where the man says he will take
her to the town shes needing to get to, on the way they stop at a
hotel. The girl continually has flashbacks, those of which are unclear
as to what is happening in them. we then shift back to Rose and
Kathryn. Rose had left with her apparent boyfriend, to inform him she
is pregnant, leaving Kathryn behind by herself. Upon Rose returning,
she finds Kathryn in the boiler room, moving strangely, in a way,
flailing in front of the lit boiler. Rose takes Kat back up to her
room, and tucks her into bed, assuring her that her parents will show
up, upon doing so, Kat makes a statement inferring that her parents are
dead. Rose is disturbed by this, but brushes it off. We go back to Joan, and the man Bill. They sit at a diner together,
preparing to eat. Bill tells Joan she reminds of him of his deceased
daughter, Rose. Joan excuses herself, and proceeds to go to the
bathroom. while in the bathroom, Joan has a flashback of strangling a
nurse in a psych ward named Joan, and stealing her identity. When
leaving the bathroom, Joan sees a cop talking to bill, she grabs a
nearby knife from a bus tray. Bill informs her they need to leave
because of a big storm coming, they leave the diner, and proceed to
continue driving toward their destination. it is now morning, and we go back to Rose and Kat. They proceed to join
the two school nurses for breakfast, while they are saying grace, Kat
appears to giggle inappropriately. When they discipline Kat, she then
gets sick and vomits. This moment is when things get very disturbing.
As the nurses try to assist Kat, she lashes out and says "get your
hands off me, cu*nt". At this moment it is clear that something is very
wrong with Kat. The nurses tell Rose to shovel the driveway, she does
so, then goes back to her bed and lays down. Now in a flashback, it
shows Kat brutally stabbing the two nurses to death, and proceeding to
decapitate them. Rose checks on her pregnancy test in the bathroom,
while doing so, she hears someone enter the bathroom, then leave. she
looks. but no one is around. Upon entering the hallway, Rose sees two
bloody decapitated heads wrapped in sheets, Kat appears and then
brutally stabs Rose to death, also decapitating her. A police officer finds Kat in the boiler room, surrounded by the three
decapitated heads, in some sort of ritual. Still wielding the knife,
she turns to the cop and proceeds to say "Hail Satan!" Ignoring the
cops orders, she rushes him and is then shot. we go back to the car, with Joan, bill and his wife. Bills wife reveals
to Joan that their daughter, rose was murdered and decapitated 9 years
earlier. Joan tells bill she is going to be sick, instructing him to
pull over. Upon pulling over, Joan grabs Bill, slashing his throat, and
then stabs his wife to death. She decapitates them both, and takes
their heads in a suitcase to the bordering school, which is now closed.
At this point, we realize Joan, is actually an older Kat. she takes the
heads to the boiler room, and looks for the beast she had originally
been seeing, who seemingly has possessed her when she was a young
Kathryn.
