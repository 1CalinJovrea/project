Warmongering and incredible

I hoped from the previews to see an exciting action flick with
spectacular scenes, suspense, maybe some cleverness, heroism and
victory in the end. Hyper violent, anti-North Korean war mongering
overwhelmed any such values. North Korean "terrorists" are shown as
brutal and ruthless as Nazis. American air defense is incredibly
skimpy, incompetent and late. Our military leaders are weak saps who
cave in to every terrorist demand with "Oh, Pleeze don't hurt our
President! We'll do what you want." Our control of our own most potent
weapons systems is easily overridden by one woman terrorist at a
keyboard. The American SuperDuperHero single-handedly kills many of the
terrorists and liberates the President. After killing the UberVillain,
he even has a moment to put a bandage on the wounded President. That
scene actually made me laugh.My wife and I regret we paid to see this. Negative emotions stirred up
by the film may cause bad effects, mental, such as tolerance for
another preemptive war, and bodily, like raised blood pressure, heart
rate, stomach acid. With tripe like this, if you liked the wars against
Viet Nam, Serbia, and Iraq, you'll probably love our wars on Iran and
"Second Korea."
