The extreme worst of all Resident Evil series

I love Resident Evil series. Despite the mediocre reviews it gets in
the past, I still go to the cinema on its release and always looking
forward for the next sequel. But RE5 fails beyond believe. The storyline is utterly crap. The action
are cheesy, the actors are cheesy, the whole movie is a joke to the RE
series. I am completely disappointed at how the whole movie turns out
to be.*spoiler alert* The whole movie is set on one giant Umbrella underwater
laboratory and Alice and friends is trying to break out of it. Along
the way they encounter some zombies and finally got out. And that's
literally about the summary of the whole story!They try to use music to intensify everything.. but it becomes very
cheesy. Especially towards the end before the final fight when Jill
walks out of the submarine.The Red Queen is total crap. Cheesy, stupid.. The fighting scene itself is very cheesy and unrealistic. They hardly
get hit by a bullet even when they were standing in open view. But it
seems like their bullet always managed to hit the enemy. Even the one
bullet that hit Alice, didn't even do her much harm. What a load of
crap.At the final fight, it was obvious some of them had had their bones
cracked. But they were still standing and fighting as if their bone is
not really a necessary part of their body. They look pretty healthy for
someone with broken bone!When Alice beats Jill.. it was so obvious from the beginning that
that's what needs to be done. But the scriptwriter must've made Alice
so dumb that she did not realize that from the beginning. Sadly, the
viewers are not as dumb as the scriptwriter.And on the final scene when Leon touches Ada's thigh.. THATS AS
CHEESIEST AS IT COULD GET! I could almost cry looking at that scene.
What the f... *sigh*I apologize for using a lot of "cheesy" word in my review. But it is
exactly how I feel when I see it. It's like a bunch of amateurs movie
makers trying to make action movie.All in all, I wouldn't even rate it 5 for effort. Its a total lazy
movie writing. I still want to see RE6, but I seriously hope they do
not FAIL as big as this one. What a load of crap this movie is.
