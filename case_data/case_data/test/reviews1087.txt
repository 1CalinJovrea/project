A Cavalcade of "Deepities"

I've always considered David Fincher to be one of the greatest
directors of all time (though 'Zodiac' was a mind-numbing,
energy-draining train wreck, and 'Fight Club' is one of the most
pathetic excuses for brute-masculinity-worshiping, apocalypse-craving,
self-righteous, pseudo-philosophical, sexist-in-both-directions garbage
I've ever seen, and possibly the most overrated film of all time,
though there are certainly a few other contenders for that title).
Still, Fincher was also responsible for 'Se7en', which is, by my index,
one of the most powerful, engrossing, genre-defining films of the last
few decades, not to mention his relatively recent direction of the
brilliant 'The Social Network', his previous stewardship of 'The Game',
and his laudable work on 'House of Cards'. So I was relatively certain,
especially given its largely stellar reviews and a personal
recommendation from one of my best friends, that after I went to see
'Gone Girl' this evening, I would have, at the very least, moderately
enjoyed it, if not referring to it as a "modern masterpiece". In the
end, what I enjoyed most about it was the pervasive running criticism
in my head.I am locked in the throes of the biting emotional disappointment and
vitriol this film just inspired in me, so my feelings are probably
influencing me to go overboard with this particular slaughter, but I'm
going to say this anyway: THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN
(and no, I'm quite sure that that is not an exaggeration)! It's not
quite in my bottom 10 or 20, nor will it be, but it lives merely inches
above them on my list (in Size-10 font), still swirling the soil at the
bottom of the toilet bowl. It is an insult to whatever audiences it
victimizes. It is, to borrow a word from one of my intellectual heroes,
Daniel Dennett, a cavalcade of "deepities", as if a bad soap opera
graduated to the big screen and suddenly got a little better at passing
itself off as important and hoodwinking its viewers into swallowing its
not-so-well-veiled insults at modern culture, marriage, men, women,
logic, and law enforcement. Don't get me wrong: these are all things
which are imperfect, and which often have aspects which beg for
condemnation, but said condemnation for its own sake, or for the sake
of uniqueness or political correctness or rebellion or ostentation, and
built on a quagmire of its own obvious narcissism, doesn't convince,
but rather sickens. And for all the moments it could have had in its
Brobdingnagian duration, it found no honesty in any of them. SPOILERS
AHEAD (though they might not all be well-understood by those who
haven't seen the film)1. First of all, nobody in their right mind would believe Rosamund
Pike's character after she "comes back from being kidnapped and raped"
and gushes about her "loving and misunderstood husband", a story that
most everyone in the general public (and the FBI, in one of the film's
countless absurdities) seems to fall for, 'Gone Girl' equating the
American general public and the FBI with Charlie Brown, and Pike with
Lucy.2. I really do wonder if Ben Affleck has ever had a single truly honest
moment in front of a camera, whether in interviews as himself (one
quite recently with Sam Harris and Bill Maher, among others), or in his
ridiculous movies playing wooden characters ('Daredevil', 'Jersey
Girl', 'Gigli', 'Pearl Harbor', 'The Town', and now 'Gone Girl', to
name a few). He is somnolent and one-dimensional, with rarely a hint of
color.3. I know a film is bad when my absolute favorite thing about it, not
to mention the most convincing thing, is a character played by Tyler
Perry. What a joke.4. This film tries to convince us that all or most men are lascivious,
shallow sex-pigs who only care about women into whom they have a chance
of inserting their penises, and into whom they wish to do so, and that
all or most women are manipulative, vindictive,
masterfully-controlling, mind-reading femme-fatale-potentials, who are
always putting on a face for everyone, who are so complex and
misunderstood and deep and brilliant, and who only want husbands who
are completely spineless and too afraid to stand up to them, and whose
love of anyone but themselves is not but a well-crafted charade. Such
notions are not only adolescent stereotypes (and pathetically tired and
pedestrian, even for that age group), but bear little, if any,
relationship to reality. Reality is far more nuanced, more interesting,
and more pleasurable, with many more twists and turns. And both men and
women are aggregates that consist of mostly very good people, despite
many examples to the contrary. Norman Bates really isn't that common in
real life.5. Neil Patrick Harris' character (the worst-cast character in the
whole story) made no sense. It is not believable that he would side
with Pike after everything she put him through before, when she set him
up similarly to the way she set Affleck up, and it is not believable
that he would keep in contact with her or let her into his house. The
film is just littered with increasingly-laughable implausibilities.6. The scene where Affleck and Pike meet is one of the worst-written
scenes of dialogue or human interaction I've ever witnessed, far more
absurd than anything from 'Titanic' or 'Dawson's Creek' or 'Twilight',
and far more nausea-inducing. I expected so much more from David
Fincher, though I guess the dialogue is Gillian Flynn's fault. Still,
he should've fixed it.To conclude, I beg of everyone who reads this: please don't contribute
money to this film! Seriously, you could inevitably be doing something
far more valuable with both your time and said money, and films like
this should stop being made.
