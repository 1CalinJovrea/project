Appeals to the lowest common denominator of humanity

Basically nothing more than a tasteless, college-humor (more like
adolescent humor) comedy. There are certainly enough non-intellectuals
in America to get a kick out of making jokes about statutory rape,
pedophilia, incest, and whatever other unnecessary things one can put
in a movie to make it..."edgy"? I could never understand the appeal,
but then I guess I've matured beyond 5th grade. Would recommend if you're one of those people who hears a story about a
woman raping a 12 year old and thinks "lucky boy". Would not recommend
to children or adults with even half the brain cells of a decent human
being.
