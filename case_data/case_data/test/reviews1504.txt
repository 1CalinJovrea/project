Terrible plot and logic and support

I need help understanding some of the plot elements, because otherwise,
this has really been the worst pixar movie I've seen to date...A lot of the more serious info was glossed over or rushed in the movie,
so I may not have this all correct. So there were four princes who were
given equal power by the king, but one of the princes wanted it all,
and this caused the kingdom to crumble. Elinor was using this legend to
make Merida become a proper princess and get married. I really fail to
see the connection between the story and her current situation. I also
didn't really catch what the wayward prince did to be cursed into a
mindless bear by the witch. And the witch is suppose to be good? She
basically killed the prince and was willing to kill Elinor (turn and
leave her as a bear) just to teach Merida a lesson? What lesson is
this? The mother-daughter family bond? Because it really doesn't tie
into the wayward prince legend at all. The tapestry with the queen
being cut off, and the prince and his stone tablet being broken off,
are you telling me Elinor is power hungry? No it doesn't make sense to
me at all.It was suppose to be about changing your destiny and doing so bravely,
but what destiny? No one is really keeping Merida from having fun
riding a horse, shooting arrows, and exploring the woods. It doesn't
push the whole caged princess theme very strongly. She seems perfectly
free to do whatever she wants, and eat whatever she wants. The king and
his subjects and allies are all fighting brutes and heavy drinkers,
jolly without a care in the world. The only one who even tries to keep
order is Elinor. She is perfectly fine and loving as a mother from all
the flashbacks, but wants to keep some order and good relations among
the various clans. This whole propriety thing isn't really even
supported in the backdrop. I didn't even know they were suppose to be
royalty in the beginning of the movie. I thought he got kinged for
defeating the bear, in the beginning anyway, because they sure weren't
living the life of luxury in the beginning. And Elinor was suppose to
be married off? And have ladylike qualities and upbringing? Maybe more
responsible than the others. And the primitive land and people. All
doesn't really support the caged princess thing.Elinor never needed to be changed, nor her destiny. Merida needed to
stop acting like a stubborn brat, and her destiny was far from set in
stone. She bravely changed it...how? Who is being brave here? And then
they throw in a "you should do whatever you want to and be true to
yourself" speech out of nowhere. They never did elaborate on why Merida
had to be married in the first place, what purpose it would accomplish,
and who actually cared, because it seemed no one, especially none of
the clansman, really cared.And the will-o-wisp was the soul of the transformed prince, trying to
get Merida to kill him and free his soul? Or maybe he wanted someone
else to turn into a bear to commiserate with him by leading her to the
witch? The prince was selfish so that made some sense that the witch
transformed him into a mindless bear, but unlike Beauty and the Beast,
he will never be able to transform back and live his former life. The
only peace he can get is to be killed off and his misery ended? Still
don't know why Elinor was transformed into a bear and what major
lessons it was suppose to instill in her, or merida, and how this was
suppose to be a bonding experience, or a change destiny lesson, or
anything effective as such or make any sense.
