This is ridiculous times 6 :)

I have seen many Adam Sandler movies, but I'm afraid the humor is not
what it used to be or my taste is just changing. I like many of his
movies also the more realistic and dramatic roles, but with the
comedies it has come down to silly and strange characters that are just
acting out on camera, sometimes it seems like they get to improvise and
if it is silly enough they use it in the film :)There really are a lot of great cast members in this and they all play
crazy characters, it is fun to get introduced to the one crazy son of a
b.... after another, they are as stated all crazy, maybe a bit too
much. It is however strange that so many talented people can join this
slapstick humor comedy and it isn't just a bit more fun to watch. We
are talking the good old Rob Schneider, David Spade, Steve Buscemi and
John Tuturo, we expect them to be part of a Happy Madison production,
then there are all the others, the extras, the "cameos" and it is a lot
of people Taylor Lautner, Terry Crews, Nick Nolte, Danny Trejo, Luke
Wilson, Steve Zahn, Will Forte, Jorge Garcia, Blake Shelton, Vanilla
Ice and many many more. It is a crazy crew, but for me none of all
these did make this a good movie.There were a lot of childish jokes a lot of slap stick humor, some
things worked, but mostly it was just not good enough, I don't know
maybe I just expected too much, but it could have been just a little
more fun.
