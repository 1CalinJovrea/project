Good action packed movie

I really like spiderman as a series, and I think Andrew Garfield does
take on this more gloomy and dark version of spidey/peter parker, it
works quite well and I hope that they make many more in the series.Very nice action packed movie, if you haven't seen it or know what is
coming in it, maybe you should not read on **spoiler alert**.I am not a big fan of these villains or heroes for that matter that
gets weird powers that is not at all plausible, spiderman well yes
maybe a mutated spider could bit and transfer powers, that is okay for
me, but Electro come on, he should have died in that fish tank and not
become this electrical super freak evil bad guy. Give me the two other
evil enemies at the end, Dane DeHaan really fits his part both as Harry
Osborne, but also as the Goblin it is really good. The Rhino that we
briefly see in the end is really fitting in my universe of spiderman
and the evil fiends he has to battle, so for my sake those are the one
they should go for.Really good and action packed, maybe a bit to long, but it keeps you
entertained all the way.
