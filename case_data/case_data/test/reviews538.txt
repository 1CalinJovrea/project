Outstanding, brilliantly creepy little horror movie

Honeymoon is a gem of an indie horror movie in which a young couple's
idyllic honeymoon getaway at a lakeside cottage slowly turns into a
strange and horrifying nightmare. Rose Leslie, star of Game Of Thrones,
is excellent eventually - as in the brilliant British TV series Utopia
in which she featured, her performance is over the top at first, almost
drama school, but as the weird and disturbing story ramps up she fully
inhabits the role. Treadaway, a tremendous young British actor, is
fantastic from start to end, as he comes to realise the near-extreme
horror scenario they're in. Music is superb, the atmosphere from the
moment they reach the cabin is brilliant - all in all, a tremendous
surprise, great performances and a first-time director with a
distinctive voice and real vision. Horror fans, seek this film out.
