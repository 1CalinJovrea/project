Encompasses everything wrong with Hollywood's arrogant attitude towards its audience

Dear Hollywood: It's time for something new.Firstly, this film is entertaining enough and has a great
director/cast/performances, blah blah blah -- However we should expect
more after this many years of the same tripe from indeed talented
people who have done better before. And seriously, how many times can
we be entertained by basically the same thing over and over and over,
just repackaged? People snorting cocaine. People having sex. Hookers.
Bad behavior. Shocking male genitalia in an R-Rated movie when we
usually only see bush and knockers. Give me a break. Hate to tell you,
although the audience may be comprised of giddy man-children who laugh
at dick jokes: Shock value does not equal brilliance. The film started out good and held my attention but the lack of depth
written for any character besides Leonardo was awful. Everyone is a
caricature of characters we have seen in countless other movies. And I
learned less about Jordan Belfort from this three hour film than a
three line bio on wikipedia. And: What was the point of this movie? I honestly still have no idea
and the ending was especially disappointing and anti-climatic.Bravo for Di Caprio in the role but that is honestly about it. Why was
John Favreu even in this film? Why was Mathew McNaughahay wasted for 5
minutes of screen time? It could have challenged the audience by not giving us the
stereotypical black and white character development and extra
predictable plotting.Scorcese has done a good job of making mob figures and murderers seem
charismatic and cool, but this film teaches neither the character or
the audience anything at all.I'm rich, so this resort style jail is not that bad. Time to get an
inspirational speaking gig and make a Hollywood movie officially
validating me as legit. Enough is enough, we need to ask for more out of these "based on true
story" indulgences. Between Belfort and Hollywood, I would say the latter has ripped off
average people the most.
