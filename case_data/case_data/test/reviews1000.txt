Thoroughly enjoyed it!

There is a reason I don't pay attention to reviewers before seeing a
movie; seems most of them have lost the ability to view a movie without
preconceived notions. Too much over-analyzing. Very little of what is
put out these days is in any way realistic. I'm not looking for
realistic when I go see a movie; I'm looking for an escape from the
daily grind. I'm not a gamer and decided to see the movie since I'm
familiar with Michael Fassbender and I like his work. I chose to see
the 3D version, which I rarely do, and am glad I did. It was a
thoroughly enjoyable movie! Kudos to Damien Walters for the stunt
work--great to watch.
