Don't listen to the haters/critics!

Following a somewhat parallel story to the original game, I do wish
they would've stuck with original characters. Despite that, the film
remains a fun and intriguing watch. The change of the Animus from a
bed-like system to the VR style arm was something I originally
disliked, but that change ends up playing well into the film visually
and aids in parts of the story. The action scenes are well
choreographed and exciting, countered with what may be a few too many
close up facial expressions and dialogue that might easily confuse
someone less familiar with the base plot of the franchise. As far as
movie adaptations of video games, this is a far better rendition than
many other attempts. As a standalone film it needs some work. But I
know they intended to produce a trilogy so I'd like to believe the
opportunity to release sequels will give the audience more of what
they're looking for, while this movie may have been a bit too much set
up rather than development. Personally I generously offer it 7/10, and
would recommend seeing it. I hope it is successful enough for them to
finish the intended trilogy.
