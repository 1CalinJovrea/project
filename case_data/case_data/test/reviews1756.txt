Worth watching...

Regardless of the negative reviews this movie received, I couldn't
resist seeing a Stephen King film. Many reviewers/critics mentioned the
movie was too different from the book, but I read The Dark Tower series
back in the 80's, so it wasn't fresh in my mind. Matthew McConaughey
played an excellent villain, and the rest of the cast did a great job
as well. In my opinion, it was worth watching in the theater. Don't go
expecting the over-usage of blood, gore and language that is typical in
a flick based on a King book. I enjoyed the story-line and action,
which is a great reason to watch it on the big screen.
