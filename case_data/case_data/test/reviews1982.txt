The Woman in Black is a fine and appropriate return to atmospheric
horror movies for the once great Hammer Films. It sticks to the source
material's (the 1983 novel by Susan Hill) original time period (the
late 19th century to the early 20th century), with authentic costumes,
sets and a spectacularly creepy haunted house. The mood is perfect
(emphasized by extreme isolation), the sustained dread is
gut-wrenching, and the anticipation is a killer. Although this is a
ghost story with the standard dilapidated, abandoned mansion as the
central location for trepidation, it presents several very unique ideas
for old-fashioned hauntings.Young Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) lost his wife (Sophie Stuckey)
during childbirth a few years ago. He frequently has visions of her in
her wedding dress (symbolically, the woman in white), which gives him a
newfound sense of spiritualism, but hampers his ability to work
effectively at the law firm that employs him. His last assignment, one
that is necessary to prove his dedication to the company as well as
demonstrate his recovery from grief, is to journey to a remote village
on the outskirts of England. Once there, he must sort out the papers
left at Eel Marsh House to finalize the financial and legal dealings of
the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow. Although the townspeople wish for
Kipps to leave as swiftly as he arrives, he finds a friend in Simon
Daily (Ciaran Hinds), the only man in town with a car, and one who has
lost his son in an accident and whose wife (Janet McTeer) has gone
crazy with mental suffering. What is supposed to be a simple job
becomes plagued by disconcerting secrets, the mysterious deaths of
children, and the unnatural sightings of an ebony-veiled woman in black
funeral attire.The use of demonic-looking toy contraptions and unnerving dolls is
nothing new. Nor are the expected, manipulative jump scares fueled by
loud thuds, screeches, and jarring sound effects (and a pesky crow), or
the sudden appearances of otherworldly imagery coupled with
crescendo-favoring musical accompaniment. But the evil spirit itself is
wonderfully singular in its ability to scare through subtle
materialization (coming into sight in alarming manner, with slower
paced emergences more traumatizing than the rapid ones), its targeting
of children and pattern of avoiding physical harm to adults, and most
of all in its vengeful mission that cannot be appeased, calmed or
quelled. She's a wronged poltergeist of legendary ill-omen stature,
foreshadowing doom; she's not meant to be satisfied but rather endured.The explanation for the wraith is much more straightforward and
understandable than in the previous film adaption. The many questions
that arose from the 1989 version are neatly covered here, opting for a
clear-cut motive of insatiable revenge. Kipps still possesses an
uncanny bravery (or stupidity) in the face of genuinely frightful,
spectral harassment, and attempts many panic-induced, pointless parries
(such as locking the door on a ghost). The conclusion has changed,
along with the previous unforgettable climax, but despite the morbid
nature of the story and the terminal confrontation, screenwriter Jane
Goldman (or perhaps interfering producers) has chosen the most
assuaging method to wrap up a dark narrative of eerie tragedy and
undying wrath.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)
