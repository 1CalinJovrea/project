All acting is on point and it is definitely not predictable

Definitely a good movie to see. I think the Survivalist says maybe 20
lines in the whole movie but he plays the role perfect. I like the fact
that it was hard to predict which direction the movie is going. One
thing I am sure everyone hates is to waste their life watching a
ridiculous movie that is so predictable where they even throw in bad
acting. This won't take you there. At first I thought it was going to
be like The Walking Dead but I was happy to see that it was far from
that nonsense. The Walking Dead is just another overrated TV show.
Enjoy.James
