Taken 2: Don't go

So, its a stinker!If you came to see Liam Neeson kicking ass, my advice is turn back now
and save your money. This is entirely due to the inability to actually
see what the heck's going on in all of the films actions sequences and
stunt co ordinations. The film looks like it was filmed on the site of
a permanent earthquake with a camera dangling by a rope. If you have
epilepsy this might be one to avoid considering how quick its been
edited. Its almost like director Olivier Megaton said "yeah we're going
for the subliminal message type look, edit it like that" And you want
anything remotely reminiscent of the first films action? well forget
about it because it hasn't been included. What you will be treated to however is a cheap, watered down child
friendly, completely unrealistic, trashy, knock off 'Rom Com with
bullets' B reel, sold purely on the title of "Taken" alone.Huge plot holes dominate the script from start to finish, in its purest
form its basically an awful rehash of the first film but 1000 times
worse, placing Maggie Grace (Bryan Mills daughter) as the heroine
trying to rescue her parents from a load of bungling Albanians (yes
they are literally that bad, think of Manuel from Faulty Towers and you
have your starting point) . Liam Neeson does his best with what he's
got, but there's only so much you can do with a turd script like this.
Unfortunately its so laughable that Neesons character starts to look
like a paranoid delusional psychopath that sees kidnappers everywhere.
They must have forgotten to include the scene where Neeson gains his
super power to spot evil doers just by looking at them, but hey that's
what happens so get over it!Not only that but did anybody even look at a map before this script was
written? Had anybody even been to Turkey or Albania? Clearly its the
best location in the world to magically learn how to drive a car,
because that's what Maggie Grace does! However there's also a dire lack
a qualified torturers because no one can do it, or interrogate or
generally manage to do anything right! Alternatively, if you feel like
throwing some hand grenades off rooftops without anybody batting an
eyelid then this might just be the place for you. Don't worry about the
police, they'll be to busy driving around in there 1970s bangers they
hauled right off the scrap heap, where this movie also came from.Unfortunately the worst news is that Taken 3 already seems to be on the
horizon. Many of you will be asking 'how...why....who....???' but
unfortunately money speaks louder than taste. I imagine the plot will
be an all black screen and Liam Neesons voice over "Your money has been
taken". The horror that it was a 12a should have sent alarm bells
ringing before I even bought the ticket, alas my money and respect for
the film industry is now gone forever. What's even more painful is the
fact that Luc Besson is partly responsible for this mess, Luc Besson!
director and producer of some truly awesome films. Please don't see this film, please don't be 'Taken' in
