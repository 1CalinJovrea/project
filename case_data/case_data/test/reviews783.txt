An undeservedly-acclaimed torture flick

"American Mary" is the story of the medical student who is drawn into
the seedy underworld of illegal body modifications. Despite the praise
this film and its directors have received, it's a mess of lazy writing,
stale revenge-flick tropes, and predictable torture scenes.The first act is promising. Mary Mason is a medical student who is flat
broke, and goes to a strip club to apply for a sleazy but high-paying
gig that will keep her afloat while she finishes her medical degree.
When the mob boss running the club suddenly needs to prolong a
mutilated man's life, he enlists her help. Before long, Mary is getting
lucrative referrals for increasingly bizarre surgeries.Initially, the film appears to deliver on its promise. Katherine
Isabelle is convincing as a competent but vulnerable woman who is out
of her league. The narrative is smart and compelling. However, it does
not take long for the film to go off the rails and lose us completely. (SPOILERS FOLLOW)Mary is invited to a university faculty party where she is raped by a
trusted instructor. While many skilled writers and directors are able
to handle the subject matter of rape intelligently, here it's used as a
lazy plot device to get her to wholeheartedly turn evil and embrace a
life of crime. This new Mary dresses like a dominatrix, enjoys
inflicting pain, and revels in the criminal element which once
frightened her. It's a huge change brought about in an extremely
contrived manner, and it takes the audience out of a film in a way
which never allows us to fully return. Mary goes on doing more and more extreme surgeries, but there is
nothing really driving the film from this point on. The revenge on the
professor is dispensed with almost immediately. The story then plods on
with surgery after surgery and the occasional bout of vengeance, but we
already know how the story will end. There's no suspense, and we are
left to wait until the directors have decided that they are done with
us. The Soska Sisters have drawn acclaim for being a much-needed female
voice in the male-dominated horror genre. It is thoroughly undeserved.
Even if this film had not used rape as a plot device, there is nothing
here that hundreds of male directors could not have offered us. The
body modification horror is actually quite banal; we're supposed to be
shocked by suspension piercing, horns, and sub-dermal implants which
are actually completely legal and known to anyone familiar with the
real-world body-modification community. "American Mary" is the worst
kind of horror film, the kind that fails to shock, scare, or amuse its
audience.
