It's worth renting, but not a buy in my opinion.

10 Cloverfield Lane was a good movie, and definitely one I'd recommend.
Was I disappointed I didn't view it in the theater? No. 10 Cloverfield
Lane was a good late night movie full of some surprising twists. The
plot and pacing of the movie were very well done, but I felt the end
and some character arcs lacked a bit in detail. So to finish things
off, I decided to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a "Good" on theVade Review
Bar or an 7 out of 10. It's worth renting, but not a buy in my opinion.Read more at theVade.
