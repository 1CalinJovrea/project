Certainly pushes boundaries, Shows new look on life

Of the two competition films I saw in Cannes, this was luckily one of
them. If you enjoy foreign cinema at all you will likely find this
mesmerizing. I'm a straight male but I couldn't help but feel strongly
for the two women during this unconventional love story. I'll go ahead and let you know that the sex scenes are incredibly
graphic (though some have claimed they are unrealistic) and VERY long.
I didn't clock any of them but I'm pretty sure one of them is 15
minutes. So, fair warning.I'd recommend BItWC to anyone who didn't like Transformers 3 or Pirates
F-ing 17. Great acting. Great direction. Strong Story. Plus, it's the
Palm d'Or.
