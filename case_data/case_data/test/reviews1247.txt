Good Luck Chuck

From the first couple of minutes it's easy to tell that Don Mancini is
treating Curse more as a horror film than the previous couple of
entries in the series. The movie is shot and edited to build suspense
and is a world apart from the sitcom trappings of Seed.A girl in a wheelchair (Brad Dourif's hot daughter Fiona) living in a
rural home with her troubled mother receives a mysterious package one
afternoon. It's Chucky, and he's somehow managed to get himself in the
mail again. He's arrived to settle a score, and soon enough he has
brainwashed a child into keeping his secret and is sneaking about in
the shadows offing unsuspecting victims.Many people are saying that this movie is a return to form, and that it
retcons Bride and Seed out of existence. Er...no, the film very much
DOES acknowledge the events of Bride and Seed. Even if you paid the
bare minimum of attention it would be hard to not to realize this. But
I guess that expecting the movie to go in a different direction only
led to further surprises when it eventually did tie in to the previous
movies as well as giving us more back-story to Charles Lee Ray.I was worried that Chucky would be all CGI as Kevin Yagher has not been
involved with the series since Bride, and while there IS some CGI, he's
anamatronic for the most part. Instead of hogging the camera though he
keeps quiet watches the humans interact for about half the movie before
unleashing toy terror. Horror composer Joseph LoDuca delivers a
pastiche of the Renzetti, Revell, and Donaggio's efforts without giving
Curse a signature sound of its own. Not really a complaint, but more of
a missed chance.It's certainly a worthy sequel and a can be viewed as a genuine horror
film without any of the guilty pleasure of Seed. Keep watching to the
end of the credits for a further surprise that ties the series together
even more (though it does contradict the closing scene before the
credits actually roll).
