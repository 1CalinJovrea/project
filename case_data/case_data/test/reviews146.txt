Fun movie for kids and adults

I'm a big Universal Horror and Hammer Horror fan, but my 5 year old son
is obviously a bit young to experience Dracula, The Mummy, The
Invisible Man and Frankenstein in their true form, so it's great that a
lighthearted movie has finally been released that kids can check out. I
was a bit worried that my 5 year old would be a bit scared by some of
the scenes, but this movie is totally kid safe. The scariest thing that
happens is a couple of loud screams and some glowing red eyes. No
problem.Adam Sandler does a great job as the voice of Dracula. Not too over the
top and constantly delivering some great lines. Andy Samberg and Selina
Gomez (surprisingly) both do a great job as Jonathan (nice touch) and
Mavis respectively. I also loved Steve Buscemi as "Wayne".
Unfortunately Fran Drescher who can usually deliver some sharp witty
comedy isn't allowed to shine as her jokes throughout the film have
been done to death and didn't bring much to the film at all. There are some great hidden jokes/sight gags, and some beautiful
animation and character designs that will please old school horror fans
and adults, but the only part that I found utterly cringe worthy was
the end scene with Dracula rapping (even after his joke about
Twilight!) Hey, gotta please the kids somehow...
