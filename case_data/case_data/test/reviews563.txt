Plain boring and horrendous

I started watching this movie with high hopes considering it was the
work of David O. Russell (who has made some great movies) and highly
praised stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro (my favorite actor
of all time), and Bradley Cooper. Unfortunately, after the first thirty
minutes or so I lost all my hope... it seemed like a childish movie
made by an amateur film-maker!The script was utterly immature. The main message of the movie was
female empowerment, a cause worthy of fighting for and to which I say
kudos; however, it was represented in the most childish way. Let me
give you an example: "You are going to grow up and be a strong, smart
young woman. Go to school meet a fine, young man. Have beautiful
children of your own. And you're gonna build wonderful things that you
do in your room." Sounds like an advice a 14-year-old, obnoxious,
recently-turned-feminist girl would give! Furthermore, the story was completely disoriented and difficult to
follow. One doesn't even know how time passes in the movie! I mean
after Joy grows up there's clearly some significant passage of time,
judging from some of the major occurrences (for instance grandmother
dying, etc.), yet the movie gives absolutely no information about it. I
was also bothered when the narrator of the story died in the middle of
the story, nevertheless still miraculously narrated the events after
her death... this is what I call 'posthumous narration' -- yep, seems
legit!The directing was so horrendous it gave me a freaking migraine! Very
rarely one can find a scene in this movie in which the camera is
actually stable. I don't oppose to a fluent type of camera movement but
in this case it was a continuous, subtle, yet super annoying jerky
motion that went on and on and on...Moreover, there are certain scenes in which the acting is incredibly
fake. For example, the scene in which Joy walks out of the garage just
before releasing her anger by shooting -- never seen this fake of an
acting from Jennifer Lawrence before. (I kind of think it's a directing
problem though, considering the high level acting Jennifer Lawrence can
perform, the director could have and should have repeated that scene)In conclusion, the movie was disappointingly weak and boring. I
certainly do not recommend it.
