Intense Film

This film was amazing. The cast, director, and cinematographer are top
notch. It will surely be nominated for several Oscars. I had a chance
to view it during a Film Festival and was excited that I got a ticket
to this sold out showing. But then, halfway through the movie, I nearly
walked out. The outrageous, violent, destructive behavior of the characters and
between the characters hit a little too close to home for my comfort.
For those who think the actions of the characters seem over the top,
let me assure you they are not. When you mix addiction, lies, and a
lifetime of pain, you get exactly this type of toxic concoction. I required multiple tissues to get me through to the end, but
ultimately I stayed (as a film lover, I could not bring myself to walk
out of such a wonderfully crafted movie). I'm glad I did.
