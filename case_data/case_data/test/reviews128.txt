Matthew McConaughey Deserves His Oscar

In 1985, in Dallas, the homophobic electrician and rodeo rider Ron
Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is a smoker and cocaine and alcohol user
that frequently has sex with hookers and promiscuous women. When he
faints in his trailer, he is sent to the hospital where Dr. Sevard
(Denis O'Hare) and Dr. Eve (Jennifer Garner) tell him that he is HIV+
and will die within thirty days. Ron also meets the travesty Rayon
(Jared Leto) that is drug addicted that also has the disease. Ron does not accept the diagnosis since he is not homosexual but a
couple of days later he realizes that the diagnosis may be accurate. He
researches about the disease and learns that AZT might be lethal for
infected people. Further, he discovers that in Mexico there is a doctor
with revoked license named Vass (Griffin Dunne) that uses alternative
drugs in the treatment of AIDS. Ron improves his healthy and decides to
sell the drugs in Dallas. He makes a partnership with Rayon and soon he
creates the Dallas Buyers Club, where the memberships pay four hundred
dollars per month to have the necessary drugs. But the FDA does not
accept his research and he is oppressed by the authorities. "Dallas Buyers Club" is a great movie based on the true story of a
terminal man infected by HIV+ that fights against the system to prolong
his and his clients' lives using drugs not accepted by the FDA. Matthew
McConaughey deserves his Oscar and it is impossible to recognize Jared
Leto, also awarded with an Oscar. The story also denounces the
participation of the pharmaceutical industry and doctors in the United
States of America using unethical procedures to test and sell their
drugs. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Clube de Compras Dallas" ("Dallas Buyers Club")
