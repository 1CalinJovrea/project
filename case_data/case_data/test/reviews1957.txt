Really opens your eyes too the truth

This movie has seriously shaken me. Like just wow. It holds such an
important message and even doe the animal is fictional, the story is
not. This happens right now all around the world. And I for once am not
gonna stand for this. This movie has opened my eyes even wider too the
truth. And from now on, I have decided that the food I eat is not
sympathizing the brutality and cruelty towards animals. And I really do
hope that people will take this matter much more serious than they do
now.
