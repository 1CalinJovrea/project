Awful

I cannot believe I spent money to watch this movie in the cinema, this
movie was awful. I went into the cinema expecting a comedy, but it
turned out I actually went in to see an emotional character development
journey with Zac Efron. It honestly was not worth it, all the funny
parts of the movie can be seen in full in the trailers. I would rate
the trailers 10/10 as they actually fooled me into thinking that this
would be a good movie.
