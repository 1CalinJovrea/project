Terrible

The story: the government of Britain is going to wage war and wreak
havoc on one of its colonies until the heroic American saves the day!
Seriously, it's that stupid.The fact that this terrible movie shares the same name as the
mysterious and intriguing Schwarzenegger/Stone film of 1990 is an
absolute insult. There is no suspense, mystery, or intrigue in this
version of Total Recall. Both the central character and certainly the
audience pretty well know the real situation from the beginning. So,
rather than sharing in the doubts of the central character who, in the
1990 original, isn't sure what is real and what isn't, we instead
simply get formulaic action mixed with a bit of romance. So, don't
forget your barf bag if you dare see this abysmal stink-bomb. This
movie is an insult to everyone's intelligence.
