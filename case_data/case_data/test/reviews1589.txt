Depressing, pretentious, and over indulgent!

Depressing...the main character is a major loser...I don't blame people
for not wanting to be around him...all of his troubles are his own
fault...he is indeed, as one of the characters call him, creepy.
Despite the previews, there is nothing funny in this film...it is one
of the most depressing films of the year.Pretentious...remember the plastic bag floating in the air in "American
Beauty"? Well, if you like that then there will be several scenes you
will absolutely enjoy with this film! Hmmm...staring at oil stains on
the ground? Watching steam arise from a manhole cover? They come on as
non-sequiturs but I am sure the director was making what he probably
considers a great statement.Over-indulgent...2 hours long! There is a scene where "sex" takes place
between he and "her" and the screen goes black and SILENT for what
feels like TWO minutes. It was an awkward moment sitting in the theater
with nothing happening on the screen! Also, after about 75 minutes, the
ending seems to be in reach but the director drags the story on for
another 45 minutes!
