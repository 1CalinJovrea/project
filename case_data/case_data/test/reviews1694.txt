Awesome

I thought this movie handled teenage romance, chemistry, nervousness,
perhaps actual first time sex, really well. If it's truly the first
time for both kids..it can be weird and confusing. I especially enjoyed
the music and can't find a soundtrack. :( I thought the characters were
original. The conversation between the 3 guys was not untypical of what
I had with my buddies back in the day...long ago. The one scene where
the guy yells back at them "what's wrong with you assholes..." wasn't
really a necessary scene. It appeared the director just forgot to drop
that on the floor. However, it would have been nice to have seen a
little more interaction between Dave and Aubrey..like the theories he
talked about and the discussions he was referring to. Still I'm 52 and
I watched it with my teenagers and we all loved it.
