Solidly engaging film may leave you with a couple of questions after its over, but Hathaway and Sudekis do terrific work

Attended a preview screening of this courtesy of a friend the other
night with zero idea of what the movie was about so imagine to my
surprise that it was a wry take on a Godzilla movie but with a
seriously intriguing and rather perplexing narrative hook. If you're
reading this right now, you're either deciding whether to see this, or
you've already seen this and are looking for opinions on what other
people thought. Without spoiling anything I'll just say that i thought the director
(who also wrote the script) does an impressive job of keeping you into
the story being told, and just slightly off track as to what's around
the bend story wise. There were a couple times watching this where I
thought i knew where the story was going to go, but ended up being
somewhat off the mark. As the movie kept going I also started to wonder
how the heck the director was going to bring this thing to a satisfying
ending, and the answer to that question was with a fantastic climactic
sequence that i very much liked watching unfold but didn't quite hit
the mark in terms of satisfying to me, but somehow still felt quite
right in keeping in tone with what we had been watching the whole time. So basically i'm just saying--its worth checking out but with some
slight reservations about the story as it unfolded. (I personally
thought the big reveal about the origins of the monster's appearance
was a little too symbolic and mystical and out of the blue, but other
people might like how its explained)All that said, the main concept of the movie i thought was pretty
superb, and I thought Anne Hathaway in a kind of role we rarely if ever
see her play was excellent and does a tremendous job in a very
difficult role. If you don't like her, you'll end up hating the movie
because she is a very large component of the movie. I thought even tho
her character is aimless, she did a terrific job of keeping her likable
throughout, even when you're kind of cringing at some of the decisions
she makes on screen. Similarly, i thought the performance of Jason
Sudekis was also surprisingly good. He starts out the film the way you
normally see him in films, as the seemingly good hart-ed, wry, slightly
bumbling slob, but as the story unfolds and he gradually starts to
change those very qualities ever so subtly, it may not be til very late
in the film or possibly thinking about it on the way home that you
realize how strong a job he did as well playing opposite Hathaway. (Dan
Stevens for the record has a very smallish part so if you're going to
see this specifically for him, you might be disappointed) In closing i'll just say that if you already know the premise to the
film and are wondering whether or not its for you, I'll just say that
if you like slightly out there premises, you should check this out
because overall despite again some narrative choices I might not have
been too crazy about, i thought it was a very solidly engaging movie,
and for what its worth, I didn't think it was too strange to appeal to
people who think that this may be too far out there for their comfort
zones/slightly more mainstream tastes.
