Nothing In the movie?

So I've taken enough theater classes to know that a movie should have
a, Plot, Climax, and a ENDING.This movie has NONE of those. I'm a huge Bourne fan and was anxious to
see the Jeremy Renner try to take on the new role of the hero in this
movie. The acting in this movie was good, but the writers stunk! There
was NO PLOT, no CLIMAX, and NO ENDING. It was a huge disappointment to
me and I would not recommend wasting your time or money on it. Although
if you like movies that are two hours long with NOTHING going on in
them, then this might be the one for you. Another thing that upset me
was that Aron Cross seemed to have a small goal or no goal at all in
the ENTIRE movie! I'm not sure who directed this movie but they did an
EXTREMELY poor job.
