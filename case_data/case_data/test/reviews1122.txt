True to Stine and fun for kids, parents should like it too

Anyone who was a kid or had a kid over the past twenty years knows what
Goosebumps are, and R.L. Stine finally gets an upgrade from the small
screen to a major motion picture by Sony Pictures, and we're satisfied.A teenage boy Zach and his mom move to Delaware, where Zach promptly
runs into his next door neighbor Hannah and her odd father. When Zach
thinks Hannah is in danger, he springs to be savior, but things aren't
quite what they appear. Her dad is hiding a secret, and when Zach and
his new friend Champ disregard the father's warnings, amazingly scary
things come to life.Goosebumps the film is made for the kids, this isn't the type of film
that is trying to bridge the age gap at being universally beloved.
Lucky for the film, its makers know their market and the children in my
theater loved it, and for this kid at heart, we liked it too.One of the smartest decisions the filmmakers made in making an R.L.
Stine film adaptation of the beloved book series Goosebumps was casting
Jack Black as the token 'adult' in the film. While we know Black has
aged in real life, he is one of the few men in Hollywood who hasn't
lost his wonder, and that transcends the big screen. He may put on a
funny accent for the role of R.L. Stine but he has the right sentiment
and that is obvious to audience members.The rest of the cast is equally wholesome and approachable, with each
of the three teens (Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush and Ryan Lee) being
equally effective in their roles. The characters they portray aren't
anything extraordinary or new, but they are archetypes we know and
enjoy. The stand out among the three would be Odeya Rush and scenes
where the kids are interacting with one another.Goosebumps does one thing that we wish would've been a bit bolder, and
that is stray away from the horror and air more on the side of family
adventure comedy. It's like Jumanji with zombies instead of a stampede
of African wildlife. And that is also where it loses points for
originality, as adult film goers will see the same plot line in a
different skin, which is a tad disappointing for something as creative
as the Goosebumps book series.There are scares, especially for those ages 12 and under, almost all
'jump scares' of the fun variety. And that is the type of tone
Goosebumps is aiming for, fun and entertaining. Of course, being a fan
of the series when I was a kid, I hoped for the creatures from the
pages of the books to be a bit more eerie, but alas.Anyone who says this film is a complete disappointment must have lost
their inner child ages ago. They are probably the type that says Santa
Clause doesn't exist either or that monsters under the bed aren't real
Â– and we all know those things are true. Goosebumps gets our seal of
approval for popcorn, feet up, enjoyment.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent
