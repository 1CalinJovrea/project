If You Don't Like Post Apocalyptic Fiction You Won't Like This

This gritty low budget thriller came and went with very little fanfare
. It was only through a favoured genre film website that I knew of its
existence and made a point of tracking it down because the premise
intrigued me . With hindsight I can understand the reason for its
obscurity since it is something of a bugger to market . Social
Darwinism in action where only the most ruthless have any chance of
survival . Add to this a slow , low key pace with little dialogue with
no musical soundtrack and you realise it's not something that's going
to sell out the multiplex . That said the Brits probably do this type
of sub-genre better than anyone else and it's a type of premise that
makes this audience member appreciate what a wonderful and fragile
thing civilisation is . Any story that makes the audience think can
only be a good thing can't it ? That said I wasn't entirely convinced by the cause of the apocalypse .
Oil production ceases meaning the end of the world ? Not entirely sure
if that's credible . In the real world the oil price has collapsed in
the last few years and countries whose economies are dependent on it
has slumped . Also some of these countries such as Iraq and Syria have
been ravaged by ongoing civil wars yet these nation states will survive
the present hellish conditions and prosper - hopefully with truly
pluralist democratic governments - in the future . There's also the
aspect common in the medium that despite having the opening scene set
several years after the disaster it's only when the story starts that
pivotal incident seems to magically happen Writer/director Stephen Fingleton isn't too bothered about the cause
and concentrates more on the effects of this disaster . More
specifically he concentrates on character dynamics of a mother and
daughter trying to find sanctuary in the refuge of a man who knows what
it takes to survive and survival comes at a heavy and harsh price . One
noticeable thing Fingleton acknowledges in this post apocalyptic world
is that concepts like menstruation and unwanted pregnancy still exist ,
which is not something that's usually touched upon in these type of
stories . Fingleton doesn't have to do much to create a bleak ,
desolate and if you've seen the director's short film SLR from a few
years ago you'll notice has a talent for creating a gloomy atmosphere
out of everyday landscapes It's not a perfect film and I constantly found myself wondering why it
only seems to be the three lead protagonists/antagonists who are
seemingly capable of speech . If I remember correctly there are only
five speaking parts in the entire movie . Some people will also find
the dark subject matter just a little bit too disturbing and depressing
to make it to the end of the movie . Despite this divisive tone if you
appreaciate the end of the world type movies that doesn't involve
armies of CGI zombies you'll find a lot to respect here
