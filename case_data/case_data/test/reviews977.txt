Good film with superb acting, awesome screenplay n excellent cinematography.

Saw this on a rented DVD. Its a western crime drama. Director David
Mackenzie (Starred up) did a terrific job. It is a very atmospheric,
character driven film n not at all boring. Taylor Sheridan (Sicario)
did a fantastic job with the screenplay. He managed to create good
tension in a simple robbery film. The acting by the 3 lead is top
notch. Jeff bridges, Ben Foster n Chris Pines got into the characters.
Its a solidly crafted, well-acted western heist thriller. The film
stuns with its cinematography. The sunburnt desolate Texas backdrop
creates a very nice visual palette. The colours look great. The lime
green Mustang really stands out as a result. The long landscapes shots
were awesome. Some may compare it to No country for old men n A place
beyond the pines. Check out the scene of the rattlesnake waitress.
