Cute and Charming

In Chicago, Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) have just
married and they are in love for each other. In a snowing night, they
have a car accident and Paige has a serious head injury and stays in
coma. When she awakes, she has partial recollection of her life until
five years ago and she does not recognize Leo.Her estranged parents Rita (Jessica Lange) and Bill Thornton (Sam
Neill) use the unusual situation to bring Paige back home. Leo decides
to woo her again to have his wife back, but her ex-fianc√© Jeremy (Scott
Speedman) is courting Paige and she does not know why she had broken
with him."The Vow" is a cute movie based on a true story. The cast is great,
with Jessica Lange, Sam Neill and Scott Speedman in supporting roles.
The charming Rachel McAdams performs a character that had completely
changed her personality from a silly Valley girl dominated by her
wealthy parents to a cool artist, but after the accident she returns to
her previous behavior; however the role of Leo deserved a better actor.
My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Para Sempre" ("Forever")
