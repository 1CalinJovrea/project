don't cyber bully or you'll die

Unfriended is a new form of horror kind of like found footage but it
did please me as a film. The story is very simple an old school mate
kills herself due to cyber bullying and in person and some how haunts
the people some what responsible for causing her to kill herself. This
may have not been the greatest horror film but it is very well done. It
feels grounded and real as the whole movie takes place all over a
computer screen and they product place almost everyone to facebook,
google, and apple. But the best thing is that it doesn't use the fake
Hollywood kind of computer screen placement stuff its actually how you
would do stuff on the computer. But the story is very basic and new
aged almost a new breed. My fear is that new movies will come out like
this and they may make a sequel to this because it may actually make
some money. My biggest problem with this is the adult supervision and
something else isn't explain about the killings but I'm not going to
spoil it. But in all honesty i thought this movie was going to be crap
but it wasn't to bad and very funny at times.
