Joss Wheddon dared to be different...and different he gave us.

After the opening title, we are thrown into the social standard of the
guts and glory horror we all know and love. Five friends decide to
drive their van out to an abandoned cabin in the woods and along the
way they come across a creepy old man at a run down petrol station;
nothing could go wrong right? And what would a stereotypical horror
scenario be without with out it's clich√©'s characters; the stoner; the
jock; the nerd; the popular girl and the virgin - well, sort of. Much
to the hilarity of the film the group do just about everything you
shouldn't do when in a creepy cabin; which results in them fighting for
there lives when suddenly under attack from bombarding creatures of the
night.As for the rest of the plot, it's pleasantly far from what you would
normally expect; and balances out stunningly between a well mixed
cocktail of classic horror and laugh out loud humor. Seeing how I'm
still traumatised from when people told me the ending from The Sixth
Sense, don't expect me to tell you what happens in the rest of the
movie - of course, aside from the killer unicorn.If you look around on the internet really closely, you will notice it's
the highest rated Horror Movie for the past 7 years since The Descent.
You will never see another Horror Movie like this...EVER...PERIOD! In
the large array of god-awful horror films to be recently brought out
onto the big screen and direct to DVD/Blu Ray, The Cabin In The Woods
is a refreshingly needed milestone to the long drying out horror genre.
Aside from the somewhat awkward and pretentious cameo from Sigourney
Weaver, The Cabin In The Woods is a deliciously bloody, funny, well
acted, all round brilliantly written and directed satire of the horror
genre. This is the Casablanca of movie spoofs and whether you are a fan
of horror or not, this is not to be missed.10/10
