Complete waste of time - too much glorification of Xander Cage

There is no story build up in this movie - and the action scenes are
unbelievable ~ aka too many bulls#it and impossible unrealistic
sequence. The "glorification of Xander Cage" is way too arrogant to a
point that your passion and interest for the character simply fades
away.After the movie, I have less respect for the character that Vin Diesel
plays. If you are the type that likes to watch the action sequences;
you might enjoy this.
