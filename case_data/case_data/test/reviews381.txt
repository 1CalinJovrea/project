The hard side of life:  how honest is your government ? Imagine the early days of AIDS

I generally think McConoughey had become a bit too self absorbed. This
movie, however, does validate my belief that he wants to do valid,
absorbing film, whether comedic or serious. The storyline is - without
spoiler - simply the early days of AIDS. The fears, the rumors, the
medical community's stalwart continuation of using the victims as test
subjects without real concern or commitment to resolution in many
cases. Based on a true story, I recommend you watch the film for the
period boldness, the two primary characters' acting, the sad part or
directing which put a talented actress in a bad light. The person on
whom the story is based is but one of us and we all have a story to
tell. It's magnificent that someone read the Desiderata and determined
to tell his story, which is worthy of your open minded, compassionate
viewing. His daughter found it to be very real and her story about her
father is worth looking up after you watch.
