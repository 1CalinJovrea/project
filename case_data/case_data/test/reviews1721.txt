Bourne Identity remake with a sci/fi twist; the Bourne franchise deserves better

Jason Bourne is one of the more intriguing film characters of the past
decade. He methodically and purposefully found out who he was, who was
responsible for his condition, and attempted to bring everything back
together again. Even better, he was not a superhero; Jason was just a
guy who went through a lot of training. He is elite, but deep down he
is still one of us. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on the other hand, has
been tweaked a little bit. He pops pills to up his physical and mental
skills. Yes, he is still human too, but perhaps a bit genetically
modified. This splash of sci/fi does not help an audience tuned in to
the adventures of Jason Bourne connect with the new guy.When I first heard there was another Bourne installment, this time
without Matt Damon, I figured someone either wrote a good script to
carry on a new story line, or the studio wanted to churn out a
guaranteed cash cow under the title of a proved and successful action
series. Writer/director Tony Gilroy wrote the scripts for the first
three Bourne films, but this is his first time behind the camera in the
series. He successfully directed Michael Clayton and the under-
appreciated Duplicity, but now the magic is gone. The Bourne Legacy is
stale. Enduring a painfully slow beginning, The Bourne Legacy reveals it is
set at the same point in time as The Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, if you
have forgotten the plot points and supporting characters of the
previous film, take the time to either watch it again or read about it
online before heading into the new feature. Jason Bourne's escapades
have thrown multiple CIA operations out in the open and the shadowy
powers are frantically trying to sweep them under the rug before either
Congress or the press start asking questions. Eric Byer (Edward Norton)
orders the termination of Project Outcome, the new series of super
agent represented by Aaron Cross. Instead of telling the agents to pack
up and go home, the CIA chooses to assassinate them instead. Oh, and
they try to wipe out all of the scientists who made them so super in
the first place.Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is one of those scientists seeking
ways to alter chromosomes to make a more perfect human. After surviving
annihilation himself, Aaron conveniently scoops the good Dr. out of
harms way which sets up an 'us against them' theme quite similar to the
one you remember from The Bourne Identity. Unfortunately, The Bourne
Legacy noticeably lacks the quality script and thrilling action
sequences of that first film. The chase scenes in the new film are
edited so atrociously, especially during motorcycle elements, that they
are almost impossible to logically follow. You know they are weaving in
and out of traffic, there are near misses, and flying bullets; but
there are only quick glimpses of that on the screen in the midst of the
unsteady camera work and split-second jump cuts.The Bourne Identity also had a mystery to unravel and wandered around
the world trying to find out who was behind the curtain. There is no
curtain now, Edward Norton is pulling the strings in plain sight using
all of the means in the intelligence community he can lay his hands on.
There are armed Predator drones, devious mop-up CIA killing squads, and
even a possible super- duper agent; imagine the Schwarzenegger
Terminator battling the new T-1000. Renner and Weisz do their best to remake a film which was already
pretty great. Yes, they have new names and faces, but they are running
from the same agency, dodging the same bullets, but this time they have
a higher chromosomal level on their side. The Bourne Legacy will be
known as that film which derailed the very respectable Bourne
franchise. Paul Greengrass, the director of The Bourne Supremacy and
The Bourne Ultimatum, was correct when he said any further film would
feel like The Bourne Redundancy.
