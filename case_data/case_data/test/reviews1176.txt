This is a Film with a capital "F"

I've been an IMDb user for several years. Still, this is my first
review. After watching this Film, I just felt the urge to praise it. So here it
is: thanks to the writer, director, actors and all those who created
this masterpiece. It really has the power to convey real feelings to
the watcher. Even though I kept telling to myself it was just a movie,
it still made me care for the characters.It's a shame that such Films are not promoted as they should be. I am
so sorry I had no idea about Danish cinematography until now. This
movie will make stay alert for any new Danish production and look for
older ones in a desperate try to recover what you could've experienced
instead of all the commercial movie offer of Hollywood.
