An intriguing and diverse journey

In an attempt to give away as little as possible about this film,
obviously so that you can enjoy all of the phases as I was able to do,
I would like to simply highlight my opinion about this movie. It was a
great film and was very entertaining. I'd recommend you take a chance
and go see this film. Expect some theatrical diversity and in the end
it all comes back full circle.I have nothing negative to say. The acting was mature and accurate.
Each character was playing a role that suited their own set of talents
superbly.Try not to read too many reviews and just go and see this movie. You
will not be disappointed.
