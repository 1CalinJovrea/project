well done - but propaganda like

The film is actually well done. Quite Thrilling. Characters are well
played and the story is based on real facts. The storyline is a bit
simple but well organized: First a prequel: You get background information about the two main
characters, a Somali pirate and a cargo ship captain. Both "getting to
work" an are boarding their ships. First Chapter: Cargo ship is
running. Some security checks are made. Everithing is getting more and
more exciting. Then a first and a second showdown, where the pirates
are trying to enter the ship. Second Chapter: About what is going on
after the boarding of the pirates. A nice "hide-and-seek" play between
both party's. With a showdown at the end ones more. Third Chapter:
Hostage drama on a lifeboat. A good and a bad Somali guy. US Army and
Navy Seals involvement and final showdown. If you do not care about any message the Films is transmitting,
everything works fine. But if you do, the film appears to you like just
one more of these unacceptable American propaganda movies. The good
guys are winning, the navy seals are the heroes. "Justice" is given.
Some small hints about the situation of Somali guys to reassure the
good intentions of the director: in one or two sentences it is stated
that fishing-crawlers are making everybody jobless in Somalya. Thats
all. The pain and problems of Somalian populations, the involvement of
US foreign policy in "failed state" areas like Somalia. The enormous
impact of US (and other rich countries) fish-crawlers for the
population and the wast problematic (horn of Africa is one of these
wast-disposal sites). All these kind of scandalous stuff is not really
treated. The image of Africans is something like a unscrupulous self
destroying, non-rational horde with a touch of pity. But America is
performing his world-police-job with accuracy. Until the last shot....
in my opinion all this smells quite Stereotyped and propaganda like. I'm happy to see that filmmakers from the southern hemisphere are
getting more and more involved in these kind of topics. "Timbuktu" is a
good example. Even if Timbuktu lacks a bit the suspense of a Hollywood
movie....
