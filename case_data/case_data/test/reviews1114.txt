Avoid it if you can!

Just because it's a comedy doesn't mean it needs to resort to name
calling or poor attempts to make you laugh. There are still people who
can enjoy an intelligent joke without being exposed to ridiculous and
nonsensical situations. "Bachelorette" is simply a waste of time. It's gross, tasteless and
full of dead-end scenes that seemed to be shot just to fill a blank
because the inspiration must have run out. But then you wonder: why try
to revive something that is already dead from the very beginning? I
still can't get over the fact that I sat through this painful
experience. Avoid it if you can.
