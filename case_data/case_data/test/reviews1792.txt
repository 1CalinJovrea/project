A great suspense story, with a standout performance by Mr McEvoy

A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of
his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve
what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could
have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his
bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no
matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep
surprising but he takes it to another level here. I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except
to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense
and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't
like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge
of your seat in more of a suspense mode. I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in
the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to
any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his
more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really
work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often
look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his
films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded
and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say
is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and
see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those
reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is
more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower
budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth
the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a
decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such
resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy
she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the
threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.
