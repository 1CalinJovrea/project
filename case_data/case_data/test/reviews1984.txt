not a movie it's an acting clinic

Look at the producer credits and you will see some of the biggest names
in the biz. Which is of course a pre-requisite to get some of the
biggest names in front of the camera too. Bale, as much a chameleon as
an actor. Harrelson who does bad guys and sociopaths so well he should
trademark it. Shepard? There was a time you could build an entire movie
around this guy, he was testosterone on wheels. Ditto for Whitaker and
Dafoe, if you print off their IMDb credits, have an extra laser
cartridge handy, because you will run out. Affleck is young but he's a
comer. He has already done some extraordinary work especially in KILLER
INSIDE ME. He is not there for the second half of the film (spoiler)
but his portrayal is haunting. So, that said, is this film a keeper?
It's slow. Parts of it are like watching paint dry. It is possible to
be hypnotically interesting (because of the acting) and yet plodding
(because of the script and the direction). I loved it, but I am a film
guy. As a revenge flick, it has issues. TAKEN it ain't. So bottom line
it depends on what your expectations are...
