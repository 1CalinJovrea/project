The first contender on worst movie in 2017

This movie is awful, yes, there's the best way to describe this movie.Acting, terrible, the story does not make sense. The girl that's in the
trailer has no impact in the movie. It's once again just about sex and
a bad... really bad written movie.The soundtrack can be said that's decent. Some of the camera work as
well is good. But that resumes all the movie. It's once again a bait
for teenagers girls that want to go watch soft porn in the cinemas once
again.Sorry to be really straight to the point here, but if you really liked
this movie maybe you have some issues.. or it's me?
