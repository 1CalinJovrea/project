Silent chiller with great acting and an excellent premise.

'Hush' is a lot like 'The Strangers', except instead of strangers
plural it's only one man, and instead of a husband and wife being
terrorized it's a deaf and mute recluse. It's very tense and cleverly
written bar a few clich√© tropes that come with this kind of movie. It
also has a minimal synth score, something I notice more and more horror
movies are utilizing - 'You're Next', 'It Follows' - to give it an '80s
classic slasher atmosphere. It's hard to even call it horror though as
it offers far more thrills than actual scares. I was thoroughly
satisfied watching this movie. It's constantly engaging, and that has a
lot to do with the terrific performances of both the man and Maggie,
and there are a few scenes that are genuinely depraved and chilling. It
doesn't break any new ground, but following 'The Babadook' and 'It
Follows', 'Hush' continues to reinspire the subtle, quiet corner of the
genre and bodes well for the future of psychological thrillers. Highly
recommended.
