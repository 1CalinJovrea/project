brightly-colored action adventure

It's WWII London. Peter (Levi Miller) was left by his mother on the
doorstep of the Home for Boys and he's still waiting for her to return.
Kids have been disappearing. One night, pirates come to take Peter and
his friends away. Pirate leader Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) has enslaved
the boys to mine Pixum, fairy dust, and looking to wipe out all
fairies. Peter is made to walk the plank and discovers that he is able
to fly. He escapes from Blackbeard with the help of James Hook (Garrett
Hedlund) and Smiegel. They are captured by Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara).
Recognizing the pan necklace from his mother, she reveals that Peter's
mother is Blackbeard's possession Mary. She had fallen in love with the
fairy prince and he is the child of their love.I really like the start of this movie. Peter Pan is brash, mischievous
and heroic. I even like transferring the story to WWII which allows for
a fun dogfight in the skies of London. Then the movie goes to Neverland
and the problems start to pile up. I also like the wild colorful action
extravaganza. It does get repetitive during the climatic action scene
but the exuberance fits Neverland.For some reason, the story forces Peter to turn into a self-doubting
taciturn. The flying story really hurts Peter's character development.
He turns into non-Peter Pan and not even the same character from the
first act. Blackbeard is a black-feathered peacock. He's not scary
enough. Garrett Hedlund is not flamboyant enough to be Hook. Rooney
Mara is perfectly fine as an action heroine but her pale white skin is
really distracting. They may as well paint her face as some kind of
warpaint like the Maori war paint. Her pale skin is too old Hollywood.
I can see a wild Peter Pan movie being made here but the little
problems overwhelm it.
