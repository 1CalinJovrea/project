So boring, so awful

The movie starts out very slow with a stag hunt and soon after it is
revealed that Hunnam's has no medals or privileges besides rank for his
many years of service in the British Army. The British "accent" he uses
makes Costner's in Robin Hood seem Oscar worthy. He is offered a job as
a cartographer to find the source of an Amazonian river. The act would
bring him the honor and prestige that he is seeking.Despite supposedly heading up river to the source, the travel in a
wooden raft with no propulsion and travel downstream. The small vessel
does not seem to have any supplies loaded on it at all. The journey is
supposed to take over a year, yet Hunnam's facial hair does not grow at
all, despite his crew mates growth. Without provisions they try to fish
the river, which is seemingly overrun with piranhas with no other fish
to be found.At the source of the river they finally bring out their map making
equipment. They find some pottery from an ancient civilization and head
back, again downriver.Back in England he convinces a sponsor to send him back to find a city
of gold he calls Zed. During the return, again downriver, they are
attacked by natives who are soothed by a song to stop attacking.It all seems to get worse from there. The whole production was just so
boring and silly. The "climax" itself was so very expected and droll.I think that after this movie and the awful King Arthur flick, it
appears that Hunnam should have stuck to television, not be the lead,
or fire his agent.
