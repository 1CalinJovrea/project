It's OK to be different, it's OK to do your own thing.

Interesting how it worked out for Scarlett Johansson this year: first,
a voice-only role in 'Her,' then this one where she's highly visible
but says almost nothing. Merge the two, and you have a full-blown
talkie.Under the Skin is the sort of movie that gives critics a bad name,
because it's really good and they invariably love it and get perceived
as abstract art snobs. I too get annoyed with experimental movies that
try to seem profound by dumping a load of nonsense on the viewer and
counting on apophenia to do their job.However, there's a huge difference between deliberate obfuscation and
'show, don't tell,' and Under the Skin is a fantastic example of the
latter. It's bleak, quiet and depressing, and most people who see it
will probably hate it, but they should anyway, just to help them
realize how much redundant clap-trap there is in most of our movies.Under the Skin may not have a single line of exposition, but is easy to
follow. The story fits in a tag line: alien sex siren lures men into
its creepy lair and sucks out their essence; but somewhere along the
line, begins to have doubts.Much of it is shot documentary-style, with hand-held or concealed
cameras. ScarJo drives a rapevan around Glasgow, trying to pick up
stray men. She brings them back to a house, stripping slowly as they
hop after her on one foot to get their pants off. Once they're nude,
they sink into the ground without a trace.The movie switches between hidden camera footage, damp naturalistic
sweeps of forests and ocean waves, and nice non-representational
effects, like the opening where color beams and circles slowly morph
into a human eye, over strange disjointed vocalizations that bring to
mind a mollusc practicing English.While we're on the subject of English spoken by creatures it wasn't
meant for, the Scottish accents are insurmountable. It's like Britain's
Cantonese. And there are no subtitles. Typical dialog:ScarJo: "Do you live alone?"Guy: "Elxzap zlflasd opvejcf kljndjk gjsgs csdag."ScarJo: "That must be hard."Guy: "Akhadks lklsdgsga erlifsd, h aha."ScarJo: "Heh."Luckily, we're not missing much here - most of the talk in this movie
is the same kind of noise-making that goes on between couples in bars,
to fill up space while the real conversation goes on via body language
("You want to bang?" "Yes.")Why should you see this movie? Because it's really beautiful, shows you
visuals you've never seen before, tells a tragic mystery without
burying you in exposition, and holds an absolutely unselfconscious
confidence. It shows beauty and ugliness as a matter of fact, without
constantly checking to make sure we grasp which is which. It uses
special effects to quietly augment reality and paint the fantastic into
the corners of ordinary scenes. It may leave you weirded out and
uncomfortable, but if you're tired of noise and crave a film experience
that's tasteful, minimal and pure like a Tschichold book cover, run and
see it now now now.
