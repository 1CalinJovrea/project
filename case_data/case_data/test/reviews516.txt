Wishes it was Gremlins...fails miserably

I had high hopes for Krampus , but from the beginning I could tell it
would be way more cheesy than scary...boy was I right. I didn't find
one single scene creepy or scary and the character development was non
existent. The silhouette of Krampus with his devil horns looked pretty
good but later on all the buildup is destroyed as soon as you see his
face with his mouth open a foot wide just like every other CG monster
of the last 20 years. Yawn. As soon as the CG gingerbread men showed up looking like rejects from a
Pixar movie and sounding like Joe Dante's giggling GREMLINS I realized
I was watching something that should have been direct to DVD. It felt
like a made for TV kids fantasy movie. Instead of dread,chills, or even
the old standby GORE we get slapstick, unlikable characters, and evil
toys that look like rejects from a Puppet Master sequel. Michael
Dougherty should stick to writing crappy superhero scripts and stop
directing "horror" movies.
