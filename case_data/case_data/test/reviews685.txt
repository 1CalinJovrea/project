Brilliant Thriller!!!! Sub-Titles are your friend!

I wish I could convince more people to watch foreign films. This is
such an incredible psychological thriller!Right from the get go the movie grabbed my attention and it was a
thrill ride throughout the entire movie. The dark undertones of the
morgue leave a chilling feel. The movie kept me guessing on who I
should trust who who the real bad guy or good guy might be. Very
satisfied with the ending. Great ride start to finish!I'd love to see this re-made in Hollywood and shot scene for scene
(although they would still probably mess it up somehow!!)Right up there with the best thrillers Hollywood can put out.
