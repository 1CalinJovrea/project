Being Fooled is Part of the Fun

I read an article that said that, with Side Effects, Steven Soderbergh
wanted to return to the old suspense classics like Jagged Edge and much
of Hitchcock, psychological twisters that aren't made much anymore.I suspect that's because today people expect vampires, car chases or
buckets of blood to justify the price of a ticket. Well, I too remember
those old classics and I loved them. Side Effects is a worthy addition
but be warned that it's a thinking person's movie not a chainsaw caper.I'm surprised that so many people mention the twists and turns. Yes,
there are some but not that many and they're what makes it all so
fascinating. You think you know what's happening -- but you don't! What
I especially enjoyed was the gamesmanship the different characters
displayed. It's like a chess match with three people and more to
kibitz.And yet as we travel through the story, the surprising bits do make
sense and we wonder why we didn't think of those things before. We're
deep into the heart of mental illness and psychopathology. Almost every
character has secrets or hidden motives they would not like to see the
light of day. Although the main character seems at first to be the
troubled young wife, it becomes clear that it is Jude Law's character
as the shrink who is struggling to find the truth and do the right
thing.Just when you think everything that can go wrong for him has, the tide
begins to turn and it's Oh My Gosh. Just like a Hitchcock film, you
have a guy to root for and wonder how he will ever work his way though.
I expected a different -- more startling -- ending, but there is the
promise (perhaps?) of more horror to come.Yes, let's definitely have a sequel! Okay, Stephen?
