Good movie with poor advertising.

Great dynamic drama but absolutely is not a comedy.I got so much than I expected with this movie. For one, it was actually
good. The characters are all very deep and their story lines are compelling
and woven together with grace and skill. No character is a caricature
of themselves which I find rare in most films. The love and relationships play as legitimate and real. But this is not
at all a funny movie. It's amusing at times to be sure but comedy it is
not. If you want to laugh out loud, pick something else. If you want to
enjoy a surprisingly good drama, this is your film.
