Bullet Train Busan.

Talking to a fellow IMDber about what his top film of 2016 was,I got
told about a tantalising Korean Horror epic that he had seen at a film
festival. Deciding to hold a 2016 Horror double bill viewing this
weekend (with the other being the gritty Brit zombie title The Girl
with All the Gifts) I booked a ticket for the Busan train.The plot:Putting all his attention on work, Seok-Woo barely sees his daughter
Su-an.Sick of hardly seeing her dad,Su-an demands Seok-Woo to take her
to Busan,so that Su-an can spend her birthday with her mum/his ex-
wife. Taking it on the chin,Seok-Woo books the tickets for him and his
daughter. Just before the train departs,a convulsing women jumps on the
train.Noticing a large bite mark,Seok-Woo,Su-an soon find their
destination to change from Busan to a zombie apocalypse.View on the film:Spending (most) of a two hour running time on a train,writer/director
Sang-ho Yeon turns down a comfy seat to lay the track for a
white-knuckle ride. Drawn away from Anima for his live action
debut,Yeon & cinematographer Hyung-deok Lee brilliantly close the
passengers to the chaos on board with ultra-stylish claustrophobic
shots,which look from above at the limited room the passengers have for
zombie-free air. Mounting up the zombies,Yeon brilliantly chews
practical,in-camera effects with CGI shrieks,howling from Yeon keeping
the gore to a minimum,to instead carve out an anxiety-drench Horror
atmosphere,spun from the disturbing fast/slow spider-like movement of
the undead. Watching the world die out as they drive by,the screenplay by Yeon eats
up spectacular horror set-pieces with precisely hit personal human
tragedy. Taking pit stops on the way to the poetic final
destination,Yeon rolls the zombies in with piles of them darting all
over the empty stations,with the unlucky pick-ups the train makes
leading to some tasty shocks. Looking in at every carriage,Yeon
cleverly uses the sweet drama between Seok Woo and Soo-an (played by
the fantastic Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim) as a foundation to keeping a
close watch at how everyone on the other carriages fight to keep the
zombie train on track.
