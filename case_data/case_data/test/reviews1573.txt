Clever, but disingenuous

In the Lego Movie, and evil minifig named Lord Business has decided
that he is tired of all of the creative people messing around with his
stuff. He is already the most powerful creature in Legoland, but to
eliminate the chaos he has decided to end the world by gluing it in
place with the Kragle (actually a big tube of Krazy Glue). The
masterbuilders can only count on the "Special," a minifig destined to
save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle.
Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.The Lego Movie is a new twist on an old idea, what some critics would
call a dystopian science-fiction piece. These stared with George
Orwell's 1984 and have come to full fruition recently in the movies
with The Hunger Games. The purpose of these movies is to exaggerate
some aspect of our society, usually an oppressive government or
capitalist system, in order to "expose" it.In the case of the Lego Movie, it is entirely peculiar that the villain
is "Lord Business." After all, there are barely any better capitalist
ventures in the world than Lego, and this movie in particular has
already grossed $260 million. Making a boatload of money off of a
critique of Capitalism strikes me as a bit disingenuous.Nonetheless, one of the reasons for the big gross is that this movie is
actually pretty good. There's lots of laughs, great animation, even
interesting plot twists and some genuinely touching human drama. You
have to love a movie that gives prominent cameos to both Abraham
Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neal. Fair to say you are likely to be
entertained by this movie, and that is better that simply getting a
boring infomercial for Legos.The problem is that these guys are criticizing Lord Business all the
way to the bank.
