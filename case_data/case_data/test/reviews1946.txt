They need to stop making bucks off of these movies

The first Despicable Me I really enjoyed, the second one was okay but
not that great, the Minions one was mediocre, and this third one is
iffy. Despicable Me has also had shorts and I saw a few of them like
the House Makeover one, the Training Wheels one, and the one that
played before Secret Life of Pets. The Training Wheels one was okay,
the House Makeover one was pretty good, but the one that played before
Secret Life of Pets was sub-par.I think that they need to stop milking this franchise because
Despicable Me is just getting worse and worse with each movie and short
and from the cliffhanger in the end, I could tell that there's probably
going to be a fourth one about Dru's career as a villain. And what's
going to happen? Dru and maybe even Gru are going to meet their dad who
they haven't seen in a long time and maybe bring him into the family?
Are the girls going to find out that their biological parents abandoned
them and leave Gru to live with their parents? And what if they make a
T.V. series?None of the characters I thought were very good and are shadows of
their former selves. The new characters, Evil Bratt is obvious and Dru
is an unnecessary character, he caused trouble for Gru and doesn't even
know how to drive yet he has a car. Lucy is annoying with how
aggressive and hyper she acts and an unnecessary mom and teammate of
Gru and she and Gru are burdening a 6-year-old little girl with stuff
about work. Which I think is too much for a 6 year old to comprehend.
Not to mention, the kids act too precocious now. Like how could a
6-year-old girl know how to cook soup? She also sold her unicorn, well,
Despicable Me is dead now. Isn't she too young to be even thinking
about businesses anyway? And she adopts a goat? Why would she adopt a
wild animal? And the minions are now more annoying trouble-makers than
ever.There are too many popular songs in there. But I really loved the end
credits song. This movie is kind of like a rehash of Despicable Me 1,
2, and Minions. A villain causes destruction to the town towards the
end, the girls get kidnapped by the villain, and a boy falls in love
with Margo and even talks about getting engaged with her even though
they're too young. And he also does embarrassing things such as
smooching all over her.Edith's voice actor sounded a bit too old for her age.There are a few good things to say about this film, the action scenes
are alright, there were some heart-warming moments between Gru and Dru
and I like how they help each other, and I also like how they got three
different stories going on, one about Lucy and the girls, one about the
Minions, and one about Gru and Dru being spies. Agnes's new voice actor
did pretty good on her character and I think she sounds kind of like
Elsie Fischer, but I still miss Elsie Fischer's sweet, babyish voice
but she no longer has that voice.This movie was clich√©d, silly, cartoonish, predictable, slow, and
therefore boring. I barely laughed at even one part, the humor was
lowbrow and the dialogue foolish. And I can probably guess what the
fourth one is going to be about and that there may be a fifth one.
