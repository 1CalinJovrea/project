Sorry? Did I miss something?

How predictable was that?Seriously this movie was at best a 30 minute episode of a forgettable
TV series. The concept is stolen from and poorly developed into a
futuristic version of The Village. It was so clear from the the start
that the lead character(Jonas?) would be come a rebel and try to upset
the society.This future society is extremely simple in it's construction...oooh
everyone is assigned a role for life ...never heard that before!
Medication keeps peoples emotions in check, never heard that before.
Etc, etc.It's easy to be dropped several hundred feet into white water at the
foot of a large waterfall and then swim to safety while holding a new
born baby. Priceless. Ooops, small flaw, there is no swimming in the
future world so how did he know how to swim anyway.In the end I'm not even sure why I gave this a 3. How on earth does
this have 6.9 as a score?Seems like only Tom Cruise has access to original/interesting sci-fi
scripts these days.
