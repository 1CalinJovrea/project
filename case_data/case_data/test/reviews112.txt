Too much, too unbalanced and a waste of talent

I can't say I went in to the theater with high hopes. I did enjoy the
first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed
like a step up from "Spiderman 3", and Garfield felt way more natural
than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the
first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't
convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to
at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended
up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the
film. Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the
incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite
beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I
can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and
a blue electric guy.Oh Jamie Foxx, how did you go from Django to this? Before he goes all
CGI-Electro he tries to play the nerdy unseen scientist (with a worse
comb-over than Christian Bale's 'Hustle'-look). As Electro it's hard to
say how much is his fault, and what can be blamed on the rest, I'd go
with the rest. You don't sympathize with him nor do you believe how
fast he becomes this super-villain. Everything that Dane DeHaan did so well in "Chronicle" just feels
unnatural and (maybe not misplaced, but wrong) here. And his character
development is way too rushed and quite unnecessary for this film, it
just becomes another sub-plot standing in the way of what really
matters. Sally Field does good work as Aunt May, but leaves no lasting mark.
Paul Giamatti's Russian criminal is just in the way and only gives a
couple of dreadful and laughable scenes. And then there's the mad
German scientist named Kafka and I rest my case. The action and visuals isn't bad, but still doesn't make up for the low
"trying to be Marvel"-comedy and horrific soundtrack, a soundtrack that
almost itself destroys the film throughout the exhausting 142 minutes.
And sometimes it feels like the movie is taking us as an audience to be
stupid, with pointers to what is going to happen. I would like to say
that you might enjoy it if you just try and see it for what it is, but
it's hard, but hopefully possible! It had an interesting start, with a
glimpse inside the past and Peter's parents, but it's left
underdeveloped, as is almost everything else, to make room for all its
action and villains.It's amazing how the difference between two big-budget superhero-movies
can be so huge, if you put this against "Captain America: The Winter
Soldier", a great and, opposed to this one, original film. Oh how I wish that Marc Webb could have continued with a "(500) Days of
Summer"-esque movie instead, he could keep the sub-plots starring
Garfield, Stone and DeHaan, and it could very well be a great film, and
probably not such a waste of talent.
