Delightful 'Absurdist' Film -- Hathaway Soars

In my many of my prior reviews I have "beaten the drum" on one
particular theme -- namely, that back in the days before CGI and the
studios' ravenous hunger for new franchises to monetize indefinitely,
films worked based on the ability of the director and the stars to
"connect" with the audience.One word. Connection. But the implications can be astounding.Colossal, for example, reminded me of 1966's Georgy Girl, oddly also a
story about a young girl whose Life needs a complete remake, and she
more or less has to start over from scratch.Georgy Girl was a major hit in the 1960s -- without any sci-fi elements
or SFX -- because, somewhere around the 5 minute mark, everyone in the
theatre, even the guys, began to identify with the character. In other
words, connection. Once you have connection, anything is possible.Recommended. Sit back. Think of times in your own life when all four
wheels fell off the wagon. Enjoy it.And pay special attention to Hathaway's wonderful performance. For an
A-list star who was weaned in the Disney studio, and held her own
against Batman, she dons a hairdo that looks like it was done by a
local vet ... and then proceeds to sell the role so effectively that,
after a while, you honestly wonder if anyone else could have played the
lead?
