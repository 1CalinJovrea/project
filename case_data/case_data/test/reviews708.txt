The story failed the new concept of police robot.

The scrip is very illogical in the sense that it lacked common sense. I
mean, how could Deon not call the police when he had the chance to take
Chappie back? Really? A genius could not think of that? Where's the
security in Tetravaal? No cameras? How could Deon and Vincent slip away
with the key guard? Or whatever they called it. When Deon was shot, why
would they not go to the hospital instead of transferring his
consciousness? I mean that's where the first place to go.As for my review, there are many gaps and out of the context decisions
by characters in the story. Some may argue that this movie is
revolutionary in the sense that it goes away with the "mainstream
stories" and tackles rather "socio-political issues". But I've seen a
lot of movies like that, and they were not mediocre like what Chappie
movie shows. The story could have been better. I was expecting more of
"what would a human do" on several scenes rather than "how stupid can
human be".If the story was about corrupt government and society, well, it failed
to show it. Although it showed potential in giving a new taste of robot
police concept, the story failed it.
