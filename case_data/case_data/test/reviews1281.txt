Director fumbled this one

This is like a 5.7 out of 10 type of movie but I'm going round down to
a 4 out of 10 on the official score because the current score of 7.6 is
complete tomfoolery. Not sure why, what should be a drama is coming off
as a bad Saturday Night Live episode . This is my first time watching a
film directed by Clint Eastwood and I must say, I am seriously
disappointed. We all know this is a compelling story and the actors
involved have amazing acting clops but this comes off as a frat boy
movie or something. You have Tom Hanks playing the straight laced, by
the book dude and Aaron Eckhart playing his party animal side kick or
something. What should have been a drama turns into the wacky
adventures of an old goat and his crazy wingman bro with an epic
mustache. But yeah, they really dropped the ball concerning the real
story of Sully Sullenberger. After the whole "miracle on the Hudson"
deal Sully heavily advocated for pilots rights and fare pay. Most
people don't know this but some pilots get paid so little that they
actually qualify for food stamps. Anyway, this movie is subpar and not
as good as it could have been if a more competent director was on the
scene.
