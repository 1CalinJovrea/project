Well, they did it again,.. another soulless Star Wars screw up..

Review Context: I am a genuine Star Wars Fan. My ranking: 'Empire
Strikes Back' 1st. 'A New Hope' 2nd, 'Return of the Jedi' 3rd. All the
other Star Wars movies, including this one, right off the radar. This one, Rogue One?: Acting = 0 out of ten. 0.5 for the computer generated characters. Felicity Jones = minus 1000 out of ten. Why on earth did they put her
in it? Her acting is so bad she is simply unwatchable. Forest Whitaker must have caught something from the other actors,
because this was the worst I have seen him. What voice was that?
Breathing like Vader? What??Where is any of the Star Wars magic? None of the star wars movies
outside of the original trilogy even touch the same soul, and spiritual
mysticism, magic and excitement. This felt like a waste of time. I
could have written a better story and script myself. This was so
disjointed, no continuity, I squirmed and shuffled in my seat in agony. One blind dude who can sort of use the Force? What a bore. His acting
was almost as bad as Felicity Jones'. "I am one with the force.. nuh,
nuh, nerrr" no you're not. I couldn't understand Diego Luna's dialogue, nor many of the other
actors. What was the point in the robot? Misfiring comedy was the final
nail in the coffin of this tripe."I have a bad feeling about this..".. again?! Really? How wincingly
weak can you make it? The dialogue between Darth Vader with Orson was inanely boring and
erratic from the first line, I switch off and wondered if I'd left the
heating on at home. They couldn't even get the electronic tone right.
The original trilogy had you on the edge of your seat with every line
Vader spoke. Ben Mendelsohn as Orson, was terribly mis-cast, his voice, like many of
the other characters was sharp and hysterical, with no conviction. What happened to the music?! No love put into it, no excitement
generated at ALL! Awful. Just keep the Star Wars theme until the end
credits?! Why bother? Action: the wobbly hand-held first person is way too old hat, and
doesn't work. Whose firing on who and... why? Non-consequential
blasting for the sake of it. The last battle at the end had some hope, then it just threw in some
Walkers, and some other things we might recognize, to help it sustain
some resemblance to 'star wars. Some climbing, falling in a futuristic
tunnel..Then there was a sudden rush to tie in the ending with the start of 'A
New Hope', which culminated with Disney animated Princess Leah taking
the Death Star plans? She seemed so much more involved than to just pay
such weak homage to her & just at the end? Why do that? How irritating,
like the rest of the movie. Star Wars stupidly destroyed.
