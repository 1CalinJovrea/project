Hunger Games - The Remake!

Catching Fire is basically a remake of the first movie, which doesn't
offer even one single new idea, just the easiest excuse to send the
winning couple back to the games and repeat everything that happened in
the first movie.At 2.5 hours (including 11 min of end credits!!!), the movie is way too
long and pointless. Half the movie is wasted on boring "background
story", which adds nothing to the plot and serves as a mean to present
the movie as something more than it is - people trying to kill each
other. The second half is better, but again - offers nothing new.Good production design, good CGI.4.5/10 Skip the first half of the movie, then put your brains in
neutralWait, they split the third movie into two movies, making the trilogy
into a quadrilogy? My god, they are just as shameless as they are
geniuses!!!
