A reloaded *** kicker and better than the 1st one.

I must admit, the hype for the first film was too much and in the end,
we all got some intense 80s style action but with a poor story. This
sequel however actually has a story, a story of revenge. The first film
introduces the gang so we get to know them. The second however, we
already know the gang so now we actually see how they truly are and how
they work. This film is better since the rest of the team (other than
Stallone) get more screen time and they have their humor moments. Van
Dammne played a very very very very very AWESOME villain, and towards
the end of the film, he shows even at the age of 50, he is stronger
than ever. Arnie and Bruce Willis had a great screen time too with
perfect humor, seriously the chemistry between those 2 and the rest is
great. Speaking of chemistry, Dolph Lundgren's role is MUCH better now
and very enjoyable. Chuck Norris, you'd be surprise how he is. The cast
was great, the story is better, the action is MORE intense, there is
great humor. In conclusion, Expendables 2 brings back the 1980s action
style with it's teaspoon of humor. Enjoy the film!
