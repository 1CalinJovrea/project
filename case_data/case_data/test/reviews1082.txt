And I Thought M. Night Shyamalan Was Loosing His Touch.

When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it
because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right
when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my
favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more
chance with "Split" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night
all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the
scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great
horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller.
It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If
you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.
