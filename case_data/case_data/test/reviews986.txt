boring and creepy

I had high hopes for this movie. I was excited to go! However, the plot
was painfully boring. The CGI looked incredibly fake. And the whole
subplot was just plain creepy. I was so disappointed. It was
immediately obvious who was the bad guy and there were definitely some
bizarre interactions between characters. Honestly, you don't really
love or hate any character in the movie, even though, from the first
minute, you really, REALLY want to like one of them. There was nothing
that felt really magical about this. It was just bland and boring. If
you are seeking another magical movie from the Harry Potter franchise,
this is not that. You might love it, but if you are truly honest with
yourself, I'd doubt it.
