What film did everyone watch?

I'm sitting here writing this a mere four hours after seeing the film,
and I don't really know what I expected - if I expected nearly two
hours of tired tropes and poor writing, coupled with all around poor
performances, I would be happy. If the film was well written, well
acted, and a slight bit campy, it would be fine, but it just wasn't.
The concept isn't original, the cast was all around shocking, excluding
Victor, although there seemed to be a complete lack of
evil-ferret-stroking; his character arc was rather predictable. Every
single line was just exposition after exposition, with the occasional
burst of teenage sass from Rose, which was extremely frustrating after
a while. Quipping one liners is not necessary, especially after an hour
and a half.Every relationship felt forced, I didn't feel any connection to the
characters, and I honestly couldn't care less what happened to them;
they were not believable in the slightest. A good script would have
helped, but the performances also assisted in bogging it down I
actually enjoyed the concept, as someone who hasn't read the books. I
liked the vibe I got from the film to begin with, but it felt extremely
tacky. Everything felt like plastic, everyone's face was constantly
caked with makeup, felt extremely superficial and tacky, and every
backdrop was injected with a tonne of poor CGI. All of the special
effects through the film were just poor, and were not nice to look at.
The fire effects looked like the fire effects from Adobe After Effects.I liked what they were trying, but they honestly needed to up their
game all across the board; budget-wise, script-wise, casting-wise, and
the dozens of other issues with this picture. I almost got a 'it's so
bad it's good' feeling, but it's heavy handed and poorly made
throughout.I do not recommend.
