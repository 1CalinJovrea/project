Amazing

I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a screening last night in
Los Angeles. It was amazing, everything about it amazing! Kechiche is
something special. He works on something until he gets it right, and
the only time he gets it right is when he feels comfortable with what
he has shot. At the Q&A afterward with Kechiche, Seydoux and
Exarchopoulos, I learned that they shot some of the takes 100 times!His methods are unconventional. Because of this you are able to
experience cinema in a whole new light. The acting was so real, so
moving; these actresses gave everything they had, I'm just blown away
with what I viewed. My hat is off to Exarchopoulos and Seydoux as
actresses. No matter how painful and difficult the process must of been
to make this movie in the end I think that they would have to agree it
was worth it. To know that you gave everything is something special,
and something that I hope I can look back to on my career and say I
felt as well. Kechiche, call me, I want to be in your next film!!
