This is not war! This is world of tank!!

As a military enthusiast, this kind of Bull**** war movie is a f******
contempt of my intelligent. The director obviously played too much War
of Tank, he can't hide his stupidities and ignorance by borrowed the
only movable tiger tank from England. There were two reason which kept
me in the theater. Firstly, I was expecting the tiger which showed up
until the last 30min of the movie, after a total disappointmentï¼Œ I told
myself 2 tanks play hide-and-seek is F****** bull**** enough, there are
only 30 min left, there couldn't be anything worst than that. However
the last theme which is the theme that the Fury killed a whole company
of Germans proved that I overestimate the director's intelligent and
underestimate my ability of endurance. The second reason is that I
don't want to upset my friend who dress in US army suit sat right
beside me. I don't understand why people give this movie 8 or 9 stars,
everyone sane men can tell this movie is a f****** garbage from
whatever perspectives. To watch this movie at cinema is a total waste
of time and money
