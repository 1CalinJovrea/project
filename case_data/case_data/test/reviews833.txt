White House Propaganda

It is inevitable that White House Down be compared to Olympus Has
Fallen. Unfortunately, it compares poorly from the title on down.The special effects lack the realism of OHF.The action sequences are disjointed and downright goofy at times.The bad guys are cartoonish and you get no sense of satisfaction when
they are put down.The plot is too complicated by half and really is not relevant to the
action.The movie ends with a whimper and a SNL quality perp walk of the
character who is ultimately responsible for all the carnage.But the worst thing is the crude, amateurish and transparent Left vs.
Right political message in which it drapes all the other sub par
elements. It is a Progressive's wet dream that really couldn't be any
more wacko if you gathered 100 of Huffington Posts's top Super Users in
a room festooned pictures of Dick Cheney and GWB, fed them mushrooms,
and asked them to come up with the motivation for the bad guys.But Good Guys shooting bad guys is always good and so are explosions.
If you ignore the channeling of Nancy Pelosi, then you might get your
money's worth at a matin√©e showing.
