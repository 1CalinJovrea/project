Awful. Really, sincerely, awful.

The creators of this movie had an agenda. A "We're afraid of technology
so let's kill it no matter the cost!" agenda.So let's make a movie about it! Oh, and let's spend a lot of money and
hire a lot of known faces to spread this agenda. And the loopholes in
the script... wow, those loopholes... Did J.Depp and M.Freeman even
read the script before starting production!?!? Seeing this movie only
causes people to resent building an AI. To resent progress, to resent
what the human species has been doing for the past 200k yeasts or so:
evolving. There is NOTHING wrong in the actions of the AI in this
movie. Only those of the humans trying to stop it, eventually causing
the humanity's own demise.
