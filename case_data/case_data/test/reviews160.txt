Don't believe the hate. Actually a great movie.

Mild Spoilers ahead.This is my first time writing a review on IMDb. Let me start off by
saying this movie is not a monster movie, it's a suspenseful drama. The
movie is advertised as a monster horror film, so I can see why people
would be annoyed after seeing this movie. But these people are just
angry because they didn't watch the movie they wanted to see. It Comes At Night is fantastic. The performances are great all around
especially Joel Edgerton. The atmosphere is one of the best I've seen
in recent movies. The climax of the movie had my heart racing to the
point where I was almost shaking. Trey Edward Shultz uses different
aspect ratios to differentiate between the dream and nightmare
sequences. When the real world slowly becomes "a nightmare" the aspect
ratio slowly closes in.People are also annoyed by the unanswered questions. But I really
enjoyed that. The movie doesn't guide the viewer and help it answer
certain questions. The audience is left by themselves to figure out
what is happening, which adds to the atmosphere. I could discuss this
movie all day and try to figure out the mysteries of this film. Go into
this movie with no expectations. Don't be persuaded by any negative
reviews. Great job Trey Edward Shultz.
