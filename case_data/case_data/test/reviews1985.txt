Teenage Mutant CGI Turtles.

All I can say is thank God I was given a free ticket to see this
garbage as I can't understand why anyone would want to spend money to
sit through this. This whole movie was just drivel from beginning to
end and I can guarantee that there is are better ways to waste 100
minutes of your life. I won't even bother with trying to put into words the overall story, if
there even is one, but I can't help but wonder why this was even
necessary. The turtles came to fame in the late eighties/early nineties
and given the success of the cartoon, it spawned 3 live action movies,
yet by the late nineties the turtle fad faded and despite there being a
cartoon series in the mid 2000's and another movie, this whole exercise
of doing this reboot, or re-tool or re-imagining etc. now in 2014 seems
pointless, even if there is a newish cartoon series doing the rounds.The movie of course has the obligatory origins of the turtles and
splinter but again, was that even necessary? The action is fast paced
and frenetic and despite the overly well choreographed fight sequences
and the action taking place, the whole movie was just plain boring.
Maybe I've seen just too much of this before or maybe the whole issue
of Michael Bay sucking the life out of everything that we grew up with
is wearing thin. First Transformers and now this. What's next? Michael
Bay and the Muppets or Fraggle Rock? The dialogue is unfunny and lame, the action sequences were tedious and
predictable, you don't care for any of the characters, the fight scenes
were ho-hum, and the ending was as clich√©d as any I've seen. The scene
where they are all falling, and then skiing and then sliding down the
mountain and avoiding getting killed, hurt, crushed and everything else
that would normally happen, is enough to give anyone an epileptic
seizure right there and then. And no doubt we can look forward to
sequels of this, as of course Michael Bay will want to cash in on the
success of anything until there's nothing left but a pile of shrivelled
excrement.In the immortal words of Bart Simpson, "I didn't think it was
physically possible, but this movie both sucks and blows". And that
right there is what you can expect from this trash.
