Way too predictable

The movie has an intriguing idea and the acting by Kate Siegel is
great. However, this doesn't save it from the typical Genre clich√©s and
bad writing. Needless to say some of the most obvious movie flaws ever
made. Here is one example:We see Maddie trying to load a crossbow several times during the movie,
but she is just too weak and we see her fail multiple times. But then -
all of a sudden - the crossbow is loaded and she is able to shoot it.
And of course she hits the killer from a fair distant. And no, she is
no crossbow expert and from what the movie is telling us, Maddie has
never shot a weapon in her whole life before. Come on, this is just
lazy writing!All in all, this movie is just your typical, hide-and-seek, cabin-
in-the-woods, serial-killer movie with the exception that our heroine
is deaf and can't speak.It is not worth it. Luckily, it's quite a short movie. I only rated it
five stars because of Kate Siegel's great acting. I hope she gets to
star in better movies in the future.
