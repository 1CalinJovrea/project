Persistance

This film is still with me a week after watching. That tells me that
besides a fast feast of entertainment, there were layers it took me
longer to digest.Ray Kroc is a fascinating individual right from the start. We meet him
on a typical day, driving long distances between restaurants,
attempting to sell milkshake machines to distracted owners, using the
same clever spiel over and over. He does it with an hyper enthusiasm
that contrasts with his stillness as he sits in his motel room at the
end of the day, absorbing a motivational record through his pores.When his secretary tells him that one restaurant has ordered eight of
his milkshakes he decides, on a whim, to drive hundreds of miles out of
his way to check the place out and that is when he first sees the small
but thriving restaurant invented by the MacDonald's brothers.The contrast between their quiet, innovative brilliance and Ray Kroc's
talent as a visionary, drives the movie and it flies from that point
on. Yet there are things in common with all three men that exemplify
mid 20th century America. The work ethic in these men and the young
couples who bought the franchises was phenomenal, so was their power of
positive thinking and their almost religious belief in "family."A considerable percentage of Americans had their first job at
MacDonald's and we see a little of what they learned from the training
they had there; courtesy, focus, and attention to detail. The teen who
flipped the most perfect burgers really did go on to the top of the
company.Ray Kroc's drive for success encounters the usual ethical problems that
come with the territory, but that's only one part of this film which
covers much more than just one man's success story. This is American
history.Absolutely no one could have played this part as well as Michael
Keaton.
