Super boring. Total waste of source material.

I honestly don't have hope for western remakes of Japanese classics.
Western media companies consistently, for decades, have destroyed
everything they try to remake.While casting whites into Asian roles is part of it. I think the
problem is deeper. They simply do not respect nor do they understand
the source material.That brings me to this review. It's awful on every level. Whatever
brilliance was found in the source material has been grounded up and
turned into spam.What comes out is juvenile yet overly confusing.It's the worst of both worlds.It is simultaneously ambitious in its vision yet moronic in execution.Very strange combination.The deeper topics that made the original material so revered is
bastardized into an unrecognizable form. What comes out is a convoluted
mess that doesn't know what it wants to be.Save your time. Check out the source material. You'll be glad that you
did.Final verdict 2/10Is this a joke? I am here to see Bruce Lee but they put the focus on
some white guy, Steve McKee (Billy Magnussen).I got nothing against white guys, but what is he doing as the focus of
a Bruce Lee biopic? I noticed a very disturbing pattern in Hollywood.
They can't seem to be happy with Asian men in the lead role even in
their own biopic.You may think I am kidding but look at all the ways they've whitewashed
history eg The Conqueror - Genghis Khan played by John Wayne, Attila
The Hun starring the guy from 300.Is it a coincidence that kulturemedia (search it) has a database of
this sort of thing?But that's just the beginning. Instead of celebrating what a beast
Bruce Lee is, they make him out to be some insecure and jealous loser
who is butthurt over Steve McKee's success (in the film that is) Seems
more like a character assassination, rather than a biopic.There's the whole "hostility to the fact that Lee's students include
Caucasians." This is very one sided because it doesn't account for the
century+ of rampant racism and war crimes committed by Caucasians
against the Chinese including the opium wars holocaust, eight nation
alliance, and the stealing of Hong Kong. None of that is mentioned.All in all, this is a terrible film. I would not recommend it for Bruce
Lee fans as it tarnishes his true history with half baked lies and even
focuses on some Caucasian instead.Feels like it was the director who was jealous of Bruce Lee's success.Update: Odd. I have noticed review manipulation. Recently, there are a
lot of boilerplate "ignore the critics. this movie is the best!". Be
alert of such fake reviews. They do not match fan reviews nor even
professional movie reviewers at newspapers and online blogs.
