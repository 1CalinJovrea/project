If you were a fan of the first, you will love the second installment

The movie picks up right where the first left off, and really gives you
the back story of the family and why they are going through everything
they are going through. They style is very similar, and there is so
much originality and style that you just don't see with today's modern
horror story flicks. There are plenty of scares, plot twists,
surprises, a-ha moments, and plenty of tense moments and horror. I
really enjoyed it just as much as the first. I got to see The Ultimate
Insidious Experience which was a back to back double feature which was
really cool to refresh what had happened in the first. There are
moments that explain cleverly scenes that didn't make sense in the
beginning but are cleverly resolved in the end. I have always loved the
first Insidious and the second is equally as good in my book. If you
didn't like the first, you won't like the second. It's just a great
spooky, scary, haunted house, ghost, abandoned hospital story that is
well-done and leaves you very satisfied at the end. They leave it open
for further sequels that are sure to follow. A definite must-see for
any horror movie fan.
