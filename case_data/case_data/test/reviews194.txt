Limped a bit

Have a daughter of 14 who wanted to see this so off we trotted with
Nachos and drink in hand.First seen seemed to set the scene for the next 90 or so minutes.I shall not be too harsh here but it is a sugar coated one dimensional
affair with no strategy, message or indeed outcome. Seemed to me it
could be shortened down and used as a part of another movie. From start to finish nothing seemed to happen ..the plot limped along
like a wounded scriptwriter and nothing changed. You could have guessed
the ending after 15 or so minutes. Don't get me wrong..it's not a BAD
movie..it's made for people who have little expectation ..and that's
fine ..but with a little more spent on script than locations..it could
have been better.Nothing wrong with the genre...but it can be done so much better...La
La Land was a million tickets better...it can be done.Also the crew were very tepid and uninterested..Reece Witherspoon needs
to challenge a bit more...like she did in the marvelous "WILD"..shes
not ready for this yet and has a lot to offer before she turns into
Jennifer Anniston..as for Michael Sheen..he probably bought a few
houses with the fee.Gave it a fair 3...take your grandmother to see this for a safe bet.
