Familiar, But So Much Fun

While there are many that would argue differently, 2012 has been a
relatively good year for animation. With Brave, Pirates! Band of
Misfits and Frankenweenie (among others), there's been plenty of
appealing films for all ages. And while Wreck-It Ralph looked somewhat
less promising than the others in my eyes, it ended up being an
absolute joy and one of the best of 2012. Set in the video game world, Wreck-It Ralph is a typical arcade villain
who's tired of being bad. In an attempt to start a new life, Ralph
"game jumps" to a game called Hero's Duty, and through a chaotic series
of events, ends up in a kart racing game called Sugar Rush. In this
Candy Land of video games, Ralph meets a little girl named Vanellope
whom is determined to be accepted among the residents of Sugar Rush by
winning a kart race against them. Wreck-It Ralph is a video game movie, and while video game oriented
films have a reputation for being relatively awful, Wreck-It Ralph
exceeds any pre-expectations that one may have as a result. Perhaps
part of Wreck-It Ralph's success comes from the fact that it adapts the
video game world, as opposed to adapting an individual video game. Gamers will get the most out of Wreck-It Ralph. A minute rarely goes by
without some reference to some video game, video game character or
video game clich√©. It effectively satires everything that's good and
bad about video games in a way that won't insult gamers, but rather
leaving them chuckling as they nod in acknowledgement. Bowser, Sonic the Hedgehog, Q*Bert, Pac Man, Dig Dug and dozens of
other make cameo appearances (some even have speaking roles). Mario
didn't make it, though he is briefly mentioned once. But fear not, Wreck-It Ralph won't only appeal to gamers. Even those
who aren't familiar with the wonderful world of video games will find
much humor. Wreck-It Ralph has plenty of humor in the less video game
oriented field, though many of the best bits come from the various
video game references and satire humor. As is typical for a Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph is filled with
memorable characters. The title character, Ralph, while still a bit on
the generic side, is an easy to like protagonist. Vanellope is a
sarcastic little girl, who is actually much less annoying than one
might initially expect (she actually sort of grows on you). Other
characters are more entertaining. Fix-It Felix Jr. is the
goodie-two-shoes of this movie, while Sergeant Jean Calhoun is a
no-nonsense space commander. The most memorable character, however, is
King Candy, who's the ridiculously over the top and punn-y leader of
Sugar Rush (though he may feel a bit too familiar to the Mad Hatter for
some). Perhaps what's most surprising about Wreck-It Ralph is how moving it
is. It's initial attempts at poignancy may seem a bit clumsy and
predictable at first, but it quickly develops into something much more
satisfying, if far from the elegance of Pixar. The animation is incredible. From the purposely stiff animation in
Wreck-It Ralph's game, to the hyper realistic looking Hero's Duty, to
the colorful Sugar Rush, Wreck-It Ralph is the most visually superb
computer animated film of the year. A vast array of blink-and-then-
you'll-miss-it sight gags that is practically begging for repeat
viewings. Cast members include John C. Reily, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, and
Jane Lynch among others. Each voice actor blends beautifully with their
character, though outside of Alan Tudyk (the voice of King Candy),
there aren't any standouts. The score by Henry Jackman captures the video game world perfectly.
Mixing electronic instruments and orchestra intelligently, Jackman
provides an energetic score for Wreck-It Ralph. The heavy use of
electric guitar in the Hero's Duty world is purposely overdone to
humorous effect, and the theme for the Sugar Rush races is joyfully
nostalgic and sounds just like a tune you might listen to in a Mario
Kart game. Still, during some of the more serious (and thankfully rare)
moments, the score becomes rather generic, and less memorable than the
other tracks. In a film that does so much right, it feels almost overly hypocritical
to point out some of things that Wreck-It Ralph does wrong, but they
should be mentioned. Wreck-It Ralph often suffers from being too familiar. Taking bits and
pieces from Alice in Wonderland, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, Despicable
Me, and various others, Wreck-It Ralph occasionally feels a bit
recycled. Still, there's so much of Wreck-It Ralph that's clever and
original, this can be overlooked. What CAN'T be overlooked, however, is the potty humor. Wreck-It Ralph
is not stuffed with crude humor, but the almost constant smile on my
face changed into a frown during these instances. The potty humor is
not necessary, and only makes the film feel more childish than it
should. It surely won't score points with parents who will find this to
be the only questionable content in an otherwise family-friendly film. While familiar elements, occasional potty humor and sometimes overly
sappy emotion fills the screen, Wreck-It Ralph is an absolutely
outrageous film. Consistently clever, visually enchanting, and
extremely memorable while even delivering a twist or two, Wreck-It
Ralph is a must-see for gamers and adults that grew up with these
games. Wreck-It Ralph is unlikely to be considered one of Disney's best
films, but it's certainly one of their funniest. Note: Wreck-It Ralph is preceded by a short called Paperman that is
cute and charming, if not quite groundbreaking.
