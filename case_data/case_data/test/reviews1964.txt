Enjoyable Enough

Mafia boss Robert DeNiro and his family are in the witness protection
program. They are relocated to France, where they have trouble with the
locals. Enjoyable crime comedy but overlong. I felt like some of the
characters were poorly written as well. DeNiro and the son (John D'Leo)
were written best. The mother and daughter not so much. Michelle
Pfeiffer is the mom and aside from one act of vengeance early on where
she felt insulted by some French people in a grocery store, her
character has little to do the rest of the film. The daughter (Dianna
Agron) had a storyline that didn't feel authentic to me. Let's just say
the early scenes establishing her character didn't fit with her
storyline later in the movie. Also, and this is admittedly a huge
nitpick on my part, I find it hard to believe the FBI would assign
someone Tommy Lee Jones' age to any kind of field work that might be
dangerous. Still, despite these complaints, it's not a bad movie. It's
entertaining enough but speeding things up to get to the predictable
climax would have helped a lot.
