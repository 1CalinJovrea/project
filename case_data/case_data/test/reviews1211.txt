Congratulations Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3. You are no longer the worst TMNT movie ever.

Before I begin this, I want to say I'm not exactly the biggest TMNT fan
out there. Having said that though, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is so
bad that it'll probably make any fan, whether they be casual(like me)
or a die hard fan. When trailers of the film first came out, I thought
it looked like the new Transformers movie. But when I finished seeing
it, and noticing Michael Bay was behind it, I had a bad feeling about
it.Even though Bay is only producing and Jonathan Liebesman is the
director, who was behind Battle: Los Angeles, this film still feels
like a Michael Bay film. From the over the top explosions, really loud
sound effects that'll probably make you deaf, and, of course, Megan (I
can't act) Fox.The story is mostly recycled from the first TMNT film from way back in
1990. The Foot Clan is terrorizing New York City and crime is at an all
time high there. Apparently, though, they want to ally themselves with
some corporate guy, spread a toxin, and sell the cure to the government
for money. After that, we are pretty much treated to the typical
Michael Bay stuff you'd see.The fight scenes are very similar to that of Bay's four Transfomers
movies. They're long, very bloated, and everything is pretty much
exploding like every item is combustible. I was somehow expecting
Optimus Prime to somehow show up. Though, part of me wants to say this
was action stuff Bay had not time in to fit in Transformers 4 and
decided to use it here.The acting is a mixed bag. The actors voicing the turtles are decent
enough and are rather believable. They also do a decent job keeping the
turtles to their same personality, sometimes. However, Megan Fox is NOT
cut out to be April O'Neil. She just has this constant dull surprise
expression, or is staring at the camera, not sure how to react. Not to
mention she's not tough or confident like in the TV shows. She's more
of a coward than anything. Tohoru Masamune is a very mediocre Shredder.
I don't feel intimidated by him at all. The original Shredder in the
first two TMNT films was much better than Masamune here.Perhaps the actors could've done better if the script wasn't so bad.
The dialogue is bland as sawdust and it looks like some of the actors
seem embarrassed by what they have to say sometimes.Not to mention they get the origins of the TMNT and Splinter wrong.
Instead of Splinter being Hamato Yoshi's pet, or Hamato Yoshi himself,
he turns out to belong to April when she was younger, along with the
four turtles. The turtles themselves were actually supposed to be found
by Splinter, but instead they all end up in the sewer together. So
forget following continuity or respecting the source material.The jokes provided by the turtles are not funny either. Instead of
clever gags or witty jokes from our heroes, we're treated to fart jokes
and other raunchy material.Speaking of which, the Turtles look ugly. I know they're supposed to be
mutants and going for some realism here since it's live action, but
this is ridiculous. I couldn't be intimidated with how goofy they look,
even if one held a gun to my head. The animation for them is also stiff
as a wooden board and, I swear, lip syncing looked off.Perhaps the worst part of this movie is that it doesn't have any of the
joy or fun of TMNT. It's extremely dark and joyless. While there were
dark elements in the shows it had, it was lighthearted most of the
time. Here, the film is dark and probably dark for the sake of being
so. There's no joy, no fun, no laughs to be found. It's rather
depressing instead.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fails as a reboot to the franchise and
triumphs as a means of insulting the hardcore fans who love the TMNT
since the first TV show. If its story isn't taking its sweet time to
get going, its throwing bad jokes at you. Not to mention bad acting,
bloated action scenes, horrible CGI turtles, and pretty much straying
far too much from the TV shows everyone grew to love. And the stuff
that does have to do with the shows feels like a slap in the face.Sadly, I've heard that a sequel is in the works already. What's worse
is that they're bringing in Casey Jones and Beebop and Rocksteady.
Stick to the TV shows and the three movies I say and spare yourself the
agony of this film and its possible sequels.
