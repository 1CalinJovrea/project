6 Morons in a barn -vs- a virus

A DEADLY VIRUS KILL THE WORLD "or not, we never know" --- HOW,
WHEN,WHERE,WHY "we never know" --- BACKGROUNDS: 1 barn + 1 car ---
STORY: 6 Morons acting like retards try to survive a deadly virus. ---
Horror Movie: NO! --- AWARD: Best boring movie 2017."IT COMES AT NIGHT", Even the title is totally out of context.
Everybody know viruses only kill at night. Oh no, sorry, it's vampire.I think even a person living under a stone know how to try surviving a
deadly virus in 2017, BUT NOT THEM. AT ALL!With the rules of the house perhaps you need to add: - DO NOT put off your gas mask outside the house - SEALED all the house with tape (windows, doors...) - Stop wearing SHORT and try to get/create SEALED SUIT! - AVOID keeping
a dog who bark each 5 minutes. - DO NOT PUT PLANK IN YOUR WINDOWS > VIRUS DON'T FEAR PLANK you know.
Even you try to avoid bad guys, PUT THE PLANKS INSIDE -AND- OUTSIDE. It
will avoid bad guys to rid them off in 3 seconds !!!! - Stop making
baby's each night.- Boil the water you use to wash yourself and not only the one you
drink. I will stop there because the list WILL BE TOO LONG!Adding cheep horror music on NOTHING, giving us bad dreams using cheep
effects DO NOT make a good movie. And as any garbage movie: - Acting like "i never seen any virus movie
in my life" - Mode RUSH activated for the last 25 minutes of the movie. The kid is sick, how? why? by who? we never know. The kid is dead, OK,
honestly i so don't care, because you never give us 5 min of flashback
or any backgrounds of anything concerning this kid then now OK a kid i
have seen 3 minutes in a boring movie just die. And you try what with that ? Touching our sentimental feelings to
conclude a big piece of nothing ?One of the most horrible "horror" movie i have seen this last 5 years.
No background, no context, no story, no interest. We don't have a real
context to take in count the gravity of the outbreak, then, you get a
barn. If you seeking good show about pandemic outbreak try : - Cordon -
Containment (the us version of Cordon) - The Andromeda Strain - Alert
1995 - Virus 1980 << THEY ARE ALL GOOD. But avoid this one you will waste your time.
