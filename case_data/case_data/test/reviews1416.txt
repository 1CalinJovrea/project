Pure cliché

Pure cliché . Makers of this movie must be so low level . Second movie
with almost same story this year . Same plans , missiles , codes . The
makers of this movie are so naive , repeating all usual things again
and again . As usual , someone is there or gets there by accident ,
which is hero . Terrorist take down whole place . Hero is the only one
who can fight back without dying ,where as other trained guards just
dying easily . Then nuclear missiles time arrives . Then national
counter attack , intending to blow all place even with hostages or
civilians . And final episode as always to stop counter attack at last
seconds . Aren't you tired of the same none sense scripts ?!
