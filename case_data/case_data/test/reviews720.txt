A Very Sweet Little Movie, Which I Enjoyed

I very much enjoyed this unusual movie depicting the lives of two
people in their older, and in this case, more lonesome years.Both Fonda and Redford gave nuanced performances which were very
relatable, especially if you are over the age of 60. I doubt that very
young adults would find much to enjoy about this picture, and that is a
shame because in fact it displays well the one thing which people
cannot lose if they are to continue enjoying their lives into their
last decades, and that is hope.So often younger people do not appreciate the wisdom and humanity which
both come with age. Nor do they realize that if they are lucky, they,
too, will be old one day. If you want a sweet look into lives of the older but certainly not dead
yet, this would be a good place to do so.
