A tale of treachery, greed and a code of ethics toxic enough to spoil a Big Mac.

Biographical dramas tell stories about significant people in history
but they are always much more than that. The person chosen for the
bio-pic reflects something about the values of the era and the society
from which they came. In this sense, The Founder (2016) goes well
beyond the story of a global hamburger empire to the values that made
McDonald's possible and it does not paint a pretty picture. The mantra
"persistence is everything" is heard at the beginning and the end of
this film but when decoded it means persistent treachery, greed, and a
code of ethics toxic enough to remove some gloss from the world's most
recognised golden arches.The real founders are brothers Maurice (John Lynch) and Richard
McDonald (Nick Offerman) who pioneered the idea of standardised burgers
made quickly that led to the modern fast-food industry. Into their
lives came Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a struggling milkshake-mixer
salesman who is amazed at the queues of people lined up for burgers and
fries. The brothers trust Ray, tell him their secrets, and in 1954 Ray
becomes the franchise manager responsible for setting up new stores.
Driven by insatiable greed, Ray wants to go national but the brothers
fear loss of quality control. When Ray realises that owning the
property on which stores operate gives him complete control of the
business, his takeover plans are rolled into place.The storyline follows the facts of history but it is the film's
characterisations that are its real achievement. Perhaps best known for
his extraordinary performance in Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton is in a
class of his own when it comes to portraying deeply flawed people
living on the edge of sanity or evil. From the opening scenes his eyes
express callous disregard for others, and at one point he boasts that
if a competitor was drowning he would not hesitate to put a running
hose deep down the victim's throat. His flawed humanity is contrasted
by the authenticity and honesty represented by the brothers. Excellent
casting, directing and period sets make this a thoroughly engaging
story.This film also arrives with remarkable timing given the current global
spotlight on the home of capitalism. Millions of McDonald's fans are
regularly processed by one of the most sophisticated marketing machines
on the planet. Seeing The Founder is a bit like finding out that Santa
Claus is Satan in disguise. Good cinema not only entertains: it shows
the world as it is, not as we believe it should be. The Founder tells a
story that should be told, and it does it brilliantly.
