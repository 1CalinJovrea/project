An Interesting Crime Thriller Spy Drama Full of Twists

To tell you the truth, I did not know anything about this movie. I had
neither seen the trailer nor read the synopsis to it. So you could
imagine my surprise when we were given twist after twist through out
the whole movie. My wife and I were pretty surprised of the first twist
and we were kept on guessing till the very end (Although some twists
were easier to guess than others), but nevertheless we were quite
entertained.The main story itself was a bit stereotype about terrorists plotting to
do some horrifying attack and must be stopped at all costs. But the
interesting part was actually those surprising twists. In addition, the
fighting and gun shooting scenes were surprisingly good. The sound
effects particularly during the guns blazing were cool and added the
element of suspense. One more thing that I liked about this movie was
the fact that they really used real-time method like in 24 TV series
starring Kiefer Sutherland. This may not be an instant classic crime thriller movie, but I
personally felt that this one was not too bad. In fact it was pretty
enjoyable and it even had some brief funny moments. The movie also had
some interesting large cast of well known stars with John Malkovich
whom I dubbed as the star performer despite having limited screen time.
Orlando Bloom sadly looked old in this movie (totally unlike his
performances as Legolas that made him became a ladies' favorite). While
Noomi Rapace started to build her own rapport as lead star of
thriller/action movies. Now if you are a fan of a crime thriller movie with multiple twists
through out the movie, combined with brief action sequences every now
and then, you should give this one a try and see it for yourself. But
if you are not a fan of such genre, or if you prefer a very intelligent
crime thriller drama, then perhaps this would not really satisfy you.For my complete review, pls have a look at
