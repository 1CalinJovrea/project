Good but lacks substance for lasting impression

Christoph Waltz steals the show in Big Eyes, Tim Burton's whimsical
tale of an artist and a scandal set in the transporting setting of
California in the 60's.The story of Big Eyes is something straight out of the movies, but no,
the tale of Margaret Keane and her artistry is based on fact and real
life.Tim Burton's Big Eyes is a dramatic narrative of Margaret Keane, the
painter, mother and wife. Having left her husband, with daughter in
tow, she seeks a new beginning in California. While there, she hopes to
make a living through her art and subsequently meets and marries a man
named Walter. Trying to navigate the art world and make a living, her
husband claims credit for her artwork which eventually becomes highly
profitable. Burton focuses on the awakening of Keane as an artist and
to her husband's shortcomings and the legal difficulties in claiming
ownership of her work.Margaret Keane's life is a fascinating and near unbelievable one. And
much of Big Eyes' success as a film rests comfortably on that very
story. Well, Big Eyes rests on the story of Keane and on Christoph
Waltz's immeasurable charm in his performance as Walter Keane.The sad big eyed children made commercially famous by Keane are
uniquely peculiar. Stylistically, it was only right that Tim Burton
should direct a film about the painter. It is apparent that Big Eyes is
a Burton film; however, Tim Burton subdues his style substantially so
that the narrative of this marvelous woman can take center stage.
Creatively, this is a refreshing departure for the director.The Big Eyes movie parallels the artwork of Margaret Keane in an
unintentional manner. Margaret Keane was able to look at a person and
capture their essence and then put it on canvas with her own twist
through large sad eyes. Similarly, Tim Burton takes the core elements
of Keane's life and translates it to film with his own fanciful
creative liberties. Though everything is in the movie adaptation of Big
Eyes, it lacks substance and heart to connect with the audience to have
a lasting impression.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the reviews of recent releases and
