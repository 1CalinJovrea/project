A True Story Worth Experiencing

True stories are the one thing throughout the film industry that can't
be known as being a dime a dozen because it seems as though almost half
of the films nowadays are based on true events. Of that half, I'd say
only about half of those stories are done with complete justice and
care. So, it's really a toss-up when going into a film like this. With
that said, Only the Brave is a fantastic presentation of these events
and the men who risked their lives on a daily basis. Although it may
feel a little slow at times, here is why I believe this is a film
that's pretty much for everyone. When you're trying to tell a possibly tragic story about people that
may or may not have to give their lives in the wake of danger, it
really does require some powerful and devoted performances in order to
get the audience to emotionally respond to the events unfolding
on-screen. From Josh Brolin to Miles Teller, to even Taylor Kitsch and
Jennifer Connelly, I honestly thought this ensemble was one of the best
of the entire year, with the standouts obviously being Brolin and
Teller. Each and every one of the supporting roles gave their very best
as well, making this a very believable and realistic team.The premise of this film is relatively simple. A crew of firefighters
is out to become the next crew of "Hot Shots," and they will do
whatever it takes, which also entails hiring some fresh and willing
talent. The film dives into their lives outside of work and really
invests you in each one of their jobs. I was quite riveted throughout
each one of the fires, and I loved how it didn't take it too seriously
to the point of depression. With a nice blend of bickering and action,
these characters were more fleshed out and likable than I was expecting
them to be, which really added a level of intensity to the overall
movie. It really is the fact that this film has a terrific cast that really
makes you feel for them when the climax occurs in the third act. I was
not familiar with the events that occurred in real life, so I wasn't
sure what to expect from the finale of this film. Although I feel there
are some abrupt aspects about it, I feel as though it was handled with
care and respected the families involved in the actual events. The
final act of this movie is surprising in multiple ways and it did have
me shedding a few tears by the time the credits started to roll. In the end, Only the Brave is definitely a slow watch at times and its
run time is slightly longer than the material needs it to be, but when
it's slow it also takes its time to emotionally invest you in its
characters, so it's sort of a catch-22. With terrific performances all
around, direction that seems to be inspired, and sequences that will
have you on the edge of your seat, this is a very well-made a memorable
film that I can confidently say will be one of my favorites of this
year. This movie is well-made in every regard and I highly recommend it
to everyone.
