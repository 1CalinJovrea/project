A Decent Thriller

Wow! These are some pretty harsh scores for this low budget thriller.
The acting is top notch all around led by Mark Strong as the police
negotiator although they made him out to be a bit of a twit more
concerned for the safety of the terrorists than the hostages. Perhaps
this was true but probably fiction just to create a little tension
between the more passive police and the gung ho SAS team.About the only thing this film lacked was steady pacing which with a
story like this would have been difficult as mostly they just sat
around for six days before the excrement hit the fan. At least the
movie didn't devolve into a soap opera by showing the "up close and
personal" side to the soldiers, police, terrorists, or hostages.Well choreographed action and training scenes sort of make up for the
down time in the story. If nothing else it serves as a good reminder of
this bit of history that I recall.
