Train wreck

How to start this? I think I'll begin with the people who haves this
movie a decent review. A lot of reviewers said this was a microcosm of
society and the struggle of the rebels showed the climbing through the
classes of to the ultimate end which is demise. These people also
weren't concerned with the functionality of this microcosm and some
even said it would have ruined the film if it was explained. Sweet Jesus lord Buddha Allah Yahweh!I hope these people are never in charge of this fictitious realm that
indulges psychotic caste behaviour. We'd all be dead in a week or they
would be and humanity would have fighting chance. Which is what this
movie implies. Do not fight, know your place and shut up. Although the
balance of power makes absolutely no sense in film. The well off out
number the unfortunate at least 2:1. Which in a balanced system of
hierarchy doesn't happen. There need to be more workers to provide for
the upper class. This didn't exist in this story. The overall end game
is to maintain humanity in a suspended state with rebellion as
regulation to preserve a class system. Know your place. However there
is no economic system presented to maintain it. How they select the
uppers and the lowers isn't explained. Which brings me back to the
people who would find this movie profound. Lack of understanding for
the more important self. The scientific laws on this train do not apply. Logic, mathematics,
physics, chemistry basically anyone who made it to grade nine should
see canon sized holes in this story. Leave aside the perpetual motion
machine. A train can't contain industrialized mechanics for a recycling
system. Sources have to be introduced for a human organism to be
supported. There would have to be scientific control in closed system
other than a woman reading a book while the oranges grow. Where is the
cockroach harvesting car? The aquarium car must be maintained by the
sushi chef. The cleaning products must come from the ammonia produced
by recycling urine. The bar gets its alcohol from the engine fumes or
that muck the kid was cleaning out. The track that never cracks could
be maintained by.... I've run out magical solutions. The idea behind this movie is to demonstrate we are all flawed and try
to maintain order in what we think society should be, but it doesn't
embrace those flaws. It ignores them and does whatever it can to fight
those flaws with no common good. It takes for granted how things are
done and who is doing them. Everyone is in it for themselves and will
rip apart anyone who gets in their selfish way. If you truly found this
movie to be good you are already on that train at the end of humanity
and you will not survive that way. It means you already take for
granted your own life and all the little white lies you tell yourself
are as big as that landscape out of that trains window. That train should have stopped and as someone suggested use the engine
to build a sustainable society instead of bombing head on into oblivion
with no end in sight. Ultimately this movie could have ended no other
way with a failed attempt at maintaining a snooty, greedy, childish
society with no responsibility but to its own anal stage of development
