The best con this film pulls is making a romantic comedy appears like a crime thriller.

Will Smith is back in Hitch: How to Get the Girl, Also Some Cash.
There's overwhelming opulence, exotic setting and beautiful ladies at
display here for the grand dramatization of thievery. It showcases a
glamorous lifestyle, riches and ladies, portrayed by the charismatic
leads. However, the movie recycles this material too often and having
too much investment in lovey-dovey banters does wear the tension thin.Story follows Nicky (Will Smith), a veteran thief who meets with Jess
(Margot Robbie), an aspiring thief. Together they embark on a swindling
journey, manipulating people and each other into giving what they want.
Led by the charismatic Will Smith, Focus boasts an interesting
anti-hero. He's very versatile, able to perform in comedic as well as
more serious tone. Robbie has a wide range of acting too, she seems
natural although sometimes leaning heavily on femme fatale clich√©.This is at heart a romance movie, with the backdrop of felony, not the
other way around. The liaison aspect is scrutinized deeper than the
actual thefts. This should be fine as both Smith and Robbie are capable
leads, but it tends to lose momentum after the many times it uses "He
loves me, he loves me not" gimmick. It's more of a light relationship
than an intense trickery exchange, while pretty entertaining it's
barely enough to keep the suspense.The film possesses a stylish colorful cinematography. Design for
costume and the vista are very suave, something out of a page of rich
people magazine. It offers fantasy celebrity nuance, a brighter side of
crime, so to speak. Its choice of soundtracks reflects it as well,
playing classy tunes to serenade heist and courtship. While the plans
might not be masterful, there are some good plot twists to unveil here.With fascinating set and actors Focus is a decent drama film, but to
reach thrilling suspense it needs to focus more on plundering instead
of plowing.
