Beautiful Movie

This film is absolutely fantastic. Great CGI, great story, great voice
cast, great music, and all around great everything. This truly is an
instant cult classic that is going to go down in history as one of
Disneys best. The CGI is beautifully detailed and polished. The sea and
the hair of the characters look almost completely real. The story is
absolutely amazing as well. It's not only thought provoking, but it
also has everything, such as happiness, bravery, poignancy, and it just
goes on a perfect flow that fits perfectly with what this film is
about. The music is surprisingly pretty great in this film too. I think
the writers did a splendid job with that as well. This film is
beautifully animated and written, and I can't recommend this film
enough for those who haven't seen it yet. I was pleasantly surprised
and I think anyone who hasn't seen it yet will be as well.
