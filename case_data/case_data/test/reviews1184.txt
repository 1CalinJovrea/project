This is NOT Mad Max !!!

The film does contain character named "Max" who appears to be
everyone's little bitch and at least mildly retarded. This character,
however, has no resemblance whatsoever to actual Mad Max films
character "Mad Max".I like the actors, film has some very pretty girls in it, Charlize
Theron still looks hot (although she is missing an arm for some stupid
reason), but that is about it.I expected either a reboot/remake or continuation of original trilogy,
I expected to see "Mad Max" pulling his weight, and bearing at least a
little similarity to the original. Nope.I've seen 80's B-budget films that beat this one easily.If this was 80's B-budget, I'd give it a 5, as they had money, and
actors, and this was supposed to be AAA experience, all this film
deserves is 1/10. Kinda like you'd give retarded kid a prize for effort
even if he messes up, with hope he improves by the experience, but when
you have Valedictorian show up drunk and high for exams and pisses all
over everyone you just cant be nice about it.Plus script reads like it was written by someone high on crack or meth.
Drugs are bad for you.
