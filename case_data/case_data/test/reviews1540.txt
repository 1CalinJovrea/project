A total Yawner, thanks for nothing James Gunn

First I wouldn't write any spoilers, because this movie is like rotten
meat - spoiled right away. Just a garbage, go nowhere, do nothing
movie. Did James Gunn get high while watching the far, far superior
Battle Royale? Did his success with Guardians of the Galaxy (two isn't
better than one) go to his head? Whatever happened resulted in this
stupid, senseless, poorly executed watered down version of Battle
Royale. There are so many plot holes in this wretched film as to make
it nearly unwatchable. It's barely above the level of the SyFy channels
lame Asylum movies. And those are totally terrible. Most of the actors
seems to be sleep walking through the movie and those that try
shouldn't have wasted their time. This is just another movie that shows
why Hollywood has no balls - even when they rip off a better movie,
they do it poorly. I wish I could sue the studio so I could get back
the time of my life I wasted watching this GARBAGE.
