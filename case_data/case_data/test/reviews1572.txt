Stunningly awful

I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's
standard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems
to have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor. The quality of the camera-work is excellent and the bear mauling scene
very accomplished if that is the right way to describe such a visceral
few minutes. But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails
utterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I
know he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible
world but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting
happens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree,
and survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and
don't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are
9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes
ago. What a relief when the baddie is finally left to his fate, but
then you realise you've just wasted 2 hours of your life.
