Forget about king Arthur

Few months ago when I watched the trailer and considering the fact that
Guy Ritchie is directing this I knew one thing for sure - this movie
will NOT BE a King Arthur story. What happens here is that Ritchie took
the concept of the King Arthur and Excalibur's myths and made a movie
out of them in a way only he can (reference - Sherlock Holmes).So what you should expect and what you will get from this movie is: -
Charlie Hunnam (excellent actor with huge potential) - Jude Law (no
need of comment here, this movie won't be the same without him). Hunnam
and Law were one of the reasons I wanted to watch this movie - Hell of
a good soundtrack - Excellent overall atmosphere and FX - 100% Guy
Ritchie movie - FunWhat you should NOT expect from this movie is regular King Arthur story
- quite the same if you had expected a regular WWII story from
Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards. And the only thing I felt missing to
get a 100% fun from the new Ritchie's movie was Vinnie Jones :)I hope you'll enjoy it as I did on my Friday's cinema evening!!!
