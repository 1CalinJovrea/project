Traumatizing & Mesmerizing!

'Raw' (French: Grave) is a fearless, disturbing & ultimately
unforgettable film, that has the courage to be itself. As my summary
states, its Traumatizing & Mesmerizing! Writer-Director Julia Ducournau
delivers a tale of violence & cannibalism with the power of a
sledgehammer. And lead performer Garance Marillier delivers an
outstanding performance!'Raw' Synopsis: When a young vegetarian undergoes a carnivorous hazing
ritual at vet school, an unbidden taste for meat begins to grow in her.'Raw' is about exploring the inner self & how exposure, to any form or
any meat that it maybe, can change your life altogether. The
protagonist here, Justine, played by Garance Marillier, a pure
vegetarian, is forced to have meat by bullies in her very beginning in
the vet school, develops a taste for meat & flesh, which is akin of a
dangerous vampire. Her transformation from an innocent vegetarian, to a
cannibal obsessed with meat & human-flesh is shocking to the core.
'Raw' narrates her disturbing & graphic journey, with relentlessness.
There were times when I looked away from the screen, due to its
gruesome content. The faint-hearted, STAY AWAY!'Raw' is a massive winner because Julia Ducournau is a storyteller of
solid merit. Her Writing questions violence & cannibalism with
tremendous power & graphicness. While its easy to be put off by the
protagonist's violent behavior towards human-flesh, Julia's Superiorly
Written Screenplay questions the act of violence in all forms,
including our daily food habits, which results in animal killing. Its a
twisted tale, with a thought-provoking undertone. Julia's Direction is
engrossing. She has handled this disturbing story, with command. Here's
a storyteller with some capability! A special mention for the nicely
Cinematography by Ruben Impens.Performance-Wise: Garance Marillier as Justine, is spell-binding. Right
from her timid body-language in the beginning to her transformation
into a cannibal, is simply incredible. The actress plays this difficult
role with unbelievable conviction. Its an outstanding performance, that
arrests your attention completely. Ella Rumpf as Alexia, Justine's
sister, is another performer to watch. She's excellent!On the whole, 'Raw' is among the big winners of recent times. Its
brave, graphic & undeniably original. Don't Miss It! But I strongly
suggest you watch it with an empty stomach. Don't tell me later I
didn't warn you.
