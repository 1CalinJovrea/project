Non-stop thrills and suspense!

This is an action-thriller starring Liam Neeson as U.S. Air Marshal
Bill Marks who, while boarding a flight to London, receives text
messages from an unknown assailant, threatening that if he doesn't
transfer $150 million to an account, a fatality will occur on the plane
every 20 minutes unless Marks complies with the money request.The film starts off with some intrigue, showing Marks depressed,
consuming alcohol and having a couple of run-ins with some passengers
before he boards the plane, already giving the audience the impression
that Marks is a disturbed person and making us eager to know what his
background story is. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) sits next to Marks on
the plane, whose background story is also a mystery until later on in
the film, providing us with another interesting subplot.However, the main plot and action come almost immediately after the
plane takes to the air when Marks starts receiving the threatening text
messages. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse as Marks
attempt to find the perpetrator and, when the casualties start to
mount, it becomes a thrilling roller-coaster ride.The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures
the audience attention from start to finish and Jaume Collet-Serra
directed a solid plot that kept the movie's pace going strong, leaving
no room with unnecessary fillers that tends to drag the story. There
are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was
realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and
engaging.Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that
will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the
unpredictable outcomes. Highly recommended.Grade B+
