Entertaining, brutal action-thriller

Why did this flop, and why is it rated to low!? I don't quite get that.
No, it is not the only movie you ever need to see, but it is pretty
darn entertaining, I'll tell ya.Yeah, it totally overdoes the we-are-such-a-tight-group-of-bros-(and-a-
sis)-and-we-joke-in-a-rough-way, but it doesn't really get too
annoying. Arnold is good, this is not his usual role, and that's pretty
neat. Olivia Williams is also pretty good. Now, the action. This has some intense action sequences, and it is
bru-tal! I mean, this is an R-rating if I ever saw one! Blood is
flowing. I saw a you-tube review of this, he though it was to violent,
it's not. I like me a really brutal movie now and then!It has a couple twists and turns, action is good, acting is decent, (I
dare you to recognize Sam Worthington!) it is, *drumroll* entertaining!People saying this is a bad movie, well, they obviously haven't seen
The legend of Hercules. Sabotage is one of several Arnold
comeback-movies, and it is definitely a good one.As I've said, it isn't a classic, it tries to be a little better than
it really is, but it does not make it that bad at all.
