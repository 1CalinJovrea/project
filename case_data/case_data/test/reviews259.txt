Very good and different for Jackie Chan

I thought this movie was very good and well acted. It got somewhat
confusing with IRA codes, but the storyline was very good. Love, loss,
betrayal, are some of the things in this story. Oh, and of course
action. Jackie is still quite virile when it comes to fighting moves.
European thugs are definitely no match for him. This to me was very
entertaining as well as a very good dramatic story. I definitely
recommend seeing this on the big screen. Roger Ebert has no clue as to
good story + drama and entertainment in my opinion.
