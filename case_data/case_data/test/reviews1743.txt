The Future of Theatre Structure is going to be More Like Amusement Park!

This film is attraction like Disney attraction facility of the same
name rather than film. The tag line is simple enough that Captain Jack Sparrow seeking the
trident of Poseidon to get rid of UK navy ghosts which led by Captain
Salazar. The most memorable sequence is the last under sea sequence in which
IMAX screen can fully express its large vertical actions in 4D. That is
the most remarkable cinematic experience during viewing of this film. It is very close to the next development phase of film. I believe film
can be 4D attraction but the limitation still is its structure of
traditional theaters. Cinema and Amusement Park are in more harsh competition in the 21st.
century. In the future theaters are more like Amusement Park! At the present, 4D is limited in the traditional theaters
structure...need transformation of theaters! 10 out of 10!
