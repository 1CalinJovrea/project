One of the worst films of the year, one my ten worst ever.

Wife and I watched this movie with high expectations because of Jason
Segeland his previous work. 124 minutes later neither one of us had
cracked so much as smile, she was utterly offended while I was less so
as I've come to expect this dreck from the formulaic romantic
"comedies" that are marketed towards women.Unique only in the level of outright disdain that Hollywood holds for
men that is on exhibit here, it is so thick it practically drips off
the screen. Every male character, and I mean EVERY one, is a caricature
of one type or another of men as slacked jawed, mouth breathing
imbeciles who might likely forget to breath or constantly soil
themselves were it not for the highly intelligent, wise beyond their
years, always sexy and dynamic no matter what women whose lives are
limited because of them.Spoilers Begin HERE: Pretty standard fare now from Hollywood in which
the never ending indignation heaped upon one particularly dim-witted
male by his manipulative but clearly superior romantic interest is
somehow intended to somehow be funny.In this version one particular clod, played by Jason Segel, is made to
look like the bad guy once again because despite his best groveling,
boot licking and subservience to his fianc√©, up to and including giving
up his promising career in San Francisco and putting his entire life
and their plans on hold in order to follow her like a love sick puppy
to Michigan so she can pursue her post graduate work - the underlying
implication that everyone knows academia is so much more inherently
worthy than any other career one might choose its a given he would do
this strikes one like a sledgehammer - he has the unmitigated gall to
react badly when she oh so nobly reveals her recent indiscretion to him
with her department head and mentor. Shame on him and how dare he try
to shackle her sexuality or some similar clap trap they like to spout
in LA these days.The course of this film is so utterly predictable that no sooner had
Rhys Ifans' character been introduced my wife declared "oh well I guess
we know who she's hooking up with already." Not to worry though despite
having shattered Segel's life in multiple ways and after having spent
several sleeping her way into a highly coveted job but not realizing it
because she's so innocent and clearly entitled to the job Emily Blunt
has "earned" she will ultimately rescue Jason from the clutches of a 23
year old bombshell and their empty, obviously meaningless relationship.
But hey, that is after all how how real life works and we all know that
every man is just waiting to have the constant affection and physical
attention of a younger beautiful woman replaced by the stiletto heal,
lash and leash held by the hand of the much less attractive but clearly
more introspective and deep academic. *pfffth* I'm sorry but I'm
laughing as I type this. Not because anything in the film but because I
do realize this is how Hollywood view the world. Of course their
reunion won't come because she realizes she made the mistake and did
her ex-wrong, of course not she perfect so that's not possible. No it
only happens after her mentor is revealed to be just another sex crazed
power hungry male who ends up telling her she's easily replaced by the
next class of groupies and Jason Realizes how badly he needs the
presence of his former emotional dominatrix in his life in order to be
complete and runs of to purse her.I'm probably repeating myself having commented on other equally
appalling, anti-male films of the "romantic comedy" genre, but if you
laugh at any point in this movie or found it the least be redeeming,
you should probably seek our professional help to get to the bottom of
your deep seated hostility toward men.
