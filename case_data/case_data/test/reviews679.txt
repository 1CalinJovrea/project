Enjoyable? -Yes. Good? -Not really

I got to see this movie in a theater with a friend who hasn't seen the
original and is generally not very familiar with old spaghetti
westerns. I think that's important to point out as we had somewhat
different thoughts about the flick.The movie was enjoyable as my rating states. However I must say that
it's hard to point out anything good about it. The plot is straight up
one of the worst revenge stories and full of ridiculous clichés.
There's no character development nor are there really any interesting
or unique characters. All the common western clichés are used and
there's really nothing unexpected about the plot.Yet I somehow managed enjoy this film. The action is good and humor is
opportune. It just feels like a good western. The plot is crap, but
then again the original one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling
either. My friend said it was one of the best movies he's seen lately,
though I must differ. I had fun for sure, but can't really say that I'd
recommend this to anyone looking for an actually good flick.
