We need more movies like this!!!!!!! FANTASTIC !!!!!!!

I had the opportunity to see a screening of this at the Regal Theatre
in Florida on Apr 2nd. We were asked after the film if we wanted to
talk about the movie to the camera. They were doing a commercial. I
would have loved to, however I was to emotional. This was so down to
earth. The absolute best movie I have ever seen in a long time. The
movie will make you laugh, make you cry, and touch your heart! From the
beginning to the end you will not be disappointed. Thank you Nicolas
Sparks!!! Well done. Look forward to the next one. If we had more
movies out there like this, the world would be a better place. I am not
one to usually review movies, I pretty much go twice a week. I see
everything from horror to science fiction. You will enjoy this from
start to end.
