Offensive

This movie basically portrays the nation of Belarus as a terrorist
state. There is actually a scene where a truck full of explosives plows
into a crowd of people. Given the fact this has been used a method to
commit real terrorist acts across Europe in recent years, it is
absolutely shameful they would add this into the movie. If you're
eastern European, Belarusian particularly, this movie seems like an
attack on you.
