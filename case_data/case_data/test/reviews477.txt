Rudyard Wouldn't Be Happy

In a word... "Flat." Seeing this remake only left me wanting to see the
old cartoon once again. I loved the old cartoon as a kid and can easily
recall many details decades later. Conversely, I just saw the new one
and it just blends in with a bunch of other fantasy-adventure
/superhero / CGI remakes of late.In general, this remake just felt like it had no soul.In particular, they didn't develop the characters much. It was obvious
the film-makers didn't care about the main characters much so why
should we either? I guess the special effects or CGI were impressive,
especially the talking animals, but that's been done so much its just
not a big deal anymore. They can't base a whole movie on those effects
anymore and just touch on a few songs. The singing and music in the old
version was so much more developed, energetic and memorable.The guest voice-overs were good but too recognizable. I kept thinking
of Bill Murray talking into a mic instead of watching the fake bear
talk. To be fair, Ben Kingsley pulled off the character very smoothly.
But why did they make that orangutang so huge? Was he King Kong's lost
brother? And voiced by Christopher Walken it really didn't make sense.
Jungle animals are already awesome, you don't need to enlarge them or
make up new ones.A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from
the pit. More of this tenderness would have been welcome, which brings
me to the next point...This story was always potentially very violent; we're talking about
jungle law here- brutal life and death is always near. But while the
old cartoon version separated that violence enough from reality to make
it safe and enjoyable for a younger audience, the new one crossed the
line. It was too real, in my opinion, for most kids under about 11 or
so. True, many kids play violent computer games from earlier ages now,
so some would argue they can "handle it", but is that the kind of trend
for them you want to support? I would argue the more we desensitize the
youth now, the less sensitive they will be later on when they may be
taking care of us when we're seniors. Do we want such thoroughly
insensitive people running society in the future? So, while yes- it was
exciting, I think this production really narrowed their audience down
to the preteens (for whom it may be too violent) and the teenagers (for
whom it may be too kiddie- you know with the talking animals and all).
So sorry Disney, I've so often loved your movies, but not this time.
