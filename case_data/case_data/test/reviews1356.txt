"Black Mass" is all but Great

I try not to get my hopes up too much for certain movies, and "Black
Mass" (which I got very excited about) just reminds me why.Oh, Scott Cooper... how did you manage to make one of the most twisted,
unusual, and mysterious gangster stories into an emotionless web of a
film? From acting to editing, there was so much wrong that it's almost
surprising.My main issue was the nonexistence of a certain necessity: stakes. In
all great mafia flicks, stakes are essential. Would "Goodfellas" have
been as remarkable if it didn't feel like any wrong move would set off
a universe-ending set of events? Would the "Godfather" have been
considered the greatest film of all time if a war wasn't seconds away
from breaking out? "Black Mass" managed to keep a story that easily
could've had those steaks from having any at all. This was, of course,
caused by the emotionless acting, but more on that in a second. But
this film really made me not care if the protagonist (whether you
consider that to be Bulger or Connolly) lives or dies; and in a mob
movie, that is a worse crime than anything committed on screen.So the acting I blame entirely on Cooper. Every single actor did a
great job with what they were given, but the problem is that they were
given the wrong thing. For example, Depp was probably told to play a
silent yet psychotic, friendly yet intimidating crime lord. Did he do
that well? Absolutely. Is that who the character was written as? Not at
all. Same goes for Joel Edgerton's - who I thought did the best job out
of all of the actors - character, Jesse Plemons' character, and even
smaller characters like Adam Scott's. All those actors did well, but
not in the right parts.The list goes on with issues, so let's talk about why the movie got 2
stars rather than zero (therefore, let's talk about the positives).
I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film.
Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very
tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and
personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us
even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. Also, I thought
the shooting locations were very well chosen, as they really captured
the narrow-mindedness of the lead characters' lives.So should you see this movie? -If you love mafia movies of any shape or
size, then go see it. -If you love Johnny Depp, wait until it comes out
on demand. -If you don't love mafia movies, haven't seen many mafia
movies, or just have none of the listed qualities above, then don't see
this film.
