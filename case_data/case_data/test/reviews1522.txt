If music be the food of love

Once again, Carney wins me.I'll let the other reviewers introduce you to the characters and the
plot, I'll just say this -- for me, this is a perfect movie. It took
hold of me from the start, took me down to the depths, up to the
heights, and never let me go until the last frame. Perfect execution:
casting, performances, writing. The actors just nail it, especially
Knightley and Ruffalo, though I would have liked to have seen more done
with Catherine Keener.I rarely watch movies twice, but there are people I want to share this
with, and I ordered the soundtrack as soon as I returned home.How will they finish this, I kept thinking toward the end. The answer?
Perfectly.
