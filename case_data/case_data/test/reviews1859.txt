Bradley Cooper is brilliantly convincing!

Definitely worth seeing if you enjoy fine dining, haute cuisine, or are
simply a Bradley Cooper fan. Convincing performances by a great cast.
Cooper is brilliant and continues to reveal the depth of his talent. Burnt offers a unique perspective and behind the scenes peek into
professional kitchens, which I found fascinating and gave me a new
appreciation for the demands, artistry, and creative genius of great
chefs. The message on the need for professional counseling and support for
someone whose life has self-destructed through substance abuse was in
balance. Watching Cooper's character struggle to start anew while still
afraid to face his demons is a story line relevant to many. Excellent
movie!
