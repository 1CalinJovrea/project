What was the movie's name? Labyrinth?

Thank God for Whalberg and Washington. They do have chemistry, can keep
you engaged with almost whatever you give them. In fact, if there's
anything to praise about this film is its casting choices. When we
start picking it apart, it gets, to say the least, quite confusing.Has anyone ever heard less is more? In this case, we are somewhat led
to believe that we are going to be entertained by the pairing of two
agents looking for roughly $3 million dollars. Things get complicated
with the arrival of drug dealers, the CIA, and the Navy. Add to that an
old flame, and a few double crossings, double-double crossings, and
quite a few border crossings, and soon you're exhausted, and the only
thing you want is for this END.It amazes me the level of physical comedy both Whalberg and Washington
can handle, and it's a pity that their fabulous comedic resources are
not better served. Instead there is the regular mix of obscene
references and jokes, as if there is no other way to get audiences
interested. It appeals to the lowest common denominator, and in these
modern times, if a movie is to succeed, it needs to demand repeated
viewings, and this is not happening here.Yes, there are a few set pieces that Hollywood is capable of doing, but
they are few, and they really don't amount to much because by the time
they happen, we're too exhausted to care, and other than the Bromance
of the main actors, everyone could just walk off the picture, and
nothing would matter.It'd be interesting if these two actors would team up again, using a
similar, more refined formula. Next time they should demand at least a
writer that can stay focused, and find a story that can at least seem
realistic. It's been done before.
