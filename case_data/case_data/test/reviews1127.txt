Amazing Spiderman a total failure

This movie is a cash-in.First thing that occurred to me was that I
previously saw everything worth watching in the movie's trailer.For
example, note that Spidey's swinging scenes which are spread out in the
trailer ended up being one scene in the movie (the crane scene)!Also,I
didn't see ONE new bit of action in the movie that I hadn't already
seen in the trailer and if I did,it was not a highlight.It really gets
on my nerves when Hollywood manages to fool me with an impressive
trailer that I am going to see a good movie, only to discover that it's
far from that.It is more than obvious that everyone's eyes are on the Parker
character, played by Garfield.I believe he did a decent job with what
he was given and if at times there was some awkwardness with the
character,it wasn't his fault.The bad thing is at some points I got a
"Harry Potter" feeling by him.The rest of the cast did well,Stone was
great and cute,Field and Sheen felt like cameo appearances just to help
the film sell more(although happy to have seen them),Leary was very
fitting to the role of captain Stacey and Ifans was sufficient as
Connors(again he did nothing wrong,not his fault that his character was
poorly developed). I also got a question here: would a half-arm person
lift his sleeve up to the point where his rest arm is shown unless he
is a beggar on the street? I think not.As for the Peter-Gwen romance,it
was cute but I honestly think it never got deep emotionally.The movie
also failed to explain to me why Gwen got attracted to Peter.The film is about Peter trying to find the truth about his parents. I
honestly couldn't care less.And besides,there are only repeated
references of that matter and no actual clues to follow,another cheat
sponsored by the trailer.The rest of the film focuses on Peter getting
bitten by the spider (since the movie is a reboot) and then on the
lizard matter. Comparing with the original Spiderman(Sam Raimi's) at
this point is inevitable. The question is raised: is there anything
more they could possibly tweak/alter? Couldn't they stick to the comic
plot at all? It's as if they are changing everything no matter what.The
result was to go worse everywhere since the Raimi version did amazingly
well with Spidey's story.Huge example is uncle Ben's death.What was
that?No guilt was established for Peter as nobody in the audience would
assume Peter was obliged to stop the thief and Ben's death had no
actual impact on him,just a shallow crying scene over Ben lying on the
sidewalk. Since they like to alter things so much, I say, let Ben live
in this one flick!Connors is underdeveloped,so his motives are not
clear,lizard wants to turn everybody like himself, although able to
talk (with fantastic pronunciation!!!)and be sane.I don't get if there
is a second persona or a crazy Connors behind the lizard,the film
doesn't really explain and the scene where Connors hears the lizard
talk to him only complicates things more.The director,in order to promote this film,boasted that this film uses
very little cgi technology if any.That is a big lie.Not only there is
extensive use of cgi, it's actually also very bad.I can't comment
further on this matter as it is something one has to realize on his
own.What gives it away is motion,colors are OK. Gravital issues also
occur as the lizard sometimes appears to be really
heavy(Hulk-Godzilla-like)and at other scenes he climbs and jumps like a
feather. The only action scene I enjoyed in its entirety was the car
thief scene. There is no cgi there as far as I'm concerned and it is a
very enjoyable scene overall(Garfield's humorous lines help too).The
flaw there is how the heck did so many police cars get there so
quick!.At this point I want to comment about the suit.I really hate
it.Had there not been the Spiderman mask,I would never recognize the
man wearing this suit as Spiderman.Mechanical (-electrical?) web
shooters are indifferent although faithful to the comics(let's give
them that),but I think Raimi's idea of giving Peter organic web
shooters was a real improvement.Like I said above, in this new film
they did EVERYTHING differently.The scene when Peter tests the web
shooters is far from realistic as he chose to fall off a skyscraper in
order to do that!.One of my first thoughts was how many times had the director(Webb)taken
me to Peter's school and Oscorp.Most of the film's scenes take place
either at school or Oscorp.I find this unacceptable unless this is a
television series or something. Furthermore,Webb never seemed to
understand what is important or not in this film and I believe his
whole approach to this project was false.Few examples:Peter Parker
being a skateboarder (!) while a genius geek at the same time.There are
more than enough scenes after Parker was bitten by the spider where his
hands glue. Spider sense was not portrayed properly.I could literally
go on forever.To conclude, there is no stigma,style,interesting shots,
there is nothing.I don't know where this guy Webb came from and I
haven't seen his other movie, but he did an amateur job.Take out the
CGI and production money and you have yourself a fan-made
film.Christopher Nolan did another take on Batman but you can see he
can direct,and his movies are really "heavy",meaning important and
professional.I fear for what's coming next for the Spiderman franchise.It is certain
that I will avoid seeing the future amazing Spiderman films.The biggest
problem is that they do no honor to Spiderman and tend to destroy him
before the eyes of us fans.
