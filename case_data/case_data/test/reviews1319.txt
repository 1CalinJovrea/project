Inspirational life not done justice by this movie

"Breathe" (2017 release from the UK; 117 min.) brings the story of
Robin Cavendish. "What Follows Is True" announce the big screen as the
movie opens. We get to know Robin, who gets to know Diana at a cricket
game and after a whirlwind romance, they marry. We are then transported
to "Kenya 1958", where after playing a tennis match, Robin collapses.
He is diagnosed with polio. Paralyzed from the neck down and tried to a
ventilator, Robin is given three months to live At this point we are 10
min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your
viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all
plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of British actor Andy
Serkis, best known these days for playing Caesar in the "Planet of the
Apes" franchise reboot. Here Serkis brings us a biopic of Robin
Cavendish, who really didn't die after just 3 months. Instead Robin and
his wife Diana refuse to give up and try to give Robin a glimmer of
hope and some normalcy. The man's life is truly inspirational. Alas, I
wish I could say the same thing about this movie. Andrew Garfield (as
Robin) and Claire Foy (as Diana) do the best they can with the material
they are given. But the movie lacks overall in drama and feels done
strictly-by-the-numbers. The set's production certainly can't be
blamed, and the photography is quite good as well. "Breathe" feels like
Oscar-bait but in the end simply doesn't deliver."Breathe" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in
Cincinnati. The Sunday matin√©e screening was attended so-so (probably
the sunny 75 degree weather had something to do with that). I had high
hopes for this movie. In the end I felt let down. I encourage you to
check out "Breathe", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or
eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.
