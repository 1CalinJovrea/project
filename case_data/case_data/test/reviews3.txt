A beautiful, heart wrenching masterpiece.

The Myerowitz Stories (New and Selected) is set around a dysfunctional
family reuniting, but that's all I'll say about it. No spoilers here. I
LOVED this film. It was heartbreaking and bittersweet but it also hit
me in a tonne of great ways and had me on the verge of tears, whilst
also making me laugh. It has very thoughtful, heartfelt writing and
every single character is brilliantly fleshed out to have me thoroughly
invested from beginning to end. Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller give the
best performances I've seen from them and are completely captivating,
as is Dustin Hoffman, who is effectively reserved here, Elizabeth
Marvel, who is quirky and hilarious and Emma Thompson, who is fantastic
too. Every performance is so laden with emotion and power that it made
me almost forget that I wasn't a fan of the editing. Some very strange
choices were made and it took me out of the film. Some of it was nicely
done, but quite a few editing choices were jarring for me. But this was
a beautifully paced, emotionally profound and gorgeously shot film with
some stunning, surprising performances and a beating heart at its
centre. Please see this film, it deserves all the praise it's getting.
