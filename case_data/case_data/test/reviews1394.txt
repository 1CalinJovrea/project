What did I just watch.....

Where to start.AMAZING cast, high hopes, good direction, TERRIFIC cinematography and a
Dystopian future to boot....What else can you ask for????A script that does not read like a bad night of binge drinking.The storyline was horrendous. The female lead acts like she does shoe
commercials. WORST "Essay" accent EVER from Momoa. Keanu looked like he
had studied for the role of John Holmes, complete with just BAD
dialogue. Ribisi.....screaming at the sidewalk crazy, not cool crazy.
Albeit, Jim Carry was perfect in his part.This viewed like a kid's idea of the future. Confusion, dead end
scenarios, lopsided and pointless plot and to me it was like that silly
acting joke " Do the Oscar-worthy film, then the artsy film, to keep
safe" for...everyone involved. It's like someone said " Hey! I have a
breakout idea along the lines of Robert Rodriguez's Mariachi, that's
going to be BIG once it's made!...and laughed when someone fell for it.Wait for this to be on youtube, for the love of God. Do not spend a
SINGLE penny to see this. Hell, the effort of turning the thing on,
even on youtube, may be a reason to sue them for a loss of personal
energy, in the effort of clicking, to be subjected to the most amazing
cinematographic pile of refuse....I mean, the camera man was a God and
the only praiseworthy participant in this entire debacleMy title is EXACTLY what I said out loud, when the credits started to
roll. Proved to me that a great line up does not always equate to
satisfaction....or even something considered to be worth watching for
free....Yeesh. The 3 star rating was for the scenery and camera work.
The movie is a dead in the hole 1, on it;s own
