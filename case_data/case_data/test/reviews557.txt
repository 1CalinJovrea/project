Entertain us that's all we ask!

Two things: 1. Amanda Seyfried proved with this that she can carry a film, she's
like Dakota Fanning meets Kate Winslet.2. In this day and age where nearly every suspenseful theory has
already been explored by now this movie managed to keep me guessing.I have to say, I suspected every single male character just to be on
the safe side (I do that whenever I come across characters that all
seem shifty) and never doubted for a second that Jill (Seyfried) was
telling the truth. Wes Bentley is just a creepy guy and casting him as
a creepy cop just upped the ante. This film about a girl who escapes
(and is probably the only survivor of) a serial killer's den is
thoroughly entertaining without getting too ahead of itself. Great
script, great cast and great acting.
