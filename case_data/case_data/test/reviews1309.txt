Irritatingly Frenetic and Ugly to Look At

"The Lego Movie" is irritatingly frenetic, smug, and so ugly to look at
it hurt my eyes. Its message is a mess of predigested secular or Pagan
takeoffs on the Judeo-Christian tradition, not direct takeoffs, but
borrowings of borrowings. "Jokes" come fast and furious. They come so
fast you don't have time to assess whether they are funny or not.
Example: Liam Neeson voices a police officer, and he sings a few
seconds of "Danny Boy." This is supposed to be funny because Liam
Neeson is Irish. It's a joke! Get it huh huh? Get how clever it is? You
don't have to think about that, because another joke is coming down the
chute. There's something really smug and divorced from the audience about all
this joking. I can just see the writers slapping themselves on the
back, congratulating themselves, "Gosh, aren't we clever?"Morgan Freeman, whom I used to like but who has become predictably
ubiquitous in his unending God roles, plays the part of God, or close
enough in this secular/Pagan/superhero super derivative mash-up. He
tells Emmet (truth in Hebrew; not sure if there is any intended
connection) that he, Emmet, is the Messiah. Only the film uses the word
"Special." Same thing. Eventually the moral of the film is revealed: if
you believe in yourself, you are the Messiah, the most intelligent,
powerful, interesting person on the planet. Wow, that will make for
healthy and happy kids. Not. Luckily the film is incoherent enough that
many kids won't even realize that that is the film's message. In this heavy-handed movie, there's a heavy-handed, live action coda
that breaks with all that has gone before. The message of the coda:
suit-wearing, rules-following, heterosexual white American businessmen
are the biggest menace to the planet, and we should all be more
anarchic, creative and narcissistic. Wow, that's a message that
Hollywood has never sent before. Nothing that happens in the action on screen matters. It's one long
chase, with Lego characters turning themselves into whatever they want
at will, and flying freely. Since they can do this  turn themselves
into weapons or escape vehicles  it doesn't really seem to matter that
they are occasionally captured by a character named "Bad Cop" 
problems with authority much?  tortured, and threatened with genocide.
Yes, really. There are torture scenes in a movie meant for
preschoolers. I found the torture scenes hard to watch, not because
they were moving, but because they were weird and out of place. I sat
there thinking, what kind of mind puts torture scenes like this in a
movie for little kids? I found the movie so ugly it was hard to look at. You are, after all,
looking at computer-generated pieces of plastic. There is no sun, no
light, no texture, no authentic color. Just  pieces of plastic. The
perfect metaphor for this film.
