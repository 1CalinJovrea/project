A technically competent and self-assured slow-burning horror that falls a little flat in its third act.

'The Ritual' is a technically competent and conceptually confident
horror picture that does manage to crank up the tension without relying
on false or obnoxious jump-scares, instead using its ominous musical
score and brilliantly foreboding sound design to create a slow-
building sense that there's something sinister lurking amongst the
trees, and it's in the script where the piece really shines as an
example of a group dynamic done right because you honestly do get a
sense that these four men are mates who have known each other for a
long time and that they are all different people who react differently
to their bizarre and frightening situation; it's when the film moves
into its third act when it starts to lose its way a bit, and the closer
it comes to its eponymous ritual the less tense and unique it gets, but
the finale does introduce a visually interesting and well developed
creature that's only real fault is being shown slightly too much during
its climactic debut, a shame since prior to then it was handled with a
deft restraint that allowed the flick's infrequent yet visceral
splashes of gore to truly have an impact, which does happen right
before a little bit of a rushed and wet ending. 6/10
