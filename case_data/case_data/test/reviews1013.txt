A story, about a story, distracted by a Shih-Tzu, with guns

My friends and I went to the San Diego film festival this past week and
were fortunate enough to get into an early screening of Seven
Psychopaths, by Martin McDonagh. The film was very satisfying to me
personally, weaving an original story around rich characters. Story is
something that I take into great consideration when viewing a film as
it has lost a foothold in many films today. In terms of presentation, I
felt this movie to be a combination of Guy Richie, Quentin Tarantino,
and The Coen Brothers. It's hilarious, dark, gripping, precise, quirky,
demented, gory, and British. The frequent narration and character
introduction of the movie gives it a constantly evolving lure and makes
you feel like you're sitting by a camp fire listening to something
unfold. Even though their is a thick layer of narration and Peckinpah
darkness, it's fun as hell, with the acting a huge aspect of that; if
you want to experience a great story, that discovers a point to the
whole mess these characters undertake, and have a blast at the same
time, then go see this awesome movie!
