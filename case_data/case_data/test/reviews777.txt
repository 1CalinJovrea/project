Surprisingly Good

Wow,I was expecting to bash this movie,but was I wrong.The movie
'Blended' is actually a good movie.I will not spoil the movie for
you,but I will say I am still surprised it was good.When I was sitting
watching the movie,and I laughed,I was quite surprised.This is yet
another Adam Sandler movie.I have recently hated all of Sandler's new
movies.I despised 'Grown Ups',and hated 'Grown Ups 2'.Those movies were
terrible.'Jack and Jill',don't get me started on that garbage.Expecting
to be angry at this movie,I had very little hopes of this movie being
good.I watched it as a final chance for Sandler to redeem himself from
his previous disasters.Luckily,I ended up enjoying this movie and kept
turning to my friend,looking at him like are we seriously
laughing.Overall,a huge comeback for Sandler and meaning this movie is
7.5/10.
