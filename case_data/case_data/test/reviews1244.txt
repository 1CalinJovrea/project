Middle of the crime-thriller pack.

Based on Jo Nesbø's bestselling novel of the same name, this Oslo-set
crime thriller has everything working for it: a brilliant ensemble
cast, a sublimely intelligent director, a gorgeously enigmatic
location, and cracking source material. It's curious then, that
filmmaker Tomas Alfredsonthe genius behind Let the Right One In and
Tinker Tailer Solder Spyhas only managed a serviceable serial-killer
mystery, rather than the genre classic it could have been. The first
act does a terrific job establishing the bleak atmosphere, Norway's
capital shot as a perpetually sombre city ripe for the grim murders
being investigated by our drunken protagonist, Harry Hole (Michael
Fassbender). Around the hour mark the plot, and the movie itself,
starts to wither away; weird flashbacks to nine years earlier reveal a
weak and unnecessary subplot, whilst Rebecca Ferguson's interesting
supporting character is inexplicably sidelined for the final act. The
requisite climactic rug-pull is present, however it's effectiveness is
dampened due to rapidly waning interest levels and a lack of
unpredictability. The essential elements for greatness are here and for
a while it seems like it's going to deliver, but ultimately The Snowman
squanders its potential to sit middle of the pack.
