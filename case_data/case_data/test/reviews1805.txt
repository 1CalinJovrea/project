Homage to a Cult

I saw this movie three days ago. I hated it when I was watching it and
it has continued plaguing me in the days since.The story revolves around a father who shuns modern society by bringing
his family deep into the woods to establish a cult with himself as the
leader and his six children as his blind followers. There, the story
would have us believe, he raises a team of physical and intellectual
supermen who can effortlessly analyze the bill of rights as 8-year olds
and are able to speak at least six languages and are enthusiastically
accepted by every major university in the country when they are on the
cusp of adulthood. They are also fearless survivalists who run
marathons on a daily basis and must submit to their coming of age by
killing a deer armed with nothing but a knife.The story begins when the father learns that his wife has killed
herself and must rescue her body from the clutches of her evil father,
who has arranged for her hospitalization for severe depression because
the cult's perfect world can't support things like basic medical care
since they live in dire poverty. Thus begins a meandering saga whose
few interesting moments - such as when the oldest boy shows himself
completely unequipped to communicate with girls of his own age or when
the younger son displays resentment at the cult's insular lifestyle -
are either entirely unresolved or are unrealistically glossed over. A
scene (which I imagine was designed to show how cool and self-reliant
they are) has the father feigning a heart attack while the children
steal food from a grocery store because they are unable to pay for it
would be regarded as child abuse in real life. But because we are in
the fantasy of the movie, they get away with the scam and when the
grandfather (very reasonably) offers it up later in the film as an
example of the cult leader's manifest irresponsibility as a parent, I
felt like I was supposed to be on the cult's side despite the fact that
the objections were absolutely spot-on and justifiable.Unfortunately, just as the movie starts to become engaging and based in
reality - when the cult leader is forced to admit how ill-considered
his lifestyle is and is on the verge of leaving the children with
responsible caregivers - it lapses into maudlin sentimentality when it
is revealed that the children (including those who have expressed
outright hostility towards the cult) have actually hidden themselves in
the father's bus when he leaves to strike out on his own and they make
a beeline to the cemetery where the mother's body has been buried to
unearth it and hold a hippie ceremony on the beach where they sing folk
songs and perform a do-it-yourself cremation. But as the credits role,
none of the primary conflicts have been resolved or even addressed in
an adult fashion.I am perplexed at the many great reviews this irritating piece of
silliness has received because from my perspective, it was a waste of
time from start to finish. It was well made with uniformly solid
acting, but the underlying story was so lacking in sense or reality and
the primary character so self-righteous and unsympathetic that I found
nothing good to say about it.
