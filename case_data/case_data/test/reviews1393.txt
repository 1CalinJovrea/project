21 junk street

An honest review. I can't understand why there are certain people who
constantly hype this movie on the IMDb and criticise other better
movies. I guess they must be paid to do so. Certainly seems plausible
since I've now watched this crapfest. How bad is it? Do you remember
the abysmal Ben Stiller butchering of Starsky and Hutch from a while
back. 21 Jump Street is worse than that. Hardly surprising given that
it stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. I've only seen Tatum in one
movie before and he was a wooden, dull, boring plank in that. He's no
better in this. As a leading man he's even more of a charisma vacuum
than Chris O'Donnell.Still at least he's better than Jonah Hill. Superbad wasn't just the
title of his breakthrough movie its a description of his entire career.He's been doing the same schtick in everything he does and if it was
rubbish the first time it stinks like month old festering garbage now.To make it clear I'm a fan of gross out stupid comedy but not when its
as stupid and badly-acted as this. Don't pay to see this. The good
reviews are fake. You'll thank me for the warning.
