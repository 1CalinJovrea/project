Sweet and Dramatic Romance

In Iraq, the marine Sergeant Logan (Zac Efron) finds the photo of a
young woman with the message "Keep Safe X" on the back in the debris of
a construction and he keeps it in his pocket. His action saves his life
from a mortar fire and he believes that the girl is his guard angel
that protects him.When he returns to Colorado, he has difficulties to adjust to the
civilian life with his sister's family and he decides to seek out the
woman. Logan researches the landscape and finds that the place is
Hamden, in Louisiana, and he walks with his dog Zeus to Hamden. He discovers that the woman is Beth Green (Taylor Schilling), who is
the owner of the Green Kennels with her grandmother Ellie (Blythe
Danner). When Logan meets Beth, he is unable to tell the reason why he
had traveled to Hamden. She assumes that he wants a job that she had
advertised and Ellis gives the job to Logan. Soon Logan befriends
Beth's son Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart) and becomes close to the family.
But her former husband, Sheriff Keith Clayton (Jay R. Ferguson) does
not want to make Logan's life easy."The Lucky One" is a sweet and dramatic romance, with pleasant
characters. The director Scott Hicks explores the beautiful landscapes
with a wonderful cinematography. The plot is very simple and
predictable, but the chemistry among Zac Efron, Taylor Schilling,
Blythe Danner and the boy Riley Thomas Stewart makes the film worth. My
vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Um Homem de Sorte" ("A Lucky Man")
