Metascore 68 on a teenage movie?

like everyone else, before going to the movies I stopped on IMDb and
read a few criticisms of the film - both those with better than average
grade, and worse. But I think it's finally time to wonder what is the
purpose of this time consuming ritual. because when a little thought,
in few years back, i found that just a couple of films is well
characterized with the average grade on this site. but here, not only that I stopped with this habit, I decided to write
my first review. for me like for many others with first reviews,
trigger is terrible dissatisfaction with seen. I did not read the book
nor did I know until yesterday that this film is another adaptation.
for the book I do not know, but the movie turned out, on my sorrow, to
be for children up to 14 years maximum - the magic of 21st century and
advertising machinery. After the first few minutes of the film when you realize you're 28 year
old who is stuck with teenage movie and after you realize what would
not just the end, but everything, look like, you tell yourself: ''sit
back and at least try to enjoy visual side of the movie''. but that too
ceases to be an option once you realize that you are about throw up
because some producer decided it was more fun instead of continuous
motion of camera to record in the way: cut-ear, cut-leg, cut-tree in
the background,cut-somebody runs, cut-Hair... and all that in 0.3
second and from different - all possible angles. must be seen to be
believed. but even that is not the worst, because imagine what the
feeling of nausea you get when you realize that the hour of the movie
is spent to describe the characters and get nothing better then awful
clich√©: bad guys are trained, arrogant bullies that smile too much and
of course despite the superhuman strength, arrogant like that, they
must be kicked by the petite 16 year old shy girl. but since this is
still a children's movie, you will not literally see bloody action
scenes where this brave archer girl kills super-strong and skilled
bullies, but you will rather see scenes where those skilled bullies can
not figure out how to catch a girl who ran away from them to a tree, so
they decide camp under a tree until this girl alone does not get hungry
and climb down. but because it was cold, of course, the bullies get
cold so they find it was smart thing to make a fire and warm themself,
but not too close to tree as it could catch on fire and kill a girl
they've been chasing to kill.:)To conclude, if you're not 14 year old teenager, this is not a movie
for you. don't get yourself tricked like I did.cheers
