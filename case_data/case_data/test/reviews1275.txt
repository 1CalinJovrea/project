Worse than Twilight, and I loathed Twilight.

--- SPOILERS AHEAD ---I watched this fim with a friend who has never read the book. I, on the
other hand, read it years ago, but wasn't interested enough to continue
with the series. However, I was willing to judge it as a film on its
own merits, not as a book adaptation. By the end of the movie, we were
left disappointed. It was rushed, choppy, unevenly paced, and made no
effort to define the world it was set in. All the characters could have
died and we would have felt nothing because the film did little to make
us care them.FLAWS IN THE FILM:- The script was so atrocious that we began predicting what characters
would say next during the cheesiest scenes. 95% of the time, we were
right - word for word. When Jace said to Clary, "I told you I'd never
met an angelÂ…", I said, "Please, for the love of god, don't say: 'now I
have'". He did. We died a little. - There was zero character development. Clary had no personality. When
we tried to describe her, we could not come up with a single adjective
as we knew nothing about this girl. (Actually, that's a lie. When she
pulled the mortal cup out of the card in front of the witch who was
obviously a demon, and then again in front of Hodge, my friend yelled,
"How are you so STUPID?".) Clary was presented as the protagonist even
though we were given no reason to root for her or care about her. We.
Knew. Zilch. About. Her. (Beyond being prone to dumb and reckless
behavior). It didn't help that Lily Collins, while pretty, has no
on-screen charisma. She was just a bland attractive girl. The other
characters suffered equally. We could tell that Simon was nerdy,
Isabelle liked slutty clothes and fighting, Valentine was evil, Hodge
was sketchy, Luke was some kind of family friend (why, who knows?) and
Jace was the standard romantic lead with a penchant for sappy lines and
rescuing Clary. Beyond that, nothing. - Words like 'the Clave', 'the accord', and others were thrown in
without explanation. - We were expected to believe that the mortal cup was some kind of holy
grail even though the movie hardly explained how it functioned beyond a
couple of statements about its necessity for making more shadow
hunters. After all the build up with no clarification, my friend began
to expect that the cup's powers would be demonstrated at the climax,
making things clearer. Of course, this did not happen, and she was left
unsatisfied. We cared about the mortal cup as much as we cared about
the characters - which is to say, not at all.- The Silent Brothers were never explained. They were just creepy dudes
living under a graveyard.- The weapons were ill-defined. They just did whatever the characters
needed them to do at any given time - be it tattooing runes, slaying
demons, or drilling magical peepholes through bookcases. They might as
well have been Harry Potter wands.- Clary inexplicably accuses Alec of being in love with Jace even
though we saw no indication that he was even gay. - The Clary and Jace romance felt forced. There was no build up. We
were never shown why he would be attracted to her, or why she returned
those feelings. When they finally kissed in the garden, it was
uncomfortably awkward.- In a seemingly random act, Valentine wanted Clary to drink his blood
from the cup and no one knew why. Said my friend at this point: "Is he
Jesus?"- Loose ends. Simon is bitten by a vampire. At no point in the film
does anybody bother to tell him this. Even when he storms out of the
institute, Clary doesn't think to say, "By the way, a vampire bit you."
We waited for the effects of the bite to manifest - to find out if he
was a vampire or not. But in the end, we were forced to conclude that
in the world of The Mortal Instruments, being bitten by vampires only
improves your eyesight. - The werewolves only existed to serve as expendable extras in fight
scenes.- Speaking of fight scenes, many went on for far too long. Time could
have been better spent on character development so that we actually
cared if anyone died in a fight. - In the ultimate deus ex machina, Clary draws a rune that freezes all
the demons. No one else has ever seen this rune. No one figures out how
Clary knows how to draw it. It was like the screenwriters realized that
their heroine had been useless and needed her to do something powerful
to prove why she's the protagonist, since her talents thus far largely
involved leading others into mortal peril.- Why were they using fire to battle demons that looked as if they were
made essentially out of fire? Do we spray water to stop a flood?- The portal in the wall was supposed to take someone to the place they
focused on or keep them in limbo. How did Valentine reach out of the
portal to grab Clary after he gets shoved in?- Clary draws a cleaning rune at the end of the movie and magically
tidies her apartment. At that point, it just became ridiculous. Are
there runes to trim cat toenails and enable WIFI as well?I thought the whole Twilight franchise was awful but despite the
dreadfulness of those movies, the plot was never unclear to even those
with IQ deficiencies. I can't say the same about The Mortal
Instruments.
