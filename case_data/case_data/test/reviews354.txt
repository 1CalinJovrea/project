Need to Breed for Speed and Not to Bleed Because of Greed and those Freed to Feed on Seed  A Pointless Title for a Pointless Movie

The only need for speed required is a good fast forward button. What
kind of doo-doo is this? Guy meets hot girl, jumps in fast car, and
goes fast. Let me see, was there anything else? Hmmm  no. I kid, this
was not the worst movie I ever wasted money on. For one thing, there
are so many worse flicks floating around out there - and for another, I
did not pay for it. So  hahahahaha. Also, this review is not all
negative. There are some huge plusses I must mention. These jewels are
hidden under one huge pointless- blanket, and I will try to uncover
them. Aaron Paul did a good job  he spoke his lines and drove a fast
car. I was very impressed. Imogen Poots played the pretty blonde to a
'T'. She superbly sat in the passenger seat, and did a fine job
inhaling and exhaling - breathtaking. I almost forgot, she actually
talked tooand, I think the words she spoke were extremely important to
the plot. Hahahahaha  again. Just kidding  there was no plot. The
rest of the cast were spectacular. They put gas in cars, got beat up or
just plain raced against Aaron and Imogen. This is a must see movie.
