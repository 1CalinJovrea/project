Brad Bird delivers a gem

Sorry that this review is so late in the day. I have only just recently
got around to seeing Tomorrowland. All the acting performances in this
movie are wonderful and the humour is first rate. The soundtrack too is
especially good. A great soundtrack improves a story enormously. I
decided to turn on the subtitle channel on the DVD to follow all the
dialogue and this also helps on the first viewing to follow the
narrative better. I am supposed to type out a minimum of 10 lines
according to the rules but to do this I would have to put some spoilers
in and so therefore I am going to try and waffle for as long as
possible to fill out because I do not wish to spoil anyone else's
enjoyment of Tomorrowland.
