Highly enjoyable film!

I remember when I was young the Goosebumps TV show, but I was never got
into it, or the books they are based on past the the point of just
knowing who R.L. Stine is.It's a perfect treat for Halloween as a group of children accidentally
unleash the monsters from Stine's mind, by unlocking the books they
were written into. It's a fantastic adventure as Stine and this group of kids attempt to
put his monsters back into the books.It's a fun story even if you are not aware of Goosebumps, but I'm sure
if you are a huge fan, you'll get a real kick out of seeing some of the
monsters from your favorite book make an appearance on the big screen.It's not just a fun film as some of the monsters were real creepy. Like
the Gnome army, the giant prey mantis and especially a ventriloquist
"puppet" voiced by Jack Black (who also plays a fictional version of
Stine).It's a great time at the movies.
