My first Spanish movie -  The best one

This is my first Spanish movie and it made me to watch five Spanish
movies back to back . Since I am a very big fan of thrillers and
mystery movies i landed up watching this movie with Eng subtitles and
made me talk and watch similar kinda movies for next few months.
Awesome thriller movie with gr8 twisting story and brilliant acting by
all the actors. It keeps you engrossed and keeps you guessing the
climax of the movie which cant be guessed by a sane person . Don't miss
last fifteen minutes as it speaks everything about the movie . A big
thumbs up for this one. " The Body" movie will definitely be a part of
my top 10 thriller movies.
