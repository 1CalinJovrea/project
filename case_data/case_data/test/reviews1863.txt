A brilliant directed, riveting thriller !!!

The central theme lying at the heart of 'Don't Breathe' is the sense of
claustrophobia, a sense of being trapped/imprisoned. The director shows
us a number of appropriate images like window bars, bars outside gates,
prison like shadows being cast by Venetian blinds,etc. to drive home
the theme. This theme resonates both in a literal sense with the kids
being imprisoned in the house that they had planned to rob in the first
place, as well as on a broader symbolic level because it is made clear
that these youngsters aspire to break out of the 'prison' of life in a
financially ailing Detroit and head for California. This film at the heart of it is an exploitation film and certain
details get revealed with the passage of time that in keeping with the
genre of exploitation cinema, flirt with lack of realism and force you
to suspend disbelief a bit. But what made it very easy for me to
suspend disbelief and go along with the ride was Fede Alvarez's
direction. Without his masterful directorial skills and storytelling,
this film will not work, full stop. He elevates the film. The Giallo
inspired visual texture that he uses with the red and green neon lights
not just makes the film look vibrant, but also serves a thematic
purpose. His camera is extremely active and he makes use of space in
the interiors of the house skilfully. He uses extended long takes to
raise the tension and his use of ambient noises and music is subtle and
brilliant. The very first shot of the film itself is masterful in the
way the camera moves from an overhead position gradually to a ground
level one to reveal what's happening along with a gradual rise in the
volume of the music. Stephen Lang has to be admired for his performance. He brings a very
raw, masculine physicality to his demeanour that truly makes him
terrifying at times.I think this is one of the best directed horror/thriller films I have
seen for some time. It doesn't spend too much time in developing its
characters. Both the sides in the conflict are not worth unconditional
sympathy. The youngsters are low time criminals and the blind man is
not someone worth sympathy either once certain details about his life
and mental condition get revealed. I guess it was intentional on the
director's part to stage the film with a degree of moral ambiguity
where the viewer doesn't fully care for either of the two parties and
in the end it works within the exploitation film framework. To end, I'll say 'Don't Breathe' is a film that I would recommend more
for the direction than for the script itself.
