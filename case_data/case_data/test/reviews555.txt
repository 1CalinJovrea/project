Best DCEU movie yet--still doesn't say much

Grade: 6.2/10, D+ 1/10I'll just say it: Wasn't as terrible as I was expecting, but it was
still pretty lame. Not good by any stretch of the imagination, but far
better than anything DC has put out thus far. Patty Jenkins needs to be
given a pat on the back for giving DC it's first non-vomit-inducing
movie. Still, I wish WB would give us a superhero movie worthy of 2017
and not 1987.Gal Gadot did surprise me, though. When she wasn't TRYING to act, she
actually gave a good performance. The problem was, the rest of the time
she was trying to act, and it showed horribly. And it did not help that
EVERY, SINGLE action scene she was in that wasn't CGI'd was done in
slow motion. When she moved fast, it was always from behind and you
could tell that it wasn't an actual person. She still showed little
emotion when she talked, reminding me of a contestant in a Miss
Universe contest giving canned answers to stupid questions.Chris Pine was Chris Pine. Nothing good or bad about that. He turned in
the most solid performance of the entire cast, but even he felt to me
like he couldn't believe he signed up for this movie or the DCEU in
general. Probably had high hopes before the BvS reviews started piling
in. He did the best he could with what he was given to work with.Danny Huston overacted so much in this movie. There wasn't a single
scene he was in that didn't make me cringe (funny, because I was
expecting to cringe during all of Gal Gadot's scenes, and I only
cringed through the scenes where she talked).The secondary characters who made up Steve Rogers--er, I mean Steve
Trevor's Howling Command--er, little group were nothing special. I
mean, literally, they served no purpose that I could see in this movie
at all.The plot was nothing special. I've seen the three acts of the movie
done in other movies and done much better than here. The first act on
Themyscira was kinda terrible, with every Amazon speaking in a really
thick accent to cover for Diana's. It made them sound clunky and not
graceful, like you would hope Amazons would be. We got a brief history
of the Amazons shown an an ancient iPad which just made made me roll my
eyes. It was very reminiscent of the way Zod told Kal-El about Krypton
in Man of Steel, just not as well done. And Themyscira was pretty, but
Asgard in Thor was definitely more amazing. Also, they did not explain
how Steve broke through the protective barrier surrounding the island.
I suppose it was because Ares was back, but something somewhere might
have helped.The second act took place in London and Germany, and again, while it
was done well, it was done better in Captain America: The First
Avenger. But I will say the No Man's Land scene was probably my
favorite part of the movie, and Gal's warehouse scene did put Batman's
in BvS to shame. The third act was your basic CGI monster that you see
in most superhero movies nowadays, but Ares wasn't terrible like
Doomsday. But after seeing the final battle, it made me ask myself "If
Wonder Woman could do this, why did Superman have to sacrifice himself
in BvS when Wonder Woman could have torn Doomsday to shreds" so there
is no consistency in her power.The music was decent but kinda forgettable. They, of course, had the
Wonder Woman riff play during the warehouse scene, but that was the
only thing noticeable that I remember. Cinematography was decent and
the CGI was good other than on Themyscira which just didn't seem to fit
tonally with the rest of the movie. Pacing was decent, too. I didn't
really feel like falling asleep, and while I think the movie could have
dealt with a bit of editing, the only thing they could take out was
much-needed character development--though they really could have done
without Steve trying to explain sex and marriage to Diana.If you liked the DCEU so far, you'll love Wonder Woman. If you hated
the DCEU so far, you'll probably find it meh and not worth ever seeing
again--and maybe not even the price of admission. I got to see it for
free, so I'm not really complaining. I don't want my money back, but if
I could go back in time, I'd tell myself not to see the movie to begin
with, even for free.
