As true to life as Mickey Mouse

I normally avoid "based on a true story" or "historical" movies like
the plaque. It is one of life's great enigmas that a movie "based on a
true story" is generally more fictional than a movie based on a
fictional work. In the later, by definition, everything about the
fictional work is documented, in writing, 100%, and there can be
absolutely no debate as to whether a movie is accurate or not to its
source. On the other hand, a movie based on a true story may well be
98% fictional and no-one can prove if it's right or wrong. Basically,
with a historical movie, the world is the screen-writer's oyster.In the case of Saving Mr Banks we have a small number of historical
facts. Walt Disney existed. PL Travers existed. PL Travers wrote a
book. Walt Disney filmed it. The rest is pretty much pure conjecture.
We might speculate that PL Travers was a difficult woman, and that
maybe her childhood was the basis of her books, but frankly that is
anyone's guess.Anyway, onto the movie itself. There are a few good things about it. I
was pleasantly surprised by Tom Hanks, who normally plays Tom Hanks and
in all of his movies I have seen has not been called upon to do
anything else. I liked the very subtle nuance of his accent, and his
understated performance. Emma Thompson is annoying in most things she
does, so it's a lucky break she gets to play an annoying character
here. Paul Giamatti is a delight playing the only character with any
warmth, depth and humanity - the irony here is that his character, the
only one that seems "real" and sincere, is entirely fictional.Really it's not much of a story, much ado about nothing. The back story
about PL Travers childhood in Australia is a load of cobblers, a
truckload of clich√©s and flights of fantasy piled on with a Caterpillar
bulldozer. Take the mother's attempted "suicide" for instance. For
reasons which are difficult to fathom, PL Traver's character, who one
minute is 10 feet behind her mother, finds it necessary to go back and
get her horse to follow her mother to the river. And what mother drags
her child into the river. I mean, give us a break. And as for PL
Travers magically coming out singing and dancing during "Let's go fly a
kite", Heaven spare us.To its credit I watched this movie to the end despite its many flaws,
not so much because of the nominal "story" but in spite of it. In
hindsight the reason I persisted is that it recreates a time in
American history when things were simpler and when Disney created
fantasies, for better or for worse, a time I am old enough to
recognise. It is really only in this respect that the movie is
historically accurate and kudos to the makers for at least getting that
right. I also enjoyed relearning about the Sherman brothers, who, let's
face it, contributed more to mankind than PL Travers ever did, and are
surely candidates for the basis of a far more interesting movie than
this one.
