Theft is Two-Sided

The Logan family is West Virginia proud, and a little cursed. Jimmy
romanticizes John Denver to his daughter while tinkering with his aged
pick-up. Clyde is a technician when it comes to mixology at the town's
bar. And Mellie chops years off of ladies' appearance at the cozy
barber shop. The siblings found their respective fits, but Jimmy is gradually losing
his place. Picking up his daughter, Sadie, means knocking on a mansion
door in overalls. His ex-wife has upgraded, but he does not seem to
mind. Sadie was always his greatest treasure, and riches have minimal
domain over him. But his mountaineer comfort is expiring.Clyde speaks with deliberate spacing. His words only mean as much as
the pauses between them. Jimmy respects his brother with canine
loyalty. Clyde's superstitions do not hold weight with Jimmy, but
believing the theory of a hexed lineage is only liable to make one
timid. Jimmy gets drunk off of opportunity, and Clyde sounds alarms of
collateral damages. Together, they find an equilibrium of homegrown
precision.The boys are only 2/3 of the dream team though. Well maybe just half of
it. The adhesive to every joint is Mellie. Her greatest advantage is
her unsuspecting swagger. A confident sway that leaves bystanders
robbed blind. Even though she is the driver, she often rides in the
backseat. But then again, you always get bit from the snake you did not
see. The bonds within the family and the accomplices they hand select speak
to the genuine roots bedded in their Appalachian makeup. They can trust
one another because they are kin with their neighbors. They are not
required to divulge all the nitty gritty details of their schemes, but
they do owe honesty and equality with their partners.Intelligence is not geographically monopolized. Cunning and forethought
can find refuge in any common man or woman's mind. The brilliance of
unexpected victories place figures in regional folklore. Their crimes
are forgiven before they are committed, and a multitude of the unheard
strikes laughter audible to the highest of offices. Luck falls on the
deserving, and fortune rains on the humble.
