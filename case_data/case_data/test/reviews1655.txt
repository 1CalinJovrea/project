Great Horror Film with Some Christmas Comedy

Going into this movie I expected it to be a horror comedy with more
comedy than horror. I was wrong.Like many horror films this film starts out light and then becomes
continually darker. The start is a great parody of modern day Christmas
and rather funny. The movie gets darker fast and the middle produces a
great mixture of light comedy and dark horror. The last third is
surprisingly dark. The end you'll either hate or love. Horror fans will be glad they have a movie to watch every holiday
season. Those seeking more comedy will be disappointed but not by much. The cast is excellent and the performances by Scott and Koechner stand
out. Ferrell and Tolman provide great side characters. The rest of the
cast provide good performances with none making me wish there was
another in their place. Characters are well written and the development
is one of the best in a horror film. Characters are supposed to mimic
family and much like many Christmas stories the family is more likable
as it progresses. The plot is decent. A warning to commercialism like most Christmas
movies and specials these days except much darker. The horror in the
film plays like a home invasion. There are pure comedic moments that
don't ruin the tone of the movie. There are pure horror moments that
sets the tone. There are only a few horror/comedy mix moments allowing
a dark tone for the movie without being too outlandish.The only problems I had was with the lack of subtitles and need for
Max/Tom to translate for the German grandma and the ending will give
you mixed feelings. Come for horror and stay because Krampus leaves you with a nice present
under the tree.
