Ridiculous, entertaining and, ultimately, moving

Dom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the
fellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government
fellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit
of kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has
gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action
movies into, at this point, super-hero movies Â– Vin Diesel and Jason
Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be
proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was
stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red
car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly
entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government
seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they
have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo
plane in their cars? Really?).Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death
during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to
bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole,
this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of
clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the
awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit
to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a
dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of
tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the
character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend
and brother.
