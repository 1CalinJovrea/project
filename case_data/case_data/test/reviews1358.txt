Great legal drama,  terrible comedy, a few chuckles,  but lacking in comedy

Tits film was clearly a,cash grab, could've been great with less
schmazly scenes and better jokes akin to the first movie and many
mcfarlane projects. Spoiler where they discover weed farm was over
gratuitous and extremely disrepectful to John Williams jurassic park
music. Better luck on next film seth! I really enjoyed million ways in
the v west abs if course the original ted is classic. Hopefully your
talents will shine through on an original project. Best of luck on your
future endeavors. Spoiler next ted looks like son of ted. Could be
funny if well done, more jokes and less schmalz. Keep hiring the
amazingly talented Walter Murphy to do the score.
