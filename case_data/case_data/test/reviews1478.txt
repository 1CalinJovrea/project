What A Let Down!

I was looking forward to this movie for months and have read through
the books going on 3 times. The movie started out decent enough and it
looked promising. First problem I had was that hunger did not seem be a
huge issue, the characters seemed so pleasant not starving. Now I knew
that Madge was not going to be in the movie but there were some details
that went with her story that really would've helped explain and put
more emotion into the story. Oh well I could have dealt with that but
it all started getting shaky when they got on the train. The first
scene in the train did not happen in the book.Then The train ride was
OK. Not exactly how I imagined but I'm still hoping it will start to
get going. Well Haymitch all the sudden sobers up and gets responsible
and starts being nice to Katniss. Um... Did I miss something because I
read in the book that Haymitch was always sloppy drunk and used sarcasm
to communicate with Katniss because that how she operated. She and
Haymitch had unspoken understandings later on in the arena (which BTW
are sent with a little note instead of her thoughts). The "fire" if
that's what you even want to call it, that was suppose to engulf
Katniss' wardrobe was the lamest excuse for fire I have ever seen. It
looked like a cheap production trick. Let me just take a moment and say
I cannot believe they spent 100 million dollars on this because they
don't have anything to show for it.Anyways, my next HUGE issue with this movie was that the characters
weren't developed at all! I felt no connection to any of them at all
and I wasn't pulling for anyone the entire time. The movie didn't suck
me into a futuristic society that was so bent on keeping control over
all the districts that they produced a hunger games for entertainment.
It didn't show me how destitute and hungry the inhabitants were, it
didn't show the true horror of the games. It was like reading the
inside flap of a book. I felt like I was watching a true kid's version
of this story and that does not do it justice! On the games, the
Cornucopia was the dumbest thing I've ever seen and what was with all
the suit case looking items??? Stuff was supposed to be hanging off the
Cornucopia not in a huge neat pile in front of it. Katniss does not get
splattered with the blood of a boy tribute for the backpack but Clove
chases her and she runs into Foxface (not in book). Katniss in the
arena lasted all of like 20 minutes. There was not true terror about it
all .. there was no desperation.. no near-death experience for Katniss.
No folks, she doesn't get dehydrated in the movie.Oh when Katniss gets
burned she throws herself into the lake and here come Cato an the
careers and they are like "look there she is! let's get her! Yeah!let's
get her!" It was like watching bullies at school not kids trying to
kill each other. You know if the subject matter is too adult for kids
make rated "R" don't water down such an awesome story! If they had to
be so politically correct as to not offend anyone on the subject matter
why even bother making a movie.When Cato and careers see smoke they leave a kid behind (doesn't happen
in the book) Foxface somehow sneaks directly behind him and stills food
without him knowing. Katniss blows up supplies does NOT lose her
hearing or have a bloody ear. Cato just puts his hands on the kids face
and twists it sounds cool it wasn't.Rue initiates the alliance in the movie. They spend like 5 seconds
getting to know each other and then Rue's death (which Katniss proceeds
to get her out of the net before she has a spear thrown into her)then
Katniss cries uncontrollably for like 10 minutes.Peeta did not get blood poisoning. He barely was scratched. His
medicine was a cream not a syringe. Katniss did not pass out with her
injury she "shared" Peeta's cream. UGH. typing this makes me sick. The
cave scene lasted all of 2 seconds.Muttations aren't anything like the book describes they looked like
over-sized dogs. Peeta doesn't hobble the Cornucopia cause his leg is
all better. Cato is already on it when they get there and they fight on
top.. Cato talks nonstop for 5 minutes katniss finally shoots. Then 2
seconds later she shoots an arrow and kills him so much for listening
to him all night. Yes this is gruesome stuff yes it is horrible but
horrible things happen every day and we publicize them! Don't tell me
we can't make a movie and not put violence in it.It's so much more than
kids killing kids yes this is awful but it's about the capitol and its
control over the people and the dictatorship.I do not recommend this movie just re-read the books instead of going
to the theater and wasting your money which BTW is all the producers of
this movie wanted they made no real effort to make this a true adaption
from book to film . I wish Jerry Bruckheimer or James Cameron could
have gotten a hold of this title. I hope someone will re-make it
somewhere down the road and have the guts to make it as real as it was
in the books.
