Babysitter from hell

It took itself too seriously in taking itself not seriously but it was
fun. Played very well with the typical clich√©s of a teenage slaughter
film mixed with elements of Home Alone. Its not a classic but easy to
watch and really entertaining. Acting wise it was solid enough. Samira
Weaving was hot and fun. She has good comedic timing which was needed
for the role. Judah Lewis held himself very well too although they
overplayed the nerdy nature of his character. I liked that it made fun
of todays youth where everything that counts is instagram and self
exposure. Good soundtrack too. But yeah just too over the top at times.
