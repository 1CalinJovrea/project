Not your average superhero

For those who are familiar with the character Deadpool, this film does
him justice. For those new to the character and his story, you're in
for a treat. Needless to say, I was excited about seeing this movie for
the first time. As a character, Deadpool is the embodiment of comedy,
parody, and slapstick while still delivering a satisfactory level of
gore and mayhem. Ryan Reynolds gave his character a new, refreshed life
which was much needed after his unfortunate and painfully inaccurate
portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. If you love the action-packed Marvel universe but also crave a healthy
dose of humor and a surprising amount of heart, then search no more.
This film satisfies on so many levels and the laughs will keep you
coming for more, time and again.
