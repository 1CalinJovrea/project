Really odd but not in good way

The house October built 2015Not sure want to make of this , I thought it had a decent plot at first There some good haunted house scenes but when the really scary stuff
happens to them Well it was not scary or it was just really odd and not in a good way .Most of time I was thinking it all a big hoax but it's wax not , I wish
it Was.I don't understand why those peolpe were doing what they were doing I felt like I missed a part of a movie.Acting was just annoying 3 out of 10
