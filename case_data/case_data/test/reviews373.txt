So Bad Even Shills Can't Ensure The Truth Won't Get Out

Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've tried
to forget it ever since. From the get go, the Suicide Squad anti-heroes are introduced one-
by-one. Then, once they're all given their backgrounds and clichéd
introductions, they are delivered to their new boss, one . . . by . . .
one. This consumes about the first 45 minutes, just before the
meaningless action takes place. What's really ironic, More time is spent describing their ironic
natures than explaining their first mission. Consequently, their first
foray just seems pointless, because it is. The character development was weak and I really didn't care if they
came back alive or not.HACK: In a fiction-writing context, the term is used to describe
writers who are paid to churn out sensational, lower-quality "pulp"
fiction such as "true crime" novels or action centered "super hero
movies".Batman Begins (screenplay/director: Christopher Nolan) is a study in
character development. Suicide Squad (David Ayer writer/director) is a
hack job if there ever was one. And yet it has a 6.9 as I write this, so I see shills at work. Time
will water this "dog" to it's real valuation, about 4.7 is my guess. I
gave it a 1/10 because it's was insultingly bad. PS - Will Smith is interesting as usual, but not nearly enough to
recommend this. This movie is a study in rote-cliché, predictable and
plodding screenplay development, and extremely poor dialogue. Dead Pool
is SO much better, that is if you want to laugh at super heroes.
