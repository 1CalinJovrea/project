Came for the shock, stayed for the quality.

When I first heard about this movie being described as shocking,
perverse, disgusting even it honestly perked my curiosity because I
have seen many films like that and not all to my liking.I came expecting something gross or even out of the top, there was I
point I didn't know what to expect. What I found instead was a very
well made comedy about a teenager with unusual hygiene habits and
dysfunctional divorced parents, an interesting well paced story with
emotional and realistic characters, great performances and a great
story that was well directed.What the criticism tells me is what we know so well, this film could
have never in a million years be made in America. American audiences
love and tolerate violence but the thought of nudity and sexuality
abhors them.I came expecting a John Waters movie, I found a great movie.
