Awful screen adaption

The screenplay is completely wrong! I was so angry I wanted to ask for
my ticket money back! I read all four novels and am not sure how they
could attempt to make the next three into movies. Amma is supposed to
be an OLD southern black lady who is involved with voodoo and is
continually places "dolls" and salt to "protect" Wate's Landing. She IS
NOT the Keeper! Professor Marian IS and she is also Lila Evers Wate's
best friend and colleague at the Gatlin Library! Uncle Abner likes Wild
Turket Whiskey and Lemon pie. Amma is a county fair winning cook who
lives at Wate's Landing and is taking care of both Ethan and his father
as she has done her entire life.The Book of Moons was in the Duchannes Crypt not in the Caster Library
which is only open on holidays when the Gatlin Library is closed! What
happened to the Sisters??? They play an ever increasing role in the
books. Without them Ethan and Lena will not get the maps of the Caster
Tunnels.Serafine does not die until book three. They killed her off in this
movie. She is an important evil, destructive force in the novels.Uncle Macon, a Dark Caster??!!! No!! He is a Blood Incubus who chose to
"feed" on dreams! He does not have Caster abilities at ALL! Where is
Link? The basketball team? Savannah Snow is a blond blue-eyed southern
belle! The English teacher has a good eye side and a bad eye side not
the history teacher. Ethan, Link, and Lena do not attend the Battle of
Honey Hill.Ethan is stabbed by Serafine on the 26th moon and Lena uses the Book of
Moons Ethan finds in Genieve's grave to bring him back to life causing
Macon to die. This fact is not in the movie creating more problems for
the next three novels in the series! The only good thing I can say
about the movie is RIDLEY ROCKS. Her character is spot on and she
steals the movie from the main characters. The casting for her role is
PERFECT!
