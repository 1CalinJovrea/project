A familiar recipe, expertly prepared and served with extra zest!

At an early point in Chef, the title character cooks a grilled cheese
sandwich for his 10-year-old son, Percy. It's a familiar recipe bread,
butter, and cheese  but the way that the camera lingers on the melting
cheese, and the care taken in how the food was served, made me want to
reach into the screen and take a bite. If Chef were a meal, it would be
comfort food. When comfort food is done right, boy oh boy does it hit
the spot. Favreau directs and stars as Carl Casper, a celebrated chef at a swanky
Los Angeles restaurant, whose creativity and integrity is compromised
by the restaurant's controlling owner. After a video of him losing his
temper at a food critic goes viral he becomes not only unemployed, but
unemployable. With his reputation in shreds, he decides to get back in
touch with his roots by opening a food truck and taking it  along with
line cook and son - on the road, rediscovering his passion along the
way.The pairing of sumptuous shots of food preparation with Latin beats is
hard to resist for most audiences, and the food shots in Chef are so
luscious and evocative that you can almost smell what's cooking. The
music, sensual and spicy, is perfectly matched to the food. There's a
beauty and a rhythm in the food preparation scenes and the amount of
them included in the film is just right, so as not to feel over
indulgent. There is also a lot of enjoyment to be had from watching the
performances of the supporting cast, and perhaps this is because each
of them play to their strengths: Robert Downey Jr steals the scene as
Casper's ex-wife's other ex-husband who is rich, generous, and always
looks like he's on the verge of doing something really crazy; Sofia
Vegara plays Casper's sweet, sexy, well- meaning ex-wife, who he is
still great friends with; John Leguizamo, always an interesting actor
to watch, has fantastic chemistry with Favreau and the young actor who
plays his son, and some of the more meandering scenes in the film are
made interesting by his infectious energy; and Dustin Hoffman adds an
element of compassion to a role that could have easily been reduced to
a caricature. The stars featuring in the film stay firmly within their
safe zone, and I couldn't help but remember what Hoffman tells Favreau
early in the movie: play your hits, because no one wants to go to a
Rolling Stones concert and not hear 'Satisfaction'. While this can have
the potential to be boring, it bodes well for the film: we know we're
in safe hands, and we're going to come out of this feeling satisfied.
Special mention must be made of Emjay Anthony, who plays Favreau's son
Percy with the perfect blend of maturity and innocence, and is really
the emotional centre of the film. While the film is certainly a feast for the senses, at its core it's
about restoration: restoring the father-son relationship, and restoring
passion. It's hard to ignore the parallels to Favreau's own career:
after breaking out in the 1996 indie hit Swingers, Favreau has in
recent years become a director of the mega-blockbusters: the first two
Iron Man movies, and the less well-received Cowboys & Aliens. Here, he
cleanses his palate as a director and returns to more down-to-earth,
feel-good fare (there's even a dead-on remark about Casper's/Favreau's
"dramatic weight gain". Ouch). A familiar recipe made with great
ingredients, Chef will leave you feeling satisfied.
