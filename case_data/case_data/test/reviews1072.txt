Annie is a little orphan girl, who is looking for her parents every
day. She lives in an orphanage with other girls. One day, when she is
chasing a running dog, she is hardly run over by car. The person who
helps Annie is Will Stacks, the mayor of New York City. He is evaluated
by what he did. So as to get more votes, he and his secretary welcomes
Annie to their palatial residence, and start living together. Annie
knows that he is doing for the election, but for her, it is a good way
to look for her parents too. How will the relationships be in the end?
Can Annie find her parents? This movie is the remake version, and the
previous one is shown a long time ago. Actually, I knew Annie, but I
didn't have the opportunities to watch, so it was my first time. I was
asked to watch this movie, and also I rent this DVD and watch a few
times. I really like it. The story line is very good, and heartwarming.
Also, since this is musical movie, about 10 songs are included. They
make me very fun to watch, and didn't feel bored at all. I totally like
everything.
