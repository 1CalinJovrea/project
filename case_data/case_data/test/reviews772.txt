Not as bad as I thought

I think that due to the sheer exhilaration that the conjuring brought
forward it was going to be hard to make a sequel/spin-off, but
Annabelle was surprisingly okay. The action started pretty quickly
which is always good to keep a horror going, the plot line was also
very fluid and flowed nicely with the horror which made it feel more
realistic as we get to see the characters. Annabelle Wallis plays very
well as the distressed mother as she can easily show her emotions from
terror to surprised she gives it her all. Ward Horton also portrays his
character very well as I truly hate him for dismissing everything his
wife says which I'm sure was very precalculated. I also think that the
film becomes more of a thriller near the end as the victim is the baby,
Leah. It truly makes my skin crawl to hear the screams of the baby and
the scared shouts of the mother as a demon tries desperately to
separate them. The best scene in the whole film has to be when Mia
believes that she is attacking and hurting Annabelle but it is actually
another doll but for that split second we are lead to believe that it
was Leah she was throwing about. On the whole it wasn't as
disappointing as I thought it would be.
