what a cynical exercise

I was really looking forward to seeing this film - it has an
interesting premise and two great actors who I really like.
Unfortunately the experience was pretty disappointing. Its like the
studio just put together a bunch of action movie clich√©s and just
pumped out another one using the same old tired stereotypes. Even the
car chases and fight scenes were the same thing we have seen hundreds
of times before. I really was thinking of switching this off for most
of the film - it was that bad. I can say, things improved slightly at
the end - and patient viewers will be rewarded with a reasonable
climax. The lead-up to it though, was just not interesting. Even the
two very talented stars couldn't make it work, and thats saying
something.
