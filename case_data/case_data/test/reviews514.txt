A Fine Little Chick Flick

Oh yes, this is a chick-flick. One that is a proper showcase to prove
Zac Efron has grown up to be a heck of a hunk! Also, you can never,
ever find anything to fault with any performance turned in by Blythe
Danner. She has been perfect in any role I've ever seen her in, this
one is no exception. I have to say that logic does step in and you
want, desperately, to say, "Oh for goodness sake, just do what you came
to do!" But if that should have happened, it would have ended up a
short movie, indeed. There is enough action, romance, gentle humor,
wonderful Louisiana scenery, good people, bad people, decent
story-line, fine acting.Â…it's a pretty good movie. Nothing
earth-shattering or Oscar-worthy happens here, perhaps, but it's a film
I'd recommend and one I enjoyed watching.
