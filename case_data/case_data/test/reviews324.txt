Well Paced Tension With Good Chemistry From Washington & Reynolds

Though you've seen this story before, intelligence agencies running
amok complete with moles, here you get compelling performances by
Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Set in the post "wiki-leaks"
aftermath, but before the Snowden debacle, it would seem the timing of
a story about a host of rogue agencies and agents, who answer to no
one, isn't too far fetched if somewhat hackneyed.Safe House takes the viewer on a ride. Starting with Denzel's
character, Tobin Frost, securing an ultra-sensitive file of who's who
among international spies, it simply doesn't take but a few minutes to
segue into heavy action. The filming of Frost's escape from a cadre of
eastern types immediately engages the viewer. As Frost exhausts his
"outs" he simply finds himself at the doorstep of the American Embassy
in South Africa. Frost, a turned ex-CIA agent, realizes he'll be
arrested. He'll take this outcome over the sure death which was quickly
closing in. Being an extreme high-value target with, perhaps, a most
damaging piece of in tel, Frost is moved to a "safe house". Naturally,
the safe house is anything but and true to the steady pace of the
action it quickly goes sideways. Enter Matt Westin, the safe house
host, whose boring job is about to boil over into deadly territory - so
much for boredom. What follows is a harrowing run from those who would
seek to kill Frost with Westin still believing his job is to bring in
Frost.The problem is a mole from within constantly gives Frost's location
away. Combine that with a CIA director who would rather "kill 'em all"
instead of risk the file seeing the light of day and everyone is
expendable. Thus, as Westin seeks to bring Frost in he begins to
realize the real enemy isn't Frost. It's the excellent interplay
between Denzel Washington's Tobin Frost and Ryan Reynold's Matt Westin
that keeps a story you can basically guess urgent. As already
mentioned, the story is constant motion. Inserted are some fully
realized excellent chase scenes both on foot and in vehicles. Yes,
these scenes are done really well as they drive home the dire situation
Westin's job has suddenly become.The ending has a few twists too which make for a satisfying finale. All
in all, a recommended spy conspiracy film despite a lack of
originality. Well done.
