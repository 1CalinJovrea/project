An absolute disservice to the source material

I don't even know where to begin with this, it is rare that an anime
adaptation ever turns out to be good, so I didn't go into this movie
with high expectations. Having seen the anime twice now I was
completely underwhelmed and disappointed throughout the whole movie.
The characters in this movie had little to no similarities to their
originals. There's honestly way too many things for me to say about
this that I simply just don't have the time to do so. I tried to watch
this movie as it's own thing and not compare it to the original but
that was basically impossible for me. If you're a fan of the anime and
manga, honestly don't even watch this, it's not worth your time.
