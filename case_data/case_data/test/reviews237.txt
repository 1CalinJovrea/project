An often uncomfortable drama with great central performances

A tough, psychological drama about the trauma caused by pedophilia. A
directorial debut by the Australian theatre director Benedict Andrews
adapting the critically acclaimed stage play. A cinematic technique to
parallel the real-time storytelling of a stage play of this nature is
to have a curious camera voyeuristically track action. This serves as a
plus but also a problem for this particular, sometimes hard to watch
film. As a spectator 'spying' on such disturbing subject matter made me
think twice about what I thought was morally right about the situation.
I also would have liked to have seen more of the characters that had
little screen time. That aside, extraordinary central performances by
the emotionally cold Rooney Mara and unflinching Ben Mendelsohn.
