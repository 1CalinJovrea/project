Gets better with age

Although young Michael B. Jordan has the title role in Creed the film
really belongs to Sylvester Stallone. Sly joins an exclusive club of
players like Bing Crosby, Paul Newman, and Al Pacino who got two Oscar
nominations for playing the same role. In the case of Sly and Newman
both aged naturally into the parts of Rocky Balboa and Eddie Felson.
It's hard to believe that it has been 39 years since Stallone debuted
Rocky Balboa. It's also 39 years between the nominations that Stallone
got for Best Actor for Rocky and Best Supporting Actor for Creed.But between that there have been several Rocky films over the years as
Sly has developed more facets to the fighting Mr. Balboa of
Philadelphia than I'm sure he even thought of when he debuted Rocky. It
all really comes together with Creed.But as for the story it seems that back when Apollo Creed was killed in
that fight with that Russian steroid machine Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV
he had a dalliance that resulted in a post mortem birth of an
illegitimate son who grew up to be Michael B. Jordan, character name of
Adonis Johnson. Apollo's widow Phyllis Rashad took him out of foster
care as his natural mother had died and raised him.Jordan has an interesting dichotomy to deal with. He's his father's son
and wants to make it in the fight game, but on his own as Adonis
Johnson. He seeks his father's old friend and rival Rocky Balboa as a
mentor and Rocky trains him for a title shot at the light heavyweight
championship. Rocky Balboa is not the most articulate movie hero ever developed, but
he sure imparts a lot of wisdom to Jordan. Those scenes with Jordan are
what got Sly Stallone that second Oscar nomination. Also Rocky has some
personal crises of his own to deal with. These guys are of incalculable
help to each other.I really loved this film and how Stallone developed Rocky to this
point. Like fine wine, Rocky gets better with age.
