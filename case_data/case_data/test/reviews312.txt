Another example of the destruction of creativity.

Much as people want to watch their sci-fi dumbed down in the form of
Michael Bay's Transformers it seems that the modern cinema going
audience, at least in America anyhow, are content with Paul Feig's
fecal offerings. I'm astonished to see this movie running at 7.2/10 at
the time I'm typing this.I can only assume that movie is made for twenty and thirty somethings
who have failed to grow up, are generally sheltered from life and are
intellectually limited. I thought Bridesmaids was bad enough. By it
seems that Feig has gone full out on Seth MacFarlane's vulgarity style,
but with even less subtlety than MacFarlane himself.Watching this you think you're in for an entertaining James Bond spoof.
Sure enough, the first five minutes sets that up nicely. It what
follows is a disgrace. In short, this has the potential to be
entertaining. But it is ruined by a constant barrage of vulgarity. The
thing is that unlike movies of the past that have had vulgar elements
in them (say, Blazing Saddles) the vulgarity is delivered without comic
timing and without any level of subtlety. Quite simply we see things
like (the normally wonderful) Alison Janney saying the F word
constantly and then hear her utter words like "thunderc***" and we're
told it's funny, because, hey, it's a swear word! This goes on
throughout the picture, from the initial scene with Statham to a plane
exchange between McCarthy and Rose Byrne, where the F word is literally
uttered in every possible sentence. I'm not a prude, I swear like a
trooper and potty humour is funny to me most of the time. But when it
gets to the gratuitous and unsubtle extent to which the film presents
it I feel that my intelligence is being insulted.Then there are, it seems, the other requisite elements to American
comedies these days, namely fart, poo, vomit and sex jokes. The whole
scene with the faked, erect penis, which we needed to see not just
once, but at least five times for it to be clear to us that we are
meant to laugh, just made my cringe like I have never cringed before.
Then you have vermin crapping on a chocolate cake.....because har har
har, isn't it funny to see a background character eat a fecal laden
treat! When not being vulgar, the picture goes to every length to
denigrate the appearance of McCarthy and Miranda Hart, with routine
jokes about how they aren't that attractive or how McCarthy's weight is
a reason for her character's undesirable place on the social and
professional ladder. To think that Feig has the audacity to claim he
makes these films to support women and that anyone who disagrees is a
sexist. Unreal.If you could get rid of the above then there is the bones of a half
decent comedy. There are still a few funny scenes, most of which don't
rely on the shock and vulgarity factor. But it seems that Feig can't
help himself and just can't take a measured approach. I shudder to
think what he will do to a beloved property like Ghostbusters. Slimer
with a rubber dick and poo jokes no doubt. Well, based on his offerings
so far I won't be going to see it. But the real tragedy here is the
amount of cinema-goers who now seem to think this one brain cell trite
is fine entertainment. It is ultimately not the likes of Feig or
Michael Bay who are the death of intelligent, creative movies. It's the
morons who line up to lap it up...and frankly they should be ashamed.
