Complete lack of darkness

I am very mixed about this film. Firstly, as many critics have singled
out, I must praise Angelica's acting, mainly as the first good, then
evil Maleficent. Now, while I could feel a little sorry for her being
unable to bring this curse off Aurora, having to see, one of my best
villains, Maleficent turn back into good is just unnatural. It ends up
looking like a beloved Disney film that has been changed for the sake
of young girls, who is only a little part of the audience, avoiding
simple but effective scares and risks, basically throwing out what many
Disney fans remember about Sleeping Beauty. Parts of the film echoes
parts of Wicked and Frozen. Of course, most people don't rush into
romantic relationships but seeing Disney seemingly apologise for making
traditional relationships in past films happen, even though this is
what happened in the era the film is set, is just horrid. I mean no
offence to Frozen at all, since it is one of my most favourite Disney
films of all time. But stealing the concept of real "true love" from
Frozen is pathetic. If it wasn't for Disney with its stupid audience
research, it could have easily looked even further into the darkness of
Maleficent, which is almost no such thing in this film.
