"I'll.  Be.  Right.  Here."

The worst thing about this movie is its title. The second worst thing
about this movie is its trailer. Both will either a) put people off
seeing it (it succeeded in that with my wife for example) or b) make
people conclude it is a 'nice holiday film to take the kids to', which
is also an horrendous mistake!This is a crying shame because it is a riveting drama and a superb
piece of film-making that may well catapult it already into my top 10
films of 2017. But it is not, I would suggest, a film that is remotely
suitable for kids under 10 to see, dealing as it does with terminal
illness, bullying and impending doom. For this is a dark (read pitch
black) but hauntingly beautiful film.Lewis MacDougall, in only his second film (after last year's "Peter
Pan") plays Conor - a young but talented and sensitive artist growing
up as a 12 year old in the North of England with his single mum
(Felicity Jones). She is suffering from an aggressive form of cancer
and is forever medically grasping for a new hope (D'ya see what I did
there?). Young Conor believes fervently that each new treatment will be
'the one' but the building tension, the lack of sleep and his recurrent
nightmares are destroying him mentally and physically. As if this
wasn't enough, his distracted nature is leading to him being seriously
bullied at school and there is the added stress of having to live in
his grandmother's pristine and teen-unfriendly house when his mother is
hospitalised. Towering over the nearby graveyard on the hill is an ancient yew tree
and Conor is visited after midnight by this "monster" (voiced by Liam
Neeson). Is he dreaming, or is it real? The tree dispatches wisdom in
the form of three 'tales', with the proviso that Conor tell the tree
the fourth tale which "must be the truth".A tale of grief, guilt and a search for closure, this is a harrowing
but rewarding journey for the viewer. The film is technically outstanding on so many levels:- the art design is superb, with the gorgeous 'tale animations' being
highly reminiscent of the beautiful ones in "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows, Part 1"; - the use of sound is brilliant, with sudden silence being used as a
weapon with which to assault the senses in one key sequence; - the
cinematography by Oscar Faura ("The Imitation Game") is faultless,
capturing both the dreary reality in a Northern winter with the
comparative warmth of the strange dream-like sequences;- the music by Fernando Vel√°zquez is used effectively and intelligently
to reflect the sombre mood; - the special effects team led by Pau Costa ("The Revenant", "The
Impossible") shines not just with Neesen's monster, but with the
incorporation of the root and branch effects into the 'normal'
surroundings. As the BFG illustrated, having a whole film carried by a young actor is
a bit of an ask, but here Lewis MacDougall achieves just that like a
seasoned pro. His performance is nothing short of staggering and -
although a brave move by the Academy - it would be great to see him
nominated for a BAFTA acting award for this.Confirming her position in the acting top-flight is Felicity Jones,
heart-wrenching in her role of the declining mum, and Sigourney Weaver
is also excellent as the po-faced but grief-stricken grandmother. Liam
Neeson probably didn't add much by getting dressed up in the mo-cap
suit for the tree scenes, but his voice is just perfect as the wise old
sage.The only criticism of what is an absorbing and intelligent script is
the introduction of Conor's Dad, played by Toby Kebbell (Dr Doom from
"The Fantastic 4"), who is literally flown in from LA on a flying visit
but whose role is a little superfluous to the plot. This is exactly what "The BFG" should have been but wasn't. It draws on
a number of potential influences including "Mary Poppins"/"Saving Mr
Banks" and "ET". Wise, clever and a thing of beauty from beginning to
end, this is a treat for movie-goers and a highly recommended watch.
However, if you have lost someone to "the Big C" be aware that this
film could be highly traumatic for you..... or highly cathartic: as I'm
not a psychiatrist, I'm really not that sure! Also, if you are of the
blubbing kind, take LOTS of tissues: the film features the best use of
a digital clock since "Groundhog Day" and if you are not reduced to
tears by that scene you are certifiably not human. (For the graphical version of this review, please check out http://bob-
