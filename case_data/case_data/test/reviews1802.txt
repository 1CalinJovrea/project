Superior craftsmanship on all levels

Jacques Audiard is the maker of the sensational, Oscar-nominated movie
Un Proph√®te. Matthias Schoenaerts is the lead actor in the sensational,
Oscar-nominated movie Bullhead. Together, they now have made De rouille
et d'os. Is it sensational? Well, um, yes. Will it be nominated for an
Oscar? Time will tell!Like those other two movies, De rouille et d'os is about strong
characters, fighting their way through life against all odds. One of
those characters is played by Schoenaerts, the Flemish actor who is on
the verge of his breakthrough in international cinema. At least, that's
what everyone in Cannes was talking about. Next year's American remake
of the Flemish blockbuster Loft might well be his ticket to Hollywood. In De rouille et d'os, Schoenaerts basically plays the same sort of
character as he did in Bullhead: lots of muscles, little brainpower. In
this movie, he succeeds in embarrassing, hurting or insulting everyone
he cares about: his child, his sister and his girlfriend. He seems
incapable of showing the least bit of empathy. His rude and insensitive
way of treating other people would almost be funny, if it weren't for
the sometimes dramatic consequences. The story is about the relationship between this emotionally
handicapped man and a physically handicapped woman. Although they have
almost opposite characters, they find each other in their mutual
experience of being different from the rest. His lack of sympathy and
understanding is almost an advantage for her. She lost her legs, but he
doesn't ask her how she copes or if she wants a shoulder to cry on. No,
he asks her if she wants to take a dive in the ocean with him. 'Do you
realize what you're saying?', she replies. He answers by carrying her
in his arms to the sea and letting her discover that she can swim by
using only her arms. Audiard knows how to let his two lead actors excel. Schoenaerts is
completely believable as a primitive macho who means well but screws
everything up nevertheless. And Marion Cotillard is cast perfectly as a
strong-willed woman who refuses to be confined to a wheelchair. I was
amazed by her physical appearance as an amputee - you'd swear that she
had her legs cut off in order to be able to make this movie. The visual
effects are awesome. But apart from the acting achievements, Audiard also has some nice
visual treats. Most of the time, the movie focuses on the actors, but
now and then aesthetics take over. The scene with Cotillard in an orca
show is an example of superb directing: the huge animals are filmed in
such a way, that it becomes clear something terrible is about to
happen. De rouille et d'os shows superior craftsmanship on all levels.
