Better than most and a nice surprise.

I thought this was terrific. It has all the elements that make for a
memorable movie  likable characters, interesting relationships,
interesting locations, a good soundtrack and finally, for me, a big
plus, an ending that satisfies. It's a love story with a Sci-fi twist
to it but the emphasis is on the romance between Evan and Louise.Evan, a young man from the USA, is dodging the police (due to his
involvement in a minor incident) and decides that it would be a good
time to get out of town. Acting on impulsive, he flies to Italy, meets
some people, goes on a road trip and winds up in a little town where he
meets Louise. Here is where the story really begins.Boy meets girl. Boy falls for girl and falls hard  love at first
sight. You feel bad for him because you know right off the bat that
something is not quite right with the enigmatic Louise. There's no way
this is going to end well but that doesn't keep you from hoping that it
does and hey, you never know. And then things get weirder and weirder.
The pace is a bit slow but you never feel bored. Normally I would find
extended scenes of two of people talking to be dull, but these aren't 
they're really interesting, revealing and intimate. The look of the
movie is also very nice. The country side and the quaint town  a
vacationers dream locale  and then there's Louise  what is she? Throw
in some history, legend, junk science and a bit of philosophy. Loved
the ending.Both Pucci (Evan) and Hilker (Louise) are excellent in their roles 
convincing and very likable. Good stuff.
