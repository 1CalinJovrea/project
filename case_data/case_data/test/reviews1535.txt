Olympus Has Fallen Â— America is under attack, to hell with logic

Olympus Has Fallen is yet an other US president oriented flick. A ton
of action and special effects with almost as many logical flaws.The acting is good, particularly Morgan Freeman (to a lesser extent:
Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart) and there's no denying the roller
coaster ride, but it has many shortcomings. Aside from the usual
suspension of disbelief, logic fails at almost every turn. Then there's
the poor dialogs, the easy retorts, the one dimensional underdeveloped
characters, the incredible body count, and the overly flag-centric
pride.It's action based entertainment for sure, but not much else.
