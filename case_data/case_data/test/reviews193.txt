So terrible it was actually funny

3 stars might be a little harsh seeing as I did enjoy this film, but I
enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons. Seemed like a movie made by
idiots for idiots. Anyone who is mildly intelligent will find it
laughable.Where do I start, the way this film was shot was poor at best, no scene
lasted longer the 3 minutes to try and achieve the same relentless pace
we enjoyed from the first Taken movie. This was even worse during any
action sequence where there would be about 20 different shots in a
space of 30 seconds showing pretty much the same event from pointless
angles. The dialogue, so cheesy, they put in every clich√© line from any action
movie you can think of, one dimensional characters sounding like
idiots. There was a moment in this film where Mills plugs in a USB into
a LAPD computer and the computers voices says "You are currently
accessing the LAPD hidden files" just in case people in the cinema
missed this. This movie treats its audience like they are slow, and I feel you
actually have to be to enjoy it for what it is. Some of the actions
sequences were so unrealistic even a 9 your boy would find it a push to
believe let alone us adults. Poor way to end a dying trilogy. Hopefully
it will now stay dead.
