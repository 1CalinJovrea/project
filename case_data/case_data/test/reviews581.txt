Bawdy romp

Loved it. We saw it at the Sydney Film Festival. The film will struggle to find the audience it deserves because selling
a medieval bawdy romp in today's market is difficult. I think back to
the 70's and there were many more of these.The cast is fun and the presence of quality actors such as Nick
Offerman and John C Reily show it is not an ultra-low soft-porn
production, though the titling could be referencing that at the start.I saw this at the same weekend as the Beguiled, also about a group of
women cloistered who encounter a single male. LH is far more fun and a
better use of your time.Set in Tuscany (no production notes on filming locations) it is
prettily shot.Nudity is not overused, there are a couple of breast shots and the full
frontal stuff is in the distance by firelight so hardly tittilating.
Nothing that was not done ad nauseum through the 70's
