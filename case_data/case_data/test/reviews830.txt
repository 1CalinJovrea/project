What was that

I've waited impatiently for The Snowman to come out for the last few
weeks and I have to tell that I'm not impressed at all with what I saw.The movie should be based on the novel of Nesbo, but it was very far
away from the thriller and the twists in the book. We didn't see at all
the passion of Hoole, his obsession of finding the murderer. The
characters were presented very bad. I've read the book and the Mould
Man has a very big role in the investigation of Harry Hole and in
finding the murderer, and in this movie i believe the spectators didn't
get why was he in the motion picture at all.Many of the facts from the book were changed, and even the main reason
for the murders and the illness of the Snowman were cut from the script
and this gave completely different vision of the movie. In the book The
Showman kills his mother in a cold-blooded way, when he was a child and
she is his first victim, and in that way we realize how twisted and
insane he is, and here in the motion picture, we saw very different
thing in the beginning.And the way Katrine Brat thought that there is a connection between the
snowing, married women with kids and the murders - this was totally
nonsense at all, it was kind of funny I can say. And in some moment she
should be considered as the Snowman, but that part was out of the
script also.And the top moment of this film was the terrible ending when the killer
fell in the ice out of nowhere. Who wrote this, and who approve it as a
way of murdering the Snowman?! This was absolutely bad, to put it
mildly, even if they wanted to kill the Snowman, there were hundreds of
different ways to do it much better, although this was not part of the
book ending, but when you cut the main reason from the plot this is
what happens.I thing the norwegian cinema will present this book in a much better
way, so I hope that this will not be the last movie for this horrific
thriller of Nesbo.
