laughably bad... but without the laughs

Holy mother of god this film is awful. I went with my eyes fully open,
expecting a tasteless, crass assault on the senses, and I was in the
mood for exactly that. Sometimes those kinds of movies are just what
you want even if you come out after feeling like you should scrub
yourself vigorously with bleach-soaked sandpaper and say a million hail
mary's.And this film delivers... half the package. It is crass and
unnecessarily rude, chucking in a few c-words for shock value, a few
boobs to keep the spotty teenagers (and spotty adults) happy, a bit of
violence etc etc. But WHERE WERE THE FRIGGING LAUGHS? I chuckled about
3 times, and one of them was because I heard my mate laugh and assumed
I had missed a joke (he was in fact, quite understandably, attempting
to suffocate himself by ramming his head into his Pick N Mix).There were a couple of promising moments in the opening scenes which I
can't even remember now. If I had known that they were to be the only
laughs in the entire film I would have made more of an effort to record
them. As it was I blithely assumed that there would be more to come. In
retrospect I blush at my naivety.Millions of my brain cells short-circuited themselves just so that this
utter toilet-juice could not be transmitted into my head. If you suffer
from seizures/are prone to heart problems/or are at risk from having a
stroke... do not worry, you are more likely to die from boredom/suicide
as you watch this brain hemorrhage of a film.Everything about it is annoying - the actors are annoying, the script
is annoying, the product placement is annoying, the music, the plot
(hahaha), the pacing, the *stupid* *unfunny* 'hilarious' to-and-fro's
between Seth Rogen and Rosie Byrne, the sickly Hollywood moralising ...
all *annoying*, and worse still sometimes just plain dull. How do you
make a film of this genre *dull*, I mean at very least you expect it
will tick along at a reasonable pace; even if it is depressingly badly
done surely the loud noises and flashing lights will stimulate some
part of your brain, yes? You would think so because you are a rational
human being and someone has placed a product in front of your eyes that
cost millions of dollars to produce; something that took months of
writing, planning, acting (cough), editing, all done by *professional*
film makers working for a major Hollywood film production company. But
no. I have sat through more exciting and rewarding bowel-movements (by
a huge margin, but then perhaps that's setting the bar a little high).
You probably get the idea: I didn't like it.I know I mentioned the 'comedy' 'back and forths' between Rogen and
Byrne, but I feel it is necessary to clearly state that you will feel
physically sick during these. They have attempted to make these
exchanges appear spontaneous, as if the comic tension between the two
of them was crackling and sparkling with such fury that the director
just said 'hey you guys, you don't need a script, you don't need me,
hell you just stand there and vomit me comedy gold'. Well they
vomited... right over your clothes and in your hair and in your eyes.
Like a children's birthday party where Uncle Bertie gave them all the
lemonade and cake they could eat *before* he let them get on the bouncy
castle.I feel much better, thank you IMDb for allowing me to undergo this
therapeutic experience.
