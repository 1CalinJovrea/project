Sandler's Best Movie In Years.

It is clear that Adam Sandler has lost his touch. He went from doing
hilarious and heartfelt comedies that only he can do, to stupid and
meaningless comedies and second grader can do better. Deep within Adam
Sandler is a gifted actor that can light up the screen, if given a good
script and a good director. Watch his 2007 drama, Reign Over Me. It is
his only movie where he does not deliver any ounce of comedy. By the
looks of Blended, he is moving back in that serious direction. Click was Sandler's last truly great film. I Now Pronounce You Chuck &
Larry (I found) was his last truly hilarious film. Funny People wasn't
quite at the level of others, but I thought it would help his career.
He buried Funny People and his other classics with bad movies like Jack
& Jill, Grown Ups 2 and That's My Boy. I had my doubts for Blended,
(you can't really blame me) but I can comfortably say that this is his
best movie in years. Best since Funny People. He teams up with Drew
Barrymore for a third time in a splendid and delightful flick. Although
this is not as good as their previous collaborations, it is a step up
for Sandler's recent string. I will start by saying that Blended has some parallels to Sandler's
recent string of movies. Those are: bad acting and no hilarity. The
acting is a step up, since you can get used to it, whereas you couldn't
in his others. I remember reading about Free Willy and saying over 1000
kids auditioned for the role of Jesse before settling on Jason James
Richter. Adam Sandler probably did 10 or 20 before deciding on some of
his cast members. That leads into there being nothing funny. Sandler
tries his darndest to incorporate as much laughter as he possibly can,
but fails at every angle. There were some parts the somewhat tickled me
and did grin at, but none of them were truly funny. Sandler has lost his touch in making funny movies, but he has proved
that Blended does not need true comedy, just warmth and delight. If he
didn't try so hard to make a gut-busting romantic-comedy, the result
would have been better. The comedy fails, but the drama portion
succeeds in ways I thought Sandler could never do. This is his best
serious flick he has done since Click back in 2006. When I said the
acting is bad but not that bad, it is because it subsides and becomes
good in the serious bits. Only during the comedy bits does the acting
become bad. Sandler and Barrymore go on a disastrous blind date with each other
then wind-up on an African vacation together. The African bits are a
joy to see. They have kids of the opposite genders, so they help out
each other's kids as they need an adult figure of their same sex. They
do so in touching ways. We all know that Sandler and Barrymore end up
together at the end, but it is worth seeing how they do so. In 2011's
Just Go With It, everything was so predictable it was boring. Blended
leaves for some intrigue and wanting to sit through it. There actually
is a point in the movie where the comedy seems to literally disappear
and the movie becomes all-around better. I am proud of Adam Sandler for
doing a movie where the seriousness is a true winner.
