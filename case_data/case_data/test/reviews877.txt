Remake of a remake of a remake

Why do they remake these movies when its already been done many times
before except this time its 40 years on yawwwwwnnnnnThere is absolutely nothing new in this version; as expected and its
far worse than anything that came before , James Brolin version was the
best and was just copied ...badly.Funny on IMDb the first few pages of reviews are; almost always .
obviously IMDb shills paid by the film producers to give good reviews -
i always skip to the last few pages where you get the real reviews, you
can always tell the shills they either have only one review under their
belts or registered around the time the movie was finished production!Don't bother with this movie its just another clone of a poor clone and
doesn't give anything new to the haunted house genre which is already
played out anyway.
