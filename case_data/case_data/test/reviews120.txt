Much more than a sci-fi/thriller

There's more philosophical and romantic aspects in this movie than the
IMDb official genre states when it classifies it as a sci-fi
thriller... But in all cases, it's quite a treat! At times while
watching this film, it made me really depressed & frustrated, but it's
also filled with positive feelings... I guarantee that no matter what
your taste is, you'll like this one (if not even love it) A 10/10 from
me, for an all-in-all great work.
