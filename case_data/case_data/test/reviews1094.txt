Worth seeing for Downey Jr and Duvall

Firstly I have to say that the trailer I saw for The Judge advertised
it as a courtroom/family drama with some comedy thrown in. Who doesn't
love the family feud type films, where the black sheep of the family
returns home for a funeral/wedding/divorce etc? And I was looking
forward to seeing Robert Downey Jr in a different role from Tony
Stark/Iron Man. What I didn't expect was a bit of a tearjerker.The story itself is fairly clich√©d. A lawyer (Robert Downey Jr) in the
middle of a messy separation returns home for his mother's funeral. His
estranged father (Robert Duvall) doesn't want anything to do with him.
He rekindles romance with an old flame (Vera Farmiga). It's the
performances though that make it engaging and stop it from potentially
being just another straight to DVD release.The film is beautifully directed by David Dobkin. Downey Jr and Duvall
are both excellent. Their scenes are strong and emotional. I also loved
Vincent D'Onofrio and Jeremy Strong (as Downey Jr's older and younger
brothers respectively). They are terrific. Farmiga, Dax Shepard and
Billy Bob Thornton are all great, but I felt they were somewhat
underused.Even though I think that there was a bit too much going on and at times
it got a bit too sentimental, I still very much enjoyed The Judge for
the most part. It is a touching and absorbing film, that will make you
laugh and cry, and if you are a fan of either Downey Jr or Duvall
you'll love it.
