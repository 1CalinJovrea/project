It's the underlying allusions to psychological analysis that stand out when the wit is weak.

No groundbreaking ideas or themes are presented in The Five-Year
Engagement, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Spurts of
slapstick, a dash of vulgar humor, generous helpings of uncomfortable
awkwardness, and a pinch of melodrama seasons the film with a cross of
genres and unexpected laughs. Although moments of sudden darkness cloud
the generally light-hearted mood, the greatest achievement for
writer/star Jason Segel and writer/director Nicholas Stoller is that
the characters are never despicable and retain a likability that
typically shirks away from roles designed to have dramatic, dynamic ups
and downs.Tom Solomon (Jason Segel) and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) are madly in
love. Despite a repeatedly botched proposal, they are destined to be
wed. But what starts as a short engagement with immediate marriage
planning eventually gets stretched into a couple of years. The lovers
decide to move away from Tom's successful sous-chef job in San
Francisco so that Violet can pursue a psychology career at the
University of Michigan. Head professor Winton Childs (Rhys Ifans)
manages to extend Violet's position there, spreading the engagement
into a five-year stretch that weighs heavily on Tom's contentment and
Violet's ability to handle his perceived lack of success in the new
environment.With most of Segel's comedies, embarrassing situations and an
inescapable level of coarseness replace genuine creative humor. This
film is no exception, frequently using sexual jokes, carnal activities,
venereal insinuations, and Segel's own seemingly contractually
obligated nudity to fuel the hilarity. The dialogue supports this brand
of badinage, although fortunately it's the underlying allusions to
psychological analysis that stand out when the wit is weak. Commentary
on the different ways men and women cope with problems is particularly
intuitive. Also, one of Violet's focuses in the psychology department
is to conduct an experiment in which subjects fill out forms about
their personal stresses. They are then observed either eating stale
donuts, or waiting for fresh ones to arrive, after being falsely
informed that such new refreshments would be provided. She determines
that people with troubled pasts are more likely to snag an old donut
than those without turmoil in their lives. Throughout the film,
occasionally quite blatantly, the notion that Tom and Violet's
relationship correlates to the donut experiment arises. Indeed, many of
the relationships depicted in the movie are representative of wanting
something new or being content with something that is imperfect yet
satisfying in the moment.The conclusion wraps up all the dilemmas too neatly, utilizing
contrived methods of repairing debacles and adding nonsensical
solutions of pure fantasy. It's still affable in production despite the
strict adherence to the romantic comedy formula, never betraying the
sense of general decency about the characters (even the love triangle
is broken up without the antagonist resorting to anything unusually
cruel). The supporting roles of Chris Pratt as moronic buddy Alex,
Alison Brie as crybaby sister Suzie, Chris Parnell as a stay-at-home
dad/devoted hunter, and Brian Posehn as a candidly foul-mouthed deli
employee are largely more memorable than the leads (although Blunt is
always watchable). A scene in which Blunt and Brie converse while
imitating Cookie Monster and Elmo, respectively, is impressively silly
and probably the most unforgettable skit. Suzie essentially sums up the
familiar joviality of The Five-Year Engagement when pep-talking Violet
into showing some enthusiasm: "This is your wedding! You only get a few
of these." - The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)
