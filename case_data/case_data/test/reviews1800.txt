predictable and mediocre

this film might have been good 40 years ago but in today's world, it's
predictable and mediocre. we've all been Twilight Zoned, X-filed,
Terminator-ed and Sci-Fi-ed to mind numbing proportions about time
travel. how many time traveling films have there been 40? 50+? after
about 10 minutes of watching, i knew the entire storyline and what
would happen. the pacing of the movie is torturously slow. the characters are 2
dimensional, flat. it seems like ethan hawke is just doing films these
days for a paycheck, the last decent film he did was gattaca. the
supporting actors just weren't. the cinematography was decent for the
night shots. the audio was good as well. the best part of this film, was the ending. glad it was over. if MST3k
was still around, this film would be on the list with Manos, Hands of
Fate.
