What happened here?

This seems like the result of some bad planning, they put all their
money into hiring actors and building the post-apocalyptic setting and
totally forgot about writing a script. Basically nothing happened, the
numerous questions that were posed remained unanswered throughout the
film, they walked and they walked but never got there. Is that the
meaning of the film? Never getting there? 0,5 out of 10, complete waste
of time.
