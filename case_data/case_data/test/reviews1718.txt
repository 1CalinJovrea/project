Might be my favourite Wes Anderson film

The thing that I enjoy most about Wes Anderson films is that they each
feel like a great adventure and in this sense I think Moonrise Kingdom
is his best yet. It tells that tale of Sam, an orphan on scout camp,
and Suzy, a misunderstood girl, as they run away together. At first I
found the two actors playing the kids to be kind of limp but after a
few minutes I warmed to them and I actually think they were both pretty
good overall, particularly Jared Gilman who plays Sam and even more so
knowing that it's the first acting he's ever done. The rest of the cast
are all pursuing or helping them in some way and there a couple of
sub-plots with the island's policeman (played by Bruce Willis) and the
parents of Suzy (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand).I thought that the rest of the cast was great. In fairness I am a bit
biased because I love Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis and
Frances McDormand but even so I have to say that they were all really
good, especially Edward Norton who plays the scout master, and Bill
Murray. There are also a couple of minor roles for Jason Schwartzman,
Harvey Keital and Tilda Swinton who were also a lot of fun. Everyone in
the cast fits into their role really well which is obviously exactly
what you want, but not only is that the case for the main roles but
also for the less important ones, like the scout troupe (especially
Sam's 'enemy'), Suzy's three brothers or the oddball narrator.Cinematography wise I didn't think this movie was particularly
spectacular, especially in comparison to other Wes Anderson movies like
'The Life Aquatic' or 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. There were a couple of
shots that were cool though, some really long zoom outs (which sounds
clich√©d but it worked) and the doll house type ones that I love and
think are awesome.I wouldn't expect to wet your pants laughing at any moment in 'Moonrise
Kingdom' but it is funny. There are a couple of laugh out loud moments
and as a whole the jokes are pretty sharp and intelligently done. The
reason I like the humour in this movie is that it's a part of the
ambiance and feel of it, it won't make you crack up but it will make
you have a smile on your face for pretty much the whole thing and leave
you feeling strangely happy.That kind of ambiance is really why the movie is so good, and is
possibly Wes Anderson's best movie. The whole story is this fantastic
blend of reality and child-like dreaming and it's wonderful. At times I
felt kind of nostalgic and sad that I'm not a kid anymore. On the other
hand it feels like a tribute to those myths and dreams of being a child
and it works so well. This is the kind of film that I feel I could
watch over and over again, each time spotting something new but also
feeling good and enjoying the overall purpose.Definitely go and see it!
