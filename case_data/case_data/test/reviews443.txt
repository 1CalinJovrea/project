Les Horribles

I went into this film with high hopes since the cast has some very
talented actors, and then I remember it was a musical, and most of
these people can't sing. "Phantom of the Opera" had a similar problem
with its lead performer; however the leading lady was superb, and the
direction quite spectacular, and it didn't hurt that the songs were
good. That's not the case with this big, horrible mess.In addition to being one of the most boring movies ever made, there is
very little to like beside some sets and costumes, and the fact that
Hugh Jackman can hold a note for almost a minute. Other than that,
Hathaway overacts, Crowe looks disturbed most of the film and appears
to be missing something. I can't even find words to describe the
emotions I discovered with Helena and Sasha. They finally met their
match. For years, these two have survived a few cinematic bombs, but
this movie is the equivalent of the Black Plague... Very little is left
standing.With a camera that seems to be on some type of epileptic seizure, a
very truncated story line, and one of the most incredibly unappealing
and forgettable song scores of the last hundred years, it's hard to
enjoy something that calls itself a musical, but doesn't quite have
anything remotely close to a melody. For more than two hours, one hears
something akin to the scratching of nails on a blackboard, and why does
everyone wear so much rouge? A few years ago the director gathered some
of the best British and Australian talent and won a Best Picture Oscar
with a very weak film. This type the trick doesn't work because the
material and the direction are outstandingly weak.If the musical genre doesn't suffer a painful death after this, nothing
will be able to kill it. If Jackman's character got 19 years in jail
for stealing a loaf of bread, I can't even imagine what a judge would
give the producers and directors for creating this tuneless torture.
Fantine was lucky to meet her maker in the first 20 minutes... We had
to endure 2.5 hours of this horrible experience.
