One of the best sequels of all time

Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen BR2049 three times now, and therefor i rewrote my review a
little, but my verdict is the same.One of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it's not the
time in the cinema that takes up my time, It's the hours upon hours in
between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer.
This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape.
And I've gone back to the cinema twice to be "tortured", but it's worth
it.It's a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a
possible near future where the human race is hanging by their
fingertips on the edge of doom. Quite depressing. But it's so
brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that
has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also hated by many when they first
released. "2001: A Space Odyssey" for example, which had gorgeous
visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers
back then. But what Kubrick did best, was to create afterthought.
People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the
movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade
Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, and it continues
the original, but stands completely on it's own, but it tells a new
story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to
be a copy, it's a natural continuation in the same universe. You don't
have to see the original Blade Runner before you see this, Though i do
recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the
cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not
to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has
now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league
entirely. It's almost weird to look at something so gorgeous, whilst
painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides
with your senses, your eyes say it's beautiful, your mind say it's
depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean?
At least do not confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is
bad, it's nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then
you will know how it feels to be a replicant that's trapped in a caged
mind.BR2049's story happens 30 years after the original, but there is also
three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch before you see the
film. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019
and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of
the things going on. The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control,
people are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything
together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is
looming just around every corner. It's a world where powerful people
take what they want, and do what they want, with the means they have
available to them. In many ways, not that far off from where we are
now.Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049
takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly
what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been
able to perfect, and that's what this films main story is all about,
and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the
"technology", which will result in him becoming many hundred times
richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is
so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself,
and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his "dirty work". In 2049
we meet his right hand "girl" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks,
if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it's her). Luv
is a "handygirl" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to
do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can't spoil anything,
but look closely at Luv's character arc. All the other actors also do
an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can't talk
about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it's heavy on your mind, and it
demands your full attention. It's one of those rare films who dares to
challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155
million dollar risk at that. The film isn't perfect, but it's close,
and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few
mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as
Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting,
every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully
crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it's the best film I've seen all year, It is a must
see, a monumental triumph of a film that's just as good (possibly even
better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!10/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve's next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings
Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I'm going
to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn. And we can't
talk about that now can we? might be minors reading this.
