A good hidden gem of a movie.

I watched this film last night having never heard of it. It tells about
the complicated nuanced relationship between a 40 year old man, Ray,
and a 12 year old girl, Una. The relationship is discovered and he goes
to prison to 4 years.Fourteen years later, Una who is still living at home and is seen
having very casual sex (in a restroom at a club), seeks Ray out.
Although she states he abused her as a child (and he did), she is also
very hurt over why he didn't return to run away with her like they had
planned.She cries over him not coming back after they had sex. She searches for
him. He explains he stopped off and had a drink to study his nerves and
then she was gone when he returned. He searched for her and is
arrested. Una appears to accept this explanation. They then undress and
start to have sex. He either stops or can't do it. She asks whether he
doesn't like her now that she's older.And then the twist. Stop reading now if you haven't seen the film. She
buddies up to one of his co-workers and gets him to take her to a party
at Ray's house. She is asked to leave but refuses. Una wanders around
the house and ends up in a child's room. She falls asleep on the bed
but is awoken by a young girl very similar in age and appearance to her
at age 12. She leaves. Ray stops Una and assures her that she was the
only one and he has no interest in the step-daughter. She walks away.
Fini.The story leaves us hanging at this point. Ray is a liar who previously
said his current wife knew all about his past. Later he admits she
knows nothing about it. At a minimum, Una needs to tell her that her
husband changed his name, abused her and went to prison for it. The
fear that you're left with is that she will say nothing because she
still has feelings for him.I understand the criticism about the long stretches of dialogue without
much action but the movie is based on a play and the movie maker does a
pretty good job of taking a lot of the staginess out of it. It appears
that the stage play was one primarily of a dialogue between Una and
Ray. It would appear that the film-maker used flashbacks including a
younger actress playing Una to "open up" the play for film. There is
also a useless subplot about the workplace where the film is set being
downsized which might not be in the play as well.However, the movie is a good examination of the complicated nature of
sex. Una may have very well liked the sex with Ray but it my opinion,
because she was 12 and not 24 when she and Ray were together, she was
damaged and remains damaged all these years later. Ray had certainly
moved on at the time of the meeting but Una is still stuck with her
confused feelings.
