Great to see they're still here!

I saw The Expendables II this morning at a pr√© screening. What can I
tell you about this movie. Firstly, it's really action packed. You're
blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story.
Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive
acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It
is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie
loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The
addition of Chuck Norris and van Damme to the cast worked out well.
It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really
pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most
will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwwarzennegger and
Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam
Hemsworth who did a great job and stood his own between these action
giants! Nan Yu as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she
was supposed to do.Aside from the "overdrive" action the film also had a lot of humor,
which gave some counterweight to the action.I hope, but quite frankly expect this will do really well in cinema's
globally. As a long time Sylvester Stallone fan I can only hope that he
(and his family) will find the strenght to overcome the loss of his
son.To the people who are going to see this extravanganza, I hope you'll
enjoy it as much as I did!
