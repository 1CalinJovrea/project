Captures the essence of the "Parker" character

I've read some of Richard Stark (a.k.a. Donald Westlake) 'Parker' books
and this movie pretty much captures the essence of the character. This
is not Shakespeare folks. The morality is pretty black and white in
these books and Taylor Hackford and the screenwriter captures what this
character is about very well. The only thing I found awkward in this
movie were the flashbacks in the first third -- but that's a screenplay
structure issue, not directing issue. Acting-wise, thought everyone did
very well with their roles. No, there's not a lot of depth to anyone,
except for perhaps Jennifer Lopez's character who makes it clear she's
stuck in a dead-end life post-divorce and needs an out. All in all, a
very good, entertaining crime thriller. I won't remember this years
from now, but it entertained me and kept my attention throughout. And
aside from all this, Stratham makes for one good badass! If you like
this, definitely check out "The Bank Job" that he starred in: he really
shows his acting chops in that one.
