An enjoyable B-movie hampered by abundant dumbness

(58%) A movie that could have quite easily dipped into crap territory
is saved by well directed and plentiful action, good production values,
Mr Johnson being a perfect leading man, John hurt calling Hercules a
"filthy bastard" and "Atalanta" (bow-girl) looking uncannily like
Nicole Kidman from the early 90's. The fact that it doesn't take itself
too seriously is a benefit, but I'd have liked the script to be a
little stronger and the humour to be sharper, as it does stop this from
being a full recommendation from me. That said it's still a decent
little watch that gets better as the plot thickens in it's second half,
but before that arrives it's just a little too dumb to grab my full
attention.
