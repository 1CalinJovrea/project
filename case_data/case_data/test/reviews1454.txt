The first rule of being a spy is not to fall in love with your partner....

The Gaffneys' lives are interrupted by the arrival of new neighbours,
whose stunning looks are matched only by the sophistication of their
lives. Tim Jones is an accomplished travel writer, and his wife, Natalie, is a
social media consultant, cooking blogger and heroine to Sri Lankan
orphans. The Gaffneys soon find themselves in the centre of international
espionage that gives them a glimpse of life outside their comfort
zone.........Keeping Up With The Joneses is one of those comedies that offers
absolutely nothing new to the genre of comedy, and basically borrows
from films that are a lot better than this, and funnily enough, a lot
worse.If this was made in the eighties, it would have starred Steve Martin
and Shelly Long as the atypical suburban couple, and probably Michael
Douglas and Kathleen Turner as the titular couple, and it would have
been an absolute smash, because it would have felt relatively fresh.Jump forward thirty years, and with films like Mr & Mrs. Smith,
Killers, Housesitter, and a never ending plethora of fish out of water
comedies, it feels stale, well worn, and relies on the star power of
the cast.The thing is, Galfiniakas is way out of his comfort zone playing the
Everyman, and Gal Gadot is incredibly wooden in her role. So much in
fact, it's setting the alarm bells ringing for Wonder Woman.So the couple get into scrapes, find a little excitement in their
mundane lives, and just like True Lies, assist in the final 'hilarious'
act when special guest star Patton Oswald makes his appearance as the
end of game bad guy.But it isn't a terrible film, there are a couple of amusing moments,
and Fisher plays the jittery housewife with panache, but you can't see
those two as a couple.If you want a comedy that is safe, and offers nothing new, then you may
get a few giggles out of it.Otherwise, if you never see this movie, trust me, you've already seen
it.
