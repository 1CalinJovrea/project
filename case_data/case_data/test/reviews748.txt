Yes and No

Yes this is a gambling film and includes just about every clich√© you
can think of. No it isn't any good.Yes Mark Wahlberg plays a gambler. No he doesn't hit, shoot, stab, or
otherwise assault anyone.Yes the film has several excellent co-stars like George Kennedy, Andre
Braugher, and Richard Schiff. No you won't see very much of them and if
you sneeze you may miss them.Yes there is some romance. No it doesn't work with a girl who is half
Wahlberg's age.Yes it's great to see John Goodman in a meaty role. No he isn't going
to play Jabba the Hut in the next Star Wars release.Yes I did stay for the entire movie hoping that the final scene would
somehow raise the stature of the film. No it didn't.
