That movie sucks!

So... yeah that movie sucks !!! I watch a lot of horror movies and that
was probably the worst one I have ever seen.Movie is split into couple different stories - guys loot some dead perv
basement, got his VHS tapes collection and start watching it. All of
the stories are super boring, reminds me Tales From Crypt with some
extra nudity (which doesn't help anyway). Killing scenes look like from
cheap 70' Italian grade B horror flick. Pretty much I had to skip scenes coz couldn't handle boredom.Cheap student like production. Boring and boring again. Don't bother
watching.
