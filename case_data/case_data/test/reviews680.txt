Good Story, Cliché's, Gore & zombies. Surprisingly good!

I saw the trailer for this film when I went to see Revenant at the
Cinema. The trailer looked so intriguing zombies in the 19th Century.So
had to go see it. I've never read pride and prejudice so that side
meant very little to me. I had no great expectations. What a good film! ( assuming you don't take anything with zombies in it
too seriously.)The acting was good, the story was believable, the characters were
developed and there was even some humour (Matt Smith added a lot of
this). Most amazing of all, it had lots of zombies in it. It really got
the balance right of, story, clichés and gore. If (like me) you like the look of the trailer, then you will almost
certainly enjoy this film. I've given it 8/10 but would add another point for being much better
than expected.
