A movie teens should watch. If you liked Fault in our Stars you will love this movie.

"We're not even friends." Greg (Mann) is finally a senior. He as
survived high school by trying to be invisible to everyone and not
causing any drama. When his mother tells him that a classmate (Cooke)
has been diagnosed with cancer and that he should hang out with her he
hesitates. What starts off as something he is forced to do actually
helps him to become who he truly is. If you have teenagers this is a
movie they should watch. The movie is a mix of Fault in our Stars and
Perks of Being a Wallflower. There is humor and drama in this but the
best part about it is that it feels real and nothing about it is
forced. The movie could have easily been cheesy and almost
after-school-special-like but it stays away from that and becomes
something that is truly special. It isn't anything all that original
but the writing and acting really make this one of the better movies of
this genre and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that could have been
very hokey but instead turned out to be very real and heartfelt. A
movie teens should watch. If you liked Fault in our Stars you will love
this movie. I give it a high B+.
