I can't believe I watched the whole thing

I could hear a thunderstorm outside, so I stayed and watched it all. In
retrospect, I would have had more fun standing in the rain. Early in
the film, there may have been a smile or two in the lines. Once the
gratuitous violence and killings began, I sat there wondering where did
I go wrong? I am probably too old to laugh at needless killings. I find
it about as funny as teen suicide. In slasher films, the body count is
the point; here, well . . . what's the point? Whenever things got
boring, another character was killed needlessly. The filmmakers at
least had the restraint not to shoot the dog, but had no qualms about
the needless killing of a friendly neighbor.
