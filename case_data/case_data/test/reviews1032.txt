The music in our lives

I was a big fan of the group the Frames and was very excited when I
learned about "Once" directed by John Carney and starring Glen Hasard
both members of the Frames. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but it had an
almost documentary like feel to it. Begin again for me was a statement
about how music affects our lives and how different songs can take on
different meanings for all of us. For my wife and myself , Ben Folds
the Luckiest has a special meaning in our relationship, to most others,
it is just another song.I loved how Begin Again opens with a rather banal sounding song being
sung by Kiera Knightly in a small nightclub as Ruffalo stands
enthralled. Then for the next 15 minutes we discover why.The movie uses music in that way several times and I felt it really
worked. Your enjoyment of the film will probably be greatly determined
by what you think of the music. I happened to love it. Even that banal
song soon takes on all new meaning. The entire cast is great and
Ruffalo certainly delivers one of his strongest performances.I have not seen Words and Pictures. My limited knowledge of the film is
that it might have a similar theme when it comes to music in our lives.
This is a little feel good movie. The kind of film that is a welcome
respite in Summer blockbuster season. Last year we had the Way Way back
to fill this niche. This year is is Begin Again.
