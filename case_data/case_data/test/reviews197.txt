Slow, boring and unengaging.

The main issue I had with this movie is that it's boring. I don't mean
a little boring, I mean pretty damn boring. The subject matter is
highly emotive and normally such a topic would set the stage for an
exciting, dramatic, even divisive experience which would be the subject
of much controversy and some considerable exposure. Well, unfortunately
it really ticks none of the boxes needed for good flick and instead
ends up as a boring account of a rather odd occurrence some 15 years
after then initial incident.I don't know who or what this was aimed at, where this was going, or
what sort of experience it was supposed to convey, but sadly unless its
intention was to put me to sleep, any other goal was well wide of the
mark. For such an intense subject, really just following through with
half decent execution should net an average score, but here the
proceedings are a bit of a mess.Much of the body of this film is filler and realistically an hour and a
half is way too long given most of it is useless padding that adds no
depth, dimension or understanding. So many pointless shots with silly
music, so little conveyed with such a lengthy production.There is a lot wrong with this film but essentially I think there is at
least a little wrong with everything, and a lot wrong with Most of it.
I can't say there are any redeeming factors as it is barely watchable
at best.I'd avoid it and watch something more meaningful like Tom & Jerry
instead.
