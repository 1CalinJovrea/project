Unbearable unconvincing and indefensible

When I left the cinema after enduring this film my thoughts immediately
turned to IMDb and what kind of response it would have had on this
site.I imagined that (like myself) there would be floods of complaints about
the wooden acting, the ease at which the main characters just sauntered
through their 'ordeal' as though they were just nipping to the shops
for a pint and a dozen eggs, and thought that it would be universally
hated.I read one review today that said this was the worst movie they'd seen
in the last thirty years.Well I sat through Dads Army, I just about managed to stay awake during
the Absolutely Fabulous movie but even those two flops were more
convincing than this film.What is supposed to be a high drama survival movie is a bland, dull,
uninspiring walk through the snow for an hour and half. Even the
moments of peril are dealt with in as short a time as possible with no
fear or risk involved whatsoever. The romance is unconvincing to me. Before anything happened between our
two lead characters I was thinking to myself that these guys clearly
didn't like each other at all during the filming of this movie. There
was little to no chemistry, the acting was woeful (from two of movies
finest actors supposedly) and it all just seemed tired and as if nobody
on the set wanted to be there.The story's climax isn't a climax at all. It's just a sudden give-up on
what had come before.I have to agree with the chap who said they'd not seen worse in a long
long time. This was most definitely the weakest of all the movies I've
seen in years. My advice to anyone considering it is as always go and
make your own mind up. But don't say I didn't warn you.
