Awesome Foursome

Robin Wright has sure moved on from the Princess Bride and is far and
away the best thing in Anne Fontaine's latest film to reach these
shores. Fontaine has long been one of the finest directors in France,
male or female and there is nothing here to indicate she is losing her
sure-footedness. I confess I was surprised to find the film was in
English from Fade In to Fade Out and slightly intrigued that Fontaine
had opted to shoot it in Australia though not having read the source
material it may well be that Fontaine is being faithful to Lessing's
setting. All the performances are excellent but Robin Wright is beyond
excellent and makes it so easy to understand why anyone, let alone a
young man, would fall in love with her. For the third time in barely
two weeks I have witnessed yet another Best Actress Oscar performance
although I tend to agree with another person writing here that Oscar
snobbery will probably ensure that neither the film nor Wright attract
even a nomination. This is a beautiful film with one towering
performance and I urge you to see it.
