2 hours of my life wasted

There is not much to say about this movie that hasn't been written in
many of the reviews before. The movie is flat, no emotions whatsoever,
no chemistry between the actors, most of the carachters are just "one
dimension"..I am not an apple fanatic (I have some of their products but I do not
change them to follow the flow every year) and I am not blind before
the flaws of Jobs' personality, but I'd like to see in the movie all
the aspects of the man who, like it or not, left a mark in the IT
field. What I saw it is a series of often disconnected episodes, and
the few of them which were nice were a re-do of the (much better) the
pirates of the Silicon Valley.Do not waste your time with this movie: if you want to learn more about
apple/jobs, read a book, if you are already aware of the story, it
simply won't add anything.
