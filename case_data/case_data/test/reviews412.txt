I didn't think this movie was based on book, not a video game

When I saw the first divergent movie, I really liked it and I became
really excited to see the adaptions of the next two books (insurgent
and allegiant).But after I saw the 2nd movie, it was a lot different
from the book and I started to get confused on why it wasn't going to
be like how the first movie was. But after I saw this movie,I realized
that it was nothing like what it was based on and it looked liked it
was based on a video game.I became really disappointed on how the
divergent series became a series I don't recognize anymore.If Divergent
just became a TV show instead of a movie before the first movie came
out, then it would have had a better chance at being more popular and
talked a lot about. But that never happened.
