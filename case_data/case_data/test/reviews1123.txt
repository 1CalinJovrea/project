Elysium gets worse and worse the more I reflect on it...

This movie was such a colossal failure on so many levels. I don't
usually write reviews for movies, but this monstrosity was so atrocious
that I felt compelled to warn unsuspecting potential viewers of the
steaming pile of sewage that is referred to as "Elysium".Where to startFirst off, the plot was a laughingstock. Even if you can ignore the
choppy camera-work that looks like the doings of a toddler with a
buffed up camera, there's no ignoring the plot. Some examples of the
numerous holes in the plot 1) Apparently, if a grenade gets blown up
inches from your head, your brain is still intact and it can be
repaired at Elysium. 2) If Carlyle could make the code to make Jodie
Foster president, then why didn't he just make himself president or
give himself all the power, by implementing the code himself or subtly
adding a nuance in there? Not the sharpest tool in the shed. 3) Where
are all the satellites to help track down Matt Damon while he is
fleeing the villains? It seems some of the technology 100+ years in the
future has actually regressed. 4) If the medical terminals can
literally give a person a new head, through repairing a "brain", why
can't they disable the sociopathic tendencies of characters like Jodie
Foster on Elysium? Once again, only certain technology has evolved for
the director's benefit. 5) In order to let one spaceship enter Elysium,
you must allow all spaceships to enter too by taking down the no-fly
zone. That makes total sense. 6) Last but certainly not least: the
ending. Apparently everyone is going to live happily ever after on
Elysium now? Every rich person on Elysium just wanted all those poor
people on earth to suffer! But now the world is sugar plums and
everyone lives happily! Yay!Secondly, there was never any point in the film in which I felt
connected to the characters in any matter. Why was this? Well, none of
them had any depth. The dialogue was one cliché after another. The
primary villain in the story appears to have some sort of speech
impediment, because for most of the movie he is inaudible. A well-told
story will also have a villain that has deeper complexities as to
his/her background and motives. This character was just a bumbling
moron. Matt Damon and Jodie Foster did the best that they could, but
their scripts were so poor that it would have been more interesting had
they been reading off the menu at a local Olive Garden. The exchange
regarding the hippo between Damon and the little girl that is dying of
seizures had me cringing in my seat at the awkwardness of the whole
matter. I should have walked out then and there.Also, why was the best look we ever got of Elysium one where we saw a
few trees and a woman swimming in a pool? Would looking at the inner
workings of the politics and lifestyle on Elysium simply have exposed
this film for the fraud that it is? I'm not going to go too deeply into
the themes of the movie, as everyone has their own opinions, but it
doesn't take much to realize the hidden (and rather misguided, imo)
opinion of the director in this one. The message was about as subtle as
receiving a ton of bricks to the head. View at your own risk for your
blood pressure will likely rise after watching this one, as it
objectively is a pathetic disgrace of a film.
