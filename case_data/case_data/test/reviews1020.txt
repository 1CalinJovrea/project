Makes you think, but it's not completely memorable

The Circle is a movie based on a novel by Dave Eggers. It stars Emma
Watson and Tom Hanks and it's set in a near future where they have this
company called The Circle which is pretty much like Google, but even
bigger. Emma Watson stars as Mae Holland, a young woman who gets a job
in the company, but when she sees what the company really is doing,
which side will she take?I have read the novel and even though it was flawed, it was an
interesting read, so I was kinda excited about the movie. The movie
isn't perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as everyone says. I didn't
find it boring at all, you just need to get invested in the story and
know that this is not your typical dystopian story. This really shows
what life might be like one day, so not much major events happen. That
made it feel a bit more realistic, but it also made it feel a bit
forgettable. That's the biggest flaw of this film. It makes quite an
impact on you when you finish watching it and you won't be able to stop
thinking about it for the next few hours. But that's more because of
the message, not because of the movie itself. But that message will get
under your skin. You will shiver during some scenes in the second half
and especially at the last shot. And the creepiest thing about it is
how easily a large percentage of humanity could be tricked by
propaganda. That's extremely well shown in Eamon Bailey, the
charismatic leader of the organization played by Tom Hanks. He's smart,
he's funny, he's down-to-earth, and he's very likable. And that's the
scariest thing. He's one of those people who would probably manage to
talk you into killing yourself in less than 5 minutes. He's such a
charismatic presence and Hanks was the perfect choice for the role.
Regardless of his plans for the future, you just can't hate this guy!
That's how easily we can be brainwashed and the movie warns us about a
lot of things going on in the world right now. When you finish it, you
will think a lot about the points this movie made. Oh, and I forgot to
mention, I also like how they eliminated some extremely unnecessary
subplots from the book and made the story a lot more straightforward
without any distractions.Overall, even though it's not amazing, I recommend this film simply for
the message itself. It's really not that bad.
