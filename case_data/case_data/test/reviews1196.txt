Powerful  - well acted piece

As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was
filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets
but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in
the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his
framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and
shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural
light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been
forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.This movie could have been another Forest Gump, it could overly
sentimental, instead, carries an appropriate amount of sincerity. The
backstory is a major part of the movie. Doss is portrayed as uneasy
with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw. This could
have been so Forest Gump-like but strikes a nice chord.The cast was excellent. Hugo Weaving was perfection. He carried the
first half of the movie as the battle-fatigued (PTSD) WW1 vet father.
Some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the
Japanese, who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon
fodder.As brutal as the second half is, I am sure it could not convey how
truly gallant Doss was or brutal it was in reality.
