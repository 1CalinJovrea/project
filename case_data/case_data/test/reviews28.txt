Not Foreign To Plot Or Edge

Jackie Chan a legend in the cinematic world for many famous roles many
will remember for years to come. With epic Marshal Arts sequences, a
sense of comedic delivery and great chemistry with a variety of actors,
it is no wonder the man has been involved in so many projects. And
after a hiatus, the legend seems to be making a comeback lending his
voice to Lego Ninjago and now returning in a live action film the
Foreigner. Does the man still have the magic, or was he better left
sitting on the sidelines? Robbie K here to review another movie and as
always let's get started. LIKES:Edgy: The trailers promised Chan would be returning with some sharper,
and darker, edges and sure enough they delivered. Mr. Quan is certainly
one of the darker roles I've seen him play, as he seeks out his own
brand of justice in a manner only a vigilante could. No punches are
thrown in this role, and this more intense role is a nice touch to
Chan's normal lighter roles. Saying few words, Chan has the look down
with sullen wise eyes filled with a hateful, hopeless stare, and scowl
that seems permanently fixated in a faithless fury. This darker role
was fascinating to watch, primarily to see how far he would go to crush
the opposition. Fairly fast pacing: No surprise here, but the Foreigner moves at a
fairly brisk pace, starting out with a literal bang and diving into the
search to come. Information is provided in a fairly linear manner so
that you get all the answers you need, all the while maximizing the
"action" at the same time. Complete story: Despite the quickened pace, this movie does manage to
close all the convoluted loops established in this film. The Foreigner
has a lot of dramatic elements integrated into the action that include
affairs, conspiracies, and betrayals that feels much like soap opera
plot lines. Rather than taking episodes to finish these tales, the
writers provided all the answers one needs to be satisfied with the
closure. Not saying it's the best closure mind you, but at least it
finishes the tale quite well. Chan's moves: While certainly not the freshest or more convoluted
stunts he's ever done, it is satisfying to see Chan still have some of
his magic. The Foreigner does a nice job of giving our star chances to
show off his acrobatic skills. After leaping around like an old
squirrel, Chan next dazzles with his close combat choreographer, still
executing his close style fist fights in a smooth dance. And with the
new edge, Chan's darker combat is unleashed, losing the feeling of
being planned to the adrenaline rush we love to see. DISLIKES:Pierce Brosnan's accent: A minor dislike at best, I couldn't get on
board with Brosnan's attempt at sounding Irish. While certainly better
than me, the former Bond star has a little more refining to do in order
to sell the angry Irish man to me. It was comical at times and took
away from the threat he was trying to bring to the table, well that and
the fact that he didn't seem to have many skills himself. Sorry Pierce,
you've got debonair down, but not the fury of the fiery reds. Editing: While dramas are sometimes a bit overbearing to me, I could
handle most of the character antics in this film. However, the
storyboard team dropped the ball a few times for me in how much they
crammed into this film. Some of the relationships were not needed,
merely extra branches to take up space in attempt to fill up time.
While the tangents expand a little on our two lead characters, they
could have been left out, or kept in small bits of dialogues instead of
full out sequences, especially when it came to the wife scenes. Drama
lovers will certainly enjoy this element, but the rest get ready to
yawn. Speaking of whichNot as action packed: I thought the Foreigner was going to have more
bite with Chan finally emerging from his retirement. Instead of the
energy that Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon brought, the Foreigner slowed
the pace down a bit. Those extensive bouts of fist punching are brought
to a minimum in terms of time, reduced to some covert moves that would
make Rambo proud in their pyrotechnic awe. The few bouts we do have
maximize the new tone and provide some satisfying stunt work, but for
me it paled to the classics I grew up with. Still not a bad display
for the aged master, I just would have liked more of that and less
drama. The VERDICT:The Foreigner is a great restart to Chan's career giving him a new edge
I haven't seen before. It's a film that does its part as an action
drama, trying to craft more of a story with the action to support it in
the long run. And while the tale is decent, and complete, it's still a
bit too slow and drawn out when there could have been more fighting.
The result is still entertaining, but with enough drab parts to
outweigh the extent of action we got. Chan may still have some moves up
his sleeve, but I'll take revisiting the classics any day.
Nevertheless, there is enough kick to warrant a theater visit for this
one, primarily in regards to those satisfying, climactic fights that
occur. My scores are:Action/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0
