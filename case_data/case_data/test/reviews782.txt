That Uncomfortable Unfunny Awkward Moment

I was so unsettled by this movie, I walked out before it ended, To the
point I just didn't care, even though it was getting close to the end,
But I was tortured enough. Identity Thief(2013) is an Oscar winner
compared to this.Trying to be Sex and the City for guys, only not clever and not funny.
I will say the three main leads do have chemistry, and you instantly
believe they are friends. But the jokes are pretty much thrown down are
throats, not to mention dramatic moments also. Unlike The Best Man
Holiday(2013) which balanced the comedy and drama perfectly, this film
doesn't do it well at all. It's a lame attempt to make a film for
couples who like comedies, I'll tell you this save your money and go
rent He's Just Not That Into(2009) instead.Michael B. Jordan why are you in this, you have proved to be better
than this, you deserve better. Has for Zac Efron, after seeing you in
this, I think your 15 minutes of fame are about up.
