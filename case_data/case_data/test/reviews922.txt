Well handled and Hard hitting

It's not hard to tell that David Ayer grew up on the mean streets of
South Central, Los Angeles. Training Day, The Fast and the Furious,
Dark Blue and S.W.A.T. all showcase his passion for writing screenplays
about these streets and the role that police officers play in them. His
two films as director (Harsh Times and Street Kings) showed that he
could also direct hard hitting dramas depicting the underbelly of the
L.A. and the police force. End Of Watch marks Ayer's second film as
both writer and director.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña star as a two young officers in the
Los Angeles Police Department. Using the "home footage" format of
filmmaking, End Of Watch shows us the ups and downs of these two young
officers as they work, love and fight in the streets of Los Angeles.In terms of subject matter this film doesn't cover anything really
different. Its about cops dealing with their issues at home and on the
job. This topic has been covered countless times but what makes End Of
Watch different  and better  then many of its predecessors is that it
holds realism as its number one priority. This is one of the most
realistic portrayals of police life ever put to celluloid. The day to
day lives of these two best friends are shown in a format that is both
convincing and horrifying. It doesn't flinch away when showing the
disturbing aspects of this high pressure career.Using everyday video sources (chest mounted cameras, vehicle cameras,
P.O.V angels, aerial shots from police choppers) definitely gives the
film an unprecedented level of proximity to cops in the line of duty.
Unfortunately, this format doesn't always work. Some chaotic scenes
become a little bit confusing when the camera is constantly changing
from first person shots to third person angles. But for the most-part
it works well.Gyllenhaal and Peña provide us with two highly believable characters
and their chemistry is palpable. Whether they're talking about the
women in their lives or having a friendly argument about racial
stereotypes, these two actors ensure that we stick with their
characters through every step of the way. Gyllenhaal continues to
solidify himself as one of the best actors around and Peña delivers one
of his best performances to date.It's got a great script and a focused story that is handled confidently
and told well. David Ayer has crafted an intense, hard hitting drama
that benefits from the two excellent performances by the two leads.
