Unwatchable

Aside the nonsense plot, the total lack of logic and the poor script
that I could expect from a full action-based movie, there is this
filming style where the camera flies, rebound, shakes, zoom in and out
(so close that I can see the skin cells of alice and suddenly from 50
feets in the air) that makes the action scenes impossible to follow,
and the actions scenes are like the 99% of the movie so the movie is
unwatchable. The special effects seems good but it's hard to appreciate
them because it's a dark movie and again, the constant movement of the
cameras. The acting is not bad.If a movie director is reading this please consider stop making that
thing with the cameras, the action can be exciting even with a fixed
plane, if you don't believe me play the first 3 resident evil games ;)
