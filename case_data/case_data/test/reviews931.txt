Critics be damned!

This is a good start for the rebooting of the Universal Dark Universe,
if you're expecting a remake of the 1990's Mummy films then you've got
the wrong idea. The first thing you should know is that this has
NOTHING to do with those movies and are completely unrelated. This is a
re-imagining of Mummy's Hand (1940) that started the Mummy series of
movies but with a whole new agenda. This time Universal are making
these films to link in with all their other monster movies,
Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman etc so comparing it with any other
Mummy film before it like the critics keep doing is utterly pointless. The movie is a high entertaining fantasy horror film, its not the
glossy action comedy level of the Brendan Fraser films, its darker and
a lot more violent but still full of spectacle and a decent amount of
humour that doesn't completely dominate the dramatic content as many
film allow these days. Only Disney's Goofy or Loony Toon's Wild E
Coyote can take the level of battering Tom Cruise gets in this movie
and still stay standing. The Mummy is an exotic beauty who can hit like
a Mack Truck. There are elements reminiscent of An American Werewolf in
London (1981) and Lifeforce (1985) that forge this version of the Mummy
and Russell Crowe's Dr Jekyll makes his glorified entrance half way
through to remind you this is a shared monster universe so expect more
of the same.Quite simply you either like this sort of stuff or you don't, if you
listen to critics they'll convince you this is the worst movie ever
made, it's not. It's actually really good fun and nothing more, it
won't suddenly change your life and have you buying movie merchandise
like a Star Wars film or Marvel franchise flick but it will entertain
you if you're not already going into the cinema armed with a critical
gun ready to shoot it down for daring to star Tom Cruise like the
average Hollywood critic and their anti-Tom Cruise agenda.
