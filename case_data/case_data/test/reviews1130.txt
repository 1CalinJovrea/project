Rip Off

You see one male stripper and, apparently, you've seen em all.A thin excuse for a cheap movie that once would have been relegated to
drive in movie theaters and 2nd run houses. Aging strippers head out on
a road trip of sorts to prove they till have what it takes. Just bogus
and predictable all the way around. Compounded with Smith's role as a
woman named Rome (really? Rome?) who owns a strip joint and is like
nails on a chalk board.There a couple of men of color but other wise it's white bread all the
way and mostly aging white bread at that. Stripping is a young man's
game. Most of these guys are headed to 40 and middle age.They all look as if they took a dip in a pool filled with hair remover.
Manganiello's trademark gray hair and salt and pepper beard have
magically disappeared to make him look younger.All the stars do double duty in their parts and as part of a coast to
coast marketing machine designed to fill the seats and the producers
pockets. They all agree that rehearsing and performing in thongs was a
true bro boding experience and make fun of their junk and blah blah
blah.Save your money.
