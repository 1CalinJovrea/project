Too clichéd to be anything other than average

This review contains some plot details.The Place Beyond The Pines deserves praise for its ambition to weave
together three stories linked to the same event in an art house style,
however the only people who will walk away from this thinking it's
anything more than a nice looking cliché are those who must have seen
very few films.Director Derek Cianfrance's film suffocates under the weight of its own
attempts to be an epic drama, spanning 15 years and three chapters in
the lives of all involved. This is a perfect example of a film forcing
itself to be something it's not; there is never enough character arc or
substantial depth of character development to warrant the overbearing
150 minute running time.As mentioned, the film is complied of three stories, the first of which
is easily the most accomplished section of the film, albeit far from
original. We follow Luke (Ryan Gosling), a man with a violent history
who now wants to care for Romina (Eva Mendes) and their baby boy whom
she has kept a secret from him and now lives with another man. He turns
to robbing banks in the small town of Schenectady, New York, and gives
her some of the cash he steals. So, a man with the love of a woman in
his heart jumps on to the desk at a bank and points a gun... Heat,
Public Enemies, The Town, Point Blank have all told a similar story
over two hours allowing the audience to invest in the characters, not
cramming it into 30-odd minutes.The success of this section of the film comes not from the dialogue or
set-up, but from the great performance by Ryan Gosling, channelling
some of the brooding madman vibe we saw in Drive. Gosling is a very
effective actor with this smaller, character-driven material and the
difference between him here and in Gangster Squad couldn't be greater.
Cianfrance also demonstrates both excellent and awful directorial
decisions in this act; the opening tracking shot is tremendous as is a
car/bike chase which shows a fantastic new way of capturing the action
from inside the police car in a single take, but then Cianfrance ruins
it all when the action goes hand-held and the shakycam comes out like
Paul Greengrass with caffeine jitters.The transition from story one into story two introduces Bradley Cooper
as cop Avery Cross in a delightfully matter-of-fact manner, not the way
you'd usually expect to see a movie star introduced; he simply appears
as a cop giving chase when Luke is attempting to get away from his
latest bank robbery. This was a very nice touch.The second story, however, soon has little to do with the opening
story. After events which won't get detailed here, the story goes into
a police corruption scandal which is familiar to anyone who has seen a
Sidney Lumet picture, Copland or even recent trash such as Pride and
Glory. The film is now rapidly running out of steam as everything
unfolding is a cliché of much better films (again, see Lumet's work)
and the crime thriller aspect which was set-up in the opening third is
now over and, essentially, a new film has begun, and we have to focus
now on caring about Avery Cross. However, the corruption case is neatly
resolved with no impact whatsoever on the characters or audience and
then the dreaded '15 years later' title card appears.Fifteen years on and the third story begins, and the cliché machine
goes into overdrive and The Place Beyond The Pines loses any interest
it may have had left. Luke's son and Avery's son become friends! They
both like drugs! They have both missed father figures in their journey
to adulthood! But, remember everyone, AVERY KILLED Luke, so this new
friendship surely won't fall apart within 30 minutes and one of the
boys won't do a Google search on their father and throw away 17 years
of good upbringing bar the occasional recreational drug indulgence to
take revenge on the cop who is now running for District Attorney! Oh...
yes it does and yes they do. It's just screen writing by connecting the
dots and is wholly disengaging and uninteresting.This final story ultimately sums up The Place Beyond The Pines; trying
making something out of nothing for there is really nothing under the
surface. Crime thriller, corruption story, father and son Greek
tragedy, revenge story, family drama; this film wants to be it all but
ends up like a film adaptation of a 600 page novel which was never
written. Shame, because it would probably make for a great novel as
well.
