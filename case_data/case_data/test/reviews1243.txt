Yet another Handcam Film

I had actually had quite high hopes of Chronicle but what a
disappointment. What made things worse is that I am not a fan of
Handcam films like this which makes it even worse.Technically very polished from a special effects view although there
were not many in the film, the story itself is a real let down and
ultimately one can guess whats going to happen next, right up to the
end, all very predictable.Soundtrack wise nothing to write home about, the actors screaming
occasionally only made things worse.All in all a really terrible film with little depth and if there are
any hidden meanings? well hardly worth the effort trying to read them.
