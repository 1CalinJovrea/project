Noomi is a master of her craft

We've come a long way since Multiplicity and other twin-style movies.
The split screen and computer aided work are very convincing. Noomi
plays off of her duplicates very well and gives each her own
personality and style. Beyond that, Noomi really shows her ability to rise to the level of a
true action star. (As if I had any doubts about the star of The Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo)In the world of the future, a one child only policy is made and all
siblings after the first child are sentenced to be frozen in cryostasis
in the hopes they can be thawed out in a future that has been made less
overpopulated. It's thought that the children might have horrible
nightmares that last hundreds of years in their cryonic state.Because of certain biological contaminations, it's become more common
for people to have more than one child at a time, so when seven girls
are born -- all identical, instead of subjecting six to cryofreeze, a
man sets out a plan for each to take on the identity of one person --
to share a life between the seven. There are hardships endured in only being able to leave the home one
day per week -- and even then, only to play a role of a person that
must be consistent from one day to the next as siblings switch out the
responsibility of work, shopping, and possibly having a love life. They
can not trust anyone to know their secret, so no one can get too close.One day, things go very bad when one goes missing... and then from very
bad to worse. Don't miss out! Watch. And maybe you'll find out what
happened to Monday!
