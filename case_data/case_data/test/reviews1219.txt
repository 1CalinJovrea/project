Arnie stars in his very own zombie soap opera

I gave this stinker 1 point for the cinematography. There were no other
redeeming features or praise deserved in this. This film is the result of a bunch of vapid Hollywood people getting
together and deciding 'let's make a meaningful art film about zombies
cos kids love zombies and we'll still make a wad of cash'. The result
is lose/lose. This is not a meaningful art film or a zombie film. The
real issue here is that nothing happens to make you care about any of
the characters. You don't care she's dying because you wish they all
would. The acting is implausible on all counts. There is no chemistry
between the characters, you can't believe any of them are related, and
every time some one laughs or cries it's about as believable as a kid's
pantomime. Even the setting is ridiculous. Towns in flames and the
world destroyed by this disease, and yet somehow hospitals are
functioning well enough to be spending so much money and energy on
looking after the zombie terminally ill. Kids are hanging out, going to
school and hanging with their sick friends, with no fear of catching a
flesh decaying virus. If you want a great zombie art film that delves into the human psyche,
go watch a Romero film or 28 days later. This is just another trite
Hollywood waste of time. I like zombie movies because they deal with
human existence and the idea that in the face of extreme circumstances,
although a few people will hold onto a moral standard, hell is really
other people, not the zombies at all. This movie is just confused in
its message. It wants to be a good values Seventh Heaven family drama
except nobody is smiling, just wailing over their inner turmoil. Yawn.
