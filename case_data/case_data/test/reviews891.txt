Water Boarding, Killing Bin Laden, Weeping

The first half of the movie is about CIA operatives interrogating
terrorists. Water boarding is being shown as the only world of torture.
The terrorists, pretty unimpressed by all this, respond with a bad- ass
attitude while bombings continue. Meanwhile the CIA employees show
emotional outbursts and are unable to make professional decisions.The next half, the main character, a good looking young female CIA
operative, comes closer into play. Now the movie is all about her. She
knows the place of Bin Laden. But the CIA turns into an incompetent
organization, where bureaucrats want proof, and therefore decide to do
nothing. Thanks to her intrusive attitude, she pushes the CIA into
action. She yells at her boss. She takes a pen and writes angry notes
on the office glass separation of a higher CIA boss every day. She
curses in the conference room to another, even much higher CIA boss
etc. And only because of all this behavior, the CIA decides to raid
that place.Now some special forces raid Bin Laden's place and kill him. The girl
is relieved, gets on a plane home, and she weeps. And that's how the
movie ends.
