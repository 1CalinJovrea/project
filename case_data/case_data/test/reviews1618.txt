At last, a summer film with some originality

With great internet power comes great irresponsibility. This is the
premise behind "Nerve", a film whose producers must have wet themselves
with excitement that the Pokemon Go craze aligned so nicely with the
release of their film. I was delighted that at last this summer there
is a film with a modicum of originality I can enthuse about. 'Vee', short for Venus (Emma Roberts, niece of Julia Roberts) is an NYC
teen living in the shadow of a family tragedy and the claustrophobic
presence of her over-protective mother (Juliette Lewis, "Cape Fear").
Always timidly in the shadow of her best friend  the extrovert Sydney
(Emily Meade)  Vee pooh-poohs Sydney's compulsion with the new viral
internet game 'Nerve': a social media 'Truth or Dare' ("but without the
truth") challenge game where you can either be a "Player" or a
"Watcher". In real time, Watchers set Players with challenges they have
to complete for ever-escalating financial rewards but "Bail" or "Fail"
and you lose all. And "snitches get stitches".With their friendship at breaking point, Vee is provoked into playing
the game by Sydney and teams with fellow gamer Ian (Dave Franco,
younger brother of James Franco)  someone with a history that could
bring Vee into great danger. However, Vee's geeky wannabe boyfriend
Tommy (Miles Heizer) is on the case.What is so impressive about this film is that the screenplay by Jessica
Sharzer (based on a novel by Jeanne Ryan) is genuinely original and is
delivered with style and good humor. Sure, you can draw parallels for
any film with many other sources: in here there are traces of Hunger
Games/Allegiance; the "Simon Says" portion of Die Hard 3; perhaps a
soupçon of "Gladiator" and Schwartznegger's "Running Man" in the mix.
But this is a novel approach to a teen flick, bang on the topical money
in bringing in the frenetically viral nature of social media and
aspects of the 'dark web', cyber security and open source programming.The film manages to generate significant credibility about the impact
that a game like this would have among a teen audience. And there is a
telling message in the finale: that it is easy to be a troll without
responsibility hiding behind an internet ident, but when the masks come
off and the message back becomes personal then your responsibilities as
an individual human can come home to roost. The film is delivered with style and verve as well, with innovative
graphics (a great title and end title design) and an 'augmented
reality' overlay of the action showing Players and Watchers across the
city. Many of the challenges are executed really well, with a few
seat-clenchingly tense moments, particularly if you have a poor head
for heights.But with all this potential it unfortunately fails to be a 10* classic,
smelling at times of 'B' movie. Which is a great shame. Emma Roberts is
fine at what she does, but at times I longed for the dramatic depth of
a Shailene Woodley or Chloe Grace Moretz, with the scenes with the
under-used but excellent Juliette Lewis rather highlighting this
differential.The otherwise excellent script is  for me  let down by a scene of
male-on-female violence which I found both distasteful and unnecessary.
And a coding 'geeks shall inherit the earth' moment towards the end is
a little too glib for my liking. But overall the directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman ("Paranormal
Activity 3" and "4") have done a fine job with a $20M budget. Regular readers of my blog (bob-the-movie-man.com) may recall my use of
the "BvS quotient"  the number of films that could be made from the
budget of "Batman vs Superman": this one has a BvS quotient of 8%
meaning you could make over 12 of these instead of the superhero dud.
Yes please! Although if they had doubled the budget and rounded off
some of the sharp corners, this could have been a true classic. It's
still recommended for a memorable movie experience though, and probably
makes it into my draft movies of the year list so far.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment, please visit
