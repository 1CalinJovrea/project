A technically outstanding but otherwise mediocre film

"Okja" is a heavy-handed and somewhat simplistic critique of the meat
industry in which, due to a highly contrived plot, a young girl's
beloved pet 'super-pig' ends up at the abattoir. The satire is neither
subtle (I assume that "Mirando" was as close to "Monsanto" as the
producers' lawyers would allow) nor clever (the wicked capitalists are
just stupid and greedy strawmen) and the characters played by Jake
Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton are over-the-top to a point of being
almost unwatchable. These weakness are unfortunate, because if the
story, script and acting were up to the level of the outstanding
special effects are, the movie might have become a classic children's
film. The take-home message of "Okja" is pretty blatant and judging by
some of the gushing comments about this film, director Joon-ho Bong was
often 'preaching to the choir', but I don't think that the film is
either clever or 'real' enough to actually change peoples' minds about
meat ("Babe" didn't and an actual piglet is a more sympathetic
character than a CGI hippo-pig, however well rendered (excuse the
pun)). Also undermining the story and the message is the frequent and
gratuitous use of profanity, which seems to have been included more for
cheap laughs than for story or character development, and seems out of
place in what struck me as basically a movie for the kids.
