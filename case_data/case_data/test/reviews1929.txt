Don't Listen to the Negativity

So I just caught this movie September 30, 2012 and I really wanted to
like it. But when I saw the decreasing rating from 6.4 to now 5.9, I
was worried. I asked: what's wrong with this movie? and should I even
go see it? I am so glad I ignored the bad rating. I normally don't care
what other people about movies, but I was a little skeptical to see it
after seeing so many bad reviews. House at the End of the Street is about Elissa and her mom Sarah moving
to a new house that is very cheap because the house next door had a
double-murder of the parents there by their "daughter Carrie-Ann".
Elissa meets the surviving son Ryan and befriends him, unbeknownst to
her that he is hiding "Carrie-Ann" in his basement and a dark secret.
Jennifer Lawrence is probably one of my favorite actresses and the
movies I've seen her in she is phenomenal. She proved herself once
again that she is a worthy force in Hollywood. Max Thierot: I don't
really know this actor, but he does a very nice job in the role of
Ryan. Elizabeth Shue is also a very nice actress. This trio of actors
did an exceptional job with the roles they were given. Lawrence does
the snarky, rebellious teenage role very well, as well as the girl with
a good heart and the will to help others. Thierot plays the quiet,
repressed outcast with a dark secret very convincingly. He isn't creepy
but he isn't dull and boring. Shue plays the cliché overprotective
mother (which may be my only issue with the movie) who only wants
what's best for her daughter and blah blah blah.Now, the twist. Most people called it ahead of time: Ryan is the
killer. Now, I know that it was pretty obvious from the get-go that he
was the killer, but that wasn't the twist. The twist was that
Carrie-Ann died after falling on the swings, Ryan's parents made him
"Carrie-Ann" to deal with their grief, Ryan killed his parents after
their abuse had gone too far, blamed himself for his sister's death and
then, when he got older, moved back to his house, kidnapped a girl and
made her his "Carrie-Ann" because he needs her in his life. When
"Carrie-Ann" escapes, she seeks help but Ryan stops her. On-screen, we
are convinced Ryan is keeping his demented sister from killing anyone,
but he just doesn't want people to know his secret. When she escapes
again, he accidentally kills her. We now believe that Carrie-Ann is
dead.While Ryan is keeping his secret, Elissa tries to get closer to him,
much to her mother's dismay (cliche again). She enters a Battle of the
Bands competition and invites Ryan to come but his car gets trashed and
then he gets beaten up until he retaliates and breaks a dudes leg (he's
not too important to the story) and the rest of the bullies go to try
and burn Ryan's house down but Elissa gets there in time to put out the
fire. The last, I wanna say, 30 minutes of the film involve Elissa
trying to get away from Ryan after discovering his secret and the truth
about him. After defeating Ryan, Elissa and Sarah move from their new
house while Ryan is in a mental institution, where he is haunted by his
family's abuse towards him after Carrie-Ann died. EndThis movie, just like Cabin in the Woods, focuses on the clichés of
horror movies, but doesn't necessarily attack them. Great acting and
great story. People compare this to "Psycho" and "Sleepaway Camp" but I
haven't seen those movies. I liked this movie and I really don't care
what people have to negatively say about this movie. I recommend you go
see it. It's not a waste of time or money. Don't listen to the
dickholes!10/10
