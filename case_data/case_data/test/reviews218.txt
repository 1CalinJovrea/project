You're Welcome.

2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the
likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying
for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be
mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the
four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the
mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the
goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and
Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must
find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen
one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking
over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef.
Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying
man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock" Johnson, as the demigod
Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in
this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his
talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this
piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O
in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer,
Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the
old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and
important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the
nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've
been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films
like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt.
The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel
the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The
animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters
find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated
with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far
behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice
acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer
Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she
really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud
that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either.
This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to
find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the
future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a
man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female
lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great
time for adults. Moana is a great film.
