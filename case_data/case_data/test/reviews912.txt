Predictable . If You've Seen The Trailer You've Seen The Whole Movie

The original film in this franchise had a great premise but failed to
do anything with the concept and I wasn't expecting anything with the
sequel but was stunned by how much the production team developed the
idea , so much so that I was genuinely excited to seeing the next film
in the series which is a rare occurrence for me to get excited about
upcoming film . As the trailers were released earlier in the year I did
feel my excitement being negated and felt we'd be getting more of the
same from a concept that with hindsight might not have much in the way
of legs . Yeah the promos did feature some very topical satire about a
female Senator and a right wing nutjob battaling for the future of
America but seemed a little too obvious The bad news is that's exactly how THE PURGE ELECTION YEAR plays out .
You could say the studio has been honest and constructed a trailer that
is refreshingly accurate and what you see is what you get but is a
backhanded compliment really a compliment ? Worse than that the trailer
is edited in chronological order and there's no surprises . One great
thing about ANARCHY was that the story revolved around the mystery and
the enigma of the mysterious violent anti-hero who had his own motives
for trawling the streets during purge night . Here there's no mystery
or character development . Here Sgt Leo is a knight in shining white
armour saving the Senator from the fascist establishment and purgers
thereby trying to save America from its extreme elements . Everything
is black and white and painlessly simplistic . Everyone is good or bad
with no in-between and no ambiguity involved Being positive about this at least the dichotomy of the
characterisation means no one is going to confuse the noble and genuine
Senator Charlie Roan with any female politician running for President
in 2016 so at least the film can't be accused of being cheerleaders for
present American party politics . It also contains the occasional
haunting image such as a body lying burning in a street , but there's
nothing here that matches the impact of a burning bus driving along a
road or the nail biting heart stopping tension of the hunting ground we
saw in the second movie . Don't get me wrong ELECTION YEAR is still
better than the original film and if you loved ANARCHY you'll probably
like this one . The downside is that you had hoped for something a bit
better and are left feeling rather disappointed by a rather predictable
movie
