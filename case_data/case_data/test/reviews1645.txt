A complete waste

I waited months until this flick came to the second-run theater and
went on discount day to see it for $1.00. But even at that, I felt it
was a sheer waste of my money and time. The movie was one-joke endless
take on a frat house moving next door to a married-with-child couple.
The jokes were sophomoric, boring, and grasping to be funny. Watching
the trailer just showcases the whole idea. Sitting there for 90+
minutes to watch this repetitive magma of crude comedy does not bring
laughs. Add nudity, simulated sex, urinating, hazing, same-sex kissing,
dildos,stale Seth Rogen shtick with his endless trying-to-be-so-cool
and you have a feeble attempt of a movie with actors and extras vying
to see who can be absolutely gross.Parents leaving a baby home alone
all night to get wasted is sheer irresponsibility along with having
said baby chew on a condom seems like some kinda crazy abuse. I
wouldn't even buy the DVD to see the deleted scenes and gag reels which
I am sure is more of the sick and rotten same.
