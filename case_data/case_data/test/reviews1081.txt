Great movie and very entertaining

Most people are comparing this movie to Fast and Furious series hence
the low rating. They're just different even though both are involving
expensive cars. The plots might have been somewhere and done elsewhere, but this movie
is still 10 out of 10 of its own. It's highly entertaining from start
to finish.
