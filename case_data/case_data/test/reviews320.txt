Awful

My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that
add to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot.
Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot
(if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat
characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The
Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at
random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no
story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the
one-liners and "money shots".If all that isn't enough, the last third of the movie is simply
unwatchable.I don't think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES and
FURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I'm pretty sure
it's due to massive pressure from the producers.
