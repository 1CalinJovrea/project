Mixed feelings....

OK, well, this is going to be a tricky review, folks, because this is a
weird movie, very weird. A Cure For Wellness has the great merit of
being different, and to reward the movie goer with something that
stands out from the crowd; but, once you have appreciated this aspect,
you might also want to be rewarded with a kind of content that gives
the form some substance. And here is where A Cure For Wellness lets you
down. I thought the first part of the movie was very good (rating: 8):
you are simply smashed by the oneiric, hypnotic power of the images, by
the stunning photography, by a breathtaking use of the camera, pretty
good acting; and the intrigue created by the plot is such that you just
keep asking yourself where this can reasonably go. That should have
been the job of the second part (rating: 2) , where instead most of the
potential built in the first half is wasted: the story, from
intriguing, turns silly; the mysterious plot turns into a surreal
Dracula movie which just does not make justice to itself.
