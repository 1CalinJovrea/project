Another "GEM" from Adam Sandler and friends..

.. and by "GEM", I mean "Garbage Edition Movie". Brought to you by the
same people who gave us "Grown Ups 2", "Zookeeper", and "Pixels"! Add
another edition to the garbage set. Adam Sandler and friends try to
take their dog and pony show out west to shovel us some more rubbish.
What a horrible piece of trash this movie is. I couldn't even watch
until the end. It includes annoying/unoriginal jokes, the plot is
utterly predictable, and the performances of all its stars is *BELOW*
subpar.I LOVED "Punch Drunk Love". So I know Adam Sandler has some creativity
(that I liked) inside of him. I keep waiting for a day he decides to
cut the crap and show some professionalism. Exactly everything that
he's worked on since then has turned into GARBAGE. And people keep
watching these "GEMs", while Adam keeps cashing his checks. Despicable!
