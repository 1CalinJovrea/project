A Terrific Movie!

David Mackenzie's 'Hell or High Water' is A Terrific Movie, that turns
out to be an unexpected delight of the Summer. With underwhelming
superhero movies or reboots doing the rounds, this Heist/Crime
Motion-Picture offers a Solid Story, that is Sharply Written, Expertly
Directed & Very Strongly Acted. 'Hell or High Water' Synopsis: A divorced dad and his ex-con brother
resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's farm in
West Texas.'Hell or High Water' is a story of family & crime. You watch the 2
brothers rob banks, as they are tired of being poor & they indulge in
aggression. And then you have Two Texas Rangers, after them, because
they're wearing a uniform & they serve for the protection of the
people. Its the difference of dynamics between its characters that make
'Hell or High Water' a solid watch. I wan engrossed by the camaraderie
of the 4 characters, they are interesting to watch & hear. 'Hell or High Water' is perfectly paced, as the narrative hits the nail
& culminates in a crisp 101-minutes. The film begins with a punch &
ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story &
how well it progressed. Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is Sharp. His
Writing is tops, allowing us to get into the story & have an
interesting experience. David Mackenzie's Direction is expertly done.
He's handled the film, with command. Giles Nuttgens' Cinematography is
fantastic. West Texas has been captured beautifully. Jake Roberts'
Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Nick Cave & Warren
Ellis's Score is good. Action-Sequences are well-done, as well. Performance-Wise: 'Hell or High Water' is filled with superior
performances. Jeff Bridges steals the show as the senior Texas ranger,
who's sly sense of humor with his Indian partner (a fabulous Gil
Birmingham) & skill to put things together & get to the criminals, is
delightful. Bridges gets his character spot-on & proves once again,
that he's among the Greatest we've ever had. As the 2-brothers who go
on bank-robbing spree, Chris Pine & Ben Foster are in top-form. Pine is
a revelation, delivering a mature, restrained performance, while
Foster, an actor who's potential isn't new to know, continues to
astonish, with his enviable talent for playing unpredictable, unlikable
characters. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Pine & Foster,
appears real & affecting.On the whole, 'Hell or High Water' is a Winner! Don't Miss It!
