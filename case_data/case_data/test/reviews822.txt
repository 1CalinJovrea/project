A Tale with No Easy Answers

In the words of poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, the beauty of film is "You
get poetic justice in less than 3 hours. You often don't get poetic
justice in a lifetime." If that'd be the case than the collective works
of Martin McDonagh serves as a counterweight to such thinking. His
films, often involve looking in vain for the nebulous concepts of love,
justice and meaning in a post-modern world. His characters, likable if
deeply flawed, shout into the void but never find the answers they
seek.Thus it's hard to truly gage a film like Three Billboards Outside
Ebbing, Missouri. Much like In Bruge (2008) and Seven Psychopaths
(2012), this film is rich with wit yet syncopated in its own world of
messy loops, twists, turns and tones. The story begins with the
melodies of Renee Fleming's "Tis the Last Rose of Summer" but then ends
the first five minutes on the screen in capital letters. The letters
spell out "RAPED WHILE DYING," "STILL NO ARRESTS?" "HOW COME, CHIEF
WILLOUGHBY". So starts the saga of the Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,
Missouri, sanctioned by a grieving mother; printed for a dying man.The mother in this case is Mildred Hayes (McDormand), who much like her
billboards stands unwavering. She's hassled by everyone from Sheriff
Willoughby's (Harrelson) clueless deputies to her ex-husband Charlie
(Hawkes). Still, even when her son Robbie (Hedges) is incensed to give
her the silent treatment, Mildred demands her message be heard. Her
teenage daughter was raped and murdered seven long months ago and
nothing has been done. She wants justice.Yet the funny thing about justice in this movie is the moment you get a
good handle on the concept, the film bleeds it away like water from
outstretched hands. So too do the characters. Every time you get a firm
understanding of who they are, something logical yet wholly unexpected
forces you to assess and reassess. No one else best exemplifies this
than Sam Rockwell's Office Dixon who goes from a racist Barney Fife to
a numbed Travis Bickle with nary a dropped beat to make you question
the change.The ensemble carries the film through a lot of ugliness with grace. We
glide uncomfortably close along the sharpened edges of rape, murder,
abuse, suicide, alcoholism and racism. All the while questions like:
"is it okay to be angry in an unfair world?" and "how do our decisions
affect others," smear into the ashy black comedy and imposing
melodrama. Deep care was given to breathe life into these characters.
Even when someone as non-consequential as Charlie's nineteen-year-old
girlfriend (Weaving) enters the fray you can't help but admire how
these people interact and curious about how they must feel.Martin McDonagh more than ever invites comparisons to the Coen brothers
in this film. A signal that to me at least proves McDonagh is
ambitious, but out of his weight class at this point in his career. For
while the Coen's approach their films with the same character-first,
free-form narratives, there's always a level of benevolence behind the
cynicism. Here, instead of smirk-worthy amusement there is anger.
Instead of cosmic curiosity there is more anger. Instead of wonder,
there's just more anger, and you know what they say about anger; it
just begets moreÂ…anger.If anger were the spice of life, then this murky soup would definitely
be worth consuming. But as it is not, regular filmgoers should approach
this witty, richly rendered film with extreme caution. McDonagh's
oeuvre is an acquired taste and those liable to agree with Bachchan's
approach to film may walk out severely shook. But for those fixing for
an overall decent barnstorming black comedy, the "Show Me" state might
just have something for you.
