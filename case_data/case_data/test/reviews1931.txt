Surprisingly good

Although the trailer peeked my interest, I didn't go into this movie
with high expectations, being that it is a low budget film with actors
you don't see to much. But I couldn't have been more wrong.The movie has good writing, dialog, all around great acting, and keeps
you interested with nice twists throughout the movie. Another thing I
liked about it, was the fact that they don't spend unnecessary amounts
of time getting into the actual story. Maybe 5 or 10 minutes tops. It
also has a storyline that is pretty original in my opinion. Yea,
certain little things could be associated with other movies, but
overall its an original idea. Sci-Fi movies these days tend to have so
many similarities, that when a movie like this comes along, its
refreshing to see something new.
