Black Mass is a decent film, but it could have been great.

Black Mass: A Near Miss'Black Mass' is another is a line of crime dramas set in Boston. The
film will inevitable be compared to 'The Departed.' And it falls short
in the comparison. The acting is top rate, and Depp is much better, not
as hammy, than the comic portrait of a crime boss by Nicholson in 'The
Departed.' Depp is genuinely threatening in the film and the make-up
job given him in the film adds to the fright. 'Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in
its favor. In fact, the overall look of the film is exquisite. That,
and the acting, are the two best things in the film. However, the movie
is both too much and not enough. 'Black Mass' tries to cover too much and thus it lacks focus. This is
where 'The Departed' succeeds. While 'The Departed' has many layers and
character, it has a focus: the Southie, Billy. 'Black Mass' doesn't
have a main theme, a main character, a main protagonist or antagonist.
There are a bunch of characters in tense situations with some irony and
symbolism. However, in the end, there is nothing to hold onto, no
lessons, no emotions, love or hate, for any characters. As I was watching, both my film buddy and I thought the same thing:
Scorsese could have made this story work with his writing and
directing. We also thought that in an era of long- form television that
it could have made a great 10-20 episode show. Then it could have gone
into depth about the childhood relationships between crime boss Bulger,
his FBI friend Connolly and Whitey's brother, State Senator Billy
Bulger. As miniseries, it could have more deeply explored the racial tensions
between the Irish and Italians with the African Americans stuck in the
middle. It could have taken a deeper look into Boston politics and
corruption, police corruption, and more. The miniseries could have also
gone further into the Irish American funding of the IRA. As it was, it
touched on each of those issues in an unsatisfactory fashion. If the
film had taken a deeper look into any ONE of those themes, it would
have made for a better movie. Rating: Matin√©eFor the great look and outstanding acting, I suggest you see it on the
big screen. Otherwise, wait for the miniseries. Hey, a man can dream. Peace, Tex Shelters
