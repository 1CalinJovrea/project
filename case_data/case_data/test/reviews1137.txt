Fake historical facts, zero original music, average actors. Disappointed

Once again I was convinced that Hollywood is dead. First of all, main
the Beast and the Beast auditory are kids and teenagers from age 6 to
age 18. So no big expectation for adult auditory. It is not supposed to
be masterpiece of all times. But even so... how you could misrepresent
historical facts like that? Medieval France. What we see? Black people
lived freely among white people, they dance happily together and drink
in one bar. I understand things about political correctness. But don't
you think it makes movie look fake and misrepresent original fairy
tale. Secondly, music. Did you actually hire song writers, authors, musicians
for such big cinema event? There are some good songs. But it turned out
they are all classic French songs or taken from 1991 animated "The
beauty and the beast" movie.Thirdly, actors. Well, I have no complains to Emma Watson beauty.
Interesting young British actress. But Belle was French. French women
have special charm and chic(remember Amelie?). Emma Watson with her
solder walking and always the same face expression did not convince me.
Animated Belle expressed more emotions and love in her eyes that Emma
"Belle" Watson. As for other actors, was very pleased to see Kevin
Kline. Only actor in the movie which performance I enjoyed. Other
actors were very plain or their roles were so short that it is hard to
do something outstanding.
