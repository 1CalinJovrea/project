A real experience of life fully lived

Dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy turns a once warm and ebullient
family man into a solemn, withdrawn, and angry loner in Kenneth
Lonergan's ("Margaret") bittersweet drama Manchester by the Sea, one of
the best films of 2016. Set in the picturesque city of Manchester on
Massachusetts' north shore, cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes ("Martha
Marcy May Marlene") captures the rugged beauty of the New England town
with its bays filled with trawlers and its winter streets and municipal
buildings covered in a shimmering white. It is a town that looks as if
it has not changed in decades, or even centuries.Lee Chandler, in a haunting performance by Casey Affleck
("Interstellar"), is a janitor/handyman who spends his days painting,
doing minor plumbing work, repairing leaks, and so on or just giving
advice while making sure to avoid any social interaction with the
people he is working for. His nights are spent drinking alone in bars
where he is quick to start fights or at home watching TV in his small
apartment. There is no hint during the film's first half hour about
what has brought him to his present state of disequilibrium, but in his
mumbling inability to express his thoughts, we know that something
unspoken is driving his need for isolation.Lee has been living in nearby Quincy but, when his older brother, Joe
(Kyle Chandler, "Carol") succumbs to a heart attack, he has to return
to Manchester to make funeral arrangements and attend the reading of
the will and to confront the people that he has turned away from. His
grief over his brother's death turns to shock, however, when he
discovers that he has been named the legal guardian of Joe's
16-year-old son Patrick (Lucas Hedges, "The Grand Budapest Hotel"), a
popular high school student. Since Patrick's mom Elise (Gretchen Mol,
"Anesthesia") is an alcoholic who left town long ago, Lee is the only
person who can assume the task.It is one, however, that he does not feel ready for. Eventually, the
seminal event that changed Lee's life forever is revealed, depicted in
a straightforward manner without histrionics or pandering, even if the
overused baroque music tends to amplify the drama beyond what is
required. In flashback, we see that Lee was once a happy family man
with a loving wife Randi (Michelle Williams, "Suite Fran√ßaise") and
three young children and we see him joking around with his young nephew
Patrick (Ben O'Brien) on their fishing boat. Assuming the
responsibility of being a father-figure to Patrick, we glimpse the man
that Lee used to be.The dialogue between the abrasive Lee and the feisty, sharp-tongued
Patrick feels real and without guile but channeling the chemistry they
have together into rebuilding his life is a challenge. Manchester by
the Sea is a serious film but is balanced by humor. In one such scene,
Patrick awkwardly attempts to hide the obvious from his mom about
studying in his room with his girlfriend. Another funny incident takes
place when Lee is used as a cover for Patrick's surreptitious juggling
of his two girlfriends. The issues between them take a more serious
tone, however, when Lee is convinced that he and Patrick should move to
Boston, a suggestion that Patrick rebels at, citing his high school
girlfriends, his being on the soccer team, and his playing in the
school band.Though Michelle Williams has a small role, she turns in one of her best
performances. In a powerful confrontation with Lee, it is clear that
she still loves him but has felt compelled to suppress it in order to
bury the past and move on. Manchester by the Sea belongs to Casey
Affleck, however, who turns in what is arguably the best performance of
his career. The film does not have the sort of neat resolution that you
may have come to expect but what it does have are real people whose
lives you want to be a part of and you know that that world is not one
that can only happen in the movies, but a real experience of life fully
lived in all its pain and all its joy.
