Self-indulgent mediocrity

This movie, while containing decent acting performances for the most
part, was difficult and just not very enjoyable to watch. It felt as
though it was in love with itself and its whole depiction of 70s east
coast disco Guido "culture" when in fact it was just an empty,
pointless piece of bombast not half as clever as it thought it was. It
felt fake, contrived and half-baked from the first scene to the last,
and as others have noted you just didn't care one bit about anyone on
screen.The performances were decent except for the lead FBI guy (sorry but
neither his screen nor real name is worth looking up) who tended to
overact. But ultimately the poor plotting & pacing and the clich√©
ridden visuals made this one I wish I would have missed; if there was
ever a movie that proves how useless so-called professional critics
are, this is it.
