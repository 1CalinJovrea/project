Life of an artist from an artists perspective

Is art the only thing one needs to survive. Can someone live on art
alone. No, not even the best of artists can. Even they need food,
casual sex, alcohol and other intoxicants. The story of recovery from a
deteriorating career was something which I could personally relate to.
And when at the end of the movie when one feels inspired to recover
from ones own downfalls seeing the amazing recovery of the protagonist,
one can only cry, because it only makes me realize that its just a
movie. There is no chance of any recovery in real life for losers who
has nothing else to do other than watching cheap porn and pirated
movies from the internet. This was an amazing movie. Amazing
presentation of the imaginary domain, the dreamy world of the artist.
His inner conflicts and his constant struggle with the outer world that
relies totally on logic and news and money making. The paranoia and
psychological phenomenon that goes on within the mind of an artist is
presented beautifully. Enjoyed it.
