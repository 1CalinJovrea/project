Possibly the strangest love story I've seen in cinema, but a beautiful story about being happy.

Sally Hawkins plays Maudie Who was born physically challenged. In order
to prove she can take care of herself she answers an ad pinned in the
local store by Everett Lewis played by Ethan Hawke to be his somewhat
live-in maid, and they end up being each other's soulmates. Despite his
horrible behavior she actually thrived as an artist living
interdependently with him.Hawkins and Hawke made a great team. It was a compelling relationship
to watch unfold on the screen. It was a small and quiet movie and
depended on how good these two acted with each other, and they were so
good, I loved them both and the people that they played.
