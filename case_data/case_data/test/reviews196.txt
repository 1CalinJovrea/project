It's not offensive, it's just embarrassing

There's a scene in Kick-Ass 2 where one of Dave's only friends who
hasn't quite got into the whole "real life superheroes" act yet finally
joins them in an outfit that is basically an inversion of Dave's
yellow-and-green jumpsuit and tries to choose his name. All he can come
up with is variations like "Ass Kick!" and "The Asskicker" to which
Dave and his other friend understandably roll their eyes. He later
changes sides completely.Remember that awful movie that the Daily Mail reviewed and accidentally
called Kick-Ass? That's what Kick-Ass 2 is really a sequel to. It's so
much a pale interpretation of what some terrible people thought the
first movie was (and I'm afraid one of those people may be the series'
creator, Mark Millar, who quite famously reads the Daily Mail) that it
may as well be titled one of those awful unimaginative names Dave's
friends comes up with.I was actually fine with the awful clangers early on in this movie the
Austin Powers-esque, "she sure had some big guns" followed by a shot of
someone carrying some actual big guns towards the camera, the blatant
descriptive gags like "his baton is so much bigger than Kick-Ass's
baton means cock, by the way" the desperate attempts to be current
with Mother F**ker spouting his plans to basically tear the world down
and then saying, "I gotta tweet about this!"I could deal with all this because I didn't expect much from this movie
except for Hit Girl to be awesome. I really thought they couldn't mess
that up because she's such an indestructible character. There's an
early line where she tells her foster father, "I've done more in 15
years of my life than most adults have done in all of theirs," and it
should ring hard for anyone over 30. Even part of the sequence I'm
about to talk about gives a fine glimpse of what Chloe Moretz's Carrie
might be like  in short, it might work, she shows the kind of
vulnerability I didn't ever expect to see in such a face  a face that,
if I described honestly, I'd probably be taken in by YewtreeBut it's in that middle sequence, the bulk of Moretz's strangely short
screen time (she was the highlight of the first movie and even the
negative reviews of this one single her out  I'm afraid I can't even
be that generous), where this movie really lost me entirely. It begins
as a strange Mean Girls knock-off with Mindy (Hit Girl) quite
inexplicably going along with a plan to make her "like other girls",
passing through a strange slumber party scene where she basically gets
horny for the first time watching a "Union J" video (I was surprised to
find this cheesy looking band, looking as fake as everything else in
this movie, is actually real  and Chloe Moretz is a fan, forcing me to
assume it's her doing), and proceeding to a clichéd looking jock
taking her on her first date (her foster father, so protective, seems
to be fine with this) that for a horrible second I thought was going to
lead into some kind of rape (I forget if the other "rape" scene happens
before or after this  I'm not even gonna talk about that 'cos it's
been mentioned plenty elsewhere). Instead she is met by her fellow
school pals and then deserted. HURTFUL! This whole middle act story
ends with Mindy strolling into school dressed like all the other
shallow girls and prodding them with an invention of Big Daddy from the
first movie  a stick that makes them throw up and diarrhoea at the
same time, which looks more like vanilla and chocolate pudding coming
out of both ends. It was at this point that if you'd photographed me
you'd have seen a face that looked a little like when Eric Cartman's
funny bone broke in "South Park".It's not that I'm offended by this stuff. If you know me, you know
this. And I knew that under any other circumstance I would've found it
tear-inducingly funny. There was just something about the way it was
done, and the context, that kind of paralysed me. It was just so 
pointless.Jim Carrey disowned this movie because of the violence after Sandy Hook
etc. He'd've done better just saying he was embarrassed at how it
turned out. I heard there was a post-credits scene at the end of
Kick-Ass 2, but I left as soon as the screen went black and I wished
for once I was the kind of person who leaves earlier sometimes. Frankly
unless that post-credits scene was Ashton Kutcher saying "you've been
punk'd!", I think at least I saved some of my time the day I saw this.
It's not offensive, it's just embarrassing. The only good thing is that
it'll make you realise just how classy the first movie was. Jane
Goldman and Matthew Vaughn, you are sorely missed
