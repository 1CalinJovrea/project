Excellent sci-fi movie with a fairly original idea.

This is not a turn your brain off and watch pretty explosions movie.
Nor is it going to hold your hand and go out of its way to explain
itself to you. If you aren't awake and thinking you will not enjoy this
movie.Most of the negative reviews are likely from people who were sleeping
through it and simply didn't understand it or missed key references in
various scenes.The script is excellent, and for being low-budget, the (very few)
shortcuts taken are generally admissible as they don't detract from the
plot or excitement.Definitely worth checking this one out!
