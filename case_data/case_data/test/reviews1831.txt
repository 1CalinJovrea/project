A welcome send-off to a beloved ensemble of characters

As we are frequently reminded during the course of T2, it's been 20
years since Danny Boyle's iconic and culturally eye-opening
Trainspotting. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his cronies, in a
monologue no doubt quotable to anybody who was a teenager in 1996,
famously decided not to choose life, and instead were on course for a
wasted existence of heroin addiction and crime. The main question asked
by this sequel is: Was it worth it? The group fans were so eager to see
back together may have less hair and more body fat, but they have
finally put aside personal squabbles (McGregor and Boyle made up after
the former was overlooked in favour of Leonard Di Caprio for The Beach)
and worked around ongoing contracts to reunite. While T2 struggles to
find a consistent tone and somewhat falls apart during its final act,
it will no doubt put a smile on any fan's face.The fragility of male machismo and the sudden emergence of middle- age
are key themes running throughout the film, constantly harking back and
reminding the audience with sly nods of how much fun these guys were 20
years ago. Trainspotting began with a skinny, pale- faced Renton
running from store security, but here he runs dead-eyed on a treadmill.
Although it would seem that Renton successfully put himself on the
straight-and-narrow in Amsterdam after robbing his friends blind at the
climax of the first film, he finds himself compelled to visit his past
after suffering a medical scare. Returning to Edinburgh, not much has
changed. Simon, aka Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), is still running
scams, now with his Bulgarian 'girlfriend' Veronica (Anjela
Nedyalkova); Spud (Ewen Bremner) lives alone and is hated by his
embarrassed son, successfully getting himself off heroin before making
his way back to it; and the psychopathic Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is
behind bars serving a 25 year jail term.Irvine Welsh's sequel to the hit novel, Porno, has been talked about as
a film adaptation ever since the first film struck so many chords with
its audience. T2 is not this adaptation, but instead takes inspiration
from Porno, as well as unused material from its predecessor, to create
an original story. A straight-forward follow- up would not have done
the fans justice. The cultural impact was so significant that
Trainspotting played a big part in many young people's lives, to the
point where just to hear the opening few seconds of Lou Reed's Perfect
Day or Underworld's Born Slippy could transport any 30-40 year old back
to their youth. Boyle knows this, and teases us in a scene where Renton
re-visits his childhood home and fiddles with a record player. The
stomping drums of Iggy Pop's Lust for Life pumps out before he suddenly
takes the needle off the record. In that split second, the excitement
comes flooding back. Yet T2 isn't just a trip down nostalgia lane, it
confronts you with the difficult question of whether or not you are
where you thought you'd be when life seemed more care-free.Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle infuses the sequel with a modern
energy, opting for a more colourful palette made dirtier with digital
grain. It contrasts the films' two different styles by slotting in
actual scenes from the original, often juxtaposing events happening now
with the characters' memories. The main conflict revolves around
Begbie's escape from prison and his learning of Renton's reemergence in
Edinburgh, as well as Sick Boy's resentment of his former best friend
robbing him of his share in the drug deal gone right. Begbie uneasily
shifts between comic relief and genuine antagonist, and Boyle seems
unsure what to do with the character. The biggest revelation is
Bremner's Spud, who is still the most sympathetic reprobate ever to
emerge from Welsh's text. Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge ingeniously
find a way to make him front and centre, turning this into his story,
and Bremner's performance is truly heartbreaking. A mishandled climax
and a lack of development for Veronica means that T2 falls way short of
its predecessor, and this will perhaps not have the same impact on any
audience members who saw Trainspotting outside of the '90s. But for
those of us who did, this is a welcome send-off.
