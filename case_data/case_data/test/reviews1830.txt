What was THAT all about really?

Where to begin? It didn't make sense. It didn't have laughs. It didn't
make it clear which period it was set in. It didn't have character
development - it merely had characters to whom things happened. It
didn't have any understanding of the drug culture. Or the music
culture. Or the technology of the day - whichever day it really is set
in. OK, it must be the 80s, 90s because of the cassettes. But as a
group they dressed so unlike any teenagers I have ever seen anywhere.
And they don't know Bowie? Old music aficionados? It didn't make sense.The school. It didn't ring true. All the pupils were stock characters.
Don't get me started on the gay jock storyline. Cartoon land. As was
the fight scene. As was much of the film. A few tender moments, but
mostly stuff we've seen a hundred times before. The acting was fine. Patrick's character annoyed me though. He seemed
to have no depth, whereas Charlie was all depth for a very clichéd
reason. I am still none the wiser as to why he wasn't sorted out at his
first trip to hospital before the film began. You mean the psych
doctors didn't probe far enough first time around? And once he lets it
all out to his new smiling psychiatrist, he is instantly cured? Freud
still lives? Oh please...It didn't make sense. And what were the perks of being a wallflower
anyway? Free pot brownies? Besides he wasn't a wallflower for about 95%
of the movie. Oh, so the whole clique were wallflowers, misfits,
outsiders? No they weren't. They were just like everyone else with
around three good friends each, but in their case, dubious taste in
music. I mean Eileen and Heroes? OK, I like Heroes, but so
inappropriate for a bunch of youngsters seriously into retro. They
think Something by the Beatles is 'out there'? Embarrassing musical
clichés at every turn.Emma Watson, you need to choose better directors and scripts or you'll
end up glossed over. Take a leaf out of Jennifer Lawrence's playbook is
my advice. Not sure why some here took her acting to task. She
delivered. But with the lines she was given I shouldn't be surprised
some didn't like her.This film is a sorry mess that I was expecting much more from. I found
myself finding fault with almost every scene. Don't like doing that.
Perhaps it might work for kids who have had little movie experience,
but wouldn't the music put them off? Why the high IMDb rating? It's a
mystery to me.
