Disappointing Twaddle

This has absolutely so much going for it - beautifully filmed, with a
magnificent, sweeping score and a stunning performance from Sally
Hawkins - but crashes and burns in sentiment, clich√© and cartoon
supporting acts. It comes across, ultimately, as a cack-handed mash up
of "E.T.", "Splash" and "The Creature From the Black Lagoon", as an
aquatic man is captured and brought into a secret military American
laboratory in the 1960s at the height of the cold war, and Sally
Hawkins' mute cleaner develops a bond with it and, ultimately, falls in
love.Sounds interesting, doesn't it? It certainly has potential, but if the
sassy black friend, constantly yammering on about her feckless husband
(Octavia Spencer, surely tiring of this kind of role) doesn't get you,
or the inefficient gay neighbour/best friend (Richard Jenkins - not his
finest two hours) or Michael Shannon's cartoonish, 2D villain, then
stay tuned for the ghastly black-and-white fantasy dance number, in
which Hawkins and the creature cavort on an elaborate set like Astaire
and Rogers. It truly is a ghastly mis-step, jaw-droppingly stupid. The
film never really recovered for me, and it lumbered to its predictable
climax and ending with numbing melodramatics and sentiment.
