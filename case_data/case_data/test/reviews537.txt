Underrated

I thought the movie was brilliant, all of the idea's that have been
slated is almost exactly why i thought it was very well thought out. For starters The Lotus Elise has remarkably low emissions for a sports
car and as the characters that were driving them were "Seekers" then it
would make sense for them to have sports cars, as for them being
silver- a few practical applications can be used in highly reflective
surfaces. The Blue eyes, well the tell is when they call themselves "Souls" and
as the eyes are the "windows to the soul" then an effect such as that
would be quite fitting. The idea of eyes lighting up through aliens
isn't new such as Stargate which had a similar (if not almost same)
theme regarding symbionts and hosts! And that was a multi million
dollar franchise.They don't actually say they want peace at any point with humans, they
want peace with each other as they have relied on each other for
thousands of years.Its a shame that this might not see another light of day though due to
the "Buck" return it had because, i thought it was a start to something
that could be amazing, the story had me from the start, the idea that
it wouldn't take massive spaceships and guns to infiltrate the human
race makes perfect sense. With the exception of the love triangle (which most movies have) it has
nothing whatsoever related to recent vampire flicks. Definitely one to watch in my opinion, we saw Seekers, Healers etc but
we didn't see who their bosses were!
