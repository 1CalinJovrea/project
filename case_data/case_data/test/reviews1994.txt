This movie was too, too, too. TOO over the top. Too melodramatic. Too forced. Too predictable. Too
blase. Never hit its mark.Not much more I can think to say.I wish there wasn't a requirement for 10 lines.That's about the extent that I think of it. Would like to at least
share that much.Other than too much, acting wasn't bad, Bradley Cooper's blue eyes were
fun to look at.Even thought the girl, Lily, was too much. Too much hair! Too much of a
stereotype.
