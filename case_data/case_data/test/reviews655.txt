Stereotype Squad

Just awful -horrible dialogue, zero premise. Stereotype Squad as far as
characters concerned...in particular the Asian 'character' which was
obviously a laughably cynical afterthought and the Boomerang Joe or
Pete (I didn't care) - I mean, come on! Will Smith seemed embarrassed
or wincing delivering his lines -hard to tell -and as for Jared Leto's
OTT indulgent 'acting' -sheesh. Margot Robbie was probably only one
whose character had a few good lines. Sad to see the otherwise
incredible actress from Secrets and Lies reduced to the ridiculous boss
character. The CGI was awful, particularly the monster at the end.
Didn't make me feel anything toward the characters -no emotional
resonance whatsoever.
