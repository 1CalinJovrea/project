Too much of one's ego and no director on sight to take hold on it:(

Well, well, well... I went on to see it thinking "You can't just get
enough of pretty naked men". As it appeared I was wrong. First of all:
although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just
being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40
minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt
Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will
not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you
cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad
not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to
notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building
characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party
were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm
concerned, I'd like to see more of "Let's make a good film" attitude
rather than purely "Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not
to go into strip club"... It made me sad - I was counting on something
that would be a start of amazing acting careers for Joe Manganiello,
Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez and Alex Pettyfer. Well, in my opinion this
film won't help. Period.
