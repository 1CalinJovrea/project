A shoddy, overlong tribute to anthology horror movies.

I'm a big fan of anthology horror movies, and horror in general and I'm
willing to accept found footage movies if they're done well enough.
That being said this is not done well at all. They use every found
footage cliché except night vision. Constant "glitch cuts", people
carrying the camera around while in danger for no reason, disoriented
confusing action sequences. The found footage aspects are the main
weakness in this movie, but I'll put that aside for now and review this
movie on its other aspects. First of all every character in this movie is terrible. They're either
perverted frat boy assholes or completely void of personality. They're
not the kind of characters you can't wait to be killed, they're the
kind of characters you can't wait to stop listening to. I know there's
no time to really flesh out any characters in an anthology, but you can
at least give them a personality, these guys are just boring, boring,
boring. The plot of most of these shorts are only possible through monumentally
stupid decisions from the characters. They never call the call the
cops, are constantly tripping while running away (maybe if you dropped
the camera...), and the overarching plot characters are the stupidest
of them all. There's no bow-tie at the end connecting all these stories, and
therefore no need for the very bland overarching story itself. However
in a few of the tapes the mystery is strong enough to keep you
interested and some of the tension is pretty thrilling, although it
never really pays off. I would be more forgiving of the cliché story and characters if it was
easier to watch, and I'd be more forgiving of the found footage
faux-pas if it had better stories. But this is the worst of both
worlds, I would give this a 4/10 but I'm bumping it up 1 for the tits.
