Boring and forgettable

First off I am a fan of the previous movies. they were not masterpieces
of story telling or acting but at least they were entertaining and
somewhat funny. Secondly this is one very very boring movie. there is
no plot to speak off, no characters to get any attachment to, no sense
of a story what so ever. the only thing that is there is Michael Bays
trademark explosions. 150 minutes of them... You could take away every
human in the movie and still have the same result. You could take away
100 of the 166 minutes and still have the same result. The fights are a
constant mess where you cant really root for someone cause you cant
really understand who is doing what. All in all I spent more than half
the movie trying to understand where it was going and praying for it to
end.
