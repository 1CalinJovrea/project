Why We Pay to Watch Others Suffer

Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of
crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like
eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the
crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to
look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax
after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after
tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion!
Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch
our breath? If you can watch this film without crying, I don't want to know you.
The woman behind me was on the edge of her seat, not just because I
smell good. The audience at the 10:40 a.m. matinée  the theater was
packed  applauded at the end, and was very slow to leave the theater,
even as the closing credits rolled. Typical of big, fat, nineteenth-century novels, there are numerous
implausible coincidences that drive the plot. These coincidences took
me out of the movie, but that was a good thing. The human suffering on
screen was overwhelming: suicide, enslavement, exploitation of living
humans' body parts, prostitution, disease, spite, malice, child abuse,
starvation, sadism, a dying man escaping through very graphic sewerage.
I did have to repeat to myself, "This is only a movie" even as tears
streamed down my cheeks. Jean Valjean is imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his
sister's starving children. He slaves for twenty years. He hauls a
massive, capsized sailing ship. The scene does look like obviously fake
CGI, but that doesn't make it any less gut wrenching. The workers sing,
"You'll always be a slave. You are standing in your grave." They are
the men we see in Sebastiao Salgado photographs of Third World
laborers. They are Ilya Repin's "Barge Haulers on the Volga." Valjean's
nemesis is the crazily obsessive policeman, Javert. They spar
throughout the film, as Valjean's fate rises and falls and rises and
falls and rises  you get the idea. A story this big, this broad, and this implausible requires one hundred
percent commitment from the performers. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is
superb. He believes. He emotes. He is as big as the story itself.
Jackman is the heart and soul of "Les Miserables." I loved him. Anne
Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne, Samantha Barks, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha
Baron Cohen  they all had me convinced. Russell Crowe was a surprising
disappointment. He's a brilliant actor and I kept waiting for him to
bring some fire, some ice, some power, some insight to Javert, the
obsessive and punitive policeman who mercilessly hounds Jean Valjean. I
wanted a memorable moment that would make me feel that Crowe's
performance brought Javert to intimate life for me. That moment did not
arrive. I wondered while watching this movie whether it will be embraced by the
political left or the political right. It is a deeply and unashamedly
Christian film. A Catholic priest, emulating Jesus, is the catalyst.
Valjean spends the rest of the film working to live up to the priest's
Biblical example. "Les Miserable" is leftist in that it depicts the
poor rising up, but then the poor fail their own putative saviors, and
allow them to be massacred, alone. Javert, representing law and order,
is a monster. The film's brief glimpse of heaven is like some limousine
liberal's fantasy. I think "Les Miserables" is as popular as it is for the same reason
that Cinderella is so popular. When "Les Miserable" was a stage play,
tickets were a very expensive and difficult to acquire luxury. It is
ironic that a play about the wretched of the earth would be such a
luxury entertainment. Why do we enjoy watching people much poorer and
more desperate than we will ever be? Why do we pay for the privilege?
Because we all see ourselves in Cinderella, in Jean Valjean, no matter
how lucky we are. I'll certainly never stand in cold sea water with
iron shackles around my wrists and neck, overseen by a cold sadist like
Javert. But, along with millions of others, I saw my own struggles in
Valjean, and thanked God that I didn't have it as bad as he. If Jean
Valjean can go on, I can, too! I wish the songs had been a tad better. There are a couple of good
ones, "I dreamed a dream" and "Do you hear the people sing?" All the
actors sing very well. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman sing especially
well.
