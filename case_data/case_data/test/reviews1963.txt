Mind-Boggling Story Revealing the Racism of the Times

This incredible, historical film opened my eyes and made me better
understand the world I live in. Given that racism is still a prevalent
issue in today's society, it was mind-boggling to see it in Britain, at
the turn of the 20th century. I admire how this film brings the past to
the present, and made me question how racism can dissipate in the
future. This film carefully documents the relationship between Queen Victoria
and her beloved servant, Abdul Karim. Queen Victoria reigned in the
United Kingdom from 1837 to 1901. She was the longest serving monarch
in world history. In addition to being a queen, she was also the
Empress of India. Because of this, Abdul Karim and his friend Mohammed
are sent from India to Britain to deliver a sacred coin: the Mohur.
Abdul and Mohammed believe they are only going to remain in Britain for
a short period of time, but they end up going on the adventure of a
lifetime. Judi Dench, who plays Queen Victoria, exceptionally portrays a queen
who is tired of her constriction. All she wants to do is have Abdul be
her full- time servant, but because of his origins, Queen Victoria's
staff does not approve. Ali Fazal, who plays Abdul Karim, considers the
queen a very special person and his kindness towards her is impeccable.
He teaches her the Quran and shares his culture with her. As time goes
on, both develop a strong friendship, which is truly heartwarming. The setting is remarkable. I've never seen the Taj Mahal, Scotland or
the queen's palace. This film takes the audience to all these places.
After seeing the beauty in other countries, it makes me want to travel
the world. My favorite part of this film is when Queen Victoria eats
with her staff. She eats very quickly and, once she finishes her food,
regardless if the others are done or not, the servants take all of the
food away. It's hilarious to see people still eating their meals and
have their food taken away in the blink of an eye. The message of this film is that no race, culture or religion is
subordinate to another, even though individuals are from many different
backgrounds. Britain is usually portrayed as one of the most powerful
countries, but not in this film. We have to learn to not categorize
others as inferior because of their lifestyle. Differences make society
beautiful. If we were all the same, everything would be boring. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to kids ages 15 to
18 as well as adults. There are undertones of adult subject matter
throughout the film. Queen Victoria is infatuated with much a younger,
married man, which is why an older audience is more suitable for it. Reviewed by Samantha M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.
