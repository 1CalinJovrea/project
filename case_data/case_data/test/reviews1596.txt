Tainted, although sparkly in light

The Bad Batch refers not to some brown acid but rather to a particular
set of ex-convicts, those recently released from a prison in the
southwestern US. Each inmate is tattooed with a serial number, which
naturally precludes them from gainful, meaningful employment. Good
thing that the vast desert right outside the prison's gates is
uncharted territory, meaning it's not under the jurisdiction of either
the US or Mexico. It just is.Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) is such an ex con. With nowhere else to go, she
begins a-wandering across the desert with a jug of water. She finds a
rusted-out car and  for some reason  begins to apply her eyeliner
using the rear-view mirror. Then a couple of people roar up in a golf
cart and abduct her. When she wakes up, she's chained to an airplane
door. She gets injected with something  I'm gonna guess a sedative or
painkiller  and her abductors lop off her right arm and left leg. And
eat them.None of that is a spoiler. It all happens in the first twenty minutes
or so. Our heroine does quickly escape and finds a place called
Comfort, which is basically a continuous rave. Comfort is run by The
Dream (Keanu Reeves, delivering a particularly wooden performance), and
everyone there is part of the Bad Batch themselves, the rejects of
society.Arlen is out for revenge, so back to the cannibals she goes. There's a
lot of her ping-ponging back and forth between the two camps, for
various uninteresting reasons. But this isn't a standard revenge movie
 it's much more confounding and pointless. I can get behind a good old
fashioned revenge flick, but this is just dopey nonsense. You know
things are out of wack when you kind of root for the main cannibal
(Jason Momoa). And when the best performance in the movie, by a long
shot, is by Jim Carrey as a grizzled hermit  who never speaks a word.The Bad Batch looks pretty and might even have a genesis for a cool
movie within it somewhere, but it's a major dud. It's also very
violent, so you have plenty of gore to look forward to. And lastly,
Arlen's lopped-off limbs are on full display (not hiding behind bulky
clothes), and apparently this was accomplished without resorting to
digital erasure of her real arm and leg. So that's a positive. Not much
else is.
