Intense movie, that raises almost as many questions as the answers that it provides.

I found this movie to be very intense and riveting. The audience seemed
to have a need to make an unusual number of trips to the snack bar and
rest room and I found myself becoming frustrated by the number of
interruptions. The movie is not for the faint of heart, as there are a
number of scenes with graphic depiction of injuries. Regardless of your
political affiliation, if you have any thoughts about what happened at
Benghazi, you need to see this movie. Michael Bay does a great job of
portraying what happened. Additionally, with the exception of one
individual who s portrayed as not wanting to take action, he does not
take the obvious opportunity to lay blame at any single individual in
the US government. He clearly portrays a small group of men as heroes.
Without their courage and willingness to fight against what appears to
be an overwhelming force many more lives would have been lost. I do not
often see movies twice, but this movie is likely to be an exception...
In closing, if Michael Bay is 90% accurate in his depiction of what
happened, our government (the US government), owes a huge debt of
gratitude and an apology for their lack of action to 6 very brave men.
