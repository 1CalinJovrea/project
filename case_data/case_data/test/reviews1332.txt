Exciting thriller

Contraband is an exciting thriller full of suspense with a slight bit
of comedy. Mark Wahlberg is always a fan favorite with his sarcasm and
flattering physique. The movie takes place in New Orleans near the
shipping yards where all the material is received to sell on the black
market. Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) is a retired smuggler turned family
man who now owns his own business selling alarm systems. Farraday is
forced back into the contraband game when his brother-in-law, Andy
(Caleb Landry Jones), owes his boss, Tom Briggs, a large sum of money
due to the drug deal he failed to deliver. Everything does not go
according to plan when Farraday goes to Panama with his team of
smugglers to repay Andy's debt. The film is listed as an action movie
but the action doesn't really start till half way through. The
background of the story is delivered in a timely manner letting us know
what will happen in the movie. Once the movie finally reaches the
action in Panama the audience is at the edge of their seats. The ending
reveals an unexpected twist that I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall it is
another great movie with Wahlberg that I would recommend to friends.
