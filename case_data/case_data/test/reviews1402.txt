Absolutely terrible......

I really had high hopes for this movie. Especially after seeing the
trailers. Well, if you saw the trailer, that's exactly all the "funny"
this movie has to offer... Literally... Out of 2+ hr movie, they fit
all the amusing parts in the 2min trailer for it. I could not finish
the movie. Walked out of the theater after getting my money back. I'm
in my mid 30's and I found the main characters (including the kids) to
be self centered, annoying, and most of all depressing. The title of
the movie should not be "This is 40". It should be "This is 18",
because the language, the "acting", the situation "humor" would only
appeal to that age group... I cannot stress enough how painfully awful
this way too long movie is... This should have never made it into a
production. If anything, is should of been a one time Saturday Night
Life skid. It would probably be fine as that... Nothing more... Do not
waste 2hrs of your life on this emotionless drain on your brain...
Worst movie of 2013 for me so far.....
