Typical American Hero story but false

It's an interesting story but it just fall flat when they push that
American hero nonsense in there just because they can't paint out
America or Americans as anything but heroes even though this oil spill
was really bad.spoilers coming up.So at one point one crew member wanted to push a button that would seal
something, possibly preventing the spread of fire but she didn't have
authority to do so so she couldn't even though it probably would have
been the difference in life of others. So they drag the captain up to
the bridge so they could hold his busted hands and push the button with
his finger...now that's nonsense. They want to portrait these guys as
heroes, no way they did that in real life. Get off it.So first I got salty about all those hero stuff but then I really got
sour when they all (but 11 I think) got rescued and started praying to
god. Now what the hell, there's just been a major tragedy, lives were
lost, oil would contaminate the water and they uniformly decides to
read bed time stories to pray to God. That takes the cake for me. Don't
push your God-crap on me, that also didn't happened in real life.So great shots, good acting, interesting story but those two
ingredients destroyed this picture for me.
