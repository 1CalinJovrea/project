Great movie

I thought it was a great movie. I grew up watching the old Annie and I
loved this one just as much. The original Annie made you feel happy for
Annie and Mr Warbuck but this Annie made you feel good about yourself
and your family. I thought the new songs were catchy and enjoyable. The
only bad thing I can see was that Cameron Diaz's acting was a bit over
exaggerated but besides that, it was great. I had no problem at all
with the actors being black, in fact, I didn't even think about it
until I came on here and read the disgusting comments. All the people
that grew up with the old Annie and are hating on this one need to stop
because this is an updated version on the story that was made for the
next generation. Just think of the poor little girls in the movie
reading your disgusting comments.
