Fun and entertaining,  but warning: do not watch if you are republican

I did not expect much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. If
you are looking for some good time I would highly recommend it this
week (*).Yes this movie has all the Hollywood clich√©s you've seen before: full
of CGI, simple and predictable plot, happy ending, etc But it is quite
fun and entertaining. Actors will not get Oscars, but had enough
chemistry. CGI was not misplaced and pace was just right. This is definitely a movie to be watched in a movie theater. I think I know who is giving this movies bad reviews. Read warning
below(*) One warning: If you are
republican/conservative/earth-flatter/whoever who uses stuff invented
by scientist but do not get it DO NO WATCH THIS MOVIE! You would be
better with stuff from Jeff Tremaine. a) It starts with climate change stuff. Oops N1 b) In 2019 presidents is NOT Trump and he is Democrat! Big oops N2 c) And by far the worst part is that world gets together! Inexcusable
oops N3
