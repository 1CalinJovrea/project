Everything's better with maturity

I just saw Richard Linklater's Before Midnight his newest and third
film about Jesse and Celine the couple who meet as young adults in
Before Sunrise and re-meet as adults in Before Sunset (one of my five
favorite films).This is simply brilliant film making: funny, raw, emotionally honest
and complicated. The couple (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy who both
co-wrote with Linklater) are now in their 40s and face some very real
challenges to their menage. I started laughing and crying within about
3 minutes and both emotions kept up until the very end. Everyone sat
through the credits so they could wipe their faces clean. Brilliant
acting . . .This film gives one hope for the state of American film making and
reminds you that Linklater is one of our most underrated auteurs. I
sincerely hope he continues and I live long enough to see the couple
well into their senior years.Even if you have never seen the first two movies, do not miss this one.
