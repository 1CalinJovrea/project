Surprisingly okay!

Firstly, I am sick to death of 'remakes/re-imaginings'. It's lazy use
of real talent. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the films that 're-imagined'
Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror - but being
remakes with a copied plot cheapens them somewhat.Then you have the pointless remakes that COMPLETELY miss the point of
the original - Last House on the Left earned it's reputation as a
sadistic wallow in sleaze which the remake didn't meet in the
slightest.I expected the same of Maniac, as the original's appeal was
purely in it's grimy sleaze.What we have though is a very well made film. Beautifully photographed
(with an emphasis on the POV which is bound to attract controversy), an
attempt at griminess, no lacking in gore and a simple story in a film
that doesn't over-run it's basic premise with a long running time.The original film had it's problems (Caroline Munro interested in Joe
Spinell). At one point Frank meets with an online date who exclaims he
was not what she expected (and pretty much describes Joe Spinell).I don't think this will gain many fans or critical praise (even
hardcore horror fans I know were unware it had been made) , but fans of
the original will have a chuckle and others will appreciate a well
made, tight horror film.I find it odd that the cast are listed alphabetically (so Elijah Wood
is last on screen and not listed at all on the IMDb basic cast list).
Then again most of his part was voice over!
