Annoying and just shockingly bad.

This is the worst film I have seen in ages. The premise looked
promising but the film they made was just so unbelievably bad. If you
think you'd like nearly 2 hours of extra-shaky hand-cam footage,
spectacularly annoying idiots yelling at each other, and repetitive
special effects with lots of stuff breaking, then this is the film for
you. The three main characters are dumb beyond belief and it's
impossible to sympathize with any of them. There is no explanation as
to how the super powers came about and the characters don't spend one
moment thinking about how they could change their lives or anyone
else's lives for the better. They just do a bunch of dumb things and
then they do a bunch of even dumber things. Do yourself a favour and
watch anything else. I cannot believe how high the ratings are for this
piece of garbage!
