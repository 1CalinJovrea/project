Just Unbelievable

"Creep" is a mixture of movie and "found footage" film. The premise is
simple enough. A hard-up photographer answers an ad in Craigslist and
realizes he can make $1,000 if he simply stays with a person for 8
hours taking photographs of a "simple life." He gets way more than he
bargained for.Upon his arrival at his destination, he meets his employer who tells
him he is dying of cancer and wants to do a film of a day in his life
so that he can leave it for his surviving wife and son "on the way."
Josif is paid upfront and the filming starts. This film has gotten rave reviews and I cannot understand why. From the
get-go, the viewer knows something is very wrong about this entire
situation. The first thing the photographer is asked to do is film the
guy while he pretends to be playing with his son. But then, he wants
him to film him doing a "tubby" with his son. Sorry, but money or not,
if some guy immediately gets naked in front of me, I'll see ya' later.
And the stupidity doesn't stop here. Josif just throws himself
willy-nilly into any kind of stupid pretense you can think."Creep" isn't a bad movie, BUT, it isn't a good movie. I did not buy
the ending for a second. It was as though they thought this ending had
to be done so the viewer would not feel he/she had wasted a lot of
their time for nothing. Rated R for adult situations, language, and
brief nudity. NOT RECOMMENDED.
