Proud Showcase of Mexican Culture

Musical Manolo, scrappy Joaquin and smart Maria are three close
childhood pals. Maria gets sent to Europe to study. Joaquin gets
seriously into training as a military officer. Manolo is discouraged by
his father from his musical aspirations, forcing him instead to take up
bullfighting, which is the traditional Sanchez family occupation. When
Maria returns to town after several years, Joaquin and Manolo vie for
her heart. Meanwhile, the two lords of the underworld, La Muerta (mistress of the
Land of the Remembered) and Xibalba (master of the Land of the
Forgotten) take a bet as to who Maria will end up with. On the Day of
the Dead, the deities interfere with the outcome, leading to an
adventure which will bring the characters from the land of the living
to the land of the dead and back.The most striking feature of this film is the animation style. The
human characters are made to look like wooden puppets. This artworks
were so ingeniously crafted such that each character is distinct from
each other. The three main human characters all look very good and
noble. The supporting characters are rather on the ugly, distorted side
in their rendition, and these may need getting used to. The background artwork is no less spectacular. The highlight of the
whole film are those scenes in the Land of the Remembered, showing it
as a happy bustling and festive place. The colors were so vibrant and
rich. The multi-layered designs were so intricate and meticulous in
their endemically Mexican-inspired details. Another wonderful feature of this film is the musical score, written by
Argentine composer Gustavo Santaolalla. This musician has been awarded
the Oscar two times before for films "Babel" and "Brokeback Mountain."
The soundtrack also employs the most unexpected pop songs, sung Mexican
style of course. Hearing a familiar song being sung makes me smile and
even sing along. The sensitive singing voice of Diego Luna (as Manolo)
makes songs as diverse as Radiohead's "Creep" to Elvis' "Can't Help
Falling in Love" sound so good.I believe this film had a lot of educational value in it for the young
audience it targets. There are a lot of Latino values being tackled
here about friendship and family, the status of women, the respect for
the dead, etc., which are likewise universal as well, more often than
not. It also introduces us, both kids and adults alike, to the vibrant
Mexican culture, especially about their Day of the Dead.The pace of the film was slow at first, but once you get into its
groove, you will surely enjoy the eventful ride. My two sons with me,
as well as the much younger kids in the theater with us, all seemed to
enjoy the film very much as you hear a lot of gleeful laughter at the
some of the shallower jokes. This was despite the rather macabre
subject matter and several grotesque-looking (albeit in a comical way)
characters. It also had humorous moments that only adults would chuckle
at. Aside from Diego Luna, the line-up of voice actors surprisingly
included Zoe Saldana as Maria and Channing Tatum as Joaquin. I would
not have guessed. Other familiar names such as Ron Perlman and
Christina Applegate are also on board. The most unexpected name I saw
on the list though was that of Ice Cube as the sunshiny fluffy
underworld character named Candlemaker. Some well-known Latino actors
like Hector Elizondo, Danny Trejo and Placido Domingo voice the more
mature characters, like Manolo's dad and ancestors.Overall, "The Book of Life" is a very unique animated feature film. The
basic story is based on Mexican folklore and traditions, so the
animation style had the colors, designs and style of Mexico. The
different look and unfamiliar references may turn off some less
adventurous viewers, but really it should not. This is one very
educational and very entertaining film for all ages. Writer and
Director Jorge R. Gutierrez was able to successfully expand on his
experience on Nickelodeon's frenetic award-winning animated series "El
Tigre:The Adventures of Manny Rivera" (which he also created) and here
proudly showcased his beloved Mexican roots on a much bigger platform.
8/10.
