appalling.  meretricious.

If there were any justice this film should be a career killer for
rogan, byrne, and efron.The sheer bankrupt cynicism that gets these worthless pictures financed
is more or less guaranteed because they keep making money from a feral
generation who think this is what humour is.But this is a comedy without humour or any redeeming merit. The studios
go on believing rogan is funny because his films reference a lost
generation of sybaritic wastrels, who have no cannon of judgement by
which to measure taste and intelligence, but who have the price of a
ticket.The mistakes are all in the writing -- the work of two no-hopers whose
only track record is in collaborating with each other. They should go
back and study the rudiments of plotting, structure and joke-writing
itself.There wasn't a single laugh in my audience and overall, the picture is
about as funny as a broken arm. the obscene language keeps on
descending to idiocy in every rogan film until it has no impact left at
all on a desensitised world.Efron's performance is borderline psychopathic and his internal
dialogue shows on his face as disgust at himself. I have never seen
such worrying ambivalence in an actor before. Actors don't know what is
good and what is not. They rely utterly on feedback, but never quite
believe the feedback. They call it going out on a limb and exposing
themselves to risk. Their obsequious flunkies never tell them the truth
so they find solace in anticipating the next good project and
half-remembering the last bad one.The production is ugly, improvised and worthless. One shot is actually
out of focus. But they think you don't notice such things.Do not see this film. Save your money. Don't encourage them to make
another like it. Pass over the ordure you're being offered on a regular
basis by the amoral cynics behind a class of film that will condemn
this generation with all future generations.If you saw Movie 43, then you know exactly what to expect from this
effort. Movie 43 required 28 talentless writers to produce abhorrence,
while Bad Neighbours efficiently took only 2 of them to fail on the
same scale.
