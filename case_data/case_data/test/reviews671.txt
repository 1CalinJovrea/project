Ignore the sterile critics and enjoy this movie while you can

First of all, to be fair, this movie is one of my most favorite romance
because to me, it's more real than any other chick-flick. Let's be
honest, OK? We all made mistakes and we were young so don't blame the
author or the director why they made them look so stupid. We were all
like that and if you were not, I feel bad for you. Don't waste your
time watching a movie which is made for the people who have a young and
wild spirit. Ignore the sterile critic who never loved someone like
those two people in the movie. SPOILER ALERT: if you read something
like they were stupid to have not admitted their love, please, they
were 18 years old. What could they have done? And that's why I love
fhis movie so much. They made mistakes and they learned from them,
that's the point. 12 years made their love stronger than anything else.
