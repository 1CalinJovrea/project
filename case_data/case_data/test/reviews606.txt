Impressive in its beauty!

Love can lead to transformation yet the force of greed and the lack of
political skills can bring anyone down even though you have the best
intentions and act for the "greater good". It does not happen very often that I come out of the cinema and
completely shut up. It didn't feel like I was listening to a
non-English dialogue. Danish felt like a familiar language ... and it
was beautiful in this movie.Though not with splendid clothes like Marie Antoinette, no intense
intrigues, no large battle scenes, it was one of the best historic
films I have ever seen. Everything was kept "small", yet with so much
feeling that I could not take sides with any of the 3 main characters.
Fair enough, the greedy and backward upper-class angered me much; just
can't stand stupidity, especially when it holds back progress and the
aim for improvements.
