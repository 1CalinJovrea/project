No great expectations from this pregnant pause

It's "New Year's Eve" in the neo-natal unit; "Valentine's Day" with a
uterus; "Knocked Up" times five. Unfortunately, that's about the best I
can write about this film featuring the ups and downs of having a baby.In an attempt to jump on the multi-story, large cast bandwagon,
director Kirk Jones (the charming "Waking Ted Devine," the horrid
"Nanny McPhee") - with the assistance of writers Shauna Cross and
Heather Hach ("Freaky Friday") - give us a few sparkling comedic
moments, only to ruin it all with depressing dramatic letdowns and
cinema's most predictable conclusion.Then again, some of the heavier scenes are actually more
(unintentionally) hilarious than the lighter ones. And while there is
nothing unusual about comedies with dramatic overtones, this movie is
all over the map, going from pure joy in some sequences to outright
horror and heartbreaking grief in the next one.Like "Hamlet," the movie suffers from an inability to make up its mind.With a cast featuring Elizabeth Banks ("The 40-Year Old Virgin," "Man
On a Ledge"), Cameron Diaz ("Something About Mary," "Killers"), Dennis
Quaid ("Cheaper By the Dozen," "The Express"), Jennifer Lopez ("The
Back-Up Plan"), Chris Rock ("Death At a Funeral"), Ben Falcone
("Bridesmaids"), Brooklyn Decker ("Just Go With It"), Wendi
McLendon-Covey ("Bridesmaids," "Reno: 911" TV series), Rebel Wilson
("Ghost Rider," "Bridesmaids"), Anna Kendrick ("50/50," "Scott Pilgrim
vs. the World"), Rob Huebel ("I Love You, Man") and Thomas Lennon ("Hot
Tub Time Machine"), among others, one figures the humor quotient would
rate high in this endeavor.One would mostly be wrong, however.Plot has five Atlanta couples: Evan (Matthew Morrison, "Glee" TV
series) and Jules (Diaz); Alex (Rodrigo Santoro, "Post Grad") and Holly
(Lopez); Ramsey (Quaid) and Skyler (Decker); Gary (Falcone) and Wendy
(Banks); and Marco (Chace Crawford, "Gossip Girls" TV series) and Rosie
(Kendrick), all of whom are in various stages of pregnancy and/or child
expectations.Evan and Jules have hooked up while involved on the show, "Celebrity
Dance Factor," (she throws up on live television after the final
episode), and now constantly bicker about whether or not to circumcise
the baby boy-to-be.Gary, who was on a fat-loss TV show, and children's author Wendy are
now expecting after years of trying; but also discover that Gary's
neglectful, NASCAR driver father, Ramsey, and his young wife are going
to have twins. The sad-sack, wimpy, whining son is one-upped by the old
man - again.Ad man Alex and professional photographer Holly are looking to adopt an
Ethiopian newborn; while Marco and Rosie - who work in competitive food
trucks - have a one-night stand. Somehow, all of these characters end
up connected with each other, no matter how far-fetched these
situations become.And for couples having their first children, there is little chemistry
or real love exhibited herewithin. The emotional depth is as shallow as
a saucer and just as inconsequential.Most of the yuks here are from Wendy, who wanted "the glow" of
pregnancy, but discovers the aches, pains and uncontrollable bodily
functions are paramount (her "mother-in-law," however, seems to have no
trouble, at all). A few more - rather uncomfortable - laughs are solicited from Janice
(Wilson), Wendy's idiot assistant (who honestly gets more snickers due
to her weight than her jokes, sad to say).The movie's worst crime, though, is Alex's association with a group of
depressing new dads, including Rock, Huebel and Lennon, who meet at a
park each day and spout unwanted and unnecessary advice to him about
being a father. Few of these scenes are funny - and a running gag of one of the men's
children tripping, falling and being hit in the head with full beer
cans - is simply dreadful.A herky-jerky film which lacks a fluid, coherent story, as well as any
semblance of pacing, aborts what could have been a much better movie
and will certainly give many viewers sympathy and - most likely - labor
pains for its 110-minute running time.
