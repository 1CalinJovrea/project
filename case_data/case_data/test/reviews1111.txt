This is a bad joke...

First I need to tell that I am from Central Europe. I am not writing
reviews but I can't be silent. This was terrible. This was 1st time
when after movie everybody was talking how bad it was. And everybody I
mean whole cinema.First 20-30 minutes were watchable. It was looking to be a solid movie,
but after that everything goes wrong. And I mean everything... Bad
dialog's; good music in very bad moments and several styles of it; main
character immortal; American happy ending style; no logic in this movie
anywhere; many mistakes noticeable for everyone...If a Uwe Boll have more money, he will make this movie better. When I
was watching Sharknado, I was less shocked by stupidity like in this
movie. It is waste of your time and money and watch it only when you
want to punish yourself.
