In space no-one can hear you yaaawn

Saw this at the Imax last night, I'm a huge fan of the alien films, I
love how each film is unique in their visual tone and style, and was
very much looking forward to Ridley Scott's Prometheus. The film may or
may not be directly linked to the original Alien film, however upon
viewing, you will realise that Prometheus is very much a prequel of
sorts.And an extremely bad and disappointing one at that.The film lacked any suspense, drive, atmospehere, strong
characterisation, or coherent plot. There was no atmospheric
scene-setting, you just get launched head-first into a lot of inane
dialogue, I actually just wanted the characters to shut up as there was
no value being added to further the story. The characters themselves
were a laughable joke. And many many many of the incidents that happen
had me scratching my head - how can someone who removes an alien from
their womb by cutting into their skin and muscle recover so quickly and
is able to run around, and absolutely NO-ONE ask why she has staples on
her stomach and is blood soaked? Why would a ship's captain who just
want to fly the ship and go home suddenly go on a suicide run taking
the crew with him, just based on quick information relayed to him by a
complete stranger? Why does one need to blow into a flute in order to
ignite the engines of a starship? If the mission was to contact a
possible alien life form, why only send a handful of geologists, who by
the way do not look at a single rock at any time in the movie? How does
the android David know how to fly the alien spacecraft, speak the alien
language, and know what the black goo will create? There are many many
more questions that can be found in countless other reviews on IMDb! I
was waiting and waiting for the main plot to kick in, but none came.
The visuals and 3D were impressive, but that's not the main focus of
what a movie should be! All other Alien films functioned perfectly in
2D with minimalistic special effects.Verdict: Prometheus is yet another example of modern filmmaking - trade
on an in-built audience to ensure big money, sacrifice story and
characterisation for flashy visuals.
