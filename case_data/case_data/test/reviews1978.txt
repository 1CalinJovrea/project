that was hell of annoying

Boy, these two sister for sure have no frigging clue about how to tell
a story (by film). Don't get me wrong, I think that's (at least
potentially) some good material right here - body-modifications in the
context of horror. Come on! That sounds a lot more promising than your
next silly zombie/ghost/fantasy flick. And I'm pretty sure someone
capable (in telling a story and filmmaking - both separate problems)
could tell one hell of a story somewhere along that "Blody Mary". First to the story-telling: so you have that idea about a film with
extreme body-modifications. Great. I already smell(ed) all kind of
horrors. But where would you take such a thing and what would you do
with it? What side of the human nature are you going to explore?
Something along the lines of mutilation/self-destruction versus
correction or beautification? Or rather something more wicked along the
lines of Frazer's "On edge"? Nope. You won't get much of anything the like or even slightly
interesting. Unforuntately the soska sisters aren't much of explorers
(which great film-makers, or more generally story-tellers, are!), so
they don't explore (as in illuminate) anything. Not in particular
anyways. This is a film where "being raped" is all the character
development you'll get. But mind you, this is no "Irreversible". Not at
all.Why was this rape-plot even necessary? As a catalyst? Nah... just to
setup that revenge-sub-plot. And why was that really necessary? Because
there would be no horror left. That's why. You see, that's the main
problem: since not exploring anything, the soska sisters didn't manage
to come up with a good (or horrifying) main plot. Extreme
body-modification? Sure, no big deal, just count from 100 to zero and
you'll be fine! They wake up and live happily ever after. Nothing else
happens. No complications whatsoever. Nobody dies. No drama. Nothing.
Just the barbie doesn't want to be regarded as sex object, that's why
she 1) got herself huge breast implants(?! - and don't even try to
argue here; we clearly are shown the scarfs from that booby-surgery) to
then 2) remove the nipples (they might have removed brains in an
additional step...). So there's nothing. Let's have some rape and then we can have the
revenge-horror! DUUHHH. Also there is a cop that doesn't do anything,
but hurray: another useless and derivative sub-plot! They tried so hard
to create any kind of suspense... it's not even funny and it doesn't
work on any level. Second; the filmmaking: it's horrendous. There is no flow, cuts and
whole scenes are more often irritating than not. Ultimatively the soska
sisters struggle with film language. A lot (to the point that it gets
hell(!) of annoying!).
