Exploitation and exploration

Based on the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who made
several expeditions to the lost city of Z, believed to be the remains
of El Dorado in the Brazilian jungle. The movie follows three of these
expeditions and first picks up his life with a long introduction from
his military career onwards. The movie becomes only interesting with
the start of his first map making expedition on the border of Bolivia
and Brazil in 1906. Based on documentary and field research (pottery
finds), Fawcett became ever more convinced that a complex civilization
had existed there. The movie then touches upon a second expedition
initiated by the Royal Geographical Society that lead to controversy
about his role in that expedition. The first World War comes in between
before he makes his last expedition in 1925 with his son.The script is based on the fascinating book by David Grann, who visited
the region in 2005 and came back with interesting findings about
Fawcett's expedition. By now, Fawcett has turned into an icon of
exploring ancient civilizations, making its way into popular culture,
Indiana Jones and The Lost World come to mind.The movie and script is however too obvious for the story at hand. It
is painting by numbers, going from phase A to B in Fawcett's life
without any intelligent storytelling, ending up with a movie that I
first thought was made for TV or online. Compare this to the classic
Herzog movies Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo, and it is clear what went wrong
here: Being about exploration, the movie itself shies away from
exploring cinematic possibilities and just plays it safe. Wouldn't it
for example not be far more interesting to just focus on that final
expedition and make the multiple accounts into a movie? Why Pitt's Plan
B saw anything in this is beyond me, as the company has by now a
reputation of risk-taking (and often being awarded for that).But don't get me wrong: The movie is still watchable and the story
itself is enough to keep your attention. And it is very nice to see
Darius Khondji popping up here as DoP, you can still see his
groundbreaking work in Se7en shining through.
