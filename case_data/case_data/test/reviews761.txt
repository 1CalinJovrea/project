Terrible movie for a braindead audience

How many more awful ego-fest Stallone movies will we have to endure
before his knumb-skull fanbase run out of reasons to watch? ExpII
continues the rambo/expendables silliness of some old farts who can
apparently take out scores of younger bad guys. There's a lot of gore
and a lot of cheap explosions, but once again it's ridiculously bad.
The story was absolutely retarded, the acting was atrocious. Stallone
and Stratham should honestly quit acting. The referential jokes by
Arnold and Willis were absolutely pathetic. The old actors all looked
way past it, and did not garner any sympathy due to their lack of
charisma. I was hoping for Van Damme to wipe them all out, but
naturally the lame good guys win, because Stallone must always live in
the end, due to some neurotic short-man syndrome or something. Oh yeah
the HGH and roids must've been why the budget is so high, because I
have no clue where the 100 million dollars went; it looked like
something straight to video. 1/10
