I enjoyed this movie very much, I'm a guy, am I normal ?

So my girlfriend and I were invited by a group of colleagues (all
female) to see this movie. I didn't know anything about it, except the
trailer and I was intrigued, I was anxious to see it. My excitement was
over as soon as my (male) colleagues heard I'm going to see it. They
started to laugh that I'm actually going to see such a piece of
garbage, I was called both a hero and gay. I didn't think much of it
until I read all the reviews on IMDb hours before seeing the movie, and
that's when I started to have second thoughts about it, seeing how
people reviewed this movie.I'm really sorry this movie has such horrible reviews, it deserves much
better. True, there's no complicated script, no fancy acting, no
original lines, no adorable love story but maybe we're expecting the
wrong things from this movie because it's considered as a romance and I
really think it's not. It has nothing to do with romance, it is in fact
about two different desires and passions and yet completely the same
once you boil them down, two sides of a coin, if you will. It's about a
man who has a different sexual desire than most men, who was abused as
a child and is now quite proud of what he has become and sees nothing
wrong with it... until he meets Anastasia, the only woman who manages
to crack his fortress and even though she wants to please her master,
she also wants her master to bend down to her desires and needs. Once
this is clear, the movie becomes an intriguing roller-coaster of
emotions, decisions, psychological struggle and compromises for both
partners who both love each other and want each other and yet... can't
find a common ground because none of them want to completely give in.
How come the majority can't relate to that, is beyond me...I will surely watch this one again, maybe I will understand why
everybody is giving this movie such a bad review. One thing is pretty
clear: males just don't get this movie and that's the majority, I would
bet it's the same majority of men that complain all their life about
how women are soooo complicated and nobody can understand them. If you
ask me, if you don't get this movie, you don't get women, or a good
majority of them. I read many guys writing stuff like "do women
actually go for that stuff, do they actually want to be abused and
raped?" Well, you're probably the kind of guy who thinks he's awesome
in bed, has the biggest penis and his women is satisfied after every 2
minutes of humping and then falling asleep, well... that's why women
enjoy this movie, but we act all shocked about it. The fact that over
one hundred young women around me in the cinema were giggling at every
sexual dominant scene, proves my point and it also proves that they are
missing something, but I guess to you they are just dumb. There was
also the biggest crowd (of around 95% young women) I ever saw queue up
in front of a cinema.And what's with all the hypocrisy ? you call this an anti-feminist
movie after you call it's female audience dumb for watching it ?
nice... You complain about the fact that it's abusive and "oh my god,
how degrading to women", and yet... you rejoice at every action movie
or thriller where a mad man is actually beating and raping or torturing
women and girls ? how are those any better ? just because the focus is
on the hero and how he saves the day, makes it less disturbing ? How
about "12 years a slave" ? that wasn't abusive and degrading at all
right ? no, it's an extraordinary piece of cinematography... right.Finally, I don't get all these complaints that it's abusive, it
promotes anti-feminism, sexual molestation and rape... how can you
people come up with such ideas ? Both partners in the movie agreed and
wanted it, how does that make it rape ? If Anastasia is down with it
and doesn't see it as rape, who are you to tell her she's wrong to
think that ? And why all the complaints about this not being BDSM ? who
said it should be ? it's not a documentary, it's about the sexual
desire of a young man who was abused as a child, it might be twisted in
your eyes, but as long as his partner is OK with it, then it's none of
your business. How exactly is it abuse and rape if Anastasia wanted it
and asked for it specifically ? And you're seriously calling this a
porn movie ? I have seen comedy movies with famous actors being
involved in more pornographic scenes, but somehow, we think nothing
wrong of those movies. By the way, have any of you ever seen a "true"
BDSM movie ? now THAT'S abuse and twisted! This movie is like a kiss in
the park compared to some of the BDSM movies out there.
