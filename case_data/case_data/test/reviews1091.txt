Tannin Poisoning

... from all the tea breaks I had to take. This movie failed to hold my
attention at all. OK, maybe for a few 30 second intervals. Yes, the CGI
is good, but so are a lot of other movies. The sound is good, but so
are a lot of other movies. None of the actors seemed to have to make
much effort, probably because the script and plot were pretty much
irrelevant.
