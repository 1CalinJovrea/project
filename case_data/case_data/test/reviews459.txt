It falls really short

I had great hopes for this film, I liked the previous titles of the
director, and mostly, find him imaginative and cheerful. Also, this
film featured a lot of good actors, and even Bill Murray!.But it falls short, it's not really funny. There are a lot of dialogs,
that try to be fast and brilliant, but they get tiring after a while.
There are a bunch of repetitive jokes, that are not funny. I was really
expecting to laugh, and you know that feeling when you are trying to
laugh on a film, but it doesn't deliver. Seems like the visuals, while powerful, were meant to be the main part
of the comedy. But they don't really add a sense of comedy. Not even
the hotel is an important piece of the history. Maybe I was expecting
it to be a comedy, but that was not the intention of the director?And then, the just mere circumstantial appearance of Mr Murray.
