Almost completely humourless.

I'm not going to sugar coat it: this movie stinks. After the
gut-busting hilarity of the 2009 original, this comedy franchise has
been struck down with a severe case of sequel-itis. The carbon-copy
second instalment was stale for the most part yet still managed a
handful of laughs thanks to the general funniness of Zach Galifianakis'
socially demented Alan; this episode however, is almost completely
devoid of humour. The writing has become increasingly reliant on the
natural charisma of the headlining star trio - with the plot here being
laborious and woefully lazy - and the irritating Chow (Ken Jeong), the
weakest link in part one, inexplicably gets even more screen time to
screech and make our eardrums bleed. If it weren't for an amusing set
piece atop Las Vegas' Caesar Palace hotel and a best-for-last gag
during the end credits, I would've given this the one star treatment. I
was desperately hoping this series would regain some form and finish
with a bang, but unfortunately the wolf-pack's last adventure barely
makes a whimper.
