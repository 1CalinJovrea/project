A rather weird approach to friendship? Or friendship was just an excuse?

Seth Rogen is a rather intelligent producer. He and his pals (including
Evan Goldberg, James Franco, Mindy Kaling, Lizzy Caplan, Randall Park
etc.) have created an unusual semi-surreal kind of weird comedies, like
"The interview" and "This is the end".In The Night Before (2015/II) (because there is another (2015/I) movie
with the same name in 2015 starring David Faustino!)...3 friends spend
every Xmas together in search for a great party and having a good time.
The dramatic element here is that one of them lost his parents in a car
accident and the other 2 are trying to be supportive.The problem is that this movie seems like it is designed to provoke,
even shock. Trying to extrude laughter through harsh and dramatic
situations without actually entering the limits of a black comedy.Drugs and "tripping" play a major part in the movie. A tone of
supernatural. And of course sex and relationships and friendships, the
"bro" kind. Yet there are a lot to be desired and a major part of the
film, although uneven, takes the lead and makes lifelong friendship to
seem like it is just an excuse for some crude jokes like blood from a
dripping nose into someone's drink or vomiting into a church during
Xmas mass.Overall: You wont be missing much if you avoid to see this. In the end,
the basic idea of bro-friendship seems like an excuse from some surreal
gags.
