Surprising Film - Not What I Expected

I wasn't thrilled with the movie, but that doesn't mean it was not
good. Actually, I think this film had incredible substance, due
particularly in part to the casting. I would have given it 7 stars, but
the length of the film took it down a notch (they could have knocked
off 14-19 minutes worth of unnecessary, and sometimes boring footage).The film started off with Wahlberg seeming to be just like Wahlberg.
But, long story short, he and the film evolved to a character that fit
him (and vice versa). Based upon the plot, I think it was a good match.Dwayne Johnson is not brand new to drama, but this was a different kind
of role nonetheless. I don't feel he was 100% there, but his likable
character makes you just ignore it. I think with a few more roles like
this, he'll be better.I'm not that familiar with Mackie, but he did a great job in his role.
Apart from Shalhoub, he was probably one of the most believable
characters. He made me think of a subdued and more serious version of
Mike Epps.Shalhoub....well, what can you say about this guy? He was awesome in
Monk, and his style is always great. He is a talented actor and the
casting of him was a solid choice. He has that goof look to him, yet
his face can show some noteworthy seriousness. This was no Giamatti
being cast as a thug...Shalhoub can pull off a "tough guy" pretty well.I've always been fond of Ed Harris, but his role was insignificant.
Same for Corddry.All in all, this was a well-made film deserving to be watched. I doubt
I would ever watch it again due to it's slow development at times, but
I'm glad I did see it. The casting was unexpected and unique.
