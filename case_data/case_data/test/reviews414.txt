"Warm bodies" embodies so many parodies

I went to see "Warm Bodies" on opening night, something I rarely do. I
have to say, I wasn't disappointed in this strangely romantic comedy.
Don't be turned off by the premise of a zombie romantic comedy - it
manages to parody human relationships on many levels the way "Shaun of
the Dead" parodied zombie movies. Nicholas Holt does a wonderful job
parodying the awkward teenager filled with angst and a longing to
connect, yet his inner dialog makes for much of the movie's comedy. He
manages to have a bromance and a romance and make you laugh at the same
time. Rob Corddry does a wonderful job holding up his end of the
bromance if you will, and I didn't even catch his part in aiding the
Shakespearian nod. Yes, this movie manages to pull a pun on Shakespeare
while also light-heartedly setting out themes for what defines a person
as human. Teresa Palmer does a wonderful job rounding out the chick
flick humor with Analeigh Tipton. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and
will be going to see it again. I was too busy laughing to see the plot
holes.I also have purposefully avoided reading the book, so I wouldn't have
any preconceived notions of the movie. I get that the book was much
darker than the film, which would set a viewer up for disappointment in
a romantic comedy.
