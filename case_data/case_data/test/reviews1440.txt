Another two hours of a dead horse being flogged sold to the public by Hollywood.

The story ended with T2, Cameron told all the story needed and moved on
unlike fans of this sorry forced franchise and the three studios that
each picked up the rights and made one contrived cash-grab after the
next before passing it on one after the other like a dirty whore. This is the worst rehash of old ideas ever resold to a desperate
fanbase. A baby-faced Sarah Connor who looks like she should be getting
ready for a prom date unlike the hardened paramilitary character that
Lind Hamilton trained like a madwoman to deliver in looks and
performance. Some 8-ball headed actor trying to pass of John Connor, an
Asian Robert Patrick doing all the same stuff we saw 20 years ago and
an old age pensioner Arnorld Schwarzenegger being made to do everything
in CGI his awful frame lost the ability to do decades ago. Only Hollywood would flog a dead horse so continuously and still find
an audience however small and desperate, to watch and cheer every
single swing of the lash.
