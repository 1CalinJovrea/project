Entertaining and Mature Action

Dredd is one of the more brutal and violent action movies that I have
seen in a while. Most of it takes place in a single tower-block, which
is a futuristic skyscraper that houses tens of thousands of people.
Judge Dredd is locked in and has to fight his way to the top. It sounds
dull, but the scenes are well done and the movie flows nicely.Judge Dredd's character was modeled after Dirty Harry and it shows with
his raspy voice, dislike of most individuals, and general unhappiness.
He is even partnered with a rookie who may or may not make it through
the day. But unlike Dirty Harry, it's perfectly legal when Judge Dredd
effectuates summary justice. And yes, there are some cold-blooded
executions. Speaking of killing, there is a whole lot it. And for a
movie that is subtly cartoonish, the action has a sober tone that I
didn't expect. It's a welcome change from the typical action movie and
I loved it.
