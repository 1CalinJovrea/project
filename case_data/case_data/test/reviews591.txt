Watch Psychopath and Plain Jane Date the movie

If you are a basic looking chick looking a movie about a rich, hot dude
dating a plain chick, then this the movie for you.It doesn't matter
whether he is a psychopath, controlling, possessive, dating you because
you remind him of his dead mother, and gets off on abusing you. As long
as he is rich and good looking, then it's worth it to you and you will
enjoy this movie. This movie is designed for you. There is nothing
special or interesting about these characters or the one dimensional
background cast. You're watching them date for an hour and a half with
an vanilla sex scene for every ten to fifteen minutes of talking. There
is no conflict or problems in this movie. All the scenes of potential
conflicts of the trailer are resolved within minutes after they happen.
Anastasia has no backbone in this movie. She gripes and complains about
not doing what he wants, then go ahead and do whatever he wants
anyway.So if you want to see a movie about Anastasia and Christian date
for two hours and have sex, then this is the movie for you.Pros: I
liked the first movie because it was so bad it was funny and the
soundtrack was good. This movie is literally the two of them getting
back together and dating and the soundtrack was okay.
