Ba Ba-Ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

The Babadook is written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It stars Essie
Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall and Hayley McElhinney. Music is by
Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Radek Ladczuk. Amelia is a single mother still haunted by the violent death of her
husband, she is trying to deal with her young son Samuel's fear of a
monster in the house. Initially tolerating it as a flight of fancy, the
arrival of a book in the youngster's bedroom called Mr. Babadook,
signals the start of a sinister presence that she herself can begin to
fear as well. Australia has been producing some great horror films in the last couple
of decades, The Babadook is one of the best of the bunch. Jennifer Kent
made it as a 10 minute short back in 2005 called Monster, itself a
super piece of horror film making, now in full feature length form
(Kent's first), the vision and intelligence explodes off the screen in
every frame. The premise at the core is not exactly fresh, but Kent manages to make
The Babadook its own entity, skilfully steering away from formula jolts
and terrors. Which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel
frenzies and blood for blood's sake, is most refreshing. This is a big
character piece, a two hander of incredible emotional power, a mother
and son dealing with their own demons before the eponymous Mr. Babadook
enters the fray. We care about this pair of troubled souls, so much so
that as we start to feel the dread, get the tingles down the spine, our
hearts are also aching for them. The two performances of the actors
quite simply magnificent. Mr. Babadook is a pop-up picture book that suddenly arrives into their
lives. The creature is a sort of cross between a German expressionistic
nightmare and Jack the Ripper. The book itself is creepy enough in its
own right, more so as it starts to take on a more terrifying tone  and
Amelia proves unsuccessful at getting rid of the thing  the picture
starts playing its ace psychological cards. The monster is kept mostly
to the edges of the frames, or just popping up for a quick glance in
unexpected places, this is a great move and suits the narrative
perfectly. The tech credits are top notch. A key aspect to getting the most out of
The Babadook is to make sure the sound is loud, for the sound mix is
tremendous and can bring pounds of goose-flesh rising up on your arms.
Ladczuk's photography is at one with the themes pulsing away in the
story, the colours paled and cheerless, enhancing the fractured psyches
of mother and son, but Mr. Babadook is a jet black presence in this
landscape. All told the art design from the book to the house and the
creature is excellent. Umbrella's Australian All Region Blu-ray Release has a super transfer
and does justice to the sound mix. There's over an hour of interviews,
which are a mixed bag of informative chat and back slapping, a 12
minute behind the scenes making of and some trailers. The bonus is the
10 minute short, Monster, The Babadook in its infancy but no less scary
for it. The Babadook is a superlative horror film for adults, like when
Polanski met Kubrick and they decided to pay homage to Fritz Lang and
George Melies. Yes it's that good. 10/10
