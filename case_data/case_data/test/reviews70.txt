The best kids movie this side of the summer

If you are looking for a movie full of dramatic moments; slow pace and
sadness; that basically bore your kids but make the critics praise as a
masterpiece; stop reading and go to see some PIXAR / Disney movie (like
Dory or Zootopia) and watch your kids get impatient to get out of the
cinema. If on the other hand; you want your kids to laugh non-stop for about 90
minutes and you enjoy with them; then do not loose one minute, get
tickets for the Secret Life of Pet and start laughing on the first
minute with the Minions short and keep doing it short until the very
end of titles. There is some moral message about friendship, trust and
love; but it will be guilty pleasure laugh and a few suspenseful
moments.***SPOILER AHEAD**** Word of advice and possible spoiler; Snowball (the
rabbit) is the most twisted character seen lately in movies; it can
easily be part of an horror movie; but as played by Kevin Hart; it is
historically funny whenever on screen. The same can be said for Gidget
(played by Jenny Slate); her transition from a white sweet puppy to a
dangerous and terrifying fighter is another of the top moments of the
movie. ****END OF SPOILER****In brief; it will not win any Oscars; but is still the funniest movie
of the summer.
