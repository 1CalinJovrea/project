Complete disappointment

This is my first ever IMDb review, but I felt compelled to write it.
I'm usually pretty partial to Wahlberg's movies, but this thing is just
awful. I get what the movie is about, the self loathing and self
destruction. The acting in this is just so flat, and boring and poorly
directed. The script is ridiculously bad. Wahlberg seems to think blurting out his poorly written dialog as fast
and as unintelligibly as possible equates to a convincing portrait of
an academic. It doesn't. He seems to think that acting bored equates to
the portrait of a deeply troubled self destructive man. It doesn't. Perhaps it improved dramatically after the hour mark, but I wouldn't
know. For the first time in what must be 2 years, I gave up on a film.
It was so terrible, not only did I fail to engage with any one of the
characters or any aspect of the story at all, I was actively hating it!
I could feel the movie literally vacuously and worthlessly sucking away
my time like the most boring vampire that ever existed. Bad script, woeful acting, weak direction, poor cinematography, weak
soundtrack. So yeah...um...I didn't like it much.
