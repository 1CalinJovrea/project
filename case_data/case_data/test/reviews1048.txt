Such a clich√© film, I'm so disappointed!

This is the second time in my life that I have walked out of a film.
The first time was an art-house movie where a lady was writhing around
on a floor of broken mirrors reciting Japanese haikus whilst crying for
40 minutes. I'm not sure which of the two was worse.Let me preface this - I am a working mother around the same age as some
of the characters in this film. None of this rings true to me, mostly
because of the way the script was written (by a couple of men who have
clearly no idea what being a working mum is). The cast is great, the
idea is great. It should have almost been the Clueless of the next
generation on (humour wise). The women end up looking humiliated for
being meek or embarrassingly gross. We have no idea where their children are when they decide to go AWOL.
'Hey - want to go to the movies?' 'Sure! I'll just dump these 4 under
5s somewhere and we'll go to a bar'. Hmmm.My two friends and I lasted 20 minutes. There was a big crowd of
younger girls, possibly not yet having had kids, that were laughing
their heads off. So I think there is a market for this. But I think you
will either love or hate it. They could have done so much better.
