Excellent

Watch it. Feels better on second viewing and gets better there after.My money on it to watch again and again to spend a very relaxing 2
hours when want to get away from everything. Acting is bang on by both
of them. Alice Eve is superb. Seeing Evans in a very different role.
Movie setting was perfect, showing NY without the hassle of crowd and
people.Direction is quite good. I hope Mr. Evans goes a long way with
direction. My kind of a movie.This is going definitely in my movie collection.
