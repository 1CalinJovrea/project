This year's FANT4STIC

This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film
feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant
appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either
Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't
get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Bryan Singer is in love wit Stryker of course we get to see the
Weapon X program (again!) and of course, Wolverine because why not.As for the characters: Magneto barely does anything in the whole movie,
Apocalypse is a one note villain, Xavier phoned it in and Jennifer
Lawrence was NOT Mystique at all, as expected she played Raven
Everdeen.Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is
being destroyed and the governments sit quiet. SPOILER ALERT! And the way they defeat Apocalypse is by combining all their powers,
just like in FANTASTIC FOUR (2005) or even FANT4STIC (2015).This movie has NO SOUL whatsoever, boring, badly acted, awful written,
the worst movie of the year so far.
