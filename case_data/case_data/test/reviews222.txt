A must watch for crime/prison movie lovers..

I normally don't have time to review or even let alone use IMDb, but
this is definitely one of my favorite movies out for 2017 and I HAD TO
REVIEW THIS hoping more movies like this comes along. I haven't had any
films which kept me interested throughout the entire movie like this in
a long time. If you are into movies which brings the feelings of how it
would feel like to be in prison and to be in dept of "prison politics",
this movie is a must watch. The main character "Jacob" played his role
very well, from a business man to a full blown convict. It might looks
crazy, but there are people out there who are really living that
lifestyle. I was surprised there were so many familiar faces in this
movie I'm sure viewers will recognize, they all pretty much fit into
their roles.Over all I would recommend this to everyone looking for that prison
experience film. The details with how prison life is so detailed and
correct. Everything from the dorm rooms to prison gangs and politics.
The only other one like this was a movie called "Felon" back in 2008
(but this movie Shot Caller has more action) I was hoping for another
one just like it, and this one satisfies me until something similar and
better comes along in the near future!
