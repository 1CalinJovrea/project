Solid, Simple and Entertaining Action

This is a simple plot movie that symbolizes everything about Silvestre
and Schwarzenegger glory days. There is no thick plot or real
complexities, it's a simple bad guys Vs good guys action flick.
However, the movie does not disappoint, its very entertaining and full
of action and hard core scenes. The acting is as expected, nothing
Oscar worthy but good enough from action legends like them. The idea is
simple and is easily understood. The one difference in this movie is
that the chemistry between Schwarzenegger and Stallone is excellent and
they deliver some humor also. The only downside that I can think about
is the fact that this movie is really meant for both the stars fans and
not people who are looking for real ideas or excellent cinematography.
Bottom line go enjoy the movie and don't forget your popcorn.
