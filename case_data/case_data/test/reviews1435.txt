A Self-aware, Hilarious Summer Flick

I went to see Hercules with little to no expectations. The main reason
was that I needed some cheesy summer flick to laugh at, and the movie's
trailer did promise this kind of stuff. Well, the movie did not
disappoint - indeed, it was cheesy, but in such a self-aware way, that
it falls out of the "so bad that it's good" category and gets into the
"simply good" one. Irony is dominant through the whole 98 minutes, and
there are plenty of minor and major plot twists, albeit not a single
forced one. And the story is delivered in an entertaining way without
any unnecessary melodrama or heroism - a nice change from most of
Hollywood big-budget action flicks.The movie opens directly with the story of Hercules and the twelve
labours. We see him battle the Lernaean Hydra, slay the Erymanthian
Boar, and kill the Nemean Lion with bare hands - and that's in the
first two minutes. Just when you'd think this flick would be nothing
but Dwayne Johnson, bare-chested and tough, slaughtering stuff, it's
revealed that the narrator is actually the nephew of Hercules,
exaggerating the story of his uncle, trying to convince a bunch of
pirates not to execute him by putting a stake through his bottoms.
There are plenty of similar absurd situations in the movie, and there's
never a pun to fall flat.Character-wise, "Hercules" offers more than a bunch of heroes with big
muscles and tear-jerking back-stories. While Hercules' family being
murdered plays somewhat big part in the movie, the drama never feels
forced (if anything, it actually feels a bit underwhelming). Also, I do
have problems with Atalanta being the typical strong female action
character but this isn't as much of a drawback - just something that
could've been improved. All actors, from the cheesy Johnson and Fiennes
to veteran John Hurt, reprise their roles in a great, fleshed-out way.
The main antagonist of "Hercules" is indeed portrayed a wee bit
over-the-top, but after all this is a comic adaptation and that's the
proper way to portray comic villains.The story doesn't disappoint either, presenting Hercules as a man with
incredible strength who enjoys the rumors of him being the son of Zeus
while being self-aware that he's still a mercenary who is most likely
born to a mortal father. The legend of Hercules itself plays a large
part in the story, and serves for a source of great jokes and puns.
There's a major plot twist that I honestly didn't see coming, and
neither did any of my friends with whom I saw the movie. "Hercules"
receives bonus points for NOT including the obligatory love interest,
and there's actually a reason for the main character to return for the
final act (other than "he's the hero and it's heroes' job to safe the
day").Unlike most fantasy action-adventures, "Hercules" uses special effects
sparsely and mostly for the scenery. Apart from the opening sequence,
Hercules never has to battle absurdly huge foes or mythical creatures.
The only moment he's fighting a CGI enemy did actually leave me a bit
disappointed, but it was still OK. The writers creatively decided to go
against the "overpowered supernatural creatures" cliché and instead
opted for a huge army of ordinary men. It does emphasize Hercules'
superhuman strength a lot more when you see a horse being thrown into
the air, instead of a harpy or the minotaur being slain.All in all, "Hercules" is a great movie to spend ten bucks on this
summer. It doesn't break the boundaries of modern fantasy adventure
flicks, but it does go against a lot of the tropes and clichés. It
delivers an entertaining story while being self-aware of its own
cheesiness. While I'm not familiar with the source material, "Hercules"
does remind a little bit of "Asterix and Obelix" and provides solid 98
minutes of pure Hollywood entertainment, comedy and carnage.8/10
