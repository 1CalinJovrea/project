Very amusing B material

The only thing surprising in The Guest is just how straight forward it
is in its simple plotting. Everything unfolds in predictable fashion,
but this B material is a fantastic showcase of wicked humor and
misanthropic violence. Dan Stevens is in excellent form here, as a
mysterious soldier who shows up unannounced at a family's home of a
fallen soldier he served with. He's all smiles and very polite, but
people with a usually negative connection with this family start
meeting grisly ends. Like in his previous film You're Next, Adam
Wingard approaches plotting you've seen a million times and wittily
turns it on its ear without ever being too self aware. It's a shame
Picturehouse who acquired the US rights dumped the film in a handful of
theaters without trying to capitalize on the strong reviews and never
bothered to expand it theatrically. The Guest is a quick fun time that
knows exactly what it is and delivers without overstaying its welcome.
