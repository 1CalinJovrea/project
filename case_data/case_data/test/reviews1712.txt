Twilight Games

I really don't see how this movie has a good rating to begin with. I
guess the studios are like the capitol in the movie. They probably paid
off the critics. I was lucky enough to wait til it was available to
rent. I really enjoyed the first hunger games because it kind of felt
like the novel 1984. Catching fire switched more to a twilight love
issue between Peeta and Gale. First Katiness wants to run off with
Gale, but he refuses because he wants to join the revolution. Then she
starts falling in love with Peeta during the Games (Woohoo, another
twilight!).Jennifer Lawrence's performance was terrible during the whole movie. It
seems she cannot display the right facial emotion. I was getting
annoyed the entire time she tried to make a sad face. Josh Hutcherson
on the other hand displayed great acting and did pretty good with a
terrible script (this kid has a bright acting career ahead of him after
the Twilight Games). During the games we don't have a chance to have a
connection with the other Tributes at all. I just kept finding myself
thinking "Oh the old lady died" or "Guy 2 just died from arrow shot".At the end Peeta just disappears out of near. We never find out why he
ran away, but that he was caught by the president. Wow, the writers
waste all this movie time with worthless scenes, but they can't add
this in? If you're looking for a Hunger games like the first one. Then
you're going to be disappointed. If you're a twelve year old girl who
enjoys wanting to know if Katiness is going to be with Peeta or Gale.
Then this movie is for you, but you'll have to wait for the third one
to find out.Twilight Games makes for a great movie to make you fall asleep though.
