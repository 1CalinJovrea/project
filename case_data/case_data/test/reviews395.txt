*** Spoiler *** Give it a miss!

Right from the moment I saw the first poster, I was keen and excited
and was eagerly looking forward to watching this movie. I am a big fan
of adventure movies. Well, to cut the story short, if you are the
person who likes Bear Grylls jungle-survival documentaries or if you
have loved The Edge or The Rainman or even Alive (movie about some
sports team lost in snow-fields when their plane crashes), then THIS
MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU. GIVE IT A MISS. It's extremely boring with
minute-after-minute flashbacks and at the climax scene, I don't know
what she really achieved. I was just waiting for her to finish her walk
within 20mins. into the movie, such meaningless it is.
