A Gripping but Flawed X-Men Movie

X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place 

about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start 

to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of 

things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the 

good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these 

movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really 

emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the 

film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside 

Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger 

X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver 

has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is 

handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is 

terrific, but the second half brings it down.



Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and 

others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and 

I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse 

Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant 

compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain 

who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are 

thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems 

uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses 

the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants 

were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire 

sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the 

cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do 

much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could 

have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final 

battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem 

is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming 

apart, making it hard to care about the situation. 



Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and 

Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and 

Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing 

for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just 

brings the film down from the really good first half.



X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.
