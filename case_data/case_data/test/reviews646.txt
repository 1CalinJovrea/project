So dumb! Did we not watch the same movie??

It's by far the dumbest, most preposterous movie I've seen in years,
and I've seen some really dumb movies. I chose it because of the high
score it got from IMDb... and got a movie that's so idiotic that I had
to review it. I do respect everyone's right to watch a shallow action
movie from time to time. I do it myself. But this is a real insult.
