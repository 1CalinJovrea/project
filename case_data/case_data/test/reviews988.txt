Pathetic, Predictable and Pretentious

There are some very poor films being made nowadays that resort to silly
or gratuitous violence (if there is such a thing) with stories that are
pure fancy and do not reflect the times or anything close to it.
Overlay that with patently fake explosions and special effects that
just cheapen the film and you are left with something that it is easy
to walk out of at half time. I had just had enough of the rattling
machine guns and stupid macho posturing.It becomes very annoying when you see how much money is spend on this
tripe when they could make more films like Robert Redford's "The
Company you Keep", for example that has no special effects just clever
and thought provoking dialogue.
