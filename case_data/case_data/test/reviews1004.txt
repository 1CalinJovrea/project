Stomps the others out of the Park

This movie is so harshly critiqued by many for all the wrong reasons,
this movie delivers in brilliant story, subtle yet well executed
character development,superb special effects that I cannot fault and
the acting in this movie is brought together perfectly with some big
cinema names. I absolutely love this movie as it keeps the
entertainment flowing and delivers a sense of engaging and exciting
realism due to the well thought out storyline. And when people say it
is predictable, it is because the read description. People need to wake
up and realise that this movie is making millions because it is a
masterpiece, I have already seen it a few times. I give it a rare 10/10
