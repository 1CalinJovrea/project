a big let down

i watched the first movie a lot of times, i must admit it was by
accident cause there wasn't anything good on TV, but i loved it, the
villain, the minions and the plot, so i expected way more from this
movie. In the first one the minions were used as sidekicks they had
their funny moments but weren't like really part of the plot, which was
okay cause they were the ingredient for the comedy and were used very
well.. in the second one they are way way overused.. they put minions
every five minutes and the jokes and even their language aren't as
funny as the first.. it feels like "they tried too hard".. the villain
was the stupid "i wanna rule the world" overused motive.. vector was
100 times better... i'm not saying was bad but was just a movie i
wouldn't watch again... the first one i could watch over and over.. Btw
i'm sorry if i don't make much sense.. my English is very limited
