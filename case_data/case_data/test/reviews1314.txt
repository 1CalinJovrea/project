An entertaining take on an unbelievable true story

If American Made proves one thing it's that truth is stranger than
fiction. The story of American aircraft pilot Barry Seal who became a
drug smuggler working for the Medellin cartel, casually rubbed
shoulders with Pablo Escobar and ran a massive money laundering
operation all while being employed by the CIA, would seem a stretch
even by Hollywood's standards. Yet it's precisely the "based on true
events" part of Seal's story that makes American Made such a
fascinating film to watch.We are first introduced to Seal as a disillusioned TWA pilot looking
for something to put the thrill back in his life. When approached by
the CIA to fly reconnaissance of communist factions in South America,
he immediately jumps at the opportunity. Flying solo from the US on his
own private two- engine plane, it's not long before Seal is intercepted
by the Medellin cartel and offered large amounts of cash to smuggle
drugs into the US. Ever the opportunist, Seal agrees and soon finds
himself playing on both sides of the law and making more money than he
knows what to do with. But as the demands from both sides grow
increasingly untenable, Seal finds himself stuck between a rock and a
hard place, with his luck quickly drying up.Tom Cruise brings his manic charisma to the role of Seal, and he's a
good fit for the highflying, larger than life character. It's hard not
to look with contempt at a man who transported illegal narcotics into
the US en masse, but Cruise does a good job in humanising Seal and
portraying him as more than just a criminal. At heart, Seal is a family
man looking to provide for his wife and daughter but whose unrelenting
pursuit of the American dream finds him working on both sides of the
law. The charisma Cruise brings to the role goes a long way in making Seal
an endearing protagonist, and he seems to have fun in the role.
Following the underwhelming performance of The Mummy earlier this year,
American Made represents a return to form for him and a welcome return
to the more grounded narratives in which he fares far better with. Director Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow, Fair Game) complements Cruise's
commanding performance with his highly energised filming style. The
camera is rarely steady for more than a beat and its constant zooming,
shaking and moving around lends the film an effective faux doco feel.
On the flipside, however, the incessant camera movements are
distracting during some of the quieter moments in the film. In one
simple conversation scene in a diner, near the beginning of the film,
the camera haphazardly changes angles and abruptly zooms in towards the
characters as they speak. It's awkwardly staged and distracts from the
dialogue. Luckily the film moves at such a fast clip that Liman's
hyperactive filming works mostly well but some restraint would have
gone a long way during the smaller scenes.Overall American Made is a fascinating biopic about a larger than life
character. The film benefits greatly from Cruise's committed
performance and Liman's lively direction to provide an entertaining
take on an unbelievable true story.
