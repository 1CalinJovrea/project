Disappointing for a wolverine movie

I can'y start to explain how much disappointed I was after watching
this movie. As many of the x-men fans I too like the Wolverine the
most. Having said that and given how much exciting the trailer looked
for this title, the movie to me was a big let down. Its slow moving,
not as much action packed as I hoped it would be. And plot to me made
no sense. {Spoiler Alert} I don't know if I got it wrong but in the
movie it has been portrayed that removing adamantium from Wolverine's
body deprives him of his healing power. WTF ? More so it has been
depicted to give the grandpa his(wolverine's) healing powers ! utter
bullshit. Wolverine(Logan) was known for his healing power and that was
the reason striker chose him for injecting adamantium. Did i miss
something there ? There wasn't a single scene in the movie that I
wished I could watch again, which is generally not true for a Wolverine
movie. Can't believe how Jackman agreed to do this movie.
