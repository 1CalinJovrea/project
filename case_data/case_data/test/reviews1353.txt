Nicole, what the hell?

I love Nicole. One of the best of her time. She normally chose good
movies to be part of. Not this one, though. Can't understand what made
her accept being part of this...thing. It started out well, but soon
loses pace and logic. I couldn't see it thoroughly. Nothing happens.
Ridiculous scenes...even sex scenes. Strange and ridiculous. The
actors, couldn't deliver cause there's nothing to. A lot of scenes
should be cut off, cause they don't make any sense at all. And the end,
gosh, deplorable. Deplorable ending. I can't understand what's the
point of this movie? For what purpose was it made? And what about the
title? Strangerland?! My God! Awful!This movie could have been good.The
ambiance, the actors...what a waste of talent and of my time!
