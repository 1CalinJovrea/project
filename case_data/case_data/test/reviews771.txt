This is not Resident Evil

This is just some Paul Anderson cash grab, crap fest abomination that
carries Resident Evil title, features some zombies, loud music, gun
shots, explosions and one of the worst directing and editing I've ever
seen. Every scene in this movie, right from the start, is shot with
shaky camera and fast cuts.I don't know who thought that this approach
would make The Final chapter a better movie, because it made it the
worst, and hopefully the last under the supervision of Paul Anderson.
There was only one scene, one moment, where the glory of the real
Resident Evil showed some signs of life, but that scene was butchered
with amazingly awful editing that made my eyes hurt. What the hell
happened to you Paul? It seems the glory of Event Horizon will remain
the peak of his career. Now lets just hope they let Resident Evil rest
for some time before they reboot it with proper people behind the
camera, people who understand what RE is all about.
