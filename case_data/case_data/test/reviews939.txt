A little rough around the edges, but...

I can't hate this film, even if it seems like that's what's going to be
trending. As a Dark Universe movie, it obviously follows the footprints
of the comic book movie universes, while utilizing old Universal/Hammer
horror movie elements.I believe most of the naysayers expected a new horror movie anthology,
one that brings the same fright that the old ones did we used to watch
as kids. Honestly, Universal horror movies can't be that sort of
frightening anymore,since we are not the same people anymore either.
Universal was never about jumpscares or deep psychological horror like
the current trending "horror" themes. It was about slowly creeping fear
caused by fictional monsters.In my opinion, Dark Universe films are and will be meant to be watched
as action films infused with classic horror elements and characters
instead of the other way around. And to me, those few elements did hit
the spot.My favorite bits horror-wise are the mummy herself immediately after
resurrection: that shambling, crawling undead figure with dislocated
joints and broken bones was exactly like something you wouldn't want to
see heading your way in a dark London alley.I also liked Cruise being chased by the undead Crusaders under water.
The relatively slow movement all while being underwater, half-drowning,
really is a nightmarish situation even if it is not meant to make you
jump out of your seat (which I still find to be the cheapest sort of
thrill, therefore a bad idea).The makers deciding not to use CGI in an exhibitionist way was another
one of these good bits: in many scenes, the overall darkness leaves
just enough for our imagination to fill in with scary ideas instead of
showing off so much, we start noticing how sterile and unfrightening
CGI looks in general (I'm looking at you, Alien: Covenant).As for being an action flick, yes, it definitely wasn't a John Wick or
a Rogue One. Not terrible, not great either, and had a little problem
with unnecessary action sequences. The fight between the characters of
Cruise and Crowe was lacking any motivation other than showing off.
Improve it in the following movies, please (which I do hope to come).How could it be better? More detailed characters: okay, we know, the
girl is cute, Tom Cruise is bringing the Tom Cruise we know from most
of his movies since the 80s and Crowe is Jekyll/Hyde, but who are they
as characters in this very universe? If you're building a universe, you
need strong, memorable characters to build it upon, glory of the past
and eye candy is simply not enough.More inventive action scenes. Watching Dracula and the Ottoman army
duke it out from the reflection of a wobbling sword in Dracula Untold
was a good one. More like that, less "Tom Cruise gets the umpteenth
pimp smack the very same way from an obviously stronger enemy".Giving some power to the Good, if Evil has so much would spice things
up. Jekyll's self-sustained evil is nice, but why stop there? Let's
make it really interesting. What if the reanimation of the dead
Crusaders backfired and they tried to fight Ahmanet due to their once
holy life? They were trying to guard that gem after all, keeping their
oath in their death would have been a nice addition. I understand that
the franchise is more about monsters than heroes, but reducing the
possibilities of what *could* happen in a still forming universe is
unnecessary and even harmful.These three points are the three missing stars from my rating (based on
the axiom of this movie is meant to be an action movie). The Mummy is
by no means a bad film, but whatever you may expect it to be, you will
find it at least a little disappointing for one reason or the other.
