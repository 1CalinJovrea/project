Don't get the negative reviews

Sin City: A dame to kill forThis 'review' will be a simple opinion, and will not contain any
spoilers. ...I saw this movie yesterday, and I was a little skeptical because of all
the negative reviews on the IMDb.But now I watched this movie, I can truly say I enjoyed this movie.Like I said in my summary, I don't really get all the hate this movie
gets...Personally, I like this one even better than the first one.8,5 out of 10
