Lame movie

I didn't laugh once during the entire movie. The writing was lame and
the acting was horrible. The movie was probably geared to 16 year old
boys. The cash I spent to watch this piece of crap would have been
better used to wipe my rear. Conversations between the husband and wife
went like this; we're gonna do it ! Yes, let's do it ! Are you sure you
want to do it? Yes let's do it. OK I will do it to them. You go baby
and do it to them. OK, here I go. I wanted to puke the writing was so
bad. Seth should get some advice from a new agent because of the crap
projects he has been in lately. I can't think of a single redeeming
character or line during the entire movie.
