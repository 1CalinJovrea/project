I've never really been quiet when it comes to the lack of live-action
family films these days. Growing up in the '90s there were a plethora
of them. Over the past decade or so there has been a steep decline in
this sub genre with studios opting to make animated films instead. It's
somewhat understandable since they're more reliable when it comes to
making a profit, as seen by the success that Pixar and Dreamworks have
had. But there's just something to be said about watching actual people
on screen deal with their problems. Especially as children, it kindles
our imaginations because if we see it happening to them, it could
happen to us too, right? And when done correctly they can really be
memorable.While this film is only partially animated, it takes place in the real
world with live-action humans. In Goosebumps, the motion picture based
on R.L. Stine's enormously successful children's book series of the
same name, Zach (Dylan Minnette) and his mother move to the suburban
town of Madison, Delaware. Zach gripes a lot about there being nothing
to do in his new city until the mysterious homeschooled neighbor girl
(Odeya Rush) befriends him and he develops an interest in her. One
night he's led to believe that she may be imprisoned by her own father,
a fictionalized version of R.L. Stine himself (Jack Black), and sneaks
into her house. He discovers a bookshelf full of Goosebumps manuscripts
which he decides to explore. Opening the first story releases a 10-foot
tall abominable snowman who starts wreaking havoc throughout the town.
Eventually, one by one, each story gets opened up with the books'
respective monsters coming to life trying to kill their creator, Stine.Some may consider it a bad thing, but this movie does a great job of
not holding back any scares. Adults shouldn't have too hard of a
time--although certain monsters may tap into your own personal
phobias--but it will definitely haunt many children. But that's what
makes Goosebumps so appealing. It keeps the visuals acceptable, but
never tones itself down. When I was little we had the anthology
television show Are You Afraid of the Dark? which still creeps me out
as an adult. Goosebumps is frightening, but it's a harmless scare. It
provides us with the same macabre tone of the novels--probably much to
the dismay of some of the parents.It gets most of the character background out of the way early on in the
first third of the film, which gives itself room to run free for the
last hour or so. However, it lets most of that information sit idle for
the rest of the film--some of which never really gets revisited.The movie hits its stride about 20 minutes in when we start witnessing
Stine's creepiness first hand and the books start coming to life. We
are dying to know why it's happening and how to stop it, and that
information may be given away a bit too easily. But not to worry
because, in true R.L. Stine fashion, we still get our fill of twists
throughout.What this film does really well, albeit stylistically inconsistent at
times, is make us laugh. The humor works well on both adult and kid
levels. It's really a funny movie and it does so without becoming too
irreverent. We still feel like something's at stake, but the jokes help
to lighten to the tone on the scarier elements of the film. I think one
reason why live-action family films have failed in recent years is
because filmmakers have lost touch with what makes kids laugh. They
know kids want to see something really outrageous that they would only
be able to see in animation, but I think this film may be on to
something by aiming the jokes back up to the grownups and not dumbing
them down. It doesn't fall back on cheap slapstick or fart jokes to get
laughs--it's gets them with some pretty solid comedic timing and by
finding cleaner versions of the humor that's popular in recent R-rated
comedies.Goosebumps may not be a Best Picture nominee, but it's extremely
enjoyable and acts as a great tribute to R.L. Stine's famed franchise.
It elicits our imagination and does so through the medium of
literature. And there is also a nod to Steve McQueen's The Blob, which
is one of my favorites.Although I would have liked to have seen just a handful of stories
explored in depth rather than all the stories being briefly touched
upon with highlights on maybe 3 or 4, I'm sure the future sequels will
do a better job focusing in on one or two stories. Despite the slightly
rocky pacing and the minor, yet sloppy, plot holes, Goosebumps will
please fans of the book series and will bring adults back to the days
when their imaginations weren't so jaded. Hopefully the success of this
film will help set the trend for a return of live-action family films.Twizard Rating: 87 **Review can also be found at TheTwizard.com**
