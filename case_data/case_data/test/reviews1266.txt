An insult to intelligence

I came into the theatre expecting a coherent ("It's based on a novel so
there has to be some consistency" I thought, stupidly) story set in a
post-apocalyptic world (it's a zombie movie, after all) with some dark
humour thrown into the mix for good measure. What I discovered was an
inconsistent, bland, badly acted attempted romance-movie with
ridiculous (not in the good way) dialogues.In short: We meet a zombie (R) who has incredibly coherent thought
processes for a zombie, yet chooses to eat brains for sustenance. If
this garish action is really necessary we never truly find out, after
all he doesn't eat for a week after meeting Julie (the bland, berating
love interest badly played by Teresa Palmer), but the movie dismisses
this rather vital part of information with the following mind-blowing
dialogue.Julie: Do you have to eat brains? R: YesSeriously. The movie then goes on about how R is changing, yet the characters seem
to ignore this fact - no one seems taken aback in the least that
zombies suddenly can talk, even though it's been established that such
a thing is impossible. Hell, the fact that they run seems very
implausible to me seeing as how the entire intro sequence is dedicated
to R telling us how he shuffles around all day and when he goes out to
feed he literally says: "this is going to take a while", but I digress.This is figuratively literally the tip of the iceberg, and just to
illustrate this point, this is the way the movie handles the love
interest losing her initial boyfriend (whom the movie then tries to
turn into a douche bag by making him act like one in a dream sequence
so we wouldn't be so creeped out when she makes out with the zombie who
ate his brains).R eats boyfriend's brain. R rescues Julie (by smearing what appears to
be poop on her - I guess it was supposed to be blood) through some
unexplained process several times. Julie NEVER mentions her
ex-boyfriend. Suddenly, in a throw-away line, she explains that it's
not that she's not sad - it's just that she prepared for this. Yeah,
that's how emotions work.There are still loads of things to point out (for instance how rotting
zombies become super-human monsters once they totally flip out and
become 'skellies'), but I hope my point has gotten across. The only
reason I give this movie more than 1/10 is the way Analeigh Tipton says
'Sup?' to the zombie R when he (successfully) wins Julie back after
having explained to her that he ate her boyfriend's brain, but has now
walked a couple of miles so it should be okay.
