Whatever happened to Tim Burton?!

Tim Burton strikes me as a pretty peculiar man so he was the right fit
for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, a film based on the
novel of the same name by Ransom Riggs. Burton has disappointed me
recently and I haven't really enjoyed one of his films since Sleepy
Hollow back in 1999.Jake Portman (Asa Butterfield) is a boy who doesn't really have anyone
close to him, except for his grandfather. When tragedy strikes at home
and Jake is left feeling more alone than ever, he goes on a journey to
Wales to find out if there was any truth to the fairy tales he was told
by his grandfather as a child.Stumbling across Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, that his
grandfather visited regularly when fighting in the war, Jake soon meets
its inhabitants and Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) herself. Hearing her
speak of the danger the the children could be in, Jake makes a
connection between that danger and the cause of the tragedy at home.This is very much a family film however, where I think it will lose
both adult and child audience members is the fact that it really is
quite a boring story told in such a dull way. Tim Burton has made
fantasy films before but there is no sense of awe or wonder as there
was in something like Edward Scissorhands. The screenplay from Jane Goldman is massively disappointing considering
the work she's done on the likes of Kick-Ass and Kingsman in recent
years. I enjoyed some of the film but for large parts I was bored
thanks to some incredibly drab characters.The film certainly has a visual appeal but even that was ruined by a
final act that descended into utter stupidity. Up until then, I thought
the effects were really quite good. Then came the moment a crew of
skeletons fend off the enemy creatures from the children. All I will
say is that the skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts looked better.Coming to the performances, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
makes a massive error in having Asa Butterfield in the lead role. He
hasn't done much of note in his career so far and I just found him so
bland in this film. Samuel L. Jackson's villainous turn is just
laughable but the film's biggest crime was not having enough Eva Green,
an actress who would have done the film a massive favour.The use of time travel is something that hindered the film for me as
well. Events towards the end don't get explained very well at all,
leading to utter confusion as the film drew to a close. I'm sure I
won't be the only one who thought so. Overall, this is just a totally
forgettable film from Tim Burton.
