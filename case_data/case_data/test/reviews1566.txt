Just Enjoy This Emotional Tapestry As It Is Woven

This movie touched me personally at a number of levels, because I lived
in San Francisco, "the one that got away" looked a lot like B.L. and my
(very happy) marriage is like the one H.F. portrays. I found B.L.
hauntingly beautiful, and this story a tapestry of feelings unfolding;
especially her surrender versus flight. Her encounter with H.F. from
out of her past is powerful for both characters. And I thought the
resolution of her immortality was quite a pleasant surprise that made
me smile after being teary-eyed most of the movie. The last few minutes
of the movie are especially beautiful if you are a romantic like me.
This is a sweet movie that you will really enjoy.
