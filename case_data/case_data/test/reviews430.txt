Probably you could trick people to see DUST BUSTERS, too . . .

. . . even though the term refers to removing bits of grit from movies
so that they won't clutter your picture. Imagine watching a group of
six or eight Homecoming Court types busting dust for 83 minutes as they
deal with the technical aspects of removing this piece of lint or that
hunk of Microjunk from CHRONICLE or the upcoming POLTERGEIST. Maybe
there's two or three flick fan "civilians" in the world who'd actually
shell out $9.75 on purpose to learn the difference between flotsam and
jetsam. Similarly, perhaps there's one or two folks (out of seven
billion) who want to stare at digital breakdowns, download progress
bars, moving cursors, refresh circles, and the other tedious aspects of
Life in the Digital Age. Talentless young "artists" frequently mistake
the dusty by-products of Art for entertainment itself. When one of my
high school classmates founded his own "label," he proudly dubbed it
"Distortion Records." The UNFRIENDED crowd apparently threw out their
baby, and kept the bathwater.
