The Founder is the McDonalds version of There Will Be Blood...and I'm lovin it

When somebody like myself can describe their childhood as always
remembering the golden arches from the McDonalds, I don't know whether
to describe this memory as sad, like an imprinted advertisement, or
simply American. Regardless of the opinion of their food, McDonalds is
the standing example of the American dream, both for the consumer and
the businesspeople. For a typical family, they have the option of
forgoing the hard work of cooking in favor of having hamburgers in a
short time (I never said it's a good thing, just an option). For the
entrepreneur, McDonalds is more then just a restaurant; it's a success
story of an American company that has gone global. McDonalds today represents American capitalism; always expanding,
always trying to please the customer, and always ruthless. For a
company that has prided itself off of its food, they've been criticized
for the health factor and their aggressive marketing tactics. A lot of
a companies behavior goes back to the ones the started it. It may be
the case for a lot of companies like Apple, Starbucks, Wal Mart, and
Playboy, but McDonalds actually had two beginnings. Their stories are
shown in The Founder. Milkshake maker salesman Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) seems to
be doing well at his job, but is striving for something bigger. His
usual sales to restaurants and drive-ins give him a glimpse at the
flaws of these places including wrong food orders, long waits, and loud
atmosphere full of teens. When an order for eight mixers is placed by a
restaurant in San Bernardino, Kroc drives out there to see this
"McDonalds". What he encounters is a revolutionary speed system that
allows food to ready fast along with disposable paper and a family
friendly environment. Kroc meets the McDonalds brothers, Dick (played
by Nick Offerman) and Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch) who convinces
them to let him help franchise the restaurant. Kroc at first has a hard time convincing investors to join in on this
new restaurant idea, and the few wealthy ones that do try to do things
their own way (including fried chicken on the menu!). Once he gets the
idea that middle class investors are more likely to follow the
McDonalds standards, restaurants start to explode across the Midwest
and the business takes off like crazy. As Kroc gains power, he starts
to become more defiant against the McDonalds brothers, despite being
restricted by their original contract.My original fear was that The Founder was simply going to be a
commercial for McDonalds. What I got instead was a very fascinating
character study into the mind of Ray Kroc. A bad screenplay could have
easily made Ray Kroc a pioneer or a monster, but this somehow balances
out everything in a fair viewpoint. You don't agree with a lot of the
tactics Kroc does to make the burger business boom, but the movie shows
where he's coming from. They also portray him as vulnerable, as they
show later that one of the companies biggest tactics comes from a third
party.Michael Keaton is perfect as Ray Kroc. He balances the scripts tough
job of making him tough and backstabbing, yet likable enough that you
still want to follow him.I have to give a lot of credit to both Nick Offerman and John Carroll
Lynch as the McDonalds brothers who have the caliber to pull off the
perfectionist, yet na√Øve attitude that the original siblings had. The Founder is neither a pro or anti McDonalds movie. This is more like
Patton or Nightcrawler; it's a study on a person in which your supposed
to make your own judgment on. I'll give this nine McDonalds logos out of ten. Had I seen this last
year, it probably would've ended up on the best of 2016. The good news
is that even without the accolades it missed out on, The Founder is
still a good movie from start to finish. Check it out and see if your
lovin it like I am.
