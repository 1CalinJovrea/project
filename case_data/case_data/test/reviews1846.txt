Do not waste your time and money on this!

I will be short and clear.This film sucked. It just did. The acting is horrible, the dialog is
horrible, the story is horrible. I actually like Vin Diesel in most of
his stuff like Fast and Furious and Riddick, but this is just sub par.
I thought it would be like Fast and Furious and be stupid but fun. It
isn't. Its stupid and boring and the dialog and story are downright
offensive towards the audience.DO NOT WATCH.If you do, be prepared to be disappointed. I warned you.
