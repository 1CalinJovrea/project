Hugh Jackman's finest role?

Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family
is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to
date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for
blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel
his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation.
The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film
emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary
setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative.
This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see
for most viewers.
