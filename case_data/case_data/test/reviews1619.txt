Not worth a gamble (sorry)

(11%) A limp waste of both man's and the world's resources who's
cinematic release came and quickly vanished away before the glue that
stuck the lame and cheap looking advertising posters had even properly
dried. This is one of those films that starts OK with hope of things
yet to come, but any hope here is badly misplaced. Rebecca Hall plays a
ditzy, quite annoying stripper who becomes a Las Vegas high rolling pro
gambler within the blink of an eye utilising her Rain man style
abilities that are mentioned once and never spoken of ever again. It
really is amazing how easy it is to get a well paying job in this
movie, so much so that in this universe there's no such thing as
poverty and everyone retires at 22. Bruce Willis plays the boss of a
group of gambling speculators, and even he managers to annoy with his
character who doesn't seem to accept that betting on anything is
massively risky and requires nothing more than blind luck to succeed.
While Catherine Zeta-Jones and Joshua Jackson are hardly featured and
play mostly pointless roles anyway. Overall this managers to be both
mundane, dry, and strait-laced, yet still a bit of a mess.
