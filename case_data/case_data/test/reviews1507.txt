Big Mess

The entire movie was messy and exhausting - scenes that should be 10
seconds long, instead took 10minutes. The movie itself makes no sense-
it's very poorly written. The dialogues was dry and cringy. The magic
tricks felt pointless(unnecessary) and no wow factors.They built up for a plot but it was absolutely terrible...They had many great actors and therefor this movie will probably make
it's money back but the movie itself was horrendously bad (I don't
understand how it can have score of 7 so far)Lizzy Caplan acting was horrible or they just wanted her role to look
like trash...1/10.
