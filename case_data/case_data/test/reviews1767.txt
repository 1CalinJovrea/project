With so many of my favorite celebrities in one movie, this one is a miss...

I can only say, "ouch." The first few jokes got me laughing out loud
and I became super excited only to be disappointed with the movie going
nowhere fast. With such a star studded collection in this sequel, in my
opinion the only way this movie will turn a profit is because there are
so many fans of the cast. I'll watch any film with Jason Bateman,
Jennifer Aniston or Jason Sudeikis with great enthusiasm, but this
movie is tough to watch for even the simplest minded viewer. Repeated
attempts at the same jokes and too much focus on idiotic arguing and/or
antics; here is another example on how/why it's risky business making a
sequel after a successful movie... (especially successful comedies)
