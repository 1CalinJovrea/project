Don't Leavey Your Tissues Behind! Solid Portrayal of Military Bonding

This weekend is certainly a mixed bag of movies from adventure/fantasy
to horror/mystery. So why not throw in a military/biographical/drama
into the fray as well, this time portraying a different, and more
realistic, female super hero. If you are reading past my confusing
opening, (and the title of this review), you know I'm talking about
Megan Leavey. With leash, and gun, in hand, this movie is the chronicle
of her walk into the life of a hero and the struggles she had to climb
over to succeed. What's the verdict? You'll have to read on to find
out!LIKES:Acting: Kate Mara was a fantastic pick for the lead of this movie.
Based on Leavey's history (from the little research I've done), Mara
was able to play the emotional rainbow required of this complicated
role. The angst of a rebellious young adult is perfectly portrayed,
with enough saucy edge to keep things spicy, while only going over the
line occasionally. Yet, the real portrayal of her talents is her acting
of honor, valor, and trauma that comes with being a real-life hero.
You'll feel all the emotional turmoil, or in some cases lack of
emotional turmoil, associated with marine life and the sense of duty
before self. Many audience members became entangled in all the feelings
of the movie, captivating them in the story. Good Pace: We know that many military dramas are a little long winded,
whether in build up or the tail end of the spectrum. Not the case for
Megan Leavey. This movie keeps things moving quite well, blending
excitement, suspense, and character development in a decently condensed
time. The training portion of the movie is funny and heartwarming as
bond between dog and human is formed, adequately building what will be
the key foundation for the rest of the movie. Once the exciting
deployment begins, the tension only surmounts and keeps one further
fastened into the movie, constantly reeled in with each ticking minute
as they perform their duty. It's engaging! It's exciting! And it is
real!The Dog: Let's face it though, the best part of this movie for most is
going to be getting to see the dog or dogs trained to sniff out bombs.
Megan Leavey may be a tale about a woman transforming into a hero, but
the director also does extraordinary work with the developing the dog's
status as a warrior itself. Watching Rex perform all the duties
required of him is awesome, feeling like a human actor himself rather
than a four-legged accessory. If you think Mara is the emotional lure
in the film, then yes you are correct, but that would make Rex the
lighthouse of emotions drawing you more into the flame of this movie.
Watching Rex with the consistent worry that something will happen is
the true suspense of this movie, I myself silently praying he would
make it home alive. DISLIKES:Movie magic drama: We know that when it comes to describing drama, many
films can exaggerate the truth. While I'm not certain how tough Megan's
life was, this movie had many moments and characters that felt a little
overdramatic to me. I'm not talking about the war aspect, we know
that's hell. No, the real overacted moments come in the form of her
family life, primarily the interaction with her mom. Eye-rolling
moments aside, fans who like these overzealous characters are in for a
treat, but it hit some nerves and took away from the movie. The Final Act: Megan Leavey's film is split into three parts for me and
the first two parts are epically put together to keep the film
exciting. The third part however, is more on the slower side and not
the area I would have spent a great deal of time on. I can't say much
without ruining things, but here it goes. This finale is certainly
emotional, well designed, and a fine example of character development.
However, the pace changes at this part, doesn't focus on the chemistry
I fell in love with. Yes, it's emotional, and the parts are well put
together, I just wanted a little more time with the dog and woman. Theater Worthy?: This is a tough component because there is a lot about
this movie I like. However, I can't say the movie was really something
that needed to be in theaters. With few special effects and stunts, and
a story that, while touching, isn't an epic, adventure/book like drama
that Hollywood theaters have captured. Instead, this movie would have
been solid on the History Channel or a Netflix original movie where you
could enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. So, don't behead me
people, I'm just trying to save you some money to maximize the quality
of the film. The VERDICT:Megan Leavey is one of the better military drams I've seen in a while.
A fantastic chemistry between man and dog uniting to portray the honor
of military service is a leading factor to see this movie. With
emotional sequences captured by beautiful cinematography and epic
acting, you'll find this at the top of a lot of drama loving lists.
Yet, it still lacks some finesse in terms of perfect pace and even more
lacks the theater quality effects that make the expensive ticket
worthwhile, unless you get the discount show. Still it is a movie worth
checking out when you can, to pay tribute to an honorable woman, her
dog, and the heroes that are our military. Biography/Drama/War: 8.5 Movie Overall: 6.5
