Very good, especially its intrinsic elements

What got me about this flick, was the whole risk element. When your at
your very lowest, with nothing left to lose, then risking everything,
isn't too difficult. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant as he always is.
The mystery of his ability is different from other actors. He looks,
talks and seems very much the same in all his roles, yet somehow makes
you believe he is that person. Bryce Howard also gives a good
performance. Her physical appearance is trans-formative, and you
clearly would never recognize her. This movie combined the elements of
a treasure hunt, and the allure and adventure of the find, with a
corporate thriller. Realism, however, prevents me from going higher.
I'm already stretching it with rating it an 8. The strange ups and
downs that happened, along with the not so surprise of an ending, is
the stretch that leaves it at the 8 point. Nonetheless, its highly
entertaining, and I recommend it just as highly.
