Wonderful Film

Many films that debuted at this years Tiff were based on unfortunate
periods of history. I hope that some of them can learn from this film.
This has at its heart a love story. It also depicts what a nation is
capable of doing to an ethic group when its leaders (both secular and
spiritual) reduce the value of life of different cultures to nothing if
it is not theirs - Islam. This film is from the same director that brought Hotel Rwanda to the
festival a few years back. That presentation was a wonderfully moving
experience for me as this one was also.This film is not all about murder thankfully. Its about the people who
were once a vibrant part of the former Ottoman empire that find all of
their hopes and dreams for the future suddenly crushed. It has at its
core a wonderful love story and it has attracted many fine actors to
portray these memorable roles. I found the female roles to be
particularly well designed and delivered. Excellent female roles in
this film.FYI: At my screening (2nd) the director told us that there were 1400
seats at the first screening and that there were already 4000 negative
reviews on IMDb - yes he reads these reviews. I don't believe 100's of
Turks would come to a film festival only to learn about the Armenian
Holocaust. No one at my screening cried foul. People that maintain it didn't happen are still trapped in a loop of
denial. If we cannot remember the past we are doomed to repeat it.This film is careful not to delve to strongly into the depiction of
violence. I think this film might be appropriate to teach children
about history and also to teach children about people who want to cover
up history.It is October 5th, almost a month now since the premiere. Currently
54,000 negative reviews for a film that hasn't opened yet - that must
be some sort of a record.
