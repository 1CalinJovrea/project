Oh My God!  Steer clear of this for your own sake.  Oh my the humanity.

I am wondering if anyone from Netflix watched this god-awful "movie"
before putting it on their website. Apparently not, or I should hope
not, or they would have rejected this absolute POS. Are they actually
going to pay A.S. for this? It is really very sad to watch what A.S.
has come to. It is so sad that they had to go to the race card in order
to be "funny." I just cannot believe that Netflix watched this horror
of a "movie" before putting it up for public consumption. No wonder
their stock is losing value. Well Netflix, its just going to get worse.
I wanted to give this "movie" a zero, but had to give it a 1. I am
wondering if i should cancel my subscription after watching just 30
minutes of this, the worst "movie" i have ever seen!
