An outstanding non-Hollywood low budget film delivers unnervingly tension and realism!

How can anyone not like this film keeping in mind this is a non-
Hollywood big budget production?! Wow, I was blown away... I still feel
uneasy 30 min after the ending credits.This film was the Irish equivalent to a Tarantino film!Novice writer and director Mark O'Connor just nailed every aspect of
this film. His directing is comparable to any top Hollywood director.
Camera angles, close ups, pan-in & outs, just perfect! Even the
cinematography and score could have not been fitted any better into
this film.Then we have actor and writer John Connors who just nailed his
character so well, you felt you were right there feeling his emotions
and tension. It felt as if this was all actually happening and you were
just in the background observing everything.Nothing about this film felt acted, phony or 'Hollywood-ish'. The
realism was on point. I've never heard of any of these actors and every
single one of them played their characters to perfection. I'm just shocked at some of these negative reviews, especially the one
who was so judgmental on the actors appearances, charisma, etc... and
he didn't even get past 20 mins of this masterpiece. Know-it-all
critics like that need to be banned from this site, as they are clearly
not critics! Try Googling 'how to critique a film' and then analyze
each component and you will see this film is a winner. Add the tense
enjoyment and realism and this film is perfect.Do yourself a favor and watch this film, ignore the negative reviews,
take your blinders off, and see this film for what it is... a
non-Hollywood, low budget amateur film masterpiece. It's a slow start,
but gets much better. And if anyone thinks my review is fake, click on

this site with over 600 ratings and almost 300 reviews!A perfect and well deserved 10/10 from me! Bravo to John Connors, Mark
O'Connor and all the rest of the cast and crew who put together this
masterpiece! I hope you win many well deserved awards.
