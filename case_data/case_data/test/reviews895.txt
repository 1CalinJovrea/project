Sure to be one of the best films of the year

Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises
big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this
film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely
enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have
come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about
musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre.
The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as
soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles
Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the
best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act
without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on
this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I
hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for
excellent low budget films.
