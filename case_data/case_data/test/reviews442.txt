Were all the scientists on a day off when this script was written?

Wow this was a bad one, I thought Interstellar was painful but this was
even worse (I know hard to believe!) My favourite part in the whole
movie was when Matt points out that an explosion which occurred in a
particular room during an experiment he was conducting was due to
(you'll love this!) him exhaling too much oxygen into the room! Correct
me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we exhale CO2 and inhale O2. I
think even a fifth grader would be able to tell me that. I nearly cried
with laughter when I heard him say that line and how he kept a straight
face is beyond me, unless he thinks its true of course.This was just the beginning of the lack of believable science in this
movie and it was so painful to watch after more and more random
unbelievable events started popping up. His one line killed the movie
for me, from that point on I was looking for more "errors" and they
just kept on coming.Anyway to cover the opening sequence with how poor Matt ends up left on
Mars to die, well there's a big storm that no one seems coming, they
all rush to their landing vehicle to hot tail it back up to their
orbiting mothership. Matt gets a whack in the gut with something (which
we later find out pierced his suit completely but yet somehow the suit
manages to stay pressurised with a hole in it) and decides to pass out.
The rest of the crew fly back up to the mothership and, get this,
immediately set course for home! They don't stay in orbit for say
another 24 hours and recover Matt's body they just leg it back home
asap. Odd I thought for a NASA mission to just abandon him and not say
bring the body back for his family to bury.When poor Matt wakes up he finds all the communications are down and
all his friends gone. And by communications I mean the one satellite
dish that was stuck to the habitat roof has blown down in the storm and
been completely demolished, but not one of the solar panels outside is
damaged, just a bit sandy. Seeing how comms back to Earth would be one
of the critical systems would there not be 3 or 4 other methods of
calling home, redundancies in case of a disaster? NASA didn't see the
point in having any of those backups on this mission to Mars, what
could possibly go wrong? Another good one is when he is told to drill
and cut a whole in the roof of a perfectly airtight rover and sticky
tape a big plastic balloon to the top of it. No reason is given for
this yet it happens, I think it's so he can take some more plastic
painting sheets with him but I cant be certain. Also wouldn't this
drilling and cutting a big hole compromise the pressurisation integrity
rendering the vehicle unsafe to drive around in without a space suite
on, oh but not for Matt, he happily drives around Mars with no suit on
at all with his new plastic sticky taped sunroof fitted trying to work
out how far he can get on his batteries while whinging about how he'll
never make it to the RV due to lack of power all the while singing
along to the stereo with more flood lights turned on than at a football
stadium. Um turn some crap off Matt that'll save you some juice.Again another scene in the movie, an airlock somehow gets blown to bits
and a big gaping whole is left in the side of the habitat Matt lives
in. The solution, a big piece of plastic sheet and more sticky tape, he
then repressurises the habitat and somehow his sticky taped plastic
painting sheet is able to hold up fine, outside there are wild storms
going on (which are visible through a few of the more believable
looking pressurised windows) raging away and not one single piece of
debris punches through his plastic painting drop sheet or does any
damage to his rover or solar panels.The mission to get him home is to send back the craft which ran away
and left him in the beginning. NASA didn't tell the crew of the ship
for months that he was still alive as they didn't want to hurt their
feelings! So the plan to get him back is drive the mothership all the
way back to Earth, do some gravity sling shot thing around Earth
(sounds like Apollo 13?) rendezvous with a supplies pod (food and
movies onboard probably) and fly all the way back to Mars and pick him
up as he fires himself into space from a lander (after stripping out
all the gear inside, removing the roof and covering it with another
plastic painting sheet held on with sticky tape to save weight) already
there for the next disastrous mission to Mars NASA has already cooked
up.For me this movie just went too far, way beyond what any normal person
with a even a tiny grasp of science can cope with. I cannot believe
Ridley, NASA and JPL were happy to have their names mentioned let alone
their relevant ground breaking departments portrayed with such a lack
of any real science.I know it's a SciFi movie but you have to get the basics right and have
some kind of explanation for the viewer to be able to buy into the
ludicrous things which take place in the movie. Otherwise it just
becomes a complete bore to watch and the viewer spends their time
looking for more flaws.My opinion, save yourself the money, stay home, get a pizza in & watch
Blade Runner on BluRay again :-)
