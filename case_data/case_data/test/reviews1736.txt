Why???

I don't understand how viewers would actually admire this film?
Honestly, I think the series of American Pie went down hill soon after
the spin offs are made. The original American Pie film (1999) was quite
a good teenage film for it's time. It was a funny, serious and had a
deemed message on the society areas within American high school.
Although there was problems within the film itself, such as Christopher
Klein's terrible acting, Jim's father being too involved in Jim's
sexual life and as such areas are deemed to be unrealistic.
Nevertheless, that film was quite good and I would given it a positive
review. I was expecting American Reunion would have the satisfying outcomes of
the first film with now all new lives with the main characters with
children and as such made their lives where they are at the moment.This foolish decision turned out to be one of the worst experience I've
ever had in the history of cinema for my personal viewing. From context
such as acting, characters (which are just a repeat from the first
film), storyline and the dialogue itself is probably the worst in
cinema. Viewing the entire film was somewhat the same experience as
Alex DeLarge from 'A Clockwork Orange' was viewing the harmful videos
during the therapy session. Jim and his gang are now mostly married and have children of their own.
They are aged probably in their early 30s. The storyline goes from Jim
and his friends hitting on young teenagers (~ aged 17-19) is somewhat a
bit creepy to say for the least. Chris Klein's character, Oz, was even
more worse than his performance within the first film. It seems like
every time whenever he's trying to say part of his dialogue, it's
either he's not tempted to do so or he has no skills in acting
whatsoever. Either way, most actors within the film are like this. It
seems like the director don't give one damn about it, it's just a come
and go if you'd like to say just in one shot. This film's a mess from the ground up through every bit of the context
within the film. It seemed that throughout the viewing of this film, it
seemed that the context in areas of acting is deemed to be equal as a
porno acting. I think my IQ level decreased when I first viewed this
film. With it's un-original film, please don't go near this film. 0/10
