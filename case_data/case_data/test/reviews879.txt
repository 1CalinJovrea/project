Civil War? more like a spit fight over a disagreement that puts lives at risk

I would give it 0/10 But had to settle for the lowest which was 1/10.
This movie is as inconsistent as it is poorly written. Black Widow
survives being thrown in a armored truck with a grenade, not to mention
no one even bothers to shoot at her. The scene where Scarlett Which blows up part of a building was
ridiculous, out of all the places she could've chosen to throw the bomb
it was at the one tall building in the area. Captain America freezes
due to hearing the name Bucky and even says that. The scene where Black
Panthers Dad dies is ridiculous given that Black Panther should've been
killed in the blast, not to mention how was that part of the building
the only part that suffered the most damage? I guess they didn't want
to kill off Black Widow. The explosion would've leveled the lower
floors thus resulting in the higher floors crumbling. Not just that one
room being majorly affected. Tony Stark is the only one in this that makes sense. Everyone complains
about Tony and says he's the bad guy and will stab you in the back,
when they are the one's who broke the law and have a cry about it.
Scarlett Witch being "rescued" by Hawkeye was completely ridiculous,
she has a guilt trip about killing people and she snaps out of it just
because she is told to get up off her ass. Not to mention Tony just
grows a conscious after a few years of all these other people dying but
changes his tune after talking to a Mother. Jokes are forced.Lets not forget how bad the reasoning for their fighting is. Captain
America especially, Bucky being a trained killer, who would be out in
public and he thinks it's a good idea to break him out and beat up the
German police. Also the part where black Widow goes off at Tony for
things getting out of hand and that Captain America will always be on
the run and she let Captain America go. This is why the Avengers can't
have nice things.
