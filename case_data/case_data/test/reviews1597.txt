Disappointment

Youth is the sort of film we are supposed to like: esteemed Italian
director and Academy Award winner, venerable actors, weighty subject
matter. Yet, in the end it is one big disappointment. Here is why, and
beware the spoilers.1. The female characters are portrayed as weak, infantile or voiceless.
Rachel Weisz has, by her own account, two jobs: daughter and assistant
to her father the famous composer (which make it one job). Unable to
pursue her own life, she is also afraid of heights. Although she
confronts her father about his failings, we last see her being held
like a baby by the bland mountaineer while hanging from the side of a
mountain. Jane Fonda, in a brief cameo, berates Harvey Keitel while
claiming she made her own career. Yet she is reduced to a raving mess
on an airplane after learning of his suicide. The quiet masseuse, when
asked why she never speaks, replies that she has nothing to say.
Caine's wife is portrayed in just one scene, and she is reduced to
nothing more than a catatonic silent scream.2. Auxiliary characters such as the violin boy and the girl in the
store do not emerge organically from the story. Rather they seem to be
dropped into the story to mouth the thoughts of the writer/director,
who apparently wants to make sure that the audience doesn't miss his
intent.3. The film is over filled with one surrealistic trope after another to
the point of bursting.4. Michael Caine's character is wrought over the realization late in
life that devoting his time to his art/work came at the expense of
relationships with people who mattered, namely his wife and daughter.
Harvey Keitel, seeking to find a continued purpose in life by writing a
new screenplay, kills himself upon realizing he can't do it. This is
the stuff of a college sophomore who has taken a course in existential
philosophy and became fascinated by The Stranger. There is a surface
level philosophical question, but not much depth to it.5. I could go on about the portrayal of emotionally empty sex, dining
rooms filled with mute couples and mannequin like guests, people
marching like automatons to the spa and so forth, all of which leave
the viewer with a dismal view of life.I give credit to Caine, Keitel and Weisz for doing the best they could
with marginal material. The film itself, however, is pretty to look at
and dismal to watch.
