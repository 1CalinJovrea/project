Spend your money elsewhere!

I first like to say that I am a fan of the Resident Evil Franchise.
I've watched all the movies and played all the games. That being said,
this movie is horrible. The whole movie seems like a opening scene,
just bullets and explosions for 95 minutes.The new characters are forced, the dialogue is horrible. The only
reason anyone seemed to like this movie was because they got to stare
at Mila for an hour and a half. If all you want is to stare at Mila use
a Google images search.They could have cut this whole movie down to 20 minutes and given us a
real story for the next hour. But that would require writing a decent
script. If the dialogue in this movie was more that 20 pages I would be
surprised.How any one can defend this movie baffles me. Please spend your money
elsewhere, if I could go back in time I would watch something else. You
can wait until it's on Netflix, trust me. If they make money on this
film they will continue to puke out this drivel banking on fan loyalty.This movie was a serious disappointment.
