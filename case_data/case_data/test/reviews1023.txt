Not worth my time or money!  May contain spoilers

My husband and I took the kids to go see this movie over Father's Day
weekend. We all left feeling extremely disappointed in the movie. To us
there was no real story line. Just people living in a time where there
was a disease outbreak. What it has to do at night time is beyond us.
There was really no point to this movie at all. It was 1.5 hours, that
felt like way longer, that we will not get back of our life. I highly
recommend people not to waste their time with this movie.
