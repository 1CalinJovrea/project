On a par with Blair Witch

I was almost put off watching this film due to some of the bad reviews
I'd read elsewhere, so I went with an open mind but didn't regret it.Not since Blair Witch have I been more engrossed in a film which, in
parts, was genuinely scary and claustrophobic...it really sucks you in
to the point you feel that you are down there with them...Once the initial "introduction to the characters" bit was over and they
entered the first part of the catacomb, the film properly began...from
the minute they passed a group of strange naked women carrying out what
I assume what satanic chants deep below the ground, I was hooked...and
the phone ringing really freaked me out....!! The section when they were in "hell" was intense with noises that you
would indeed associate with such a place, if it were to exist..deep
screams and cries, absolutely terrifying...the hooded demons were the
stuff of real nightmares and you just wondered what the hell (pardon
the pun) was going on down there as without the groups head torches
they would be down there in the pitch black...doing what I wondered..?
Very eerie to say the least...it was definitely a good interpretation
of hell...This film is not for the purists amongst us, and there is indeed room
for criticism...the shaky camera is not everyone's cup of tea and at
times, you are relieved when they are static for a brief moment and the
motion stops, however this did not distract me from what was a
thoroughly enjoyable film...there is also an element of scooby do about
the whole thing as the group keep repeating "we must carry on" every
time something bad happened and the constant running away from bad
things...As for the ending...I didn't get it as such, but i liked it....it does
make you think...you leave the cinema pondering on what just happened
and HOW it could happen...it maybe wasn't the crap ending that some
reviewers have stated...I liked it...Quite simply, If you liked Blair Witch, you will like this...if you're
looking for high budget, great acting and CGI, you won't...I'd give it 8/10 purely because the shaky camera was at times too much
and you just wanted a bit of camera stabilisation..!!I'd recommend this film, definitely..
