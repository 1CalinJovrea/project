Dinos return to glory days

JURASSIC WORLD I do so love when a movie series returns to its creative
roots. JURASSIC PARK was an epic film, and then Spielberg and company
found a way to destroy its flavor with two banal sequels. After a
lengthy hiatus that included much soul-searching, and dumping Jack
Horner, JURASSIC WORLD brings the franchise back to the wonderfulness
of the original.I try to not watch trailers before I see a movie. Often, they are
misleading. At best, the reveal too many key plot elements or scenes.
Unfortunately, the trailers for JURASSIC WORLD permeated media in a
major advertising campaign blitz. What I saw in the trailers alarmed
me. Did I actually see Velociraptors work along side the film's
protagonist Chris Pratt, as a unified force? It reminded me of ALIENS
VS. PREDATOR, where viewers were force-fed the notion a petite black
woman was the only human representative capable of defeating a horde of
aliens by teaming with the creatures who hunt humans for sport. Please.
The concept was idiotic, and though they tried to salvage the movie
series with a follow-up, the initial theme essentially destroyed the
franchise in the world of celluloid.The raptors, in the same frame with Pratt, are not friendly creatures.
Luckily, there are no "we are family" moments between species. I'll
test your memory here, but think back to the second film in the
CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON series; THE REVENGE OF THE CREATURE. In
the film, John Agar, experimenting on the intelligence of the gill-man,
uses an electric prod to teach the word "stop" to the Creature. Through
Pavlovian testing, the Creature hesitates at the sound. It establishes
a necessary reaction for the climatic scene. The raptors work much the
same manner in JURASSIC WORLD. It is done well.Now, consider Jack Horner. After JURASSIC PARK, Horner attempted to
garner his fifteen minutes of Andy Warhol fame and used rather sketchy
paleontology findings to discredit the Tyrannosaurus Rex. He claimed
the King of Dinosaurs was nothing but a mooching scavenger. Somehow, he
convinced Spielberg to shift attention away from Rex. It was a bad move
that culminated in a horrendous JURASSIC PARK 3, where a Spinosaurus,
which in reality measured only 20 feet compared to T-rex's 50 feet,
fights and defeats Rex. Horner's new Rex theories were dismantled by
his peers and colleagues within a year. He is now in the caf√© of
scientific oblivion, sipping coffee with the two researchers who tried
to convince us of global warming with a fabricated hockey stick graph
model. Rex is back in full glory in JURASSIC WORLD. In fact, he
received cheers and applause from the preview audience when he appeared
on screen. They were louder than any reaction to superheroes.JURASSIC WORLD makes many references to the original, and basically
ignores everything from the sequels. It is twenty years past John
Hammond's disastrous attempt to bring dinosaurs to a theme park. In
that time, technology has improved, enabling Hammond's dream to become
reality. Thousands of people visit JURASSIC WORLD on a regular basis,
but as with all things, dinosaurs become mundane with the public and
the park must find new and exciting ways to keep ticket sales booming.
Enter Indominus Rex, a genetically built dinosaur hybrid, meant to add
an element of fear and terror to park visitors. BD Wong returns as Dr.
Henry Wu, and is the culprit behind creation of the new Rex. He is
reminiscent of Dr. Susan McCallister, played by Saffron Burrows, in
DEEP BLUE SEA, who created superior sharks, but opted not to tell
anyone about the enhances features.In keeping with the Spielberg tradition of constantly putting children
in danger, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson star as Gray and Zach, who are
visiting the park while their parents attempt to end their marital
bliss. There can never be happy families anymore in films. It doesn't
fit the template of a dysfunctional society, so loved by liberal
Hollywood ideology. Entrusted to the care of their aunt, the boys
naturally find a way to immerse themselves in park havoc, while they
discover the bond that exists between brothers. Meanwhile, Auntie
Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, while chasing the All American
Woman Executive Dream, has the hots for Owen (Pratt), who is in this
story what Robert Muldoon should have been in the first. All these
subplots are secondary and just provide hurdles for a tale about a
genetic freak, and the dinosaurs who hate him.Critics were able to see JURASSIC WORLD in 3D. It is worth it. The
dinos, especially the raptor attacks, are superb. The dinos look great,
thanks to Ed Verreaux's production design. Cinematography by John
Schwartzman is excellent and provides several iconic moments sure to
appear on posters and memes. Music, though featuring additional tunes
by Michael Giacchino is basically variations on John Williams memorable
score.All in all, JURASSIC WORLD brings the series back to where it belongs.
You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump
straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled
with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It's worth repeated views and
deserves a spot on your home video shelf. As such, it exemplifies
excellence in film entertainment and captures the coveted Fist of Fiore
Award for 2015. You'll like this one; it's a keeper.10/10
