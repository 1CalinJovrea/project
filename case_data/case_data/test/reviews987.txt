So many reviews reek of denial!

I am so glad The Promise finally brings to the screen the story of the
Armenian genocide by the Turkish government during World War 1. This is
a long overdue telling of a part of world history that has badly needed
airing. I admit to over rating the film in order to counteract the very
obvious political bias of many of the low reviews. I would actually
rate it overall as an 8, (needed a bit more editing) but 10 for the
topic and acting etc. It is very well worth while seeing, a good film.The statement at the end of the film that the Turkish government denies
the genocide to this day is echoed heavily in many of the very low
scoring reviews here on IMDb. These supposed reviews are reminiscent of
a child stamping its foot and saying "how dare you", rather than any
serious discussion of the film. It makes you worried for the future of
modern Turkey when it can't accept and learn from its past history,
something at least Germany, with so many more deaths on its hands, has
done admirably. Perhaps the young Turkish friend of Mikael could be
held up as someone to admire, he saved his friends lives at the cost of
losing his own, a truly courageous act in a time of barbarity. The movie, is well written, acted and filmed. The story mainly unfolds
to us from the perspective of a young Armenian man Mikael who wants to
become a doctor; Oscar Isaac's performance as Mikael is wonderful, the
scene where he finds his slaughtered family is incredibly moving, the
display of raw, naked grief and loss its almost unbearable. Christian
Bale's performance as the world weary AP reporter, is great. His
character, becoming aware of the atrocities happening around him, turns
from drunken cynic to courageous truth teller, revealing to the world
the systematic, cruel elimination of the Armenians. Charlotte le Bon
created an Ana so full of life and hope, a candle of kindness to the
children in a dark place, that she was a joy to watch. I can't think of
one character who didn't ring true, all were very good. I did enjoy
Jean Reno's very brief appearance as the French admiral coming to the
rescue.A highlight is a scene in a cathedral of a man singing which strangely
to me was the most powerful moment in the whole film, I have no idea
what he was singing but something beautiful and hopeful and truthful
echoed in that building and in the song. Overall an emotionally
draining story well told.
