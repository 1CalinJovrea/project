Been There, Seen That

Tone of the movie wavers between serious and quirky, never making a
definitive choice; as such it succeeds at neither. Far too many
"homages" to other movies to stand on its own. Tries to play on LA
stereotypes, but the commentary on them only comes across as "making
sure each clich√© is thrown in the movie somewhere," thereby ensuring
that the movie itself exemplifies the most prevalent LA stereotype:
style over substance. Liked the "alternate reality" sequence if only for the fact that it was
the one moment in the movie where it tried to say something interesting
about life and because I could pretend to be in some other reality
where I wasn't watching this movie.
