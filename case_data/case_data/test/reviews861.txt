Welcome to the friend-zone.

Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) and Chantry (Zoe Kazan) meet at a mutual
friend's party and instantly bond with one another. Chemistry between
them is flawless and spontaneous  but she has a boyfriend, which
leaves recently heart-broken Wallace in the 'friend-zone'.Containing much witty dialogue, quirky references and probably
redefining the entire term awkward  'What If' seems firm and fresh in
style, yet is typically conventional in story, hindering on the exact
narrative of Harry Met Sally actually ...Lead star Daniel Radcliffe, seems as if he is still trying to get to
grips with genre post HP and distancing himself after trying a mixture
of features; Woman in Black, Kill Your Darlings, and upcoming horrors;
Horns and Frankenstein. Nonetheless, he seems concrete in his first
Rom- Com performance and we want to see more.Also interesting to see him play a Brit in an American/Canadian film,
rather than putting on an accent like a baffled Hugh Grant we are used
to in this Richard Curtis-esqe movie. We see great potential ahead of
him and are going to go ahead and call it that Dan' will win an Academy
award before 2018 is out.Alongside Radcliffe stars Zoe Kazan in an equally exceptional
performance (her best yet), and co-starring upcoming Star Wars actor
Adam Driver for even more humour  the film is solid. A film coming
from the director of both Goon and Fubur, set our expectations low, but
it impressed and entertained by taking and old story and remixing it
with an indie feel.'What If' arrives in UK cinemas on the 20th August 2014.
