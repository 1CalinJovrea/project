Fulfilling entertainment with slickly (and clearly) edited action

John Erick Dowdle's "No Escape" is a taut thriller, nicely edited and
strongly paced, resulting in a film that knows exactly how to get your
adrenaline up and your movie-going senses tingled. Dowdle has been a
strong force in the horror genre ever since his seldom-seen, largely
unreleased debut "The Poughkeepsie Tapes" came onto the scene in 2007.
Since then, Dowdle has proved his ability to direct claustrophobic
thrillers such as "As Above, So Below" and "Devil," solidifying his
filmography as dynamic and rounded, especially for a horror/thriller
director."No Escape" is his most mainstream project to date, with a bigger scale
than his previous films and bigger stars as well. Set in Southeast
Asia, we focus on Jack (Owen Wilson), his wife Annie (Lake Bell), and
their children Lucy and Breeze (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare), who
are moving to Asia for Jack's new job. Not long after being in the
land, Jack's morning walk to get a newspaper results in him racing back
to his hotel, following an all-out war between law enforcement and
natives in the cluttered streets. Riots, looting, and inexplicable
violence break out in the streets and Jack and his family must find a
way to Vietnam where they can declare asylum. They seek out the help of
Hammond (Pierce Brosnan, who provides darkly comic relief in many
scenes), a skilled survivalist who is seen traveling on the plane with
them to Asia, who assists in finding them temporary places to stay
amidst all the madness.Assertions have flown over the alleged "racism" of "No Escape"'s story,
due to the negative portrayal of Asian natives and the constant danger
and sanctity of this white family being challenged, in addition to
being the prime concern, throughout the course of this picture. I bring
this up not to challenge the position, for it is somewhat valid, but
how come films like "Taken," which is operating on the same playing
field as this film, isn't as slammed as this film is? Was that picture
just too entertaining for the subtext to be noticed, or were we too
distracted by Liam Neeson in that film to really care? "No Escape," however, can claim more than "Taken" can as film because
"No Escape"'s strengths come in the regard of its editing and
camera-work, two things I was worried about walking into this film.
Chaotic action films like these are ripe for sloppy aesthetics, which
can, in turn, ruin any ability to see the action, let alone really care
about what is happening to the characters. Dowdle and editor Elliot
Greenberg are smart about how they shoot and edit this film, never
settling for anything other than shots and editing tactics that allow
for immersion and clear placement for the audience. In addition,
Greenberg's editing provides some elements of structural pacing, which
work to "No Escape"'s favor, especially during the more chaotic scenes.The only element that subtracts from what "No Escape" does so uniformly
well with its aesthetics is the convenience of the plot. Throughout the
film, characters are put in compromising positions, including one scene
at the end that comes so close to making this film great and almost
entirely amoral, but finds ways through miraculous scenarios to get
them out of harm's way in the nick of time. This ostensibly comes from
writers John Erick and Drew Dowdle's dueling desire to up the film's
stakes but simultaneously back down and not make things too drastic.
For as heartless as some scenes of the film can be, it would've only
been fitting to see some of the more serious, morally corrupt scenarios
to follow through."No Escape" still works as a basic, fulfilling film; a pulsating action
film with various elements of a thriller directed by someone with an
evident list of ideas and edited by someone who understands the value
of pacing and crystal-clear editing.
