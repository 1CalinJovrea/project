Totally Disappointing

This type of movie must be factually correct above everything else.
Instead it is a hodgepodge of 50% theatrics, 49% personal life drama
and 1% science and even that of questionable accuracy. For example, it seems to imply that the theory of singularity was
developed by Hawking and it was immediately hailed by the scientific
world which is totally at odds with the account given by Hawking
himself in his own book. The theory of stellar collapse was developed by Subrahmanyam
Chandrasekhar on board a ship on his way to England for higher studies
at Cambridge. It was based on his flash of insight that while Pauli
Exclusion Principle is limited by Relativity, Gravity is not and
therefore when a star above a certain mass (later named Chandrasekhar
Limit) begins to collapse, it completely disappears into a mathematical
abstraction called singularity. This shockingly alien concept was hotly
contested by the scientific orthodoxy and ferociously attacked by his
supervisor Sir Arthur Eddington and opposed by Einstein himself even
though the mathematics was irrefutable ("A Brief History of Time", P.
83-85). In fact, Eddington's hostility was so vicious that Chandrasekhar had to
switch his field of study although it later formed the foundation of
the theory of Black Holes which was built upon by others like
Oppenheimer. Arthur I. Miller's "Empire of the Stars" gives a detailed
account of Chandrasekhar's scientific career and his rivalry with
Eddington.Hawking is unquestionably one of the most brilliant minds of our time
but to credit him with the achievement of another brilliant mind and to
totally distort history does grave injustice to both of them and
misguides the viewers.
