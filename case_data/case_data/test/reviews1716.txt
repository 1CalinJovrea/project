Great opening at the Venice Film Festival with this must-see movie. The
story of an actor persecuted by the role that made him popular,
"Birdman", and pressured by the willing of proving himself on stage
with his new play.The characters in the story are all struggling with something: Sam
(Emma Stone) with her drug addiction, Mike (Edward Norton) with his
sexual problems, Lesley (Naomi Watts) with her self- realization and
Michael Keaton with love. What kind of love is he lacking? Is it
admiration for his work? The same admiration that chained him to
Bridman, who is probably the only one capable of saving him.The cinematography reminds of that used in Hitchcock's "Rope": it seems
to be filmed consequently. The originality of the cinematography,
though, may have sacrificed the storyline."Birdman" certainly needs to be seen more than one, but likewise
certainly it's going to be one of the greatest movies of the year
