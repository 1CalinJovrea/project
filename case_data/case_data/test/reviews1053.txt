Not half bad, really. Jennifer Lawrence's presence ups the value a bit, too.

People don't seem to like this one much, but I found it totally decent.
It's probably better than it should be simply for the presence of
Jennifer Lawrence - who is just smoking hot. Okay, she's a good
actress, too, and gives a good performance. She won an Oscar last year
for Silver Linings Playbook (much deserved, in my book). Her tank top
from this film should have been nominated for an award. Okay, enough
about how hot Lawrence is (very, is the answer). The story here is
decent, if nothing special. Lawrence, moving into a new home, falls for
the damaged teen down the street, Max Thieriot (also pretty good). His
horrifying past (his parents were murdered by his insane sister) is
well known to the small town they live in. He harbors a few other
secrets, as well. This mostly wins for me because Lawrence comes off as
a fairly smart horror heroine. The climactic sequence is really well
done (shades of the climax of Wait Until Dark - would have been nice to
see this in the theater, as I came really close to doing last year).
Elisabeth Shue also co-stars as Lawrence's mom. She's still good
looking and is a fine actress. I'd love to see her in a really good
role at this point in her career.
