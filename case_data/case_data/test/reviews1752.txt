What the hell is wrong with people.

I don't understand these raving reviews for this movie, this movie
literally is a more graphic abstinence propaganda film. If you have sex
before marriage with multiple partners you will die... maybe... If you
walk really slow.These kids clearly have parents, who seem to be okay with their kids
running all over the country side with no accountability.They didn't even follow their own established rules for this poorly
established creature; At one point it is mentioned that if this thing
touches you, you will die, So when chilling on the beach it grabs her
hair she manages to get away, however a little later down the line it
instantly kills her neighbor with sex... Uh alright I guess...They never explain, or even bother trying to find out where it came
from or why it just wants to sex people to death. Also they mention
that "IT" will take the form of anything to get close to you, including
people you love, however twice I think it was do we see it take on a
form of anybody they know, once at the beach, and once as the neighbors
mom. Would have made more sense to have "IT" just take the form of
somebody you love so it could get you...This was over-hyped trash and if I could get my money back, that would
be great. Wish I could rate this 0/10. Weak Plot, Weak Acting, honestly
where can I get some of that crack everybody who reviewed this
positively is smoking?
