Different from other Teen movies

Great coming of age teen movie that explores the angst of the 'First
Time'. Unlike most teen flicks, the characters don't fall into
stereotypes, and they act their age in an intelligent way that does not
lean towards Dawson Creek territory. Great from start to finish, and
different from most movies in that genre.The teens are normal, the girl
and boy you and I know, and now some picture perfect model. The cast
were excellent in their roles in fact I have also watched the lead
character in Teen Wolf and this is quite a departure from the role he
plays in that. The best thing, however, about the movie is the romance
was relate-able and normal, and not some unrealistic love story you
only seen in movies. What a great ending!
