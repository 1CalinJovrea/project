A worthy sequel

Hilarious, often outrageous, but above all thoroughly entertaining, 22
Jump Street manages to recapture all the humor and audacity its
successful predecessor had to offer, while also offering some new
thrills and unpredictability along the way. The film strikes a unique
and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing
the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story
but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the
storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh
and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be
differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an
awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film's dominant feature
continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who
again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall
this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success
of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition
to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to
establish a very distinct comedy series.
