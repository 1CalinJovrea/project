Star Wars is Dead!

Bring back George Lucas. All is forgiven!!!Makes the Prequels look like masterpieces!I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this movie. Like a lot of
Fans here, I have been waiting to see the further adventures of Luke,
Han, and Leia again since 1983 (32 years) when I saw 'Return Of The
Jedi' just before starting high school. And this is the rub... There is
no adventure for them. And there never will be now. The dream is
over!!!The one thing all fans of the originals wanted to see was all three of
them together again on screen at the same time. I will say that again! 'The one thing all fans of the originals wanted to see was all three of
them together again on screen at the same time.'At least once! Well, that never happens. You only see Luke at the end
for about 30 seconds, and he doesn't even speak. Han is killed off
pathetically. And Leia is hardly in it. We find out that the big
romance between Han and Leia didn't work out. You find out hardly
anything about what happened to any of them over the years, apart from
Han and Leia splitting up due to their son (let's not even mention that
sorry excuse for a villain) turning to the dark side. There was so many things wrong with this movie, I can't begin to tell
you. It's easier just to say there was nothing right with it. I will
watch the others, simply because I have seen every movie on the cinema
so far. However, for me it is dead! They can't make up for this in
episodes 8 and 9, no matter what they do. It is truly awful. I wanted
to walk out. I wonder how much Harrison Ford had to do with this being a
monstrosity? After all, it is no secret he wanted to be killed of in
'The Empire Strikes Back' so he could do other things. He has a huge
ego. He only done this movie because he was promised another Indiana
Jones movie. Did he also stipulate that he wanted to be the main star
of this? Forcing Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher into the sidelines?Anyway, All I want now is for the originals to be released on Blu Ray
in their original theatrical versions (without any changes). Then I can
sell my other Blu Ray Box Set, and pretend that nothing else was ever
made.Biggest movie disappointment of my life. Nothing will ever come close. STAR WARS IS NOW DEAD!!!!!!!!
