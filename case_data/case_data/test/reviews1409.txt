An indie well worth seeing

I saw it three times. Yes,it was painful because we were all that kid
-- geek, awkward, nowhere with girls.The movie is honest, funny, and I will see Olivia Cooke's unreal face
in front of me for months. (And she did shave her head; I wondered
about that.) R.J. Cyler gave perfect balance to the lead actor's
awkward role.The best thing about this movie is the writing; it crackles at times
with insight into the outsider's life.I am much aggrieved that it only earned four million at the box office
nationally. It's worth a lot more.
