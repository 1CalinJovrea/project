A whole lotta 'meh'

There's two kinds of Netflix programming: the stuff you watch regularly
and intently, like Netflix's ongoing series, and then the stuff you
just sort of have playing in the background as you do other stuff. The
Ridiculous Six falls into the second category.Some Sandler movies are just flat out awful. But Ridiculous Six manages
to be mildly amusing at times. It's impossible to buy Sandler as a
bad-ass Indian tracker, but that's probably the point. You've probably
never seen Taylor Lautner or Jorge Garcia like this before--but whereas
Garcia is pretty funny as a mumbling moon-shine- making hillbilly,
Lautner as a simpleton just gets grating after awhile. Also, somewhat
surprisingly, the funniest guy out of the six is Rob Schneider, whose
Mexican character manages to steal every scene he's in. Terry Crews and
Luke Wilson are just there and don't really add much to the
proceedings.The best parts of the movies are Will Forte's bumbling band of one-eyed
bandits and the cameos--seriously, some of these cameos are just flat
out awesome. Particularly a couple cameos that occur during a poker
scene.Chances are good if you're a Sandler/Happy Madison fan, you'll enjoy
this.
