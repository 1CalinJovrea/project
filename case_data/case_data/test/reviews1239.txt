How Did Veronica Roth Approve this Movie?

I have read all three books written by Veronica Roth. I came in with
expectations of character profiles and I reviewed the characters on
IMDb. I understand that all book-to-movie adaptations make it difficult
to fit in all the elements and are not perfect. It's impossible to
portray the book word for word. Despite knowing all of this, I came in
with a low expectation.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely
not the small and weak Tris we imagine while reading the book. A lot of
the character profiles were 'off.' However, Shailene gave an excellent
portrayal of how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident
fearless warrior.The opening to the movie indicates we are in 'Chicago,' and that we are
separated into the five factions because of the war. There is no
explanation of why the war happened, where and who with. Just that we
have the huge fence to keep each other safe and we don't know what's
out there.Elements were definitely rushed and lacked intensity. The characters
that were not featured in this movie are revolutionary figures in the
second, making it impossible to have a movie without them. Key
characters were left out or barely mentioned. Drew, Edward, Molly &
Susan don't exist in the movie. There's no relationship at all with
Susan and Caleb, as they left her out. Peter's entourage is completely
removed. Edward has a couple brief mentions in the movie including the
capture the flag game and on the leader board. Otherwise, the entire
eye stabbing scene doesn't exit. We don't see Peter for who he really
is. The intensity of taunting Tris and making it difficult for her at
Dauntless headquarters is glossed over. We see Peter make a name for
himself when he beats Tris in the fight. Molly has barely two lines in
the movie. One of the lines Molly has complimented Tris. In the book
she's part of Peter's entourage and they hate each other. I find that
Peter is too soft in the movie and he isn't enough of a jerk. In the
book he's way more nasty.Elements of the Dauntless training were not victorious as they're
supposed to be. There was no focus on how vital Dauntless training is
and that they do it well. There was no desperation to survive the
training like there was in the book. You saw the rankings change, but
the intensity in the fights and the will to survive was never built up.Members of the family have the choice to visit on visiting day. This
scene was replaced with Tris' mother sneaking into the Dauntless
compound to be updated about her progress in the Dauntless training.
She warns her about doing too well and asks her to remain in the middle
of the pack. It's not revealed that the mom isn't going to visit Caleb,
nor does she ask Tris to visit Caleb and ask him to find out what's in
the serum. Instead, Tris on a whim visits Caleb. The movie was way too focused on the romance of Tris and Four. Four
softens up to Tris way too easily. He's supposed to be edgy and
guarded. Details about Four were supposed to be revealed in his fear
landscape. Four seems unfazed by his fear landscape. This scene is so
critical in the book, it's the first time we are supposed to see how
vulnerable Four really is. Four never tells Tris to call him Tobias. In
Tris' fear landscape, she sacrifices herself for her family. In the
movie, she faces her family and the gun is aimed at them.I can't even talk about the ending. It was completely changed. I might
have appreciated the ending if I hadn't read the books. There were
elements of the ending I quite enjoyed, but it's still very rushed. I
understand that they needed to end the movie with no cliffhanger, but
my sister who had not read the books still had questions about the
ending. Overall, I rate the movie as a C+. Other discrepancies include Tris
taking credit with Christina after the win in the Capture the Flag
scene, Will dying at the same scene as the mother (rather than in the
Dauntless compound), Tris not showing her displeasure with Four and
yelling at him, as well as Peter not begging for his life to be
included with Tris, her dad, Caleb and Marcus. As well the initiate who
jumps from the train and falls to her death, Al's crush on Tris, Four
getting drunk, and overall many scenes that never showed the struggle
of being that character. Near the end when the dad, Caleb, Marcus &
Tris have to catch the train to the Dauntless compound, there's no
struggle from any of the characters jumping on or off the train. Dad
and the others jump like they have done it a million times and Caleb
never complains. When they jump into the netting below, Tris asks each
of them, 'you good?' 'you good?' There was a lot of odd phrases that
Tris never used.There were quite a few memorable scenes including the aptitude test,
the fear landscapes, the simulations, the tense moments Tris and Four
had that were very true to the book including the capture the flag
scene, as well as the zip lining experience. ï»¿
