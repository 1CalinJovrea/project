Brilliant con artist movie blended with flawed romantic comedy

"Focus" blends two different movies in roughly equal measure. One is a
movie about con men, scam artists and hustlers, in the tradition of
"The Sting," "Ocean's Eleven," "House of Games" and "Shade." The second
movie is a romantic comedy between two people who are strongly
attracted to one another, but who cannot and do not trust each other. The movie about con men is brilliant. The hustles and scams are clever
and cleverly executed with excellent skill and tradecraft.
Dramatically, the double-blinds and double- crosses are well executed.
The players con their marks, one another and the audience with finesse
and aplomb. The cinematography, choreography and editing are crisp. The
reveals are plausible within the film's cosmos of reality. The romantic comedy is not bad. One can understand and believe the
attraction between the two characters. Will Smith's character is hunky,
clever, confident, successful and wealthy. Margot Robbie's character is
gorgeous, sexy, vulnerable, clever and charming. But the major plot
points in this boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back
subplot seem contrived, while the intriguing aspect of their
relationship (How can two con artists with a history of deceiving one
another learn to trust one another?) isn't explored in a satisfactory
manner. Instead we get a breakup for reasons that are never explained,
a repeated gag involving a wallet, and a massive coincidence that leads
the audience to believe one of them has a hidden agenda involving the
other. The relationship between them works best when they are conning
one another, but it needs resolution. Technically, the film is beautifully done. Cinematography, locations,
wardrobe, make-up, editing, audio -- everything is polished. It's a
movie that merits a second or third viewing, not only to see the cons
played out, but also to appreciate some of the subtle foreshadowing.
