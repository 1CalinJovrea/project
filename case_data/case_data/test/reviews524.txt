Couldn't finish movie

I had to turn this movie off because the default Apple ringtone makes
my dog freak out; main character's phone was ringing on average 1x per
minute. It got to the point where my dog picked a fight with my other
dog, not kidding. Since I wasn't able to finish it, I'll add a star for
the benefit of the doubt. But I don't think I'm missing much. Very slow
pace, did not grab my attention.
