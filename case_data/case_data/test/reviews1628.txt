What a mess...

Felt like it should've been a 10 minute short, in the first few scenes
you already know the uncle and protagonist are weirdos. Somehow this
movie is able to stretch so much out of nothing; there is no suspense,
the script is dull and uninteresting, the story is bland and
predictable, the performances equally bland - Wasikowska and whoever
played her uncle have one expression throughout the entire movie. It
felt like I was watching paint dry, this movie was BORING and
pointless.It gets a 2 for its style and cinematography, but that doesn't
overshadow the fact that the story sucked.
