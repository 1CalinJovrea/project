Irrevocably Broken

I am truly at a loss for words concerning Focus Features's newest, and
I pray last filmic experiment. In it, director Colin Trevorrow, and
screenwriter Gregg Hurwitz attempt to, among other things, balance the
story elements of a taut thriller, a morality play and a maudlin
melodrama while making a smart, borderline psychic 11-year-old not seem
like the kid from The Omen (1976). While doing so they use the affable
Naomi Watts as a doe-eyed sacrifice to the Gods of tortured metaphor,
and willfully ignore the fine line between believable, unbelievable and
unbelievably stupid. Is Book of Henry maliciously bad or just plain
bad? The fact that I can't tell should say something.Jaeden Lieberher plays the titular Henry, the elder son of a single mom
(Watts) living in Upstate New York. Henry is by all accounts a whizkid.
Some would call him brilliant, he calls himself precocious - I prefer
to call him a snot who, in addition to putting his peers to shame on a
regular basis has more-or-less taken over every responsibility at home.
Things however take a turn when Henry discovers his neighbor and
coincidentally the town Police Commissioner (Norris) has been abusing
his daughter (Ziegler). Finding only obstacles where there should be
help, Henry ultimately decides to save the day, using his mother as a
means to "take out" the Commissioner for the sake of his tortured
crush.Did I say crush? I ask because the plot assumes there's some kind of
deeper connection but we never see Henry have anymore positive emotion
than a waffle iron towards anyone. The character basically has two
modes: smug and pissy which somehow only gets worse as the film
progresses. Likewise Ziegler, Watts, Norris and Tremblay are given
nothing more than a single trait in which to base their entire
performances on. Tremblay especially gets shafted being forced to play
a modern version of Ralphie's brother in A Christmas Story (1983) when
if anything he should be channeling Elijah Wood in The Good Son (1993).The tone of the film (once it manages to settle on one) can't help but
be at odds with the cynicism of its lead character. Lieberher's Henry
moralizes with the eloquence of a French philosophe but can't help but
sound like a patronizing baby Hitler when he says things like "There
are worse things in the world than violence." Henry as written doesn't
have an iota of love in his body and as a result his mother is in for a
Rube-Goldberg-like ride that has a lot of moving parts but amounts to
nothing. Despite this, the movie itself is so obnoxiously twee it feels
like it's trying to mimic the best part of The Goonies (1985) while
exhibiting the worst parts of Red Dawn (1984) - which is to say an
inconsistent, reactionary moral compass with nary a character in search
of real solutions.Below is a list of things that happen in this movie. They're not
spoilers per se, as they are without context. That said, I truly
believe the lack of context actually makes everything better:-Watts becomes a stone-cold killer and sharpshooter in under a month.-Henry buys and sells stocks on a schoolyard payphone.-Sarah Silverman macks on Jaeden Lieberher and it's played off as okay
even though the entire movie sets itself up as against child abuse. -60% of Maddie Ziegler's lines are the words, "I'm fine."-Henry plans a murder with two outdated textbooks on forensic science. -Naomi Watts repeatedly plays Gears of War while ignoring her sons yet
its supposed to come across as absentmindedly charming. -Naomi Watts prepares school lunches like she trying to give children
diabetic comas. -Watts nonchalantly buys an illegal weapon despite nearly having a
panic attack in the car earlier. -Henry explains an MRI to a professional surgeon (Pace) despite zero
medical training.-The handsome doctor boxed-beard then unexpectedly shows up to a middle
school talent show, despite not having kids, and it's not seen as
creepy. -The assassination is setup to a middle schooler crooning "Amazing
Grace, " presumably because she couldn't get the rights to "Ave Maria".-Henry's young brother showers the audience of a middle school talent
show with fake snow strongly implying that he has just spread a
person's ashes.-The school principal continually ignores Henry's claims of abuse but
calls the cops after the talent show because apparently she can speak
dance.Of course taking any of this farce at face value would be giving it far
too much credit. Every story beat, character decision and sudden jolt
in the narrative rings too demonstratively false to be taken seriously.
Even if it does carry itself as just another thriller. I've seen a lot
of bad movies but rarely have I seen a movie so hypnotic in its
badness. The makers of this thing best be reminded that movies are
tricky.
