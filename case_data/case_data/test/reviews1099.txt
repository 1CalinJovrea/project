stylish but soulless

for me the main problem is ben.or ben's character in the movie.he's got
this bored look on his face.and he does not succeed in making us like
him..somehow.or care of what will happen to him in the end.isn't that
the point?to be charmed in a way.on the bright side,both actresses are
charming without trying,sienna and zoe.other than that ,i read some
reviews talking about a bomb.i don't agree.it's an expensive
production,well directed,acceptable acting,nice action scenes.maybe the
script needed a little spice.a little more of a human condition.enough
to care.it's too much matter-of-fact about how the mob business must be
run.i mean who cares.we need a little faster editing,suspense scenes
with characters to care.we need the suspense of argo,and the darkness
of gone baby gone.i am surprised because ben's first love i think is
screenplay.what happened there?still nicely watched but you forget it
once you leave the theater.
