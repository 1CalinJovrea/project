Again: This NOT Bond, Mrs. Broccoli...

this time it's getting even worse than Quantum Of Solace. The story is
lame and stupid, the nonsense plot is build around a melodramatic
inside view of Bond's psyche. O.K., when Bond is no bigger than life
daredevil anymore, it seems to be a logical consequence, to let the
audience learn more about the "true" psyche of Bond. But this is
completely crap in my eyes!An other complacent try by Mrs. Broccoli to revitalize the dusty genre
of spy movies. But the audience was always smarter and realized, of
course, that Bond never was realistic. The audience does not need to be
educated in the direction of a more temporary 21st. century Bond by
some filmmakers who do not want become suspects of doing the same thing
all over again. Bond WAS always the same for 40 years till Albert
Broccoli died and his very very untalented daughter took over the
franchise automatically. This happens when you bequeath a
business,there is no warranty that your children are going to handle it
well.The real Bond is a classical archetype male and a chauvinistic,
arrogant womanizer with a very dangerous job (secret agent), no woman
can withstand although she knows what a heart breaker he is. This
worked for 40 years and would have worked for another 40 years or so.
The Bond we knew until Craig appeared might not be the type of man
radical left-wing Eco-activist broads would like to welcome to their
sit-in. Fact is, the real Bond is dead!This is a private version of Mrs. Broccoli's fantasy Bond 008, a guy
who deeply comprehends women instead of bumping them before they can
count to three (which might be a challenge for some real Bond
girls...). Of course it's intended not to be "your dirty old father's"
Bond. It's a Bond for the masses not for the classes, offering a bit of
everything the average movie goer under 20 (Twilight-fans) might want
to consume.Craig's Bond has become a sissy, who has a complex oedipal relationship
to elder women, especially to those he calls "M". Now, in Skyfall, we
will learn that "M" is for "mother"... There really was no need to change the Bond franchise so completely,
except to squeeze out some dollars more out of the franchise. R.I.P.
007!
