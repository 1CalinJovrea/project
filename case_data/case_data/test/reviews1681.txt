The Poor Man's Fast and Furious that Overdrives Your Brain into Dullness

Overdrive mashes so many ideas from other movies that it was hard to
keep up with all of them and so I stopped counting when I couldn't keep
up. Sure, stealing from other movies isn't a bad idea when you add your
own touch. As some guy once said "steal like an artist" but with this
one, it's like you're watching a weird reenactment of cool ideas from
other movies without adding your own details or imprint or at least
gluing them together with some sense.And this is the case with this movie. They made a soup of ideas from
other films: vintage and sports cars, protagonists that get trapped in
doing a "job" for the rich douche-bag, pretty locations, chases, and
cute faces.But when you add in really bad acting, way too many plot twists and
side characters, an absolute lack of chemistry between the main actors,
boring racing scenes and some of the stupidest lines of dialogue one
can only wonder how come no one realized it was destined to fail in
such a loud way?Speaking of loudness, a message to its creators: turning that goddamn
volume up to 1 million won't make it more entertaining but instead
leave its viewers with a gigantic headache.I could, however, see 2 qualities in this racing flick: some pretty
panoramic views of France (a la Fast and Furious, of course) and the
protagonist half-brothers who actually felt like they were half
brothers.Teens will probably fall in love with the cute faces but otherwise, you
should stay away from this poor man's Fast and Furious because
Overdrive "overdrives" far from its inspiration points way up to the
realm of too much, or too little. Drive Over it and go see something
else.Also, who the **** eats cereal at night?
