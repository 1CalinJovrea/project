Too Much Exposition, Meandering and Bland

With Hollywood at a loss to make original movies, it was inevitable
that the Robocop franchise would eventually get the reboot. In 1987,
the original Robocop became an instant box office hit with its mixture
of witty satire and over the top violence as well as top notch acting
by Peter Weller, Kurtwood Smith and Ronny Cox; the deciding factor in
what made that movie so fresh at the time was the addition of Dutch
director Paul Verhoeven who seemed to understand what the audience at
the time needed: a high tech cyborg (artfully designed by special
effects whiz Rob Bottin and its robotic suit would become a cinema
icon) who fought crime in a near future world overwhelmed by greed,
hypocrisy, corruption and excessive, almost cartoonish violence.In this reboot, the studios were able to acquire the services of
Brazilian director Jose Padiha (who directed Elite Squad and its
sequel, two intense police thrillers set in his native Brazil) but
unfortunately they forgot to give him a good script to work with (there
were rumors during production that Padiha had a lot of ideas that were
nixed by studio bosses. Figures.). The other reason why the original
movie also worked was because its R rating worked in its favor: the
enormous amount of bloodletting added to its satirical view of the
future as well as that of American culture which really spoke to the
audience. With this reboot aimed at more family friendly crowds, the
PG-rated violence is filmed using rapid jump cuts which makes it
totally confusing, its like watching a video game on fast forward so
that by the time your mind registers what's going on the scene is
finished.The movie itself also suffers from pacing problems- just when the
narrative is about to steamroll forward, the scenes abruptly change so
that any emotional momentum is lost because there just isn't much
characterization of the main parts; everything that should have an
emotional impact is glossed over by a jump to a new scene with way too
much focus on explanations of what the characters are doing so that the
audience fails to gain sympathy for anybody.I can't really judge Joel Kinnaman's acting in the title role since
there really isn't much for him to do other than walk around in the
Robocop suit and utter a few words every now and then- he seems to
spend too much time bug eyed and in shock more than anything else. The
supporting cast also seems wasted, with Michael Keaton and Jackie Earle
Haley's screen time largely limited to trying to explain whats going on
rather than actually doing anything. Even Michael K Williams seems lost
as Robocop's sidekick. Patrick Garrow as the heavy is pretty much a
cardboard villain compared to the 1987 version with the menacing
Kurtwood Smith and his gang of killer psychos. Gary Oldman's
performance is pretty much average since he's also got nothing much to
do.Alas, the biggest disappointment is the movie's absence of any sort of
humor: the 1987 film had boatloads of wacky commercials that
interrupted the narrative yet provided a great view on how that future
world was set up as well as crazy, sadistic villains and a pun on the
name of the chief baddie (Dick Jones- best name ever). Instead, we get
snippets of a news media show run by Samuel L Jackson whose presence in
this movie is also wasted since he spends more time recapping what we
already saw and his jokes fall flat.The only good scene happens right at the beginning with a battle
between Iranian insurgents and the robot army but soon after the movie
quickly loses momentum and never regains it. Better to skip this one
and wait for the rental, or better yet, watch the 1987 version- its way
better.
