so boring and no where close to the franchise

So agent 47 the great, the fantastic the unhuman , what the hell is
this, i had the impression of watching a movie about metal gear solid,
agent 47 is silent, classy, a ninja et doesn't draw attention, in that
movie you see him has a beast, gun blazing shooting people not giving a
... there's somehow a guy made out of metal god what a shame. i wasn't
expecting a great movie either i'm not even surprised i was bored after
an hour watching that fake hit-man, plenty of car chase and shooting,
are we ever gonna get a great movie game EVER ?? please don't watch it,
there plenty of good movie that one isn't, i'm not giving more than one
the action scene almost made me puke with the shaky camera , it doesn't
represent hit-man at all.
