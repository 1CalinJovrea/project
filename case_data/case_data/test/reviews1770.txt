I want my 2 hours back!

In a nutshell..... The story of a writer-blocked poet (Bardem) and his
beautiful young wife (Lawrence) who has adoring fans (including Ed
Harris and his wife Michelle Pfeiffer) that flock to his home just to
be in his presence. Forgive the run on sentence........Harris is dying
of cancer, his two sons arrive to fight over his money, get into a
fistfight and one gets killed, more fans arrive, Lawrence goes into
labour, fans start to riot, tearing the house apart, she has the baby,
he wants to show his fans, she says no, he sits and stares at her for
days, she falls asleep, he takes the baby, shows his fans, they grab
the baby, kill it and eat it, Mom goes nuts, runs to the basement with
a wrench, bashed a hole in the oil tank and sets it on fire and blows
up the whole place, Bardem carries her charred body, sets her down and
proceeds to reach in her chest and take out her heart, with her
permission. He squeezes her heart til it turns to glass, sets it in a
stand, the next scene there's a new wife and the whole thing starts
over again. There! Just saved you $10........you're welcome!
