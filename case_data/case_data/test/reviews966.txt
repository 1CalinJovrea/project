Another Sandler flick that made me angry instead of making me laugh.

More of the same garbage from Adam Sandler. This abomination has the
same thing nearly all his other movies have had: humor that only eight,
nine and maybe ten-year-old boys would (should) think was hilarious.
Problem is, much of it is not AT ALL appropriate for that age range --
undoubtedly this would be, deservedly, PG-13 in theaters had Netflix
not picked it up. It is stunning to me that his movies rake in so much cash, and that so
many bonafide actors (Keitel, Buscemi, Zahn, etc) agree to be in them.
And I like Dan Patrick has a sports personality -- but come on ...
these movies hurt your brand sir. Bad look. So it's come to this: I honestly believe that if not for the normal
bodily functions of humans (and animals of course) for Sandler to make
fun of -- over and over and over again in this, and about all of his
movies, he'd be a broke joke remembered mostly for his okay SNL skits
from 25 years ago. A truly awful movie that I couldn't get but about half-way through it
was so bad. One star out of 10.
