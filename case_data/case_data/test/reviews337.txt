Evident Heroism, Hidden Doubts

This is one of those "based on true events" films that the moment you
return from the theater you're going to hop on the internet and explore
the story. That's a good sigh. Unfortunately, here the need to do some
fact checking might not stem from all the right reasons.Hidden Figures is an upbeat, inspiring tale about the role three
African-American women played in the NASA program during the early
60's. First Katherine Johnson (Henson), our lead, a gifted
mathematician and human computer trying to carve out a roll in the
Space Test Group. Second, Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), leader of the
"colored computers." She wants both the supervisor title she deserves
and to survive the transition to IBM's mechanical computers. Finally
Mary Jackson (Monae), who is trying to overcome discriminatory policies
to become NASA's first female engineer. These women must meet
challenges in the workplace then return home to more struggles
African-Americans were fighting nationwide. Having the performances to anchor your character drama goes along way.
Henson is solid, but Spencer is Oscar worthy and Monae's performance is
part of a spectacular 2016. I will be on the lookout for more from this
talent. Kudos to the supporting roles played by Ali and Costner. Beyond
the highlight performances, the scenario is well worth a shot. We have
seen heroes fighting against segregation. We have seen space race
movies. The mix presents America at its finest and most appalling. A
cute combo. The woman at the core are also very deserving of a chance
in the sun. The problems creep in with presentation. The
director/writer Melfi and co-writer Schroeder were clearly unsatisfied
with the quiet, real nobility with which these woman conducted
themselves. I cannot say if what the creators did is ethical, but the
addition of obviously manufactured drama was a damning decision. This
leads to some awkward trust issues. After watching some Hollywood like
Johnson erupting at her boss's boss, it becomes more difficult to
believe in the little things. Did Johnson really need to run a half a
mile just to use the restroom? Or even the climax. On the day of the
launch, did John Glenn trust Johnson's calculations over the IBM? It
turns out only one of these inclusions are factual. Not the one you
think, and perhaps the true story demonstrates more bravery. I'm not going to share any more of my digging here. Others asked the
same questions and the answers are readily available. The point is
after I watched Hidden Figures I wanted to learn if I had been lied
too. Sad, because doubts are not what stories this wonderful deserve.
Beyond this major stumble, Hidden Figures is well worth anyone's time.
Educational, but entertaining. Positive without preachy. Family
friendly in a genuine way. At the theater, I sat next to a nineish year
old who kept asking her mother questions. The daughter was interested
and wanted to follow every detail. The mother gave brisk answers not
wanting to miss a moment. That's a true event, I swear, and the best
praise for Hidden Figures I can muster.
