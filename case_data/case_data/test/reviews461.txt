Looks Like any Tom Cruise's Usual Flick

After being seriously wounded in Afghanistan, the Marine Jack Ryan
(Chris Pine) is recovered by Dr. Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley) and
they move in together. Jack is recruited by agent Thomas Harper (Kevin
Costner) to join the CIA as analyst infiltrated in Wall Street to check
possible terrorist accounts and he can not tell that he works for the
CIA even for Cathy. Three years later, Jack finds unusual movements in
the account of the Russian Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Jack is
assigned to go to Russia with Harper to investigate Cherevin. Out of
the blue, Cathy appears in his hotel room in the middle of a dangerous
operation. Now Cathy has to be involved in the espionage game. "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" is another absurd movie with a shallow
story and the usual exaggeration. In this movie, the efficiency of the
American secret service is amazing while Russians are depicted as
stupid. The plot and the action scenes look like any Tom Cruise's usual
flick, where he is the best agent of the world. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Operação Sombra - Jack Ryan" ("Shadow Operation - Jack
Ryan")
