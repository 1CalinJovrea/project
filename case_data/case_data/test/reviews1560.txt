Pretentious . . .

And a waste of a talented cast. Really, if you're not a "beautiful
people" New York socialite with literary pretensions (with a great
beach house in the Hamptons and a designer wardrobe) you'll be hard
pressed to find anything you can relate to in the movie. All you need
do is look at the box office numbers posted on IMDb to see the film
appealed to an audience numbered probably only in the hundreds, all
living within 150 miles of Manhattan. In spite of all the under-stated
yet conspicuous wealth depicted on screen I wonder if anyone involved
got paid given the movie's almost non-existent receipts. Don't bother
with this. It's a real yawner with zero wide audience appeal.
