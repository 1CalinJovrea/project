Fantastic Visuals, No Logic

While Doctor Strange should be praised for its' amazing visuals and CGI
effects, the movie is filled with a less than logical plot line and
various plot holes, such as Doctor Strange throwing people into portals
while they still have their Sling Rings, not using his cape in many
various scenes with which it would have been extremely useful, being
accepted quickly and without test into the temple simply because of his
"dedication", and Strange being able to master the art of sorcery
better than the dozen or so other sorcerers, who are almost completely
ignored in all of the action scenes throughout the movie, while Strange
is shown as extremely skilled and powerful at his newly learned skill.This movie is for the circle-jerking Marvel fans that take shallow
actions sequences and expensive visuals over a good plot. This movie
does not have a shred of logic after the first 20 minutes, completely
ignoring it for the purpose of looking dope and having intense fights.
