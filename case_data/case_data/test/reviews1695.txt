Pretty much everything you'd expect from it's title!

'SCOUTS GUIDE TO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE': Four Stars (Out of Five)A teen/horror-comedy 'zombie flick'; dealing with three scouts, taking
on a zombie apocalypse, in their hometown. The film was directed by
Christopher Landon (who also helmed 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY: THE MARKED
ONES'); and it was written by Landon, Carrie Evans, Emi Mochizuki and
Lona Williams. It stars Tye Sheridan (of 'THE TREE OF LIFE' and 'MUD'
fame), Logan Miller, Joey Morgan, Sarah Dumont, Halston Sage, Patrick
Schwarzenegger, Cloris Leachman and David Koechner. The film is pretty
much everything you'd expect, from it's title; and it does it's job
perfectly.The story revolves around three high school sophomores, that are also
the only scouts in their small town. Ben (Sheridan) and Carter (Miller)
feel like they're getting too old, to still be scouts; while their
other best friend, Augie (Morgan), is still proud to wear the uniform.
On the night of their last camp-out together, Ben and Carter decide to
ditch Augie; to go to a secret senior party. Then the boys all realize,
that their town has been taken over by zombies; and their scout
training actually comes in handy. So does the help of a beautiful
stripper, named Denise (Dumont), who bought the boys alcohol; earlier
that day. The movie is filled with sex, violence, nudity, crude jokes, and lots
of foul language; everything teen boys, the age of scouts, like (too
bad they can't get into theaters, to see it though). Thankfully the
movie went straight to VOD, just 17 days after it left mainstream
cinema (as part of a studio experiment). The film is great 'juvenile
male-bonding fun'; everything I liked as a kid, growing up. The movie
even has a positive message about friendship (over popularity, and
coolness) hidden in there, somewhere. It's a lot of fun!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
