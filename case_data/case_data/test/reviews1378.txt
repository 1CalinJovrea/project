XXL is XX Lame

I totally loved the first Magic Mike and the first 5 minutes of XXL
looked good too. But after those first 5 minutes....XXL suddenly turned
into one long improv show - The sort of improv done by people with
fabulous bodies and no sense of humor whatsoever - The sort of improv
where audience members shout out topics like "Frozen Yogurt" or "A
boring person sits next to you on a bus and just won't shut up." After
a while I felt sorry for the actors who seemed to try so hard to come
up with something, anything, to say, while growing more and more
resentful as in "Hey - we're strippers, not writers. Do we have to do
everything?" And the dancing this time? Yuck. I even felt sorry for the female
audience members in the dance sequences. Imagine that you are just out
for a fun bachelorette party, when you suddenly find yourself thrust 6
feet in the air with your "bachelorette parts" strapped across some
strange guy's face and then the guy starts doing somersaults and
cartwheels. Ouch.I left about 3/4ths of the way through. It was just all too sad.
