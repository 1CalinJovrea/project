Save your sanity

I have been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan since Sixth Sense his movies
are usually good. with great plots, good acting. but after Signs
Shyamalan you went nuts or something cause the movies you have put out
have been completely absurd. I made the mistake of reading into the
reviews and got excited that M. Night Shyamalan has returned to form.
HAHAHA the jokes on me I actually spent money on this retarded movie.
by the way You forgot to expound on why the effects of dementia only
come after 9:30PM? or maybe you did and that was one of the many parts
I fell asleep. what about what was the connection to the psychiatric
hospital? were they neighbors? if it was a small town as you suggest
then everyone would know everyone and more than one person would come
looking for the elderly couple. Sixth Sense awesome, Unbreakable was
great, signs OK, the village stupid, lady in the water stupid, the
happening even stupider, last air bender OK, the devil OK, after earth
OK, the visit was just stupid, the twist, a child can guess. M. Night
Shyamalan this is last time I will fall for your nonsense. I will never
again pay for a movie of yours.
