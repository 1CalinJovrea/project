I Hate Bad Romance Movies

Every-time I watch a romance movie I'm going to either really love it
or really hate it. This movie is one of those examples.1. The characters are so bland and forgettable. They don't learn
anything from there experience. All I know about the main guy is that
he rides bulls and that's it. The lead girl is into art and nothing
else. Alan Alda is old with letters and that's all we know about him.
Every character is just a one character description. 2. The story has too many coincidences and questions. What was his
health problem that injured him so badly? Why does her family take her
to the bull rides? Why did the guy promise to quit bull riding but only
after he won the championship? Plus the coincidences are over the top.
The elderly mans wife happened to be an artist like the main girl, his
wife had issues with him going to war kind of like the bull riding with
the two leads, the wife also had difficulties in their relationship
just like the leads, she collects art just like the main girl etc.3. The romance is so dull and bleak to watch. After maybe five weeks of
knowing each other she gets into a fight with him saying: how can you
do this when I've given up every thing for you? I'm sorry but you've
had an on and off relationship with him for five weeks. You shouldn't
plan ahead with him in a life when you've hardly known him. Most of the
time they talk it's exposition dialog that doesn't improve their
characters so they can know each other.This movie is just every example of a bad romance movie. No chemistry
of romance with the leads, no character development with anyone in
general, unanswered questions, too many coincidences and overall it
feels five times longer than it actually is with it's awful pacing. The
opening to UP is more romantic than this.Just watch Am√©lie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or The
Princess Bride. Those are better romances than this mess.
