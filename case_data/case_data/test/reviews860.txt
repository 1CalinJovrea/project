Worth an easy 8/10 - Pro gun folk are manipulating it

So many users are getting their knickers in a twist. They are giving
this excellent movie with great twists a low rating because the story
is about gun law, and sides with, yes you guessed it, anti gun
lobbyists. All the 1/10s own a gun lol.It's actually not about gun law at all. Gun law has only been used as
the subject of the day, to put the point across about dirty politicians
and lobbyists.This movie is terrific. It's complicated at the start, but soon starts
to make sense.The main character is terrific. Cold, hard and calculating. Great job!I can't say anymore because I never include spoilers. Just trust me.Whether you're for or against guns, that's not the point. This is a
political thriller folks. Sit back, relax and enjoy it!BTW....it's not a true story. Don't take it so seriously.8/10
