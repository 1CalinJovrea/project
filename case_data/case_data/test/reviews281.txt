nothing like inspector calls

if i had to summarize this film into 2 sentences they would be - 'i want my cake and i also want that other cake' 'i'm constantly whining about how crappy everyone is, why does no one
like me?'next to nothing actually happened in the film apart from her father
dying, which had no real impact on what happened.also why does she dress strange, then act exactly the same as everyone
else, whilst holding contempt for them? bad film.also everything was too clean and jolly
