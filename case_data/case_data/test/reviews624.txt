Nostalgic, Fully Of Potty Talk, And Incredibly Hilarious, "Captain Underpants" Is Major Loads Of Fun

"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie" is a movie that is finally
released that is based off the book series of the same name by Dav
Pilkey and is about two fourth graders named George and Harold who are
troublemakers in their school and are often ridiculed by their mean
principal Mr. Krupp. When they decide to hypnotize Mr. Krupp into
thinking he is the superhero Captain Underpants, a superhero the boys
created in their homemade comic books, chaos and mayhem then ensues. I remember reading these books in elementary school. They were always
sold at our seasonal book fairs, and because it was a Catholic
elementary school, they eventually got banned and were deemed
inappropriate. Captain Underpants was a big part of my childhood, and
though I never finished reading the series as I got too old to continue
with the series, I have always been fond of the series and one day want
to go back and re-read the books. The movie certainly helped with this.
This is a movie that could've been either really good or really bad.
Luckily, it was really good.This movie, like the books, is very self-aware. It knows it's a movie.
The characters know that, and break the fourth wall constantly. This
worked because by doing so it stuck to the source material. The books
constantly broke the fourth wall and were very self-aware that they
were books as well. If the movie didn't have that element, then this
movie would not have worked as well as it did. That is a key component
from the books that I think has to be in the movie, especially to play
up the laughs. The animation is very smooth as well. No technical problems with the
animation in this movie as far as I am concerned. It is a very
beautiful, colorful looking movie. This movie isn't a straight adaptation of the first book. The villain
in this movie is Professor Poopypants, probably the most iconic Captain
Underpants villain in the books, and that's what I liked. You give the
most iconic villain from the book series a plot to work with that is
similar to his own book that it felt so nostalgic that it was great. It
was full of potty talk which was great. I know that is a complaint for
many people with these types of movie, but listen, you have to stick to
the source material, and the source material had a lot of "potty" talk.
It had to be in here. There is a sequence from the books called
"Flip-O-Rama" that is a prominent staple in the books and it somehow
made its way into the movie and was awesome!This is nostalgic fun, full of potty talk, with smooth animation that
has laughs for kids and adults alike. I am going to give Captain
Underpants an A.
