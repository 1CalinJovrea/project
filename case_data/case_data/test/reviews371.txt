Bad

Worst movie. The opening had promise with Russell Crowe as Jor-El
sending his son on his journey. The minimal dialogue revealed very
little about the characters. Even Lois Lane is a shadow of her former
self, with longing looks and not much of the spunk we expect from her
character. Where is the fun news room banter? The entire project is
based on computer graphics explosions and destruction. They destroy
building after building after building, gas station, supermarket,
skyscraper, until you are just bored with the repetitive plot. It is
terrible. The fighting is a blur and Superman is just not his super
self. Don't waste your money unless you are a young male looking for a
movie that looks like a video game. I am so disappointed that they made
an awful Superman movie. If you like anything besides violent fights
and explosions, you'll be bored to tears. Save your money for the next
Spiderman, Bat Man or Iron Man movie.
