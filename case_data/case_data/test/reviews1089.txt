Remarkable

(I'll take off one point for Abbie Cornishe's bizarre portrayal of Kate
Adie.) This is how it's done. If you want to see a cartoon watch "London has Fallen." Reality is complicated and bad guys are three dimensional. Sometimes
real-life operations don't involve constant gunplay. Well, not if you
want the good guys to actually survive. Good movie for grown- ups.
