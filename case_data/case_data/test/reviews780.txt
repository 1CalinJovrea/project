Great thriller and true to Vince Flynn's character, Mitch Rapp

I was looking forward to this film, given that I'm a big fan of Vince
Flynn's "Mitch Rapp" franchise. The film's portrayal of young Mitch
Rapp was true to his character in the books, as was his mentor Stan
Hurley. Michael Keaton gave a powerful, great performance as Stan
Hurley, and Dylan Obrien is a born action star, as Mitch Rapp. I loved
it and look forward to more of this franchise.
