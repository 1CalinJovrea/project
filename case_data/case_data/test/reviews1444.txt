Average, more style than substance

Overall I enjoyed this movie but I think it was more style than
substance. The direction and visuals were excellent - it's possibly
worth watching the movie solely for them, especially if that's your
kind of thing. The aerial ballet and art exhibit scenes in particular
(which you get a hint of in the trailer) were stunning. It's a
well-made movie with a sufficient budget.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say it reminded me of
Knowing and Twelve Monkeys - however, compared to those two movies, the
stakes felt rather low and the mystery was never particularly
compelling, on top of being a little too predictable. I always felt I
knew the general direction it was heading, even if I didn't have all
the details yet.
