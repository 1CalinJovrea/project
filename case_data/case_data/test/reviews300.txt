A Gentle, Almost Say Anything

Sundance-darling "The Spectacular Now" is a curious one. With a script
by the guys who wrote "500 Days of Summer", the movie is about as
slice- of-life as they come, and it is interesting and well-acted. As the film unspools, it may subconsciously remind viewers of the
imperfect messiness of Cameron Crowe's teen ode "Say Anything" -
complete with a Cusack-like performance by Miles Teller. Teller's Sutter character is smooth, confident, charming, occasionally-
unlikable and flawed. It's an accomplished balancing act. The centerpiece performance is really Shailene Woodley, as Sutter's new
girlfriend Aimee. She gives the most natural performance of a teenager
on screen in ages. Her unaffected, open assignment elevates every scene
she's in. Both performances are in service of a film that drifts through the
senior high students' last weeks before the end of high school, and
takes a mutedly-pessimistic approach of the future before our two
leads. These two kids are invisibly shackled to their town, in their
home life, their pasts. Echoing the crux at the centre of 1989's "Say
Anything", Aimee figures an escape plan; Sutter seems to be blindly
comfortable in his 'spectacular' now.Pulling "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" alum Jennifer Jason-Leigh into
the film as Sutter's world-worn mother was a nice touch. Her
vacant-eyed mother is in keeping with the film's less-glamorous take.The picture labours a bit too much in over-emphasizing Sutter's crutch,
and the mid-film scenes visiting Sutter's estranged father had trouble
finding the right tone between character and caricature. The movie
doesn't feel any urgency to build to a conclusion, but when it does, it
is understated, uneventful - kind of like our two characters, and sort
of like real-life, too.Life is messy, as is "The Spectacular Now". It eschews the studio
slickness and over-plotted determination of more polished teenage
products. Despite two grounded, award-worthy lead performances, this
film seemed a touch sketched and ever-so-slightly inert.
