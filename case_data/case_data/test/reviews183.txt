Essentially Boring

If you have a penchant for pornography, this is for you. It delivers a
convoluted and essentially meaningless plot that seems to have been
constructed merely for the presentation of the sex scenes. It presents
devious men who misuse and abuse women, but it reveals more about
devious women who misuse and abuse each other. The movie is beautifully
filmed, but not so well edited. The actors (pornstars?) are good at
their trade; however, they portray women in a negative wayÂ—as
self-obsessed sex objects.
