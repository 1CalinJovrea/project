Disappointment

I look at "Logan" as the "Alien 3" of the X-Men franchise. It basically
gives a gigantic middle finger to everything that came before it. It
destroys everything the movie that proceeded it ("Days of Future Past")
accomplished. In "DOFP", all of mutant kind are about to be destroyed,
but by the heroic actions of Logan himself, they survive. Then,
according to the film "Logan", they all get killed off a few years
later anyways. It has been said that one of the big themes of "Logan"
was disappointment. I agree. I was very disappointed in this film."Logan" is annoyingly low on information. We are thrown into this
terribly depressing future without a whole lot of explaining as to how
we got here. As I watched, I kept waiting for a scene where things were
laid down for the audience. It never came. The best we got were a few
vague references here and there. There was something called "The
Westchester Incident", but the reference was so fleeting that I barely
caught it. There was also another part near the end where the main
villain claims that he had something to do with the lack of new mutants
being born and that he is Striker's son? I think? It wasn't very clear
plus the dude's last name wasn't actually Striker, which further
confused the issue. Later on, I hopped online and had a few things
clarified (such as the "Westchester Incident"), but why weren't they
clearer in the film in the first place?Another issue I have with this film is how it treats the deaths of its
two main characters. First, with Xavier, he is stabbed unceremoniously
by a clone of Logan about two-thirds the way through the movie. There
are no heroics in this death, no greater purpose, no meaning. He's just
stabbed and then dies. What a disservice to such an incredible and
important character to this franchise. Then there is Logan's death. Logan is impaled by a chunk of wood from a
dead tree. The dude literally has a skeleton made out of adamantium,
which is the world's most indestructible metal, but yet wood cuts right
through it. What? Now, we are shown through the film that Logan is sick
and his ability to heal is getting worse, but that shouldn't affect his
crazy metal ribcage! They even go to great lengths to explain that the
only thing that can really kill him is an adamantium bullet, but in the
end a hunk of wood does just as well.Then there is the "R" rating. Once again, if this were a true
stand-alone movie and not part of a larger narrative, I'd mostly be OK
with it. But of course it isn't. Everything that we got with the "R"
rating was unnecessary. What we got was far more blood and gore (there
was more than one decapitation), a dump truck full of f-bombs and even
one scene where a woman in a bridal shower flashed her boobs. All of
this could have been edited out and the film would have been fine.Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I've seen plenty of violent movies,
heard plenty of f- bombs and seen plenty of nakedness on film. I'm fine
with it, but it has to be there for a good reason. I didn't see a whole
lot of good reason here. What really did it for me, though, was seeing
a 10-11 year old girl running around slashing off people's body parts.
That got to be a bit much for my taste and I began to wonder for whom
that kind of stuff didn't bother? Once again, does our society have a
bit of a violence fetish, one that has gotten so bad that watching
children tear people to shreds is OK? I think the reason for the rating has more to do with a popular trend
in movies (especially comic book movies) nowadays than it does with
serving this particular story. With the success of "Deadpool" last
year, film studios realized that an R-rated super hero film is not only
possible, but profitable. But as Malcolm hinted at in the movie
"Jurassic Park", just because you CAN do a thing doesn't mean that you
SHOULD. For "Deadpool" it works. You can't do "Deadpool" without all
that R-rated stuff. That is who "Deadpool" is and that's fine. With
Wolverine, however, he's already been established throughout the
previous 8 X-Men films. All of these R-rated "upgrades" now don't make
a whole lot of sense.When I read positive reviews for this film, the main point that is made
is how good the dramatic performances are, especially from the two
leads, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman. In this case, I completely
agree. They did a fantastic job. Even the little girl was amazing, I
thought. That can be quite a rarity when you think about how hit and
miss child actors are. However, even though most of the performances
here are top notch, great performances do not a great film make. If the
story sucks, what does it matter? It is hard for me to imagine why Patrick Stewart or Hugh Jackman would
be excited to work on a project like "Logan" once they read the script.
Were they excited to basically negate all of the great work they did
(and others did) in the previous X-Men films? They, better than anyone
else, should understand what this whole series has been about since the
beginning. Yes, "Logan" is unique and absolutely gave these actors
something different to do with their characters. And yes, they gave
stellar performances. However, there needs to be at least a little bit
of respect for the source material (and its fans) than this. Much like
the season premier of "The Walking Dead" this past fall, this seemed
more like a kick in the pants for viewers than anything else.
