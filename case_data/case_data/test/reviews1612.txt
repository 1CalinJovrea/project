An excellent satire on showbiz

Every once in a while, there comes a movie that really invigorates
someone with its performances, story, and direction. Birdman is one of
those films that just delivers on all forms to bring a unique
experience. While that sounds like over the top praise, I feel like
this film will be heralded as a classic as the years fly on by.Good: I love the story for this film as it encompasses pretty much
everything that comes along with being in the entertainment world
whether it is Hollywood or Broadway. It talks about the plight former A
list actors have with trying to stay relevant, the over saturation of
superhero movies and how every major actor seems to be a part of one,
the battle between big budget movies against indie films, an actor's
need for either credibility or box office draw, and the infiltration of
Hollywood into Broadway among many other topics. It balances all of
these subjects with grace and it never feels disjointed. Add to that
the very meta and excellent performance by Michael Keaton, a hilarious
turn from Edward Norton, a career best for Emma Stone, a revelatory one
from Zach Galifianakis, and a great supporting cast helps makes the
beautiful chaos on screen work. Then there's the direction which is
marvelous how the movie seamlessly looks like it was shot in one take.
Fantastic editing involved along with beautiful cinematography with
some breathtaking shots. Overall, this is one fantastic dissection of the entertainment industry
without feeling pretentious and having a lot of fun doing it.
