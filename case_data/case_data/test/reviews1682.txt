The definitive Les Miserables movie experience!

As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of
Les Miserables, let me categorically state that this time it was done
right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was
borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a
negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is, when
you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing
it into a feature length movie, some things will be cut or rushed. This
is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond
of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it, but people
new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off
by it.As far as the acting and music is concerned, I can find very little to
fault. Russel Crowe was the weakest of the lot as I just didn't find
his voice to be up to the task of singing some of Javert's songs (Stars
immediately springs to mind). Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Samantha
Barks were all especially good. The intense emotions their characters
experience throughout the story are perfectly performed.This naturally leads to a critique of the music. Anyone familiar with
the Broadway show will undoubtedly find themselves joyously mouthing
along to the familiar lyrics and might be surprised at a couple of
brand new songs written specifically for the movie. Just as in the
show, the music is brilliant and meshes wonderfully with the story.One of the biggest treats, however, were the sets and special effects.
The beauty and squalor of 19th century Paris was showcased
magnificently and it really allowed you to become engrossed in story.This is a movie that both fans of the novel as well as fans of the
musical can both fall in love with, since even though there are some
deviations from the novel this is still the closest a film version has
ever come to being completely faithful to the book. Additionally, this
movie is a perfect chance for those who have never read the book or
haven't heard of or had a chance to see the Broadway show. I
wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. My only warning is to
limit your fluid intake, since at 2.5+ hours your chance of
encountering an overflowing bladder is a very real danger.
