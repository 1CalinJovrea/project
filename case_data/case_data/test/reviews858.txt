OMG! Such an awesome film. A must watch..

I don't like to write reviews,also not much fan of sci-fi (but like
thrillers). Before watching the movie I read the user reviews on IMDb.
They amazed me and so did the movie! Its simply brilliant! No one can
imagine that superb thriller can be made in such a low budget. Great
concept, great storyline, great script, great execution. As many are
not happy with camera work (as its like found footage type), it wont
bother you as movie progresses,in fact it increases curiosity. Movie
keeps you guessing and predicting but does not allow you to win. Not
much twists, but last few twists are really good. Please watch for off
the road concept. It will surely amaze you. Hats off!!!
