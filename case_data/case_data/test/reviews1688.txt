Superb

I don't usually write reviews, this is more a reply to the negative
comments - because I'm a contentious little man. The plot has been criticised as non-existent and this simply isn't the
case...All you need to know is there's some kind of experiment going
on, could be a prelude to an invasion, but it doesn't matter - there's
plenty of research that has been done that isn't condoned (or known) by
the whole of society and well is the Alien society homogeneous and
united in cause? Hmmmm..see it would take an eon to get into all this
detail about the organising principles of another world and the plot
simply doesn't need it, neither do you: she's doing a job and leading a
life that she becomes deeply conflicted about and her desire for change
drives the plot within the crucible the poor Alien finds itself. Enjoy the wonderful soundtrack, sublime camera work, the eeriness and
Scarlet's stunning performance (all actors were great) and all the
nuances and themes. A film is the sum of its scenes and this one has
some excellent, excellent scenes. The visuals alone are to die for. The pace? The film I felt was excellently paced, with one small judder
at the cake part, but that's entirely minimal and I probably imagined
it.Scots have criticised the portrayal of Scots - it's not a tourist
commercial though is it... and isolation (on which she preys) is an
easy bed fellow of poverty and other difficulties. It just works.
Please see this excellent film, there is so much going on and it is
wonderfully dark and desolate.
