A nice, family-friendly ending to a half-way decent trilogy.

Once again, Steve Carell proves he's better at doing CGI voice-overs
than he is at live-action comedy.The movie begins with a retrospective news story about Balthazar Bratt;
an ex-child TV star gone bad (Holy Danny Partridge, Batman!). Followed
by the super-villainous, middle-aged version going after the world's
biggest diamond in the modern day. When Gru and Lucy fail to capture
him, however, it turns out that this is the _third_ such disastrous
confrontation.Result; termination of employment with extreme (though non-lethal)
prejudice.The rest of the film is like a cross between Disney's THE INCREDIBLES
and the Ah-nuld/Devito comedy TWINS. Carell does an admittedly good job
making Drew appear to be a more naive/less competent version of Old Gru
(the villainous one from the first film) simply by using a shriller
voice combined with wavy-blond CGI hair! So, who better to help him
overcome that handicap than his long-lost brother who once stole the
Moon, itself?Speaking of shrill voices; once again, the Minions are voiced--at
higher RPM's--by French executive producer Pierre Coffin. Although, the
sub-plot about their going to prison for loitering and trespassing
wasn't as hilarious as it could have been, I still got a kick out of
the French version of that old Gilbert and Sullivan classic, "The
Modern Major General."I also loved Julie Andrews' cameo "appearance" as the voice of Gru's
mother (now a cougar-ish dowager). Priceless!But, of course, what really stole the show (as in the first two films)
was the lovability of Little Agnes. This time, on the hunt for a
"really live unicorn."Add all of the above--plus some STAR WARS and Marx Brothers
references-- to a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, head-bobbing sound
track from the Eighties (back when MTV actually lived up to the name
"Music Television") and you've got another winner from
Sony/Illumination.
