Wrath of the Filmmakers

I'm one of the 3% of the population of Americans that actually enjoyed
the 2010 remake of "Clash of the Titans". It wasn't a masterpiece, in
fact, I wouldn't even call it good. But there was a charming simplicity
to it all. It involved generic characters getting from Point A to Point
B in an hour and a half. Sure, it was plagued with problems, but for
me, it's a serious guilty pleasure. But that's another review for
another time. The most glaring problem with "Wrath" is that it's essentially the same
thing as the first one, with a few tweaks here and there. Sam
Worthington plays Perseus. He's strong, powerful, and dull as a rock.
It's just Worthington's generic, bland good guy. He's not a terrible
role model, he's just not that particularly engaging. The only
character that's more boring is Queen Andromeda, played by Rosamund
Pike. These two characters share such an awful, contrived romance that
it makes Anakin and Padme from the Star Wars prequels look like Romeo
and Juliet.But, as I said before, this sequel is merely a re-tread of the first
movie. Sure, the first one was predictable, but at least it gave us a
bit of time to know each of the characters. Here, there's no
development because they just assumed you know these characters because
you watch the first movie. That's a problem I find many sequels running
into, and here, it really weakens it.The special effects here are used in a way that makes me want to
sterilize the people who came up with them. The filmmakers operate
under the impression that if you throw a ton of special effects onto
the screen, it will give your audience something to look at. The
problem with that logic is that the factors of character development
and motivation are canceled out by the pointless action sequences to
such a degree that the audience becomes bored by these fight scenes.
The special effects don't dazzle audience members like they did in the
past when they're used in such a repetitive fashion.With really bad movies like this, when all hope is lost, I try to focus
on the positive aspects of the film. And there are a few good things
found here. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Bill Nighy are pretty
entertaining as the gods of Mt. Olympus, and I do like that there is
some, though not a lot, of development with these guys. The movie sort
of touches on the messed up issues of family in Greek mythology, and it
was interesting. Whenever I found myself watching Sam Worthington and
his band of bland beatniks (try saying that five times fast), I was
wishing that I could be watching Liam Neeson and the others, because
they were interesting! Unfortunately, not even the awesome acting of
Liam Neeson can save this stinker, kind of how Optimus Prime couldn't
save the "Transformers" sequels.Final verdict: If you're a fan of rich cinematic genius like Citizen
Kane or 12 Angry Men, this is not your kind of movie. It's too long,
too forced, and too choppily edited. I'll admit, there were people in
the theater that watched it and seemed to get really invested, and if
you think you can, go ahead and watch it. For me, there were just too
many things that didn't add up for me to enjoy this one. I don't regret
seeing it, but repeat viewings are not in my future.
