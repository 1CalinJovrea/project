A good film but perhaps a bit over-rated

Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but I waited on and on for that
special thing that made it deserve eight stars over here and win so
much admiration all over the Internet, but it never arrives. Nothing
special happened really.Also, usually if they give a woman such a role they tend to show them
as strong and smart, but it was hugely disappointing to see Kate
literally play a cow, a weak, dumb woman who has nothing else to do
except giving curious looks! She is in a sense irrelevant to the film,
the story and everything undertaken by that FBI team. The only thing of
note that she does is almost having sex with a person from the enemy
group!
