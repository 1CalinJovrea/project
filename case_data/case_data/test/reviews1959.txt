Underrated Thriller

This movie is based on a best seller and features fine actors. Still it
doesn't seem to have gained the buzz I expected. Perhaps that's because people are expecting a horror film more than a
thriller. Yes, it's a bit of both. I would recommend the film and hope that it finds success.
