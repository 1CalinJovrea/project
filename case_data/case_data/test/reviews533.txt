Feeble Story, Fuzzy too dark cgi mess

This is a dreadful film. It is purely a badly done cgi movie. The
graphics were fuzzy and featured third rate monsters that have all had
parts in other films.Worse the cgi action did not look realistic and
this added to the overall failure.Apart from the fuzzy graphics the story was an abomination and an
insult to the memory of King Arthur. There was very little story and
the characters acted in such an unbelievable and clichéd fashion that
you tended to try and forget them as irrelevant to the excessive
computer violence.If you rate John Boormans's Excalibur as a 10 then this is a 0.0001There are better ways to spend £125 million
