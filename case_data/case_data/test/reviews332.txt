OMG! What a waste

I actually saw this film before reading any reviews about it because I
hate to go in to the theatre already knowing what people think... Since
seeing it though, I have read the reviews and I agree with the majority
of people who say that After Earth is crap...There is pretty much nothing that Will Smith has starred in that I
didn't like. I Robot, I am Legend, even Wild Wild West was
entertaining... Hell, I even liked him in Independence Day... But this?
I'm a huge Scifi fan but the story was totally pointless and
predictable, and the acting was terrible. I think Will Smith is worth a
lot more than being a cold hearted general/father with broken legs
talking into a radio. Wasted talent if you ask me. As for his son...
Maybe Jaden Smith will get better, one day... but so far, No. I hated
him in The Karate Kid and After Earth has just confirmed it for me. I
so much wanted one of the Animals to kill his character and be done
with it. All he did was run, jump and cry. Then a giant eagle
sacrifices herself to save him. WHY? What an utter joyless film on so
many levels.Seriously, I am not a Smith hater, I love his films and I expected a
decent film with After Earth even if it wasn't going to be a master
piece. I was so disappointed that next time Jaden Smith's name comes
up, I'll wait and read the reviews before going to see it. I wish I
could vote minus numbers. This was the worst film I've seen in a long
time.
