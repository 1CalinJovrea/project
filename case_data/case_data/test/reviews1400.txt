Amazingly awful

After reading the reviews here and hearing about the surprising success
of this film, I was eager to watch it. I love plots involving history
pieces as well as the possible paranormal. But as I started watching
this movie, I found myself praying that there was just a slow build.
Unfortunately, I found myself hoping for that up until the very end.
The characters were annoying at best. The various elements and ideas
introduced to move the plot along seemed to be only minimally explored.
The two worst characters in my opinion, were the twins who, from the
beginning, gave off an air that they could be evil. Yet when it is
confirmed that they had been talking to the devil via a farm animal,
the directors/writers still somehow maintained their characters as
innocent children. The sporadic intense sequences seemed more tragic
than spooky. And the ending was completely insane. A girl watches her
whole family get murdered and is scared half to death then instantly
decides that she wants to join a coven of naked floating women? Really?
I was extremely disappointed in this film and even more in the
misleading reviews on this site. I even double checked to make sure
that I had watched the same film as those reviewing. So now I am just
wondering if I can have those 2 hours of my life back...?
