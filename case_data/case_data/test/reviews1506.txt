Good mindless entertainment if you're trying to kill a few hours.

I'm the guy who can appreciate Ben Affleck's Daredevil as mindless
entertainment...so with that being said I'm not too hard to impress. I
liked this movie's concept...it's fun and engaging. The actors did a
good job with it for what it was. It's not an Oscar worthy movie by any
means, but if you're bored and you're looking for something to
mindlessly entertain you for a few hours this will do the trick. A
little far fetched at times with regards to the antagonist(s)...but
it's a good source of mindless entertainment. I've read people say it
tries to actually get into serious themes...if that's the case I missed
the memo cause I didn't really see any serious themes other than the
availability of information over the internet... I'd sort of go the other way with this and say it doesn't really take
itself too seriously...which I think is a good thing. I do feel like
the ending was a little meh and a little bit of a letdown...but I can't
think of a better way to end it off the top of my head so I really
shouldn't complain. This was an OK movie with a really good premise for
nerds like me.
