Underrated movie with Matthew McConaughey at his best!

I don't know why this movie has been underrated so much. It deserves at
least 8. If you liked Blow, or Wolf of Wall Street... this is just as
good! Maybe not so deep story, but still, amazing Matthew does what
he's supposed to.Don't follow the ratings and check this out!
