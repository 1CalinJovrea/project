Unbelievable...

For the budget and start power... This was a total waste of time.I so want to like and enjoy this movie... But I simply couldn't...Over the top acting...Unrealistic story line...Lousy interactions...Even the bad guys are terrible at being bad...Batman... Hahaha... Utterly crap and needs a new bat-suit... This is an
imitation Batman I need 10 lines but can't think of anything thing
remotely decent to say about this movie...Oh... Will Smith... Missed the disaster of independence day but crapped
out here instead...To anyone reading this...I implore you... don't waste your time and
money... Don't even watch it on TV for free... I'm certain you'll find
more joy watching grass grow...1.5 out of 10... Some OK explosions...
