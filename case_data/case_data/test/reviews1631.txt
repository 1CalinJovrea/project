This movie deserve an easy 7.5 rating on IMDb. Engaging and Compelling Thriller..

I think this movie deserves a better rating. Just because it shows the
reality doesn't make it an under appreciated movie. The cast is
perfect.There are many scenes where you would not take your eyes off
for a moment. This movie has a compelling story and some thrills, that
is why I would recommend to watch this flick. Good Luck.
