The Time is Just Right for this Remake

I'm pushing 60. I've been a fan of the original Three Stooges for
almost my whole life. Got all the DVDs. Read most of the books. In all
that time, I have seen many imitators of all 6 Stooge-members,
including Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp, Joe Besser and Curly Joe deRita. In
these guys (Hayes, Sasso & Diamondapoulos), I've never seen anyone come
nearly as close to the original Larry Curly & Moe. And that includes
the three actors who portrayed the boys in the 2000 TV-movie bio-pic.
But it isn't just that. It's the Writing and Directing of the Farrelly
brothers here that really does the trick. The funniest things the
original comedy trio did were the rapid-fire slapping, poking and
punching, set to hilariously beautiful sound-effects. That is all
presented here, perhaps even more often than in the original short
films of the '30s & '40s. The time is just right for all this. This is
another nostalgia trip for baby-boomers like me and so many others
today. Presented in the form of one continuous 90-minute story divided
into three 30-minute "short films," even the pace is perfect. I was a
little leary of the brothers' apparent "need" to include Jersey Shore
cast-members into the film, but that decision turned out okay. Loved
this hilarious, fast-paced comedy film. ***1/2 out of ****
