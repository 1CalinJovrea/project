A little gem of a movie about goals and personal growth

Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it
for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could
possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican
border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.At first, it's hard to understand Cheryl, she definitely does not
strike you as a someone who could do this. She bit off more than she
can shew, it's clearly naive of her. But as Cheryl is struggling on her
hike flashbacks of her life before the Pacific Crest Trails are
peppered throughout the movie and like anyone you're getting to know
she starts to make sense. You get to understand what she's been
through, who she is, and what motivated her to do this. It's a
challenge that she brought on herself for herself, something she
needed.And just like that a 115 minutes passes, during which you were taken on
physical and soul searching journey with amazing landscapes, and a
flawed but strong woman. Reese Witherspoon carries that film
beautifully, she layered her performance with sensibility and a quiet
strength that suited the character. I didn't totally relate to Cheryl
but I wasn't completely impervious to her ordeal, I also have dreams
and life-goals to achieve.On a side note, it was recently pointed out to me I had never seen Wild
as the female lead version of Into The Wild. I've never finished Sean
Penn & Emile Hirsh's hiking movie but from what I remember Into The
Wild was much more wild and raw the dude wasn't on a hiking trail but
in the wilderness. These two movies only compare in the drives these
two characters have to undertake their journey.Wild is a beautiful movie about personal growth and living in one's
truth. @wornoutspines
