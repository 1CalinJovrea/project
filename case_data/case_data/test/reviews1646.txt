A good movie, an okay book adaptation

I have read the book before the movie came out, but ill give a movie
review separate from my book ideals of what it should have been.As a movie on its own, its good. Not great. They have a little bit of
action, and when i say little, i do mean little (under 5 minutes).
There are some chrome vehicles, modern looking bland clothing etc. This
movie is really about what makes us human. With a love triangle. Not
nearly as dominant as it was in twilight. A very interesting premise
for a movie. The acting was great, I really loved Jake Abel as Ian
O'Shea. Dian kruger added some depth to her seeker attitude. Max Irons
I found to be the weakest actor of the bunch, some of his lines were
delivered poorly ("so help me"), but what really ties the cast in is
William Hurt.He ties them all together, and ads some charm to his
clich√© lines that makes him very likable. Other noticeable actors were
Scot Lawrence (Doc) and Francis Fisher (Maggie), but neither were given
the screen time needed to develop any sort of charter, although it
would have been ve3ry interesting to see. Nice scenery, and nice shots.
The music (and some scene lacking) was great and added a indie touch to
it.Now, based off the book this movie kinda blew it. it was extremely
different, cutting out characters and adding things that never were. I
personally felt that by making all the Aliens dress the same, drive the
same vehicles took away from the depth of the battle between the
resistance and aliens. They were supposed to be creative, and find
individualism in human hosts, which was very lacking. Instead the movie
went in the direction of aliens turning humans into one mass of boring
un unique sheep. I also wish they had kept a few of Wanda's experiences
from other worlds in the movie, even as flash backs etc. This movie
lacked as a sci-fi, as all we see are humans with contacts. It lacked
as a romance as her love interest was gone for most of it.If anything its a good movie about : "what is considered human? a and
how shall we react that makes us human".Not bad, i enjoyed it anyways, and my husband actually stuck around to
watch it too lol./
