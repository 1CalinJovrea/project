Compelling Premise Becomes Preposterous

"The Hunt," the latest from Thomas Vinterberg, takes a compelling
premise but pushes its credibility, and its audience's patience, so far
that any impact the film might have had is blunted under the weight of
its preposterousness.Mads Mikkelsen plays a kindergarten teacher who is accused by a little
girl of exposing himself to her. We know from the start he's not
guilty, and that the girl says what she does out of a combination of
confusion and anger. But as soon as the idea is planted in the heads of
the teachers and parents, they use it to go on a witch hunt with one
person as their target.Watching the film is sort of like watching a car accident in slow
motion. We see one bad decision pile itself on top of another, and a
situation that could have easily (or at least more efficiently) been
resolved instead turn into a spiraling nightmare. The problem is that
the events in the film don't make any sense (or at least didn't to this
American viewer). The kindergarten teacher who first hears of the
allegations decides to call in the mom of the little girl, tell her
that her daughter may have been molested, and then says there isn't
anything else to discuss at that moment in time!! And the mom accepts
that!!! And then the teacher announces at that evening's parent/teacher
night that all of their children might also have been molested, and
hands out informational pamphlets!!!! And none of the parents ask any
questions!!!!!! Maybe there's a cultural disconnect, but I can't
imagine parents in any country handling this situation in the way it's
portrayed in this film.And the implausibilities just add up from there. A much more effective
and interesting film would have found people following proper
procedures and still not being able to shake their inherent knee-jerk
prejudices. But an incident like the one in this film, or any incident
for that matter, is of course going to get out of control if everyone
acts as crazy as they do in this movie. The film manipulates its
characters into doing things that it doesn't seem plausible people
would actually do, just to make a point. That's called building up a
straw man argument, which are famous for being able to knock down.Perhaps Vinterberg means for his film to be morbidly funny, a black
comedy of the absurd. But if so, he doesn't handle the material well
enough to make that clear. He invites us to scratch our heads in
disbelief at how poorly people can behave, but doesn't make those
people's behavior believable enough for us to care.Grade: B-
