Who doesn't love Bobby DeNiro?

Wonderful contemporary story, great acting. What more can one ask for?
DeNiro totally inhabits the role of a bored NewYorker retiree who
quietly, commandingly changes everyone around him for the better. There
were little bits of sentimental predictability but not many. Nothing
slowed the pace for long. It was lovely to see ageism front and center,
blasted to smithereens! Subtle, believable performances that did not
pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them. The boys "road
trip" was hilarious. The "boys" themselves were presented as
stereotypes but managed to imbue them with personality. There were some
great laugh out loud moments! Nicely cast, well-written plot and
characters. Go see it! Especially if you are over 60!
