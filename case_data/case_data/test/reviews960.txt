One of the Greatest movies i watched in my entire life.

I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them really
have a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He really
know how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans who
have followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during the
entire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto's
older works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki's
spirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better than
spirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his own
stunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard? Even
Spirited Away, When Marnie was There, and 5cm per second can't do that.
This is a movie that you must watch before you die, really.
