Amazing movie, a step ahead from modern movies of the genre

I watched The Evil Dead many years ago, and I loved it and when it
comes to remakes, I always try to watch them with an open mind, not
ignoring its positive points just because I like the original better,
after all, they are not going to cease to exist, but some people just
can't do just that, and that seems to me as the biggest problem that
people showed with Evil Dead.Spoilers ahead!!Starting with an interesting, but not much relevant opening, Evil Dead
show to the audience what to expect from the movie, right from the
beginning. After the title, we are introduced to the five central
characters. We see Mia suffering with the abstinence, David trying to
do something to bound with his sister after leaving her with the dying
mother, Eric being angry with David for the same reason as Mia, Olivia
trying to do her best to make her friend go through hell and Natalie
doesn't do sh*t.All hell breaks loose when Eric reads the words wrote in the book that
they found in the basement (a normal act drove by curiosity, not an
dumb thing like many people point at) and the demon awakes in an
amazing sequence, the camera rising from the woods and rapidly moving,
changing from Mia walking in circles in the rain and Eric reading the
words one by one, until the demon finale reaches the cabin.When I first walked in the theater to watch Evil Dead, I expected a
gore fest, limbs flying everywhere and some interesting death scenes,
that's all. The film has all that but not just it, the tension is hold
from beginning to end, and you really get nervous during the entire
show, like in the famous Tree rape scene that this time isn't explicit
like in the original and yet is much more shocking.The acting is also great, Jane Levy as Mia (and here I should say how
much I loved her) and Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric are amazing, Jessica
Lucas is also very good, but she doesn't gets much screen time.
Elizabeth Blackmore could be pointed as a bad actress but in reality,
the script doesn't allow her to do much, that being said, she is the
most useless character in the movie. Shiloh Fernandez is bland and
didn't quite deliver the David that I hoped from the script.In the technical department, Evil Dead shows the combination of all the
good things in a movie, the score from Roque Baños is nothing less than
brilliant, the make-up is astonishing and even if the Deadites may
resemblance a little too much with Regan from "The Exorcist" they feel
very organic. But the thing that surprised most about the film is the
photography, the landscape in the beginning, the shots from outside the
cabin, the blood rain, the contrast between the dark from the scenario
and Jane Levy scarlet red dress looks absolutely beautiful.Evil Dead is an amazing movie, it isn't the perfect one, but it doesn't
want to be it. Pointed by many to have "dumb script" (like the horror
movies in its most, or even the original The Evil Dead had a great one
¬¬) that actually diverges a lot from the genre. We see the family
issue, the subtle correlation between the drugs and the demon
possession for Mia, and the distance from clichés. A friendly advice,
fans of the genre should stop smashing the movie just because of their
love for the original, if you can do this, you may actually enjoy one
of the most amazing horror movies released in quite some time.And for the ones that say "this is just a gore fest with no history
whatsoever" or like someone wrote in a review I read here "this is Evil
Dead for the Xbox generation", just for the fact you don't like a
movie, it doesn't mean this is the "Worst movie of our Generation",
grow up!Evil Dead is one of the most terrifying movie you will ever experience
