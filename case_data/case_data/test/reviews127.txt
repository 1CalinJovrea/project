Indie Film Perfection

Beyond Immpressive!! Being a big fan of both Game of Thrones and Penny
Dreadful (both leads are from each respectively), I was immediately
attracted to Leigh Janiak's Honeymoon. What an amazing indie film, with
equally memorable dramatic and terrifying moments, the suspense holds
you all the way through. Although the story is somewhat familiar, but
the execution is first rate. Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway kept me
mesmerized the whole 90 minutes. Janiak's direction of these stars is
highly commendable. I can honestly say this MUCH better than the
average swill that comes to theaters these days. Looking forward to
future films from this director!
