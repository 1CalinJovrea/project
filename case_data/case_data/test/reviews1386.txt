A competent, thoughtful drama from Tim Burton that could do with a little more of the director's trademark whimsy.

Tim Burton has crafted quite a reputation as a director of the surreal
and the macabre. In his films, he conjures up dark, Gothic images of
death and despair, but suffuses them with his special brand of
bittersweet magic and whimsy. On the surface, Big Eyes is right up his
alley - this true story of the fiercest and most outrageous copyright
battle in art history centres on a series of big-eyed waifs, almost
ghostly figures of hope and horror that fit perfectly into Burton's
aesthetic. And yet, barring a few scenes, the final film is curiously
characterless: a competently-made, shrewdly- cast biopic that never
quite troubles the heart or spirit the way Burton's films can do.Margaret (Amy Adams) is trying to scrape together a living for herself
and her young daughter when she meets Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), a
charismatic real-estate broker who would rather make a name for himself
as an artist. He offers her a home, love and financial security, and
she quite happily takes his surname as her own. Once they are married,
Walter keeps trying to break into the notoriously snobby art world,
selling his own Parisian landscapes and Margaret's portraits of wistful
young girls with enormous eyes. But it's her art - simply signed as
'Keane' - that grabs the attention and, as one white lie leads to
another, Margaret suddenly finds herself shoved into the background.
Walter has taken credit for her work, and is well on his way to
transforming it into a global phenomenon.There are many big ideas swirling around in Big Eyes: art, deceit,
integrity, commercialism and love are shaken liberally and stirred
through with deeper issues of sexism and psychological abuse. This
comes through pretty well in the film, which paints a chilling picture
of Margaret's enforced anonymity. As her husband delights in dominating
newpaper headlines and picking fights with famed art critics like John
Canaday (Terence Stamp), she fades almost literally into the background
- creating ever more pieces of art for him in the solitude of her attic
studio, lying even to her daughter about her life's work. The film also
draws a canny, subtle distinction between the artist and the
businessman: Walter may not be much of the former, but his skills as
the latter are what drag Margaret's work from county fairs onto the
international stage.Through it all, Burton exercises a light - almost impersonal - touch.
He scatters a few scenes into the film that hint at his trademark
film-making style: Margaret bumps into a crass supermarket display of
her art, and suddenly everyone around her sports the limpid, haunting
eyes of the waifs no one knows are hers. But, for the most part, Burton
keeps himself out of the proceedings. It's proof that he can create
nightmares on a more subtle and realistic level, capturing the darker
side of life as it can be rather than as he imagines it. Occasionally,
however, the film begs the question whether he should - it's stuffy and
dry, never quite engaging either the heart or the imagination.That's through no fault of his cast. Adams anchors Big Eyes with an
astounding portrayal of a complex woman: one who's willing to cast off
the chains of her first marriage, only to wind up tangled in the snare
of another. It would be easy to play Margaret as a victim, but Adams
finds the bitter strength in someone who must endure untold torment in
a world and home that constantly remind her she's too weak to succeed
on her own. Waltz's performance, on the other hand, is puzzling - he
plays Walter in the constant key of manic, right from the start, so
that the character's smooth, smug charm is all you ever see of the man.
There is something undeniably delicious, though, about Waltz's Walter
when the cracks begin to show: he simmers his way into a kind of
monstrous madness, which lends both drama and humour to the proceedings
when Margaret finally brings her claim to court.On the evidence of Big Eyes, there's hope yet for Burton if he would
like to switch to making more literal films. He unearths plenty of
smart, insightful tension in this troubled marriage, a partnership on
unequal terms that becomes less emotional and more financial by the
day. But the film also stumbles along at points, bled dry when it
should radiate colour and emotion. It's hard to shake the feeling, too,
that Waltz seems to be under the impression that he's in a more
old-school, over-the-top Burton production. It's at these moments, in
particular, that one might long for a splash of Burton's own
personality - the chance to look at this world, this story and these
people through his eyes.
