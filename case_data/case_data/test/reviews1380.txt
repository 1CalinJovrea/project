Expecting more from the original

So, I saw the first Flatliners years ago, and it was a film that
somehow stuck with me. From what I remember raised me real questions
about life after death, and had a dark psychological feel.This remake starts well. It seems to go in the same direction, but then
it goes on to seem more like any other supernatural terror movie, using
the same old tricks to get you jumping of your seat. Yeah I was
surprised sometimes, got that "he's behind you - don't look" felling,
but I was expecting more.And what's with the Kiefer Sutherland character? Should have a more
active role than just being there - no connection to what happened to
him in the 90s.Expecting more psychological stuff and less "in your face" goosebumps,
but it was fun to watch and to be actually a bit scared.
