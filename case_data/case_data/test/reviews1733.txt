I don't care what the critics say, I enjoyed it from start to finish!

Upon seeing the trailer I was hesitant that it might be good but I
decided to give it a shot and watched it during its premiere. And boy, was I surprised! I absolutely loved the simple things that foreshadow the events of the
actual story: James Hook using a hook in the mining scene, the ticktock
of the bomb that he placed to set Peter free, Tiger Lily scaring Hook
with the crocodile and many more. I have to give credit to the writer
with his different take on the Peter Pan story.Also, the friendship between Hook and Peter was great, they got each
other's backs, with Hook saving Peter and vice-versa, kinda sad that
they'll eventually end up as enemies since this movie established that
relationship. Everyone was right for the role, Hugh Jackman was amazing as the
villain, how he looked here made me forget that he is Wolverine. Rooney
Mara was dashing in her Tiger Lily role and performed well even though
she was Caucasian in contrast to the natives. Garrett Hedlund played
this cocky, playboy-type, off-character Hook who always provides the
laughable comebacks. Levi Miller was great as Peter, that dude's going
places. Although, I have to note the lack of battle between Peter and
Blackbeard, since the prophecy stated that the former will defeat the
latter. They should have put at least a short duel between the two
because that'd be amazing. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I don't care what the Rotten
Tomatoes rating or critics say!
