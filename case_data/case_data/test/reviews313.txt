Quite good!

First of all, I will say that this is not really a horror film to me (
in its entirety) but rather the first half and bit more is kind of a
thriller / suspense movie and the last 20 minutes is a mild horror.But even if it is a real horror ( as many would say - though maybe my
definition of horror is rather narrow as I can not be scared easily) it
does bring something new.This is why I am rating this as an eight!That new element to the horror is what makes it good: a beauty, a dead
beauty that looks like a doll outside but hell inside... The
inscriptions inside her body and skin is a very awesome detail. Maybe
that is one thing that will stick with me when I think of the film ...The story is simple but appealing. The three actors + the girlfriend
and the sheriff are all good. But really, all hail Jane Doe ( if it was
a real person whole time).I recommend it!
