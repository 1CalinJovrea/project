DaFoe is utterly brilliant but the film leaves much to be desired.

The Florida Project is the third feature film from writer-director Sean
Baker and, while being an improvement over Tangerine and Starlet, The
Florida Project is still missing the heart it needs to be an
everlasting and impactful film. From his cinematic conception, Baker
has had a knack for showing very dingy lifestyles bursting with a color
palate that would make George Miller weep. But underneath the colorful
array that he includes is a superficial mess of a film. One that thinks
it is smarter and more heartfelt than it really is. Telling the story of a young girl living in a by-the-hour motel ran by
a seedy motel manager (Willem DaFoe) with a heart of gold and having a
drug abusing, prostitute mother doesn't exactly translate to feel good.
The young girl decides to let her imagination take wind and shield her
from the harsh realities of life. While this sounds like it should hit
hard, it doesn't. Not even a little bit. The problem that Sean Baker
has in all of his films is his characters. All of them are begging for
sympathy when sympathy is the last thing they deserve. While I think
the young girl, Moonee, deserves our sympathies, no one else does.
Every one in this film has gotten themselves here by their own doing
and Baker tries desperately to make us feel for them. It may work on
some audiences but it was wasted on me.Overall, this feels like a cheap grindhouse drama that really doesn't
do any favors to the actors. The cinematography in the film is top
notch and definitely shows that Baker has a visual eye but, as with his
previous 2 films, the story is severely lacking. While I definitely
think Baker has talent, it doesn't lie within his original stories. For
those of you who enjoyed Baker's Tangerine or Starlet, give this a
shot. Anyone else, you might want to skip it.
