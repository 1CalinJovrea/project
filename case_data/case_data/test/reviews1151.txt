Amazing story

I watched Safe Haven knowing that Nicholas Sparks wrote the story, and
not having read the book. This movie completely exceeded my
expectations. As I write this, the tears are drying on my face. I
believed the chemistry was there with the actors and the romance had a
good build-up (not rushed). I like that the story was easy to follow.
The actions scenes were well-directed and realistic. I like how the
story incorporates action, suspense, drama, and romance, all in one.
What really moved (shocked) me was the ending. It was so beautiful and
I just started bawling. It was so moving. As a whole, I really enjoyed
this movie.
