One of the worst horror flicks i've seen in a long time

***SPOILERS*** Lights out is one of those movie concepts that sounds
really interesting on paper, but falls flat on its face and breaks its
nose as soon as it starts moving.It's a jump-scare filled slug that fails to impress, featuring a boring
cast with no real personality, illogical decisions to try and make you
jump, and a monster that doesn't even follow her own rules.The massive problem is the star of the movie itself: Diana. She's an
evil woman that follows the mother of two kids, and relies on the
mother suffering to survive her self. The problem with Diana is that
she breaks her own rules all the bloody time. One moment she needs people to open the doors for herself, the next
she's teleporting around like she's a god. In the next moment she might
disappear when you flash a light at her, or she might decide to stand
there and burn while screaming her lungs out.Diana herself doesn't seem to have any real goal other than being a
jerk. She needs the mother to be depressed or she disappears
*supposedly* but then decides to hunt her kids when they're trying to
avoid her, which in theory she should be grateful for.Diana is also about as subtle as a Train wreck. Whenever she appears
the music blats your ears in an attempt to scare you, but when you
close your ears *since it's always easy to predict where she will be*
and just look at the scene, you realize Diana is about as scary as
Mickey Mouse with fangs.Characters also do the stupidest of things, like walking TOWARDS where
they know Diana might be, instead of staying in a lit area where
they're safe. And the excuse "they don't know better" is not valid,
since the entire family knows Diana is real, and has multiple scars and
wounds to show from it.In conclusion, Lights out is a poorly thought out movie that would have
been better off staying as a short film. The only real good thing about
the movie is that none of the "living" characters are inhumanly
bastards. Don't waste your time.
