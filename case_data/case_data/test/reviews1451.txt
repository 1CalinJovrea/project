Misbegotten venture with no known target audience...

A portrait of the real-life Keanes, San Francisco married couple of the
late 1950s and '60s: Walter is a braggart and storyteller (i.e., a good
liar) who is masterful at promoting his wife Margaret's paintings of
saucer-eyed waifs--but when it comes down to turning the spotlight on
the actual artist, he seizes an early opportunity to take credit for
the work himself, even though he has absolutely no artistic talent. A
study of ego, delusion and, that old standby, how success destroys a
marriage, each theme taking precedence over the process of artistic
creation. Tim Burton directed, and was obviously more interested in
Walter's preening self-importance and Hollywood hobnobbing than in
Margaret's inspirations (she churns out paintings--off-camera--at a
rapid pace). Christoph Waltz and Amy Adams are unconvincing as the
Keanes, neither able to overcome Burton's uncomfortable imbalance of
moods gleaned from Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's curiously
thin screenplay. As a movie about art, "Big Eyes" is surely a failure,
with a timeline presented to us in shorthand. Viewers attracted by the
picture's nostalgic trimmings--as a jaunt back in time to a simpler
era--might enjoy it, even though the family dynamics are a mess and
Waltz's larger-than-life portrayal gets more annoying as the film
progresses. *1/2 from ****
