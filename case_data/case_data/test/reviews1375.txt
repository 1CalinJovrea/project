Familiar and sadly weighed down by its TV feel

When music-hall star Elizabeth Cree is accused of poisoning her husband
on the same night as the last of a series of 'Golem murders' Inspector
Kildare discovers both cases maybe linked and sets about solving both
crimes.Based on an an adaptation of Peter Ackroyd's 1994 murder mystery novel
Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem director Juan Carlos Medina offers an
old-school Hammer-style horror anchored by performances by subtle Bill
Nighy (who took up the reigns from the late Alan Rickman), Olivia Cooke
(of Bates Motel), Eddie Marsan and Daniel Mays. But it's Douglas Booth
as Leno who steels the show.All the familiar Gothic Victorian elements and crime story beats are
there reminiscent of A Study in Terror and countless other yarns and
clich√©s set in the period which are more than likely inherited from
Ackroyds source material. Set on the unforgiving, squalid streets of
Victorian London in 1880, Jane Goldman's script captures the Lizzy
Borden and Jack the Ripper talk of the time, but where 2015's
comparable Frankenstein Chronicles series had a filmactic feel this is
sorely lacking in Limehouse Golem given it's made for TV look despite a
theatrical release. That said the costumes, makeup and music are spot
on as Nighy's Kildare goes effortlessly about piecing the case together
aided by some bloody flashbacks and spectres in his mind. There's a
little nihilistic twist which peaks interest showing that the conscious
of life isn't black and white especially when it comes to work
politics, promotion and fame.Overall, it has some gruesome elements and while it may not work as a
whodunit reaching heights of In the Name of the Rose, Agatha Christie
or a Sherlock Holmes mystery it satisfies as an unconventional
immersive period piece in the vain of countless Ripper-like outings.
Worth checking out even if for Booth's memorable performance.
