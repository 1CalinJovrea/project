A riveting and different movie about real heroes

With the recent fires in Napa & Sonoma this movie is even more
involving and relevant. It's well made and filmed. And the story is
firstly interesting then exciting and tragic. It doesn't feel like it
is over 2 hours long.There have been many movies about fighting fires in buildings in cities
but not many about tackling wildfires in the country side. What is
different to see is they actually stop fires by controlled burning. and
use portable bags as fire shelters. There is quite a lot of back story
about some of the characters mainly Josh Brolin the head of the unit
and his quest to get the team certified Hotshot. His lovely wife played
by the mesmerizing Jennifer Connelly. Sometimes she is so slim on the
horse she looks like she is in a photo shoot. Glad they gave her a
large role. Miles Teller's character as a reformed drug addict also has
a pretty wife played by Natalie Hall. Miles is quite different looking
here and acts well. Taylor Kitsch is the comic relief. Could have done
with a some more background about the others in the team though. There are a couple of small faults. The words on screen to show the
locations was in small white letters and hard to discern. The dialog
wasn't always easy to make out. Some of the accents were a bit thick.
Jeff Bridges always had sketchy diction. There isn't too much lingering
on the tragic deaths but would have been better with a bit more shown
about how they got actually got trapped. The part about getting
certified as hotshots could have been swapped for more of this.The reaction of loved ones is handled in a straightforward way.It's good to see a movie about heroes that are just pure heroes without
any question mark of war or politics hanging over their actions. One of
the better movies about firefighting.
