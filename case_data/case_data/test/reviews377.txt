Awful subject - Pedophile Redemption film. Pretty sick.

The film itself was pretty dull and low budget except for the
exceptional acting but the truth of the matter is WHY would any sick
director or film person want to make a film about a guilty Pedophile
that gets a visit from his victim as an adult. The film not only blatantly tries to portray the Pedophile as having
true love feelings for his child victim and it is unforgivable. No art
or slice of life in this movie but a sick mind. Maybe the director
thought converting this sick idea into a movie from a play is
worthwhile.Honestly I agree with others that at least if the Pedophile did not
violate her sexually it would have played better, even if supposedly
she consented it is just an inappropriate message to send out to the
world. There is no excuse for this type of story.I guess if a child that was molested by a Pedophile wants some
redemption perhaps this movie might provide some solace yet maybe not.I left the film pretty disgusted that this poor victim was messed up
for life - pretty messed up. And the ending of the Pedophile trying to
make her feel special and that she was the only one 'he molested' or
loved as he tries to state was just unfathomable and hard to believe. Great acting but sick subject. So many great stories to tell in life
and this is not one of them. What is next for this director.. to make a
movie about Human torture and killing people or a Charlie Manson like
character tries to provide solace to his victims families. Glad I was
able to see it for free.Kudos to Ben and Mara putting their names behind this pretty sick
subject. Without them it would have been really lame. Hope the director
picks a more appropriate subject next time3 rating mostly for the acting as the rest of the directing was pretty
basic like a student film all shot in a few locations with terrible
music.
