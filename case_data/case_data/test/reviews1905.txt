Boys Own Adventure becomes a coming-of-age and adult drama.

Two boys make their way along the Mississippi River to an island where
they find a boat up a tree, however they quickly discover that they are
not alone. A mysterious man is living on the island and when they
encounter him, their adventure gets a lot more serious.The setting for this film is the Mississippi River. It dominates this
film as it dominates the lives of the main characters in this film.
This is not a film about small-town America. There is a small town, in
which everyone knows everyone, but most of the action takes place out
of town, out on the river, and out in the uninhabited areas of the
river's ecosystem. The two fourteen year old boys and their families,
are river people, making a precarious living from the river. Life is
hard but the people are hard-working, honest and resourceful. If Mark
Twain was writing now, and had not been seduced into doing graphic
novels, these are the people he would be writing about. In fact, this
film does homage to Mark Twain; Huckleberry Finn was based on a
childhood friend of Mark Twain's called Tom Blankenship, the name of a
character in this film. This film then, essentially, is a modern
up-date of that genre.The two boys are played superbly by Ty Sheridan and Jacob Lofland.
Their characters are fourteen-years old, hardened and matured by their
environment. The two actors seem believable and natural in their roles.
Chris Pine was originally considered for the role of the mysterious
stranger, and with his blue eyes and young looks, he would have looked
attractive and charismatic as he encountered the boys. I bet he wishes
he had been in this well-scripted film. However Pine's loss is Matthew
McConaughey's gain. Robinson Crusoe was never like this. I doubt if
Pine could play this as well as McConaughey, who lives this role.
Actor? This guy looks like he has done nothing, but, live on the river,
all his life. You totally believe he is living on this island. If there
was a Best Eating Baked Beans Oscar, he would get it! A totally
convincing performance! All performances were great. Not just of
McConaughey and the two boys, but of all the supporting actors too. At
first you are unsure who is who in the families. They seem a little
cold but as the film progresses the characters develop. All are
believable. The female roles, there are three, are all strong and well
developed. The lovely Reese Witherspoon, star of 'Legally Blonde', like
Sharon Stone in 'Casino', shows here that she can play a gritty role.
Youngest actress, Bonnie Sturdivant, like the boys, got it just right.
Older actors too were great; Sam Shepard, who played his role with some
depth, and it was good to see Joe Don Baker in a small role.All actors played their roles convincingly. As said, their lives are
hard; they are plain-speaking people, however the occasional bit of
laconic home-spun philosophy, will also be said.This movie is beautifully filmed, lovely rich colours. The river is
filmed lovingly, so too the way of life. The film is a homage to the
life and the river. However while we see beautiful scenes of the river,
we see too the grittier scenes of urban decay and dereliction and
waste. All filmed well.The UK rating of this film is 12A, though this reviewer thinks it
unsuitable for anyone under 14 years of age. There are many different
threads and themes to this film and it is unclear what will be
resolved. Friendship, family, life and death, love and violence are all
explored. The adult themes are not hidden. The boys have to try figure
out the truth and act accordingly. The film is very much seen through
their eyes. However we do see a little bit more than the boys see. What
is the truth? What to do? The truth is not very clear, clear as mud,
perhaps. No real judgement is made about the truth, or the characters,
or their decisions. Their lives are too rich and complex for that sort
of simplistic verdict.So at the end of this film, a fourteen year old boy may have learnt
something, and others, so too may you. 10/10.
