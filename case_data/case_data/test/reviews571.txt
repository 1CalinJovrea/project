One of the worst movies ever

This is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. If you want to
see 3000 people shot to death then you will love this movie. I saw this
in an IMAX, but that didn't make the movie less painful. The story is
the same old one, good partner gets killed the teams takes revenge. The
first 15 minutes was bearable. There was nothing but mindless killing.
Every scene is unrealistic and there is absolutely no story line. The
good guys can apparently stand and shoot 1000 people face on face and
bad guys will miss them. 5 guys shooting and killing 100 people in a
open room without getting hit, is what best describes the movie. And
finally stallone defeats the villain in fist fight. Oh he had a gun but
u know fist fights are better. This is worse than any bad Indian movie
i have ever seen. Most Indian superhero movies are much better than
this movie. In short if you have watched any action movie, don't go to this movie.
