Writers bringing down this franchise

I love this series BUT the scriptwriters are making the plots pitiful.
Selene is becoming more predictable and considering she's the #1 Lycan
Killer she's showing a soft side. I would recommend seeing this ONLY IF
you're an avid fan but DON'T pay full price! Good: Selene continues to show skills and gets some new ones.Continuity of characters.Storyline remains consistent.Bad: Compacting too much of the story-line just too keep action flowing.Inconsistent displays of vampire strength and powers.Ease of vampire gullibilityAt least we can expect at least one more film to give them a chance to
bring it up to par, sigh...
