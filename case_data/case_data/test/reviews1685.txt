A Team for the Ages

There have only been a few movies in which the theater I was in went
completely silent as the credits rolled. Only the Brave tells the true
story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who risked their lives to stop
wildfires across the country. It's films like this that always move me
the most. A group of people who you grow fond of during the course of a
film band together in the most dangerous of circumstances for a common
cause. When done right, they can be extremely powerful.Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Josh Brolin, Miles Teller,
Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Connelly, and Taylor Kitsch among others; all of
them do a great job of creating a chemistry and realness between each
other. In order to feel anything when these men are entering the
flames, there has to be real friendships and relationships built
between the actors as these real life heroes. Perhaps more than
anything else, Only the Brave completely nailed the bond between the
team of hotshots.Going along with the bonds they have with each other, the film focuses
heavily on a few of the men's personal lives, which is where the real
emotion lied for me. Jennifer Connelly had the biggest supporting role,
as the wife of Brolin's character, but that was far from the only
character's personal life I felt attached to. As much as this a tribute
to the men on the team, it's also a great film to honor those lives who
were affected by the team in any way shape or form.Kosinski's directing, the team of writers, the ensemble of actors and
actresses, and of course everyone else doing the dirty work should be
commended for the work here. Only the Brave is a deeply moving film
that never takes advantage of the fiery source material to bombastic
results, instead only using it to honor the lives impacted. Truly one
of the best films of the year.9.4/10
