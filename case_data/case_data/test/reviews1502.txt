VIEWS ON FILM review of Geostorm

2017's Geostorm is my latest review. It was initially shot over three
years ago but that doesn't really diminish its quality. Geostorm is a
disaster film and yeah, I'm a sucker for that kind of popcorn fury. You
wanna see random cities get destroyed by hail storms, tidal waves, and
millions of lightning bolts? Geostorm's got your back. You wanna see
denizens parish from molten heat and from being flash frozen? Geostorm
will give it to you. But wait, that's not all. Geostorm doesn't just have the weather as its
only antagonist. There's also a creepy Secretary of State playing
government cover-up by implanting a computer virus to destroy the
planet. You just know that Geostorm is then gonna have vapid car
chases, some fistfights, and some gnarly shootouts. Hey I can dig it. In truth, Geostorm is a little intense for PG-13 fare. I remember
getting the same feeling watching people burn to death in something
like The Towering Inferno (a disaster trope that today could have been
rated R). Guess what, you've been warned as a moviegoer.For what it's worth, I almost decided to recommend Geostorm. What can I
say, it surprised me. Call it science fiction fodder with ideas as
opposed to just relying on chintzy special effects. Geostorm creates
its own unique world of how satellites control the Earth's climatic
overhaul. There's also a sense of fragility and peril when it comes to
Geostorm's take on natural disasters. Geostorm's logic is hokey yet
weirdly fascinating. Its scenes of destruction are partial yet boldly
intense. The critics have been lambasted this thing every since it came
out last Friday. Frankly, they just need to chill.Now where would I rank Geostorm in the disaster porn canon? Well it's
better than Deepwater Horizon, better than Into the Storm, better than
1979's Meteor, and much better than 1974's Earthquake. However,
Geostorm is not quite on par with Cloverfield, The Day After Tomorrow,
and Deep Impact. So OK, I'd probably put it in line with something like
The Core? There's a flick that I'd also saddle with a strong, mixed
rating (hint, hint).Anyway, Geostorm is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and features a
musical score straight from the annals of Michael Bay. Added to that,
Geostorm chooses the cities of Rio, Orlando, Florida, and Tokyo as
candidates to bite the proverbial dust. In the casting department,
Geostorm stars scruffy Scot and ICSS commander hero, Gerard Butler. Listen, I believe Gerard to be a decent actor. I really do. The problem
is that his agent keeps putting him in movies that are critically
panned on a dime. Geostorm inhabiting that kind of movie (this isn't my
opinion), puts Butler in the position of being the poor man's so-and-so
(Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, take your pick). It's a
shame. Heck, flicks like Playing for Keeps and The Bounty Hunter won't
get him any closer to the Academy Awards either. Oh well. Butler's the
heart of Geostorm and he does a bang-up job. My overall assessment of
this motion picture: 2 and a half stars.
