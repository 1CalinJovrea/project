A sweet movie, unfairly judged

This movie is my favorite feel-good flick and 9 out of 10 times it's my
go to for an easy late night comedy. That isn't to say it is a gut-
busting laugh-fest but it EASILY ranks higher than a chuckle. Even
though I can almost quote every line I still smile in expectation for
the scenes and moments that continue to crack me up. It has been unfairly reviewed by others who describe it as sophomoric
and shallow. While the movie maintains a sense of levity throughout it
is not lacking in emotion and empathy. If you want something to help
you get rid of a box of Kleenexes try "The Notebook." "What to Expect"
treats it's scenes of tenderness with respect (which I appreciated) but
won't make you ball your eyes out.Other ridiculous criticisms target the development of the characters
and their portrayal of parental roles. As in many comedies, the
characters of "What to Expect" are more closely related to an archetype
than actual people. That being said, I didn't find it difficult to
identify and empathize with each character as the movie progressed.
Their emotions and development are hyperbolic but still believable for
what this movie is - a comedy! As a pregnant woman I can easily relate
to what seems (to some!) an exaggeration. This movie is sweet, funny, and easy to watch. Not to mention that it
actually DOES pack a lot of useful information regarding pregnancy
without seeming like a health class video. It won't make you pee
yourself laughing or cry yourself to sleep or enlighten you but it
should make you happy as it does for me every time I watch it. Abandon
your cynicism for a moment and enjoy a cute couch-film.
