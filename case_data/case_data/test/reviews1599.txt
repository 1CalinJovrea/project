A very un-unique animation which is still surprisingly good in its own way

When 'Hotel Transylvania' first came out, I had absolutely no intention
of seeing it for two reasons: Adam Sandler and vampires. I thought a
comedy about Dracula would be boring. This movie isn't that bad but at
the same time isn't that funny In this movie, we have Count Dracula who
has organized a building called Hotel Transylvania to keep his fellow
monsters safe from the evil humans. Now, doesn't that sound familiar?
From a Pixar movie? MONSTERS INC! One day, a human accidentally
ventures into the monster world...Hmm...Still familiar and meets
Dracula's daughter, Mavis voiced by Selena Gomez and falls in
love...Still remind me of the Sully and Boo relationship as well as
segments of Twilight.I'll start off by saying that voice acting is brilliant. Adam Sandler
really was great as Count Dracula, Adam Samberg was great as Johnny and
Kevin James was a great Frankenstein. Selena Gomez also did a great
job. The story however isn't anything special by any means. Too much of
the story is from Monsters Inc but there are parts of Twilight in this
movie which I love as a lot of it is indirectly mocking that god-awful
series. The characters are funny but by no means any memorable. The
dialogue is actually the movie's greatest strength. It really is
hilarious in so many ways. There are so many one liners and Johnny's
line "Wow man! Your Dracula impression is way over the top!" is simply
hilarious as is the woman with the annoying voice saying to the monster
in the kitchen "Your voice is annoying" If it weren't for the dialogue,
this movie could so easily be horrible. The visual animations in the
movie are stunning with each scene being carefully visualised and is
truly a treat for the eye.The film's main problem is its very close resemblance to Monsters Inc
which makes the movie nothing unique. However, the mocking of Twilight
is handled very well, the animations are superb, the characters and
voice acting are done well and is well directed but a bit rushed at
certain points during the film. The film could also have been a good
ten minutes shorter and we wouldn't have missed anything funny or
special. Overall, a good animation movie which isn't unique but funny
