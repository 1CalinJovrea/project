Far From Original but Definitely Worthy of a Watch

The Belko Experiment pits an entire office building against one another
during, what seems to be, a government experiment that puts 75+ people
in an office building and an announcer tells them to kill one another
or hardcore ramifications will follow for not obeying the order. When
you break it down, this is a film that just sounds stupid in the best
way possible. It is fun, violent, gory and, at times, thoroughly
enjoyable as a passable thriller. Anyone looking for the gold that
James Gunn struck with Guardians of the Galaxy or even Slither will
walk away disappointed. Those of you who enjoyed the director's work on
Wolf Creek will probably be happy with this. For me, it's hard to give thoughts on a film like this because it is so
obvious that the filmmakers didn't give a damn about impressing anyone.
For that, I've got to give kudos to Gunn and McLean. They know their
audience. This is far from a movie that will turn you into a fan of
horror or thriller. This is the type of film that you just sit back,
turn your brain off, and try to be entertained. There is not artistic
value in this film. This is a balls to the wall thriller that works for
anybody looking to waste 90 minutes or so. With that being said, there
are still some frustrating moments in the film. The film plays out very black and white. We know who is who and where
they stand in the experiment. So right away, we know who to care about
and who not to. This was something that I didn't really care for with
this film. I wanted to be surprised, I wanted to be wondering who was
going to make what decision. Instead, it all ends up being very
predictable. While what i just mentioned is extremely vague, it is hard
to really go off about the film without giving major spoilers but those
of you who have seen any of the Red Band trailers probably know what
I'm talking about. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a gory thriller that is almost a lot
of fun. It has every ingredient there for a tight, great little
thriller. Unfortunately, director Greg McLean repeats what he did on
Wolf Creek and let's us stew in gore instead of deep and layered
characters. For a film like this, that is what anybody could expect.
Personally, I would have liked to have seen something a little
different than what was expected. Either way, this movie is a lot of
fun and a good way to waste some time. Other than that, The Belko
Experiment comes up a little short.
