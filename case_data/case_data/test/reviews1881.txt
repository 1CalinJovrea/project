A "Spark" Of Originality

Ruby Sparks is a film that is different from most romantic movie's I
have ever seen. It star's Paul Dano as Calvin, a writer whose first
novel was a huge hit but is yet to write anything since. He is bitter
about relationships due to the poor ending to the only one he's ever
had. This coupled with his father's death has sent him to therapy. In
one of his sessions he is encouraged to write about a girl who likes
his dog Scotty despite the fact it is sloppy and pee's incorrectly. He
proceeds to go home and has a dream about this girl and is stuck to his
typewriter the next day typing out her whole life story. Thus we have
our title character Ruby Sparks (Zoe Kazan). This movie is based on Calvin's realization that he can control Ruby,
as he wrote her into existence. It show's how in relationships it is
nearly impossible to make things perfect, it gives us insight into the
fact that nobody is perfect and it shows how hard it can be for others
to accept those imperfections. However, the most important lesson I
believe this movie teaches is that said imperfections MUST be accepted
if you want to be truly happy. The lead performance by Paul Dano is quite good. He displays a full
range of emotion throughout the film. Zoe Kazan plays a very lovable
Ruby Sparks, she makes Calvin's complete fixation with her character
believable. Chris Messina plays Calvin's brother Harry and is often a
quite humorous voice of reason. Antonio Banderas also makes an
appearance as Calvin's step- father and is consistently funny.The movie as a whole is a funny, emotional ride. It chronicles the
importance of being willing to accept others for what they are and how
trying to change them causes nothing but turmoil. The score is very
well incorporated and often heightened the dramatic scenes. All in all, Ruby Sparks was a fun and likable movie, much like its
namesake character. I would recommend a viewing of this to anyone who
enjoys a good heartfelt film. 8/10
