Darker, more violent, and nowhere near as good.

I am a huge fan of the first Kick-Ass movie; it was fun, action packed,
and even had a few emotional sequences thrown in for good measure. I
went into the sequel expecting the same feel of the first one to be
present, but just a continuation of the story. That, unfortunately, was
where I was horribly wrong.Lots and lots of spoilers for Kick-Ass 2 below...Alright, so it starts off pretty good, with Hit-Girl and Kick-Ass
training to be a crime fighting duo. I'm excited about this...I would
be cool with a movie entirely about KA and HG putting down bad guys.
But then HG makes a promise to Marcus, her guardian and protector since
her father died, and subsequently stops being a super hero and spends
the rest of the movie trying to fit in with teenage 'mean girls' super
clique b**ches. Um, what?? Which then leaves her and KA's interaction
through the rest of the movie to essentially him begging her to come
back and be a hero and she repeating over and over again why she can't.
They literally have this conversation like five times.Don't even get me started on the "Sick Stick" she uses to get her
revenge on the girls at school. It's a cool weapon in theory, but the
graphic portrayal of its use in the middle of a high school cafeteria
was repulsive and completely unnecessary.Here's something I never thought I would say; I wish Jim Carrey had
been in the movie more. His character actually seemed like it could be
pretty interesting; hints about a spec ops past, an attitude that
borders (well, maybe more than borders...) psychotic, like he could
easily push being a hero too far. Even though it is a clich√© story, I
would have much rather seen his character devolve into a morally grey
killer as the villain than what was given to us with Christopher
Mintz-Plasse.I liked Chris in the first movie, teenage son to a powerful mob boss
trying to figure out where he fits, but still with some sense of moral
integrity. None of that is seen here; so consumed with Kick Ass after
the masked hero killed his father with a bazooka, he dons his mothers
S&M outfit and becomes the first supervillain, the Mother F****er. Yep.
That's right. I'm sure this is supposed to be funny, but they portray
him as too dark, violent, and serious while trudging around in leather
and chains for me to feel anything but nausea during every scene he is
in.I missed Nicholas Cage. Another thing I never thought I would say.Character's do things for no reason throughout the whole movie, the
dialogue is terrible, the movie is just awful. It's redeeming qualities
are few and far between, and not enough to make it worth a viewing.
There is a lot more about this movie that upsets me (like Dave's gf
from the first movie breaking up with him because she thought he and
Hit-Girl were sleeping together...??) but I think I have probably said
more than enough.Watch the first Kick-Ass, it is awesome. Give this one a wide berth.
