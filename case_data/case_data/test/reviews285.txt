terrible

The only movie I have ever seen that is worse than this is Alien Vs.
Predator. No blood, no gore, no swearing, no zombie movie. Brad Pitt's
arrogance and feeling of self-worth will suffocate you as you watch
this steaming pile of cr*p. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble
the book, it was a terrible movie no matter how you slice it.
Apparently Brad's artistic addition to the movie was that when humans
become ill the zombies won't attack them...yet one of the guys who help
Sir. Brad super-UN inspector Pitt only has an injured knee, not an
illness. Brad Pitt is the only actor in this movie that has any real
screen time, it might as well be called "Brad Pitt saves the world (in
the most uninteresting 2 hours ever). This movie is bad and anyone
involved in writing/directing/producing it should feel bad.I hate you Brad Pitt, with every bone in my body. Since you "made this
film for your kids" by giving it a PG-13 rating I hope one day they
grow up, read the book, and despise what you created.
