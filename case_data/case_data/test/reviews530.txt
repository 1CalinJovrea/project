Excellent Thriller!!!

At first, i tough this is not going to be a good movie, but later on i
realize that has a very good plot and a solid performance of the entire
cast. this is the kind of movie that you must see every detail. kept
you intrigue along the entire film. The end was the best, a really good
end, like the kind of movies you don't know what's gonna happened to
the final. the art is for me another strong point, really well ambiance
when you also can feel the mystery.So i give 8 out of 10 to this great Spanish film. Very recommendable.
PD: as you can see English is not my first language, so sorry for the
basics lines.
