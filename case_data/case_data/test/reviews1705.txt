Very slow and boring

This is the kind of movie you can watch in fast-forward, with only a
pauses here and there to sniff around. In fact, I recommend it.But even if you watch the whole thing you will be left with lots of
questions. What caused population to fall after oil production fell?
Once population fell, why was food scarce? Why didn't more people grow
food? There was nothing but land and wilderness as far as the eye could
see, but only one guy growing a tiny little patch of vegetables? Why
did the guy grow such a small patch? Why didn't they expand the garden
when the women showed up? Why not use that open field to grow even more
food? So again...why on earth was food scarce? Was there some rule that
only this one guy was allowed to grow food? And at the end when she
finally found a settlement, why were the people walking around in the
grass pretending it was a farm? There were no fields of vegetables,
only grass? Was that a movie mistake, or did they plan to eat that saw
grass? And lastly, what the heck is wrong with people who can't make a
decent, believable movie?
