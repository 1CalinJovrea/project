Funny fun time. Entertaining valentines release.

I almost started off hating this movie before I had seen it; I thought
the trailer looked like crap, with horrible comedic dialog and
premises, but I took the chance on free screening tickets, figuring I
could make fun at worst. The film opens with shooting at the hip action
and stays pretty entertaining in comedy and delivery. Witherspoon's
character's sister (Chelsea Handler) and their interactions are lots of
fun. Chris Pine does a good job being semi-typecast and the movie
doesn't take itself too seriously. It's way better than expected and I
wouldn't have been upset had I paid full price for it. Like a review I
read said, it's a romantic movie that guys won't have to be dragged to.
Is it a great movie? No. Is it a fun valentines movie? Yes.
