"Gold" is pure gold

I reviewed only one movie on IMDb so far, but "Gold" is much better
than the ratings and other users' reviews suggest, so it's good to
balance things out. First of all, you have a three-dimensional protagonist you can
sympathize with. He's unattractive, unlucky, drinking way too much -
like most of us are, ha ha. In fact, Kenny is very human with his flaws
and ambitions, and this is fantastically portrayed by Matthew
McConaughey (it's not about his fake teeth, weight gain or shaved head,
it's about his ability to make you care about the character). The
script is tight, smart, bitter-sweet and funny at times, because it's a
dark comedy. Well, sort of. And while it may not stay true to reality
(the Bre-X scandal), it's preceded with a note "Inspired by true
events", not "Based on". After all, it's a movie. And as a movie, it's
better than most things you're gonna watch this year. Or last, for that
matter.Plus, the soundtrack is just great (Iggy Pop, Joy Division, New Order,
Pixies), as is its use in particular scenes.5/6 in my book, 8/10 according to IMDb standards.
