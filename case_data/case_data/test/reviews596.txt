Left wing opinion masquerading as fact

Some good acting (I especially like Bale) and interesting tricks like
having actors talk to the audience and having celebrities explain
complex financial deals.Unfortunately it distorts reality to match a Leftist viewpoint, and
repeats ad nauseam how evil bankers are. Conveniently left out is the
pressure the government put on banks. Check out the history of the
Community Reinvestment Act, particularly Bill Clinton's "coup de
whiskey" which forced banks to accept junk housing loans. This is why
such a large percentage of mortgages failed. This was NOT mentioned in
the film; how can this not be relevant?Also, it was well known that housing loans were in trouble before the
crash. I remember a cover article in The Economist predicting disaster
in housing around 2005. I think the bankers were thinking, yeah, it's
crazy, but the government is forcing us to do it so they are going to
cover these loans in the end so they are secure.At least with Michael Moore you know he is lying to you; with this
movie a lot of people accept it as fact.
