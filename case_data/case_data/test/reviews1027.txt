Predictable but charming

Rosie and Alex have been best friends since primary school. They nearly
got romantic on Rosie's 18th birthday, but Rosie was way too drunk.
Since then, both have had relationships, just not with each other -
timing has always worked against them.When I watched the trailer for Love, Rosie, I thought "I now know
exactly what will happen in this film." But I like Lily Collins, so I
went to see it anyway. And I was quite right - the story progresses
along the tramlines which are displayed in that trailer (with one or
two little sidetracks), so don't expect any earth-shattering surprises.But it doesn't matter. Lily Collins and Sam Claflin have an easy
chemistry, the film is a romantic drama with some gently amusing
moments, the supporting cast is good, and Collins turns out to be able
to do a bit of acting, too.I enjoyed this.
