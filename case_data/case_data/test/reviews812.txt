get thee to a  nunnery

a young man fleeing from an irate husband lands in a nunnery run by a
priest john c. reilly and mother superior, molly Shannon. to protect
the young lad from the sometimes violent nuns the priest decides to
pass off the young man as deaf and dumb. ideas like that usually don't
work out except in farce. that's when the laughter takes place. not
here though. there is a very funny joke, but it is milked to death and
becomes unfunny. the nuns are lustful, and force themselves on the
young man, sometimes under the threat of a knife. some of the nuns are
lesbians, I think and some are witches. with a w. the sex scenes could
only be devised by a male writer and director. fantasizing. anyway,
there were smatterings of laughter in the audience and I realize I am
not the customer they had in mind. but I do see a lot of movies and I
know when I see a good, funny film. this is not one.
