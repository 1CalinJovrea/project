Not a great Bourne movie

To me Bourne movies changed the face of a genre. After the Bourne
movies James Bond couldn't remain the same and had to morph to meet the
new standards. In this movie, I found that there was nothing new. Head
of agency is again evil. Him and the asset that is going against Bourne
are conveniently the ones who also killed his father. Female lead was
not well developed. We are not sure what her motives are and where she
is coming from. Chases and fights were stale and we have seen those in
previous Bourne movies. Overall this will not be a movie that will live
up the reputation of other Bourne movies. It feels like a movie that
was made in haste to cash the reputation of this series.
