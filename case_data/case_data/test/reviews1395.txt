Wonderful!

I LOVED this movie. As a woman that grew up with the comic strip & the musical, I was
hesitant about the reboot. Not because Annie & Daddy Warbucks were now
black, but just because it was already a classic film. So often, you
lose the feel of the plot when trying to update a movie for the times.I feel that this new Annie was able to hold onto the spirit of the
character while still updating the lifestyle & nuances of today's
reality.I literally laughed out loud so many times and caught a myself tearing
up a couple times, too. All in all, I loved this movie. I will own it and I won't need any of
my nieces with me to watch it over and over again. This is a feel good movie and touches on a few social points that we
all need to remember. Peace & Blessings
