Simple Lacking in Originality,

The Family is a mediocre movie with an averagely written storyline and
a mostly terrific cast. The performances are what really hold it
together, keeping it modestly entertaining, Robert De Niro plays a
really intriguing character who had a great droll personality, Michelle
Pfeiffer shines as his wife and his scenes with Tommy Lee Jones are my
favourite, seeing the two of them acting together was a pleasure. I did
not enjoy the teenagers storyline, it was very typical teen comedy, as
we see a relationship develop between De Niro's daughter and her math
teacher, it was poor and easily could have been done just as
effectively in twenty minutes on a television series. As for the main
plot, though there were certain scenes I really liked, such as the Top
10 and the interview, it lacks originality, there is nothing here we
have not seen before, and it feels as if they are aware of that, it
makes no attempts to be different or to stand out in any way, which
every movie should. It has its moments, but The Family misses more
times than it hits, and I would say it is better off avoided. The heads of a Mafia family move to France under a Witness Protection
Program. Best Performance: Robert De NiroWorst Performance: Dianna Agron
