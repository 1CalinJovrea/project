There really is something rotten in the state of Denmark, No, it's not
Von Trier's latest in-joke art-fest. Or Reffin's foray into the world
of Hollywood pot-boiler. It's something Danish born, bred, and branded.Nicolaj Arcal's A Royal Affair is essentially based on the true story
of young English Princesses doomed marriage to an eccentric King in
18th Century Denmark. So far, so Downton-Dogme. Ineed this is a film I
went into with a certain trepidation. The poster is ghastly -
resembling, for all the world, a visualisation of a Barabara Cartland
novel - it screams costumer-drama tweeness and historical romance
schmaltz. Secondly, how interesting could a portrait of 18th Century
Danish Royalty be to a Brit proto-Republican? The answer is very. Yes,
this is a period-drama. Yes, there is a "forbidden-love" romance.
However, there is so much more. The drama and romance are framing
devices to big ideas and big themes. Essentially, this is a portrait of enlightenment thinking versus the
feudal establishment. Church, state and the nobility pitching itself
against writers, doctors and free-thinking women. Denmark is portrayed
as the vanguard of European progressive politics. Voltaire would have
been (actually he was) proud.As a piece of cinema it is terrific. Beautifully shot, it evokes
Kubrik's Barry Lyndon at times but actually has a heart and soul. The
performances are universally excellent (Mads Mikkelson following up his
jaw-dropping role in The Hunt and who is rapidly becoming my favourite
screen presence). Most importantly it is bursting with ideas and
imagination. Do yourself a favour and get a proper history lesson.
