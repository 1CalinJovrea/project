Depravity We Can Swim In

Spoilers Ahead:Well after the first one which featured child rape cannibalism
castration done by hand this is a Walt Disney Picture. Poor Eve she
keeps taking all her clothes off and nobody cares this film another
bomb like her other meretricious special the hilariously bad 300; RISE
OF MISANDRY was another crashing bomb. Eva I do not think your body is
doing it honey back to TV where you belong in the appropriately titled
Penny Dreadful. Yes the black and white photography is beautiful how
wonderful to watch Marv our hero rip eyes out and slash throats with on
snot nose youngsters. Hey way to go Marv. I will spare my readers the
usual lecture on decadence. WHAT A CRASHING BORE; as I watched this sad
commentary on what a depraved sewer our once great country has become;
oh, make no mistake films are mirrors of the society within which they
are made. I refer critics to the great anthropologist Jules Henry on
how society's cultural products evince the mores and folkways of that
society.I thought of that wonderful quotation from Napoleon," When you take God
out of a society you get a nation of highwaymen." Marv himself echoes
this in the first Sin City when he says hell is waking up with no
purpose or meaning. Yes exactly Marv and this is what you get near the
end of a great ascendant country that once ruled the world a depraved
repugnant nauseating gore fest to assuage all the worker slaves feeling
of being the impotent ants that they are; yes, is this enough? How much
more pain and suffering before you start to feel better. They
annihilated God then family currently country and what is left? Savage
brainless cruelty better fitted for a cannibal village. Any of you New Age feminists notice the portrayal of women in this
film? Eve Green what a feminist Icon. Yes, from ladies to heartless
evil seductresses the misogyny throughout the picture in this time and
place is so funny. Yes the new Miho how many heads do we need; hey
anybody bored yet? I found the film a very hideous depressing
experience. It is much tamer than the first one which was real garbage;
sorry just not into cannibalism and child rape sorry I know I am so
gauche. Destroying others simply for the entertainment value there is a
word for this condition SADISM. Save your time it is simply sewage.
