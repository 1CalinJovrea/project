A truly great comedy!

I usually do not laugh when it comes to movies this bad. What they do,
is make me angry and disappointed, but this monstrosity takes all the
clichés to a whole new level. Don't get me wrong, this movie tries to
be funny, but it all feels awkward and unnatural, given the
circumstances, characters find themselves in. I watched Olympus has
fallen - not much of a movie either, but at least they try to take it
seriously.First half of the movie is actually a standard Hollywood action that we
are used to, but after that... holy cow! You get all the clichés you
would expect from a movie like this and MUCH MUCH MORE! I laughed so
hard when the little girl waved the flag to stop the fighters from
bombing the white house, I laughed when Tatum killed James Woods with a
machine gun from 2 meters away and there was no blood at all (so this
can be a family movie you rent on Sundays), I couldn't NOT laugh when
Foxx actually found the chrome dildo RPG in his limousine or when I saw
the hilarious acting of big-faced Gyllenhaal.With this movie you get all the clichés like patriotic music playing
throughout half of the movie, the "at the end of the movie" good guy -
bad guy final fight, the classic motive of using the nuclear weapons,
the brave speeches, and of course the "bad guy waiting to press the red
button before the good guy does something".Never before in the history of big-budget cinematography was there a
movie more pathetic and stupid as this! I mean, who do you feed this
to? Well, yeah, teenagers and people with IQ less than 90.However, I really had a good time with this movie. It is definitely one
of the best comedies out there this year. I actually checked IMDb to
see if this was intended as a comedy and the "action" "thriller"
"DRAMA!!!" really made my day.
