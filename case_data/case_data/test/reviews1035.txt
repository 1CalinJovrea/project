One Last Ride!!

This was sold as One Last Ride. And it felt just like that. Throughout
the film, you get the feeling that this is the finale for this
incredible franchise.It paid incredible homage to the previous installments. From
characters, to story lines, everything seemed to come full circle. Even
some of the sequences made you flash back to when you first saw
something identical or similar years ago.It reminded us of why we love every character tied to this franchise,
present and past.As someone who quite literally grew up with these movies, I feel like I
have closure. I don't need another one. I've watched every Fast and
Furious movie dozens of times each, hundreds total. I used to looks
forward and impatiently wait for the next movie. With this one, that
urge is gone. The journey feels complete. It was our last ride.Faced with the huge challenge of finishing this movie without Paul, I
think everyone involved with this movie made all of the right moves,
all the way up to the very end. It did Paul Walker justice.
