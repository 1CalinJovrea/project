Watching once is too many times

This movie is a serious competitor with After Earth for worst sci-fi
movie of 2013. While After Earth was the result of wealthy Will Smith's
nepotism, the question of why Elysium ever came to be is more of a
mystery. The longer you watch this movie, the more you forget about the
ridiculous fantastical story, and will just see wealthy actors boring
you. The contrasting uber-polarization between rich and poor was made
to be so obvious, particularly with the rich having a machine that
instantly fixes any health issue - and somehow the poor run a space
program - that it is simply childish and unbelievable. The director
obviously had dough for proved talent Matt Damon and plenty of special
effects, but it just doesn't add up to anything. The villain is an
absolute annoying joke - and I guess villains are to be hated - but
maybe not for the reasons I did, which was: "Why can't I take this guy
seriously?" and "I hate the sound of this guy's voice". And
unfortunately the villain isn't the only annoying thing about this
movie: the entire thing is torture comparable to a steaming pile of poo
held under your nose for over an hour. The movie can't end soon enough,
and the director and all actors involved should be punished severely
for unleashing this abomination unto the world.
