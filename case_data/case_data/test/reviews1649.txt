Very Disappointing- Trite and Formulaic

This genre of film - a group of people who have significant history and
are brought together by an event that impacts them all- rely on great
script,creative casting and directing that creates chemistry and
meaningful interaction."This is how I leave you" has none of these elements. The seemingly
talented cast seem to go through the motions, speaking contrived lines
and relying on set piece comedic elements that are not funny to begin
with, a rabbi called "boner" and Jane Fonda's fake breasts are as good
as they get. The script hardly rises above the level of a one -season
sitcom. Characters and their stories are undeveloped. there s no sense
of real relationship between these family members and certainly no
spark or wit. This film fails miserably. Save your money and watch "The Big Chill" to see how it should be done.
