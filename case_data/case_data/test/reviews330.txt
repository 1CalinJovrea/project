Good ideas, Bad scenario

I had really great expectations for this movie, and maybe that's the
reason why I was so disappointed. Of course, all the actors are great,
and even though the direction is not bad, it's really a typical love
movie scenario, with the doubt at the beginning, the intense love, the
betrayal, and finally the traditional happy ending. That could've been
good without all the inconsistencies there are. For example, why didn't
they thought to resurrect the captain, just as Aurora did for Jim? And
there was enough place for both of them in the end. It would be Titanic
all over again if Rose had decided to stay in the water with Jack. Not
a bad movie, some ideas are great : leaving a man alone with his
thoughts and robots to see his attitude evolve is interesting, the fact
that he sacrificed a life instead of staying alone too, but those ideas
could've been pushed so much further if they did not decided to focus
on their love story. Honorable mention to Arthur, the best character in
my opinion.
