Quite A Revelation!!!

CAUTION: PROBABLE SPOILERS!!!I expected to enjoy Chris Evans as I am a fan since around 2010 or so,
but with a title like Playing It Cool, I figured I was in for a very
fluffy comedy, perhaps like the mediocre Nanny Diaries, or the sexy and
funny What's Your Number?But this film, while it gave me a laugh or two in several moments, was
more poignant than silly, more deep than fluffy. I am not even certain
Evans' character has a "name" in the film, but the voice- over
narration keep you close to his existence. He is extremely human, thus
extremely flawed. But you're given such a fleshed-out, fully realised
character that you understand why he is fiercely protective of what's
left of his heart. He has a circle of friends, a writer who believes
fully in the miracle of love (a brilliant Topher Grace), a performance
artist whose feminist gore is quite jarring (Aubrey Plaza), a married
but obviously bitter (and I'm afraid annoying and quickly tiresome) guy
pushing 50 (Luke Wilson), a guy who lives in his van (Martin Starr),
his loving Granddad (a warm and potty mouthed performance by the great
Philip Baker Hall), and his enthusiastic agent (Anthony Mackie) who has
gotten him a gig writing a romcom involving multiple personalities. Our
nameless protag argues that he'd rather write action movies, but the
agent promises that if "Me" comes through with the RomCom, he'll have
the action movie job shortly afterward."Me" meets "Her" (Michelle Monaghan, and I'm unsure whether a name is
mentioned for her either. And suddenly, this film is overflowing with
tons of cleverness and imaginative visuals. That's what really makes it
a strong movie for me. All the storytelling visual styles. Of course
this dreamy, perfect woman is engaged to "Stuffy" (Ioan Gruffudd), the
clichéd boring, snobby fiancé. Sometimes the story works in this arc,
sometimes not. We're not given much of a look at "Stuffy", but I guess
we're meant to route for "Me." It's not even "Her" story. It's "Me's"
story, entirely from his POV. I loved how Evans submerged himself into
each short story role, especially the Korean transsexual lovers' story.
I also love that this movie is so LGBTQ friendly. It's very poignant in
some places. I kept waiting for Evans to cry after the hits just kept
on coming for the character. Even though I saw no tears, I could see
the pain. He never disappoints as a true actor. The film is a very
realistic look at the reality of love. Many times you will fall in love
with someone who doesn't feel the same attraction you do. Mallory is in
love with "Me"; "Me is in love with "Her"; "Her" believes she's in love
with "Stuffy", but is also confused; She says he's the most "stable"
thing in her life. Scott is in love with a guy who doesn't seem to get
the hint for a long time; Lyle hooks up with a hot older woman Beverly
D'Angelo) in his van, and is that the extent of his "love" life?;
Samson is married but again, seems jaded, bitter and believes love is a
crock; Granddad says, "Go after the woman you love, even if she says
she doesn't love you." I would say this is bad advice because No means
No. But "Her" does respond favourably to "Me's" kiss, and later out and
out cheats on "Stuffy" with "Me." So it's not nonconsentual. It's flawed, but it's also surprisingly clever and fun to watch!
