It'll please the little tykes and meet with their approval

Fresh off the success of The LEGO Movie and The LEGO Batman Movie comes
The LEGO Ninjago Movie, about an elite ninja force fighting an evil
warlord by night and existing as unpopular high schoolers by day. The
kids are sort of like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, in that each of
them has a distinct color scheme and elemental theme going for them,
like fire, water, ice(?), earth, and lightning(?).The de facto leader of this young crew is Lloyd (Dave Franco), whose
color is green and whose theme isalso green. (It's explained later.)
Together, the team fights the ever-invading forces of Garmadon (Justin
Theroux). The name of the city Garmadon wants to conquer is Ninjago,
which looks like it should be pronounced like "Ninja Go!" but really is
pronounced with the emphasis on the middle syllable: "NinJAgo." Anyway,
the big secret that Lloyd and the gang hide, aside from their real-life
identities as high school students, is that Green Ninja is  dun dun
DUN  the son of Garmadon. Lloyd the teenager, on the other hand, is
well known as the warlord's kid, and man does he bear the brunt of
their ire. Kids sit on the opposite side of the bus from him. People
boo him. He just has to deal, because it's what being a kid is all
about, right? Now Lloyd, being a teenager, is just slightly resentful
that he has had an absentee dad, so after one of the many battles with
Garmadon, he takes things personal and unleashes holy heck on his
nemesis. Oh, I should mention that although each of them calls himself
a ninja, they're just kids in mech suits. Totally not ninja like at
all. This leads to Garmadon coming back with a vengeance, andwell, I
think you get the idea. Someone is going to learn a Very Important
Lesson here.And if that were all that was to this movie, I'd say let's leave it to
the kids and never watch it, fellow grownups! But the movie does
inherit a bit of the sly humor from its predecessors. Remember how,
when guns were fired in The LEGO Movie, the characters would make "pew
pew pew" sounds? During one long battle scene, Garmadon actually fires
sharks from (presumably) a shark cannon, and each time a shark is shot
one hears "dun dun dun" aka the theme from Jaws. Later on, a bigger
enemy is revealed, one that dwarfs Garmadon in destructiveness  a
tabby. As in a real cat. If you've ever wanted to see a cat demolish
LEGOs that you didn't have to pick up, now's your chance.I found a lot of The LEGO Ninjago Movie to be entertaining. What it
lacks in creativity it makes up for in sincerity, as it never gets
terribly maudlin. The characters are fun, and both Franco and Theroux
really sell them well. Movie's good for kids. Rest of us can wait for
home video, if at all.
