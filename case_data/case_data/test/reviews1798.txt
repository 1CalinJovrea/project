Really, really just terrible.

I am not a movie snob and am easily entertained, but this movie was
absolutely a complete and utter joke. It felt like a 3rd grader wrote
the script. It contained every single clich√© imaginable, from corny
Platoon/Apocalypse Now-type one-liners to ridiculous slow-motion
"sacrifice" scenes-- all incredibly cheap, contrived and void of any
depth what-so-ever.Absolutely NO PLOT-- not a single tangible, well-built contextual plot
exists in this movie. John C. Reilly was the whole point of the movie--
it should be called "King Reilly and His Adventures"-- but then again,
there really weren't any adventures to talk about...The worst part of the movie was that I could absolutely not tell when
the movie was supposed to be serious or a comedic parody, and folks,
that's never a good sign, as it usually means the film is not good. And
Samuel L. Jackson?? I think I just might use his appearance in future
films as cause to not see them because he is clearly cast for his
popularity and for a quick marketing boost for films that clearly need
that extra kick. I am going to binge-watch King Kong (2005) with Jack
Black until I can forget that I ever saw this new attempted failure to
reprise Kong. Have our standards really fallen so far?? I honestly do
not think there was a single frame that lasted longer than 2 seconds, I
am not joking. Oh, the agony.
