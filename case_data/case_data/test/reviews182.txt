A Satisfying Sequel

More monster characters, more amusing moments and more exciting parties
have upgraded an additional star rating for the hotel this Halloween
season. The animation starts off immediately from where it ended
previously, progresses in a moderate pacing, filled with numerous
hilarious moments though with the usual ridiculous Adam Sandler type of
humors, it's not overly used and creates just sufficient amount of
laughter. The message about to change and to adapt in order to fit
oneself into a new environment is well simplified to cater children's
understanding while the eye popping, colorful visual effects together
with pop styles emerging into the story are well crafted to make young
adults feel like kids. Overall, the sequel is an energetic animation
compared to its predecessor, heart-warming and certainly a satisfying
family goers movie to enjoy.
