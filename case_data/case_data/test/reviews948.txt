Not really Star Trek.  To JJ: Your audience is smarter than action and explosions.

Disappointed with this entry in the series. Star Trek to me isn't about
motorcycles and loud music, it's more about exploring science fiction
concepts and themes through great storytelling (which this film has
very little of). The "twist" at the end is figured out about a 1/3 of
the way in. Lazy storytelling where props are laid for action scenes
for no apparent reason (why is there a motorcycle aboard a starship?).On the plus side, the cast is magnificent and the charm they bring to
their roles makes this enterprise watchable. It's too bad the script
and direction don't give them much to do. Mr. Lin, while a good action
director, isn't a good storyteller. While that's good for the Fast &
Furious franchise, Star Trek deserves better.
