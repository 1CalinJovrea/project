Omg, did these people go to the same movie I did, if so, hint:The Emperor is Naked!

First thing I'd like to say is this is the most over-rated movie I've
seen in 2016! I'll eschew the bandwagon and tell you the
truth.....boring, Boooooring.......unless you want to watch endless
sequences of the heroine's face "showing expression" and a seemingly
endless sequence of "swirling hair, swirling mist, swirling hair,
swirling mist...", well, you get the picture. This is simply yet another example of a filmmaker trying to awe us with
the CinemaScope because there's next to no story line there! Her co-star appears to have no purpose except to stare at her in awe,
while she stumbles around and experiences flashback after flashback of
supposedly meaningful memories? of her daughter. Oh, yeah, she's so
awe-inspiring that he can't help but fall in love with her.....gee,
didn't see THAT coming! I'm not bashing Amy Adams, as to spend and entire two hours pulling out
endless facial expressions of confusion and sadness, alternating first
one, then the other, surely takes great skill. Truthfully, the leap between her being selected to talk to the aliens
because she was simply a renowned linguist with an old pre-existing
security clearance to, "oh, yeah, actually she is the only person ON
EARTH who is clairvoyant", defies imagination. Give me a big fat break,
and start putting out movies with substance, and quit counting on "jump
on the band wagon reviews" to pump your attendance records! Ask anyone who attended this movie, "Would you bother to watch it
again?" I think not!
