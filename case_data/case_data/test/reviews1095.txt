Nothing new to see here folks.

Maleficent is the very first movie, in my long list of movies that I
have seen, that I wanted to walk out of.Lets start with the positives. Angelina Jolie was incredible. She was
beautiful, she was strong, and she executed Maleficent beautifully. Her
relationship with Aurora was refreshing and.... Nice. The magical world
was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia,
but it was still beautiful and engaging.But all of this does not save the movie. I expected to walk in and see
a movie similar to wicked, where we get a better understanding of the
bad guy. Yes, us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they
have done, but we can see where they come from. In the musical Wicked
(and even in the movie great and powerful Oz) we have sympathy for the
character we previously viewed as the bad guy. We could see where she
was coming from. In those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming
"the bad guy". Most were victims of circumstances. In Maleficent? It
was ferngully/Avatar all over again. Magical people, good! Man,
BAAAAAAD! Instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously
were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping
beauty, suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional
villain that created the evil Maleficent and later on becomes obsessed
with killing her! He was given NO aspects that would make us have even
the tiniest bit of sympathy, not the smallest bit of understanding. He
was just a vile man that broke Maleficents heart, mutilated her, and
cared only for power. Even when he tried to protect his daughter, it
was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a
person he loved. Yes, he graveled for her for a bit, begging Maleficent
not to curse her, but that was it. The movie left all traces of the
good of the humanity from it. OK, it had some of the good of humanity,
but the only human that was portrayed as good was Aurora.The movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief, but
ended up just portraying them as idiots, incompetent selfish creatures.
The fairies in the original Disney movie were clumsy and unused to
taking care of a child, but they were like that because for the first
time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve
things in life. If were as modern people were thrown in to the middle
of the woods and had to do everything by hand, then yes, we would be as
lost as they were. But they were given 16 years to evolve, to learn and
to grow. But no. The fairies were not given even the smallest of story
arc in this movie. They were creatures that switched sides when ever it
benefited the movie.I mentioned before that I liked the relationship that Maleficent and
Aurora had in the movie, but even that was shattered later on in the
movie. The solution to the problem was not a surprise at all. It was
taken straight out of Frozen. It was refreshing and incredible when
Frozen did it, because it was the first time Disney did not use the age
old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of "true love",
but when the same solution, the same realization is done in a movie
that came out within year of each other? It is boring and in no way
exiting, it is in no way entertaining. We have learned NOTHING new. Is
this Disney's new approach in relationship? Love between man and a
woman is obsolete, but the love between girl (family kind of love, not
lesbian, kids apparently can't handle that, and also, family excludes
male family members at this moment as well, only women can feel true
love!)is the strongest of all the loves in this world.In the end, the movie basically told the audience "yeah, the
movie/story that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda,
and I should know, because I am Queen Aurora, and I was there all
along!" The original Sleeping Beauty was rather black and white, good
VS.. Evil. When I walked in to the theatre I expected the lines to be
blurred, to be thought "all stories have two sides, not all of our
actions are blatantly good OR evil" but instead the writers and
directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil
even more visible. The good creatures are good no matter what they do,
and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way.In conclusion: The movie might have given some depth to a villain that
previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character, but in
exchange they created a new one dimensional villain, just switching the
genders around. The worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was
amazing, but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the end.
