The not as bad as you'd think Wall.....

two mercenaries from the West are captured by a military organisation
that are headquartered in a fortress on the Great Wall.In time, the duo get caught up in a battle between the Chinese warriors
and a supernatural menace that the Great Wall was built to repel....First things first, The Great Wall is a stupidly over the top film, and
it will have it's fair share of haters. In fact, you could call it this
years Jupiter Ascending.So if you do decide to see this at the cinema, find the biggest,
loudest screen you can find, and see it in 3D, because here it really
adds depth to an otherwise very flat film.Damon appears to be coasting through the film, in fact, it's one of his
most stilted performances, so luckily the rest of the cast really get
into the cheesy script, and make the most of it.Dafoe pops up every now and again to chew as much scenery as the beasts
that are attacking the titular wall, and adds nothing to the film.The film is basically and opening battle, a long Last Samurai type
middle where the two opposing sides gain respect for each other, and
the final climactic battle, which features hot air balloon attacks,
Magnets, and good old black powder.It is a load of old cobblers, but I wasn't bored in the slightest, but
that's maybe to the 3D being really quite effective, or wondering where
Damon's character originated from.This would make a great double bill with 1999's The 13th Warrior,
another film that is frustratingly entertaining...
