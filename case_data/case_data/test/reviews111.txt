What a waste of time and money.

Goodness this movie was bad. I cannot believe the high ratings it has
been getting. I am wondering if we watched the same film. I don't even
know where to begin.First of all, little things like gorgeous, obviously made up nuns annoy
me.Secondly, what a disjointed, clich√©-riddled movie. It didn't take me
long to just wish it would end. The plot is a joke. There really isn't one, surely not a proper one.
It's the arrival of the girls, exploration of the house, scary scenes,
more scary scenes, then the owners of the house reveal everything, and
then more scary scenes. Throughout the film, incredibly bad,
unbelieving acting. Anthony LaPaglia was the only upside for me. He
managed to portray a character that was obviously grief-stricken but
who would seem quite scary to young kids.There is so much that didn't make sense. One minute there is
electricity and the next it's back to match-lit lamps and darkness.
There is no reason presented to why the wife can't walk. And what the
heck kind of a reaction was that to Samuel pointing out to Sister
Charlotte a fourth nun in the picture, that she had never noticed
before?And finally the pace was SO slow that I was soon yawning and even the
scary scenes had absolutely no effect on me. By that point I was simply
numb.I cannot recommend this movie. Watch it if there is no alternative and
if you don't have to pay money for it.
