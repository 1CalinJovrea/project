A prequel that doesn't hold much value! [+33%]

When the directors of 2007's gore-spectacle 'Inside' (Alexandre
Bustillo & Julien Maury) took over the reins of a supposed prequel to
1974's Tobe Hooper classic 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', expectations
had indeed sky-rocketed. But what we get isn't even worthy of being
called a tribute to the TCM franchise, let alone be regarded as its
worthy canon prequel.The screenplay offers very little in terms of the surprises it throws
at the viewers (and TCM fans), thereby ending up strictly ho-hum. We
see a bunch of eccentrics creating a riot at a mental health facility
and escaping, with tidbits of the Sawyer family thrown in to engage the
viewer. In fact, the makers are trying to sell this movie around the
mystery of which character amongst the the leads ultimately evolves
into 'Leatherface'. Well, much to our dismay, even this stretch appears
annoyingly contrived (and to be honest, the poster kinda spoils it
already!). What we're subjected to for most part, is literally a lunatic couple
shotgun-killing their way to notoriety on their supposed escape (even
the big chainsaw-kill comes in too late) with a helpless nurse named
Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) who has unnecessarily been dragged along with
them while also being accompanied by a duo of brothers (the somewhat
compassionate Jackson and the bulky Bud). Lizzy is the character we're
supposed to root for, but sadly this does not work. We know as little
about her as we know about the rest of the zany troupe. The directors who're known to stage horrifically-exciting set- pieces,
resort to cheap tricks here (like a partial necro scene) in order to
augment the shock-value. The shot of a woman's derriere walking into a
barn surrounded by badlands (during one of the opening segments,
clearly reminding us of previous TCM films including the Michael Bay
funded remake) had just about raised my hopes a teeny weeny bit before
everything came crashing down. With no real thunderbolts in store for fans or non-fans, this prequel
falls head first into a pit of quick-sand, the real difference-maker in
the story being the weapons (shotguns, knives) that the characters
possess and not their personalities. You're bound to forget this movie
as soon as the credits roll.Verdict: Terrible!
