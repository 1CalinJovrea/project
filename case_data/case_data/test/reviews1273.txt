This is Michael Bay's best movie and a great movie in its own right

I want to set the record straight: I think Michael Bay directed a good
movie, not perfect, but really good and thought provoking as well. I
really liked it and the story stayed with me for a while.The key to the movie is that it takes us inside the head of a trio of
meatheads that plan to kill rich people, take their money, and live the
life they think they are due. The thing that Pain and Gain does well is
to show what actually fuels the murders: a combination of
self-delusion, misplaced pride, mediocrity, stupidity and jealousy. The
movie starts as a dark comedy until the point of no return is crossed,
and then the feeling changes from entertainment to revulsion.Answering a few remarks I have seen again and again: 1/ Comparison to
Fargo - yes the plot is similar. No it is not Fargo with sun, muscles
and dildos. Pain and Gain takes you inside the heads of the murderers
and hides none of their mediocrity and base instincts. Their normalcy
is their worst trait. Fargo puts you in the head of a normal lead
(Frances McDormand)faced with an abominable kidnapping and murder.
However, Fargo, although arguably a superior movie, does not take you
in the murderer's heads. It is a different movie.2/ Bay made the murderers likable - Has anyone who said that actually
seen the movie? Mackie, Walhberg and The Rock may be some of the more
likable actors out there but make no mistake: they play awful
individuals in that movie. The movie actually hid the fact that one of
the victim may have been a crook (real life story) just to avoid making
the murderers likable.3/ The story is unbelievable - Most of the unbelievable elements are
sadly true. Only a lost toe incident is totally made up. The rest has
been changed for cinematographic reasons, but it is all true. Sadly,
again.I am not sure if it is Michael Bay bashing, which has become a
tradition, or people and critics' real opinions. But I do think Bay is
due a bit more credit on this one. This is good work.
