This is how it works ?

It's incredible, the amount of money this movie has supposedly made .I am a huge fan of action movies; I have watched and rewatched all the
flicks with Stallone , Schwarzenegger, Stratham, and many of those with
the other known actors .The first Expendables movie I enjoyed a lot; however, this one is
taking it way beyond the silly, yet entertainable threshold .Where to start ?The acting is wooden, to say the least . Granted, the dialogues are
poorly written, and the attempts at humour and the references are
clumsy and forced .But most of the known actors in this movie can do so much better, have
done so in other roles , and are so experienced, that I find it hard to
comprehend how they could agree to do this script . The money, of
course, yet I somehow think that their performance in this movie will
seriously hurt their career prospects .This is sad for veterans like Van Damme and Lundgren, who did great in
their recent projects to add some substance to their pedigree, but
where cast as 2 dimensional morons for this .The action is decent, though not very original, and very much on the
silly side . I don't mind if it's realistic, but this is just action
for action's sake, and thrown in like random video clips ; the action
scenes don't even pretend to be real, as they do in any good action
movie, but are intentionally created like circus acts .Which brings me to editing; you know those over-sized Legos for
toddlers ? The kids can put them together , it's easy and they fit ,
but it's just a bunch of bricks, no gaps but the colors don't match and
there is no discernible shape . That's this movie .The pieces somehow fit, never match, but everything got squeezed in
that was available and deemed necessary , no matter how poorly executed
. All boxes ticked, job done . Some parts even seem to have been shot
seperatly and poorly stuck together, like some of the Schwarzenegger
appearances; scenes jump from one environment to the next, held
together by some half sentence in the previous scene .What really killed it for me, was Chuck Norris - the straw and the
camel's back .It's not just that he is such a bad actor, and doesn't even look like
himself anymore; take Steven Seagal as an example - he is horrible, but
he can be made fun of easily and blended into this kind of movie (if
the writers had had any sense of humor to start with) . But Norris
isn't funny, nothing about him is . An empty shell with a beard glued
to it, his legacy is being known for not worth being known .Yet still he got a big part in the later stages of the movie - randomly
and inexplicably thrown in, like everything else .It's truly bad movie, and goes to show how marketing can even make a
skeleton effort of a movie into a success .
