Making a final killing

This is my review of The Purge: Election Year (spoiler free)*** (3/5)Cast: Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Mitchell, Mykelti WilliamsonPlot: America, 2025. As public sentiment rises against the Purge,
ruling class the New Founding Fathers Of America target Presidential
candidate Charlotte Roan (Mitchell), who's lobbying to end the annual
lawless mayhem. She'll need the help of Leo Barnes (Grillo) if she's to
survive the night.With his scary vision of a near-future United States where all crime
including murder is legal for one night in order to keep the peace for
the rest of the rest of the year, writer/director James DeMonaco has
crafted a successful, thrifty franchise. As real-world America slides
further into electoral madness, the latest Purge feels more apt than
ever, even as it ramps up the terrifying politics and the slow-motion
violence. Although Election Year comes dangerously close to repeating
or even remaking the first follow-up 2014's The Purge: Anarchy we're
once again out on the streets close to the action but this time in
Washington DC, (weirdly filmed in Providence, Rhode Island) as opposed
to Los Angeles, though at this it could really be 'Anycity, USA' as our
heroes try to find safety. Barnes, Grillo's reliably relatable tough
guy, must this time shepherd Mitchell's determined Roan through the
madness to keep her political chances  and, more importantly, her 
alive. The added wrinkle here is that the rule protecting governmental
people has been relaxed, and the New Founding Fathers have not only
paid off a chunk of her security detail, they've also sent a mercenary
to take her out, because they enforce a new rule that will now make
government officials of ranking ten vulnerable for the night, so now
the New Founding Fathers will kill everybody who is involved.Set two years after the merciless killings in The Purge: Anarchy (2014)
Leo Barnes (Grillo) who is now head of security for Senator Charlie, he
and his employer has to survive as they put it "one last purge." This
film takes you right into the action something that the first one
failed to do now The Purge: Anarchy was actually better than the first
although this despite all its craziness and its terrible scripting it
is a very entertaining end to the trilogy, although not what you might
have thought it was because writer/director James DeMonaco keeps the
same style as he did in the previous it unfortunately fails to deliver
one thing and that is an actual story, it just continues as a psycho
killer film and all though it has pretty good action and good acting
from Frank Grillo and Mitchell and fortunately down have to go down the
romance route  no time for love when you're on the run from a
skull-emblazoned drone., it fails to deliver in everything else. It
also decides to add not only torture which has a bad impact on the film
but also adds a schlocky alternative to Trump vs Clinton not exactly a
great way of putting it, but you get the idea. Good things about the film it adds a creepy song which is what many
good horrors like Nightmare on Elm Street tend to do, but instead of
"Freddy is coming for you" it adds a new spin and is put 'we are gonna
purge tonight', in a very creepy tone which gives it a dark and edgy
feel to the film. It's much more suspenseful because with the first one
it had suspense but didn't do anything else besides that and the second
one had plenty of suspense and action of course but lacked the
craziness that this one has and although some killers come out dressed
as previous American Presidents it does get more than that, but that is
the start and the middle of the crazy. Weirdly enough in the first two
government officials ranking above ten weren't affected during the
Purge night, but now in this one everyone is affected but that's
basically nobody wants Charlie Roan as the President so the killers try
to make a killing to get rid of her, but don't quite succeed.Amongst the anguish and pain it decides to take a religious turn but
instead of praying it makes it turn out that the people who don't kill
are sinners as the film puts it, and although that idea is original it
really wasn't needed in a film that was already cold hearted but this
adds even more cold heartedness. We should really forgive this series
for taking pride in creepy masks and world class warfare. This one is
very problematic and simplistic but keeps the idea alive and although
it may not be the best in a series that takes pride in senseless
killing, it's still an enjoyable addition to the trilogy and a pretty
good ending. This final film adds a killing end to the surprisingly
successful B-movie franchise and maintains to keep the thrills and the
entertainment just as well as the previous two. VERDICT: Election Year maintains the nervy tension that made the first
film entertaining, but doubles down on the political metaphors,
overwhelming you with its soap-box rhetoric. 6/10 an enjoyable conclusion
