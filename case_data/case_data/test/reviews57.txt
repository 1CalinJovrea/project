Romantic Horror. Excellent acting, lacking script and ending. Still worthy for a low budget film!

Well, I usually try to maintain at least the minimal level of
objectivity in my reviews, but in this case I find myself unable to do
so. The first review that loaded when I opened this film's page
complained about the "cliched", "nauseating" and "painful" acting and
portray of romance. I am happy to say that I found that review to be as
far away from the truth as possible.Call me a hopeless romantic, but I like saying beautiful scenes of true
love and romance. The first half of The Honeymoon gives us just that -
a beautiful couple who found their missing piece in each other, getting
married as a celebration of their undying devotion and going away on a
honeymoon. Slightly corny? Perhaps. Clich√©d? We'd wish, not nowadays...
I personally found it to be touching, moving and eye-watering. May we
all know such love in our lives.Then there's the acting, which I found to be not half bad! I think the
entire cast of four has done an excellent job. Rose Leslie is great as
the loving new wife going through something supernatural she doesn't
yet comprehend. Harry Treadaway is a profound loving husband having to
deal with the sudden terrifying change in his newlywed wife. Lastly but
not least, Ben Huber and Hanna Brown, with the few minutes of camera
time they have received, have done exactly what they were supposed to
do and exactly the way they were supposed to do it, right on the spot!As for the script - I'm not sure I'm really happy with the story and
supposed twist. I didn't feel like the outcome justified the build- up
(which was excellent), and I can't help but rule that this film suffers
from the bane of the Horror genre - an anticlimactic ending. Having an
at least 8.5 rated acting with a no higher than 5 rated story is what
made me decide the overall rate of the Honeymoon, seeing as how the
acting and story are pretty much the only features worth mentioning for
a devout Horror fan viewer such as myself.All in all, you could find Horror films that are more frightening and
horrific, and simply better. But I doubt you would find one more
romantic, and we may have just witnessed the birth of the Romantic
Horror sub-genre. Regardless, I thing the film is definitely worth
watching, especially for couples who enjoy Horror and don't expect
every film to be a phenomenon. Let us also not forget that this a
single location low budget film, that still succeeds in being fun and
not that bad! I say, as always, watch it and judge for yourselves.
