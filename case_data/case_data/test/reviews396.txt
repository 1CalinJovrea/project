Complete WOTAM

Complete WOTAM (Waste Of Time And Money)- has to be one of the very
worst plots I've ever seen put to the big screen! Only a brain dead
moron could possibly enjoy this piece of crap. I not only want my $22
back I want damages for the mental angst I incurred watching this
nonsense. The plot was ridiculous, the script was written entirely in
clich√©s, the acting from the main characters was woeful, proof positive
that Gerard Butler can't act to save his life but then again he
positively shone when paired with Jim Sturgess who was just terrible
and appears to be an emotional cripple. The two female leads, Abbie
Cornish and Alexandra Maria Lara, were the saving graces in the acting
stakes. I could throw in some spoilers but the wounds are just too
fresh to go there at the moment. Hollywood has gotten so disrespectful
of their audience these days that they appear happy to throw up
anything these days without any attention to quality control. It has
been suggested that if you put enough monkeys in front of enough
keyboards they will eventually tap out the complete works of
Shakespeare. Well obviously illiterate monkeys wrote the script to this
one but it is a very long way short of Shakespeare. I give POS 2/10 and
one of those was only because it was in color! Wait for it to come to
Free-to-Air would be my suggestion.
