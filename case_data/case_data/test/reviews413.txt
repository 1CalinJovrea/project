Christopher Walken is brilliant

I watched this movie last week and I am still returning to re watch
because it contains some of the most fascinating scenes I have ever
watched. I think the casting was very good. Sam Rockwell, who had already pulled
off a slowly degrading and paranoid character living in moon alone,
really succeeds in bearing the weight of the story. He is essentially
causes almost all the progress single handedly and the parts really fit
together.Colin Farrell, who is a favorite of the director is another good flavor
but I didn't really get impressed with his acting or his character.
Because his character has almost no impact, he is dragged along to
different situations and usually has no bearing in the movie. Maybe it
supposed to represent the director in some level but it is very
interesting to see the story teller who doesn't even realize how little
control he has on his own story.But I am mainly reviewing this title to praise Christopher Walken.
Every one of is scenes are perfect, he is just brilliant. I have always
liked him but I could never imagine that I would be impressed this much
with his acting. I think the character is very interesting, his dialogs
really fit the atmosphere and in general it was a very essential part
of a good story.
