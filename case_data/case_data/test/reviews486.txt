Being an Excerpt of a letter to my Cousine; or, The Review

... I enjoyed the Experience and the Filme for the Comedye it was; for
how, thought I, could it be that a Filme so large (and enacted by
Beings among whom we might account the mighty Thor, Abraham Lincoln,
the grand-father of Alle Behemothes, and one Scare-crow) be yet writ so
Small across such a vast Screene.And the experience for What itself Was: being at the Omni-Theatre of
the Minnesota Zoological Gardens, before a Screene some Ninety feet
across and Seventy high, with a Sounde-system that might rival the
bellowing of Zeus or Vesuvius, shared on a drizzly December night
betwixt Myselfe and sixteen gentle Strangers, the youngest of whom
appeared to be a Childe of some Ten Years, the eldest a Gentleman of
perhaps Sixty-five.A bucket of Popped-corn and a sugary Soda provided my repast.The Failings of the Filme did unfortunately outnumber its Strengths,
for while one Weasel-Lad, who was Cousine to the shippe's Captain, did
provide a fine Scene of noble yet bloody Sacrifice toward the
Conclusion, beforehande we Film-goers were made to bear Witnesse to the
Unholy Slaughter of a blameless Behemothe, various stormes at Sea that
seemed the Products of a Television Filme, and the Unspeakable Mangling
of Accents by Mssrs. Thor and Scare-crow, which said mangling, whilst
the Source of much-needed Laughter, yet leaves the Bones of my Eares in
Knots some dayes later.In closing, deare Cousin, let me saye that the greatest Flaw of this
Filme lies in its Unfathomable Mediocrity: for, given the Strength of
its Pedigree, of its Tale and Themes, we might finde ourselves asked to
forgive the mighty Man-o'-War placing Fifthe in a Tortoise-race.I remaine, with all kind Regarde,Your faithful Taco-nites
