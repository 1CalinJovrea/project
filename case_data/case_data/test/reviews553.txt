"Are you doing something desperate? Something we can't clean up this time?"

You had me at "Tom Hardy and a puppy."The Drop stars Tom Hardy as Bob Saginowski, a bartender at a corner bar
that also serves as a drop location for mob money. James Gandolfini
plays Marv (who runs the bar) and Noomi Rapace is here as Bob's main
squeeze.The story isn't a complicated one, but the characters stay busy and
have clear motivation. To be honest, there isn't much to the story at
all, but this movie will keep your interest because of one thing - Tom
Hardy. Tom Hardy is an on screen chameleon. He's fantastic here as Bob, a
vulnerable 'down-and-almost-outer' just trying to scrape by. Things
change for the creepy when he finds a baby pitbull in a trash can one
night on his way home from work. It's hard to believe this guy was
Charlie Bronson in the fantastic Bronson (2008). Heck, while Bob stands
toe to toe with a local trouble maker at one point during the film, I
couldn't help but think "this guy broke Batman's back as Bane...surely
he can beat the hell out of this schmuck!". It was fun watching Hardy
here with his thick Brooklyn accent - he clearly stole the show.James Gandolfini holds his own as an old, washed up gangster in his
final role - the same magnetism he always had on screen - but I think
that the other main key to this flick is the terrifying Eric Deeds,
played by Matthias Schoenaerts. While watching, it's hard to not think
about what you would do if confronted by the reality of a guy like
Deeds stalking your every move. His performance is simply chilling.
Noomi Rapace is adequate as Nadia. I found her role in the movie to be
pretty organic and unforced, but I do think she is the weakest thing
about the story.Overall, I thought that The Drop was a very good crime story. The plot
is nothing that you haven't seen before, but the cast does a fantastic
job and the ending is really freaking cool.My final grade: B+
