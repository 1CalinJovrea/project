typical Hollywood comedy

First of all,it's not that funny as it showed in the trailer.While
watching jokes of the movie ,i hardly laughed.So, You will be getting
bored after just 5 minutes.There is no erotic scenes, let alone a good
jokes.And the saddest part is , they tried to be funny in every way
possible.Here is the reason why i could not force my self to like itit does not have any plot/ story , let along the acting.i am getting
the felling that , directors tend to think , they does not need any
story line for comedy movie without some cheap jokes.There is no twist
, no turn of event.They are hardly put any thought on topic.They tried
to pass along with some weird sex scenes and some plain sex scenes.
They need to understand that people do not have any interest to see 37
years old actress's saggy bottom , let along 45 years old actors.Jason segal should try to come out from his comfort zone.Try some new
characters .I loved his performance on HIMYM or in Forgetting sharah
marshal.But you can not carry the same character in every movie you
made.Its like watching series of drama .There is hardly any difference
between the roles he played in those movies.Every time you can not
become the whining boy frnd or husband and expect people to like
it.Grow a pair.How many times , we have to watch movies like this , i don't know.All
the jokes are outdated,so actors who pass their prime , desperately
showing some flesh (u have to agree surgeon have done wonder on their
body).So, i am recommending , don't fall in the trap , you will regret
it.
