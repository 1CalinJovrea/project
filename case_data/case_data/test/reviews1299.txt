How to Destroy the Past with the Mediocrity of the Present

In 1984, fans of sci-fi with action were surprised by "Terminator", one
of the best films of this genre in the cinema industry. Followed by the
excellent sequel "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991), the franchise
apparently ended in 2003 with "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines".
However, in 2008, it was released the series "Terminator: The Sarah
Connor Chronicles" that also worked well showing how Sarah and John
Connor survived along the years. In 2009, the exhausted franchise was
revived by Hollywood with "Terminator Salvation". Unfortunately "Terminator Genisys" is a typical example of the present
days of Hollywood that insists in destroying great films from the past
with the mediocrity of the present writers. This time, the studio does
not only destroy the franchise but also the character John Connor and
the initial vulnerability of Sarah Connor. The number of
inconsistencies and paradoxes in the "butterfly effect" of the story is
amazing. The best part of this movie is the smile of Pops. My vote is
four.Title (Brazil): "O Exterminador do Futuro: GÃªnesis" ("The Terminator
from the Future: Genisys")
