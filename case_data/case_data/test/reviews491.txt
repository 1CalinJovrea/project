Good message, however...

This movie is essentially a sci-fi version of the 1998 movie
"Pleasantville". Both movies have similar themes and the same core
message. Watch Pleasantville instead, it tells the story much better.The Giver takes itself too seriously and there are so many details in
the movie that just do not add up.Like for example, why does the role of "the giver" even exist when the
rulers of the community obviously want to keep the truth a secret? Why
not get rid of the role of the giver all together and not have to worry
about the truth coming out???If you were disappointed by this movie then PLEASE watch Pleasantville.
