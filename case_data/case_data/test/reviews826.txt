Works as a short film, but not as a feature length one

I was looking forward to this film because I loved the original short,
but when I saw it, I was disappointed. The kids who looked like horror movie characters were just distracting.
The finale where the kids create giant monsters was just too far
fetched. The original movie worked because of the focus on Sparky, and
this movie is more focused on the filler characters.Oh look, Catherine O'Hara is playing a mother........ AGAIN!Also, what about the cat that gets killed at the end? That poor girl.
She'll miss that cat.When they did actually reinact moments from the original, that's when
it worked. But the rest of the movie is unfunny and dull.Oh, and we have a poo joke about ten minutes in. Shame on you, Tim.Well, it's nice to see a Burton film without Depp and Carter in it.
