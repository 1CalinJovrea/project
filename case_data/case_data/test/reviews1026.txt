Solid if not at all subtle abuse drama

I enjoyed the writing of this film, it was interesting, disturbing and
uncompromising in dealing with the most taboo of topics. A few things
really irritated me and stopped me from enjoying it as much as i
should. Rooney Mara's accent is, well, rubbish. Ben Mendelsohn just
plays an Aussie even though he pulled off the English accent in Starred
up. Riz Ahmed's character is underused and almost pointless to the
story. Having work problems continually interrupt their tense
conversations became repetitive and stale. However, the writing was
still so good I paid attention all the way through and did not regret
watching it when it was over. They should have cast someone else in the lead role as Mara, a good
actor but simply not fit for this part, is the biggest factor in
stopping the movie hit as hard as it should. Still, it is a thought
provoking and pretty creepy study of unacceptable sexual desire.
