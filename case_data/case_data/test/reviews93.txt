Aside from the stripping there's nothing new  here but I was never bored

This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike
(Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction
in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper.
He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked
on drugs and things get dangerous.First let's get the nude issue out of the way. There is only one full
frontal in the movie--it's off to the side, is partially blocked and is
probably faked. It's also very funny. There's mostly butt shots only
but all are from Tatum, Pettyfer and Adam Rodriguez. This movie is NOT
about the nudity. The movie moves slow (although I was never bored) and
main events happen off screen OR are never explained! Still the movie
works. For one thing all the acting is good. I was surprised at how
good Tatum was. I never thought he could act till this. He captures his
character perfectly. Pettyfer was equally good as Adam. Even Matthew
McConaughey was good as the group's owner named Dallas. The strip acts
themselves are incredible. All the guys are in good shape and Tatum
shows some moves that are jaw-dropping! However they're not shot in an
exploitive fashion. They're done in a matter of fact way that actually
makes them seem quite funny. This movie (script wise) shows us nothing
new but it was well-made and entertaining. This is not just for women
and gay men--I think everyone would enjoy it. I give it a 7.
