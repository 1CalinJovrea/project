Not a bad end to a fun trilogy

Taken 3 is a step down from Taken 2, itself a lesser film than the
original. But that is to be expected and forgiven. The title could be
considered an unimaginative misnomer, but it makes marketing sense.Aside from the part of Stuart (husband to Famke Janssen's Lenore), the
casting is consistent. The addition of Forest Whitaker as a smart cop
is for me something of a saving grace since Taken 3 offers up
absurdities without question. On reflection, however, the plot has
enough coherence to do the trilogy justice. Moreover, it is a joy to
see Liam Neeson in this role again.The director Olivier Megaton has an irksome penchant for frenetic,
up-close, disorienting action sequences whereby shots are rarely longer
than two seconds. He was a little better in this regard for Taken 2,
which had the benefit of superior choreography.Another personal point of contention is the casting of Sam Spruell as
the top Russian villain. He has not an imposing physical constitution
and quite frankly brings to mind Jim Carrey, who sported the same
haircut in the Dumb and Dumber movies. Not at all what I want in a
villain.I generally enjoy the films I see, and this onenotwithstanding the
negativesis no exception. However, I would not recommend it for people
who are more stern in matters of taste.
