The reason why i avoid watching trailers for comedies.

Just to note i haven't watched "Borat" or "Bruno",so i only kinda knew
what to expect from the movie.In short it's a really great film,filed with great humour and great
actors,that doesn't take itself too seriously and it shouldn't be taken
seriously from the audience around the globe.It's lighthearted comedy
for those who have a hour or two to spare.The main problem for me (as noted in the title) is that the trailer
gave away maybe 70% of the really really funny parts.I remember seeing
the trailer for the first time i laughed for a good 5 minutes after it
ended.The second time i saw it,it actually convinced me to go and see
the movie later on,expecting much more from it.In the end i can't say i was disappointed i still think it's a great
movie,just with a trailer that gives away less of the really funny
moments it would have been a much,much more memorable experience.But i
guess that's my mistake since i know that trailers usually give away
50% of the comedies these days.
