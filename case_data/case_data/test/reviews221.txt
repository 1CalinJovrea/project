Offensive but funny

This film is crass, stupid, offensive, childish, crude, and very very
funny. It is if Team America and There is Something About Mary both got
drunk, ended up in bed together and this is their brat of a kid out in
the streets of New York running wild.There is something here to offend everyone, but it is especially
offensive to anyone from the Middle East or Muslim. You could argue
that Sacha Baron Cohen is making some point about the West's regard for
Middle Eastern dictators, but I suspect he just wants to make the
audience laugh and so produce a box office success.A guilty pleasure.
