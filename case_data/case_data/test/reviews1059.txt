Honeybee........

Newly-weds Paul and Bea travel to a remote lake country for their
honeymoon. Shortly after arriving, and meeting with one of Bea's old friends, who
is acting rather erratically, Paul finds Bea wandering and disoriented
in the middle of the night. As she becomes more distant and her behaviour increasingly melancholic,
Paul begins to suspect something more than sleepwalking took place in
the woods......It's a simple premise, couple go on the titular holiday, she's found
naked in the middle of the night, and then becomes, well to say distant
isn't giving it justice, but any normal non-cinematic couple would just
leave, but hey, this their Honeymoon, so lets see what happens.And that's my only quibble about the film. There is one point where
Paul is watching Bea in the bathroom talking to herself, and this was
the point where I was talking loudly to the screen, willing Paul just
to grab her and leave.But it wouldn't make a good film then would it?There is a point in the film where the narrative literally changes
genre, and although the film does have an element of horror to the
story, it most certainly isn't come the end of the film, even though
it's still an eerie experience.But the writers do a good job of keeping the viewer in his/hers toes.
Even though you know what has happened to Bea, you cannot help but
question Paul's sanity throughout the third act.It's well acted, the setting suitably sinister, and the minimal cast,
gives it an air of claustrophobia.A nice little movie that I fear a lot will miss out on.
