The movie didn't necessarily make me into a brony but... (possible spoilers)

The movie is great and is praiseworthy. The animation is engaging to
the eye, and it enables to arouse interest in going along with the
characters & plot.The characters are great, such that there's a diverse disposition for
each array of character. This is probably an exaggeration, once you
realize in the end that Fluttershy is voiced also by the same person
who voiced Pinkie Pie, and Apple Jack & Rainbow Dash being voiced by
one person as well. The main character is Twilight Sparkle (consistent enough with the
movie poster), and we get to explore her power as a princess, which is
Power of Friendship. The antagonist is a new/guest character named
Tempest (Emily Blunt), a disenfranchised pony who has become calloused
and driven. If you don't care about My Little Pony at all, Tempest is
the powerful character you'd like to watch. The character of Tempest
however will take you on a journey to an unexpected destination,
because Tempest's interaction with Twilight Sparkle becomes very
important. Another antagonist, Stormking is just as important as
Princess Celestia, Princess Luna and Princess Candence.There is a cat character, Capper, who you'd soon realize is a smooth
talking cat. Capper would fall into the male prototype character
category in the midst of female characters, worthy of their fancy,
disdain and then fancy again. There are various absurd situations (mostly because of Pinky Pie) the
characters are put into, and as a group, you are able to assess,
compare and contrast the reactions of each member of the group. Again,
the animation conveys the situation well, and because of its comical
effect, it engages the mind into hilarity. The movie is quite an adventurous one, and would appeal to any audience
other than young girls. The plot is a rather good one, and the pacing
moves along quite well. For those who have seen adventure films before,
one may realize that the movie captures recognizable thrilling, and
momentous stages of an adventure. Again, the coloring of each backdrop,
background, is lucid & vibrant, with a great use of acute hues.The animation quality of the movie is good; it appears to be a mixture
of rotoscoping, mixed with 2D hand animation (I guess by computer). The
coloring is with a balanced saturation and hues.I could digress about the movie in its trivialities, but in summary,
the movie is great. I enjoy it. It didn't make me into a brony though
(that's probably because I don't know what brony really is or what he
does).
