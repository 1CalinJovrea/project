A Mildly Funny Film That's Been Done Before and Better

Let's be honest here...Rough Night is probably the most unoriginal idea
to hit theaters this summer. It has the storyline of Peter Berg's 1998
film Very Bad Things with a Weekend at Bernie's twist. Starring
Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Zoe Kravitz, the film's star
power seems to have no shortage but the film's screenplay doesn't know
what it wants to be. There are far too few thrills to classify it a
thriller and, as far comedy is concerned, it is severely lacking. So
we're given this cookie-cutter film that does its job (more or less). The film opens Hangover style, it introduces us to the gang of girls as
they make their way to the bachelorette weekend to end all bachelorette
weekends. Scarlett Johasson plays the bride to be while her bridesmaids
are either overly sexual or prudes. There is not much of an in-between.
No character felt real. They all felt like they were written specific
to this event and that really didn't bode well with me. In a
situational comedy like this, it helps to have a character we can
relate to. This film really doesn't have a relateable character, just
mere pawns in the film's game. The story itself moves pretty well
through it's self proclaimed rough night but doesn't really latch on to
you as a viewer. You're pretty much there to watch the ride...nothing
else.The cast here is probably the best part of the film. Between the
gravitas Johansson brings to the screen and the intrigue of Zoe Kravitz
and the off the wall banter from Kate McKinnon, it would be a lie if I
said they weren't at least fun to watch. The problem the film has is
its dialog. If the film's goal wasn't to promote feminism and a
pro-female image, I'd say it is passable. But the film portrays women
either as sex-crazed drunkards or uptight prudes and coming off of
Wonder Woman, this film seems like a slap in the face. Maybe it is poor
timing or maybe it is true, only time will tell. Overall, the film isn't horrible. It features good performances from
Kate McKinnon and Scarlett Johansson and makes the best of its
boderline terrible script. It sustains its 101 minute runtime and fills
them with countless penis jokes (Jillian Bell relies on them annoyingly
too much) and features some decent moments of situational comedy that
could have landed way better but they still land nonetheless. Either
way, it is a passable film but not one that I'd recommend spending
money to see in the theater.
