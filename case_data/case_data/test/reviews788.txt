Found it hard to enjoy this movie even with delectable food in it

I watched this movie simply because it starred Bradley Cooper and
because I couldn't imagine a movie about food wouldn't be enjoyable.
But the truth is I felt it was far away from being scrumptious. Bradley Cooper's acting was not bad I should say, but it was just hard
to love the character who was like an active volcano. Even at the end
of the movie, I still feel he is gonna erupt anytime. The movie gave me
the feeling that it wanted to touch on something but it never really
reached there. There is always some distance between what it wants to
tell and what it tells. Just like the part about Adam's history in
Paris, I eagerly wanted to know how terrible it went all throughout the
movie, but in the end I only got the impression it was pretty ugly.
Some flashbacks might have helped. And what's the point of the language
change? The intermittent use of French didn't add to the plot of the
movie. It only gave a frail point that they used to live in Paris. And
that's it.The only scene I liked is the birthday cake Adam made for Helene's
daughter. The only few minutes I felt I was enjoying it a bit. It was a
tiny triumph overwhelmed by the tormenting characterization.
