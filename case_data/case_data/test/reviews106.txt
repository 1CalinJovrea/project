Was this shot on film? Cause there's a lot of chemistry involved!

This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes.
Including the closing credits, that you need to dry your eyes and think
about what you just saw. It's the inspiring story of two young people
who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of
dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of
life; because their Â„eternity" has an expiration date, set by Hazels
terminal illness: Cancer. As the viewer is put on an emotional roller-coaster, alongside the
feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share, this
movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds. And
through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are
amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions.The writing and directing is so brilliantly executed, that you have
sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to (short)
life. Even when they oppose another you feel unable to take sides.
Because you find yourself sharing both. And when the credits role -
like the tears on your cheek - you realize, that these opposing views
are one and the same after all: Life.
