Really Great LMFAO movie! A must watch for this summer!

For a good all out can't stop laugh you must go watch this. I laughed
so much I had stomach pains and tears in my eyes. It was a little bit
longer than I was prepared for but well worth the time. Rebel Wilson
was AMAZING!!! Her acting skills are on point and flawless. She is very
funny and she's not afraid to try anything out of the norm. She will
make you laugh and fall in love with her all at the same time. The plot
and the ending was predictable because it follows the same patterns as
the first movie but I still found it very tasteful and comforting.
Often times sequels fall short but this one made me love it even more.
I normally do not find movies with an all female cast funny but this
time I was surprised! If you're wondering whether or not you should
take your boyfriend, husband, brother or any other masculine man to go
watch this because of hesitation that he might find it boring and nag
about having to be dragged to watch this then you don't have to worry.
There is a lot of male approved humor in this chick flick. I'm
definitely going to buy the DVD when it comes out.
