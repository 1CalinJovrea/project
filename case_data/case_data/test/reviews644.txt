A disgrace of a movie

I just saw the first projection at Chiang Mai Thailand. This is one of
the most horrible movies i have ever seen. Please don't waste your
money. The story makes no sense. The characters are stiff like frozen
cucumbers, the purpose and motivations are completely ridiculous. This
is a disgrace of a movie. It is as if the director wanted to create the
horrible anti point break. Oh My God! Oh My Buddha! Wasted life! There
is no logic, the characters are half-dimensional, the star is beyond
ridiculous and annoying, the girl is on drugs, the pace is awful they
jump from scene to scene like monkeys jump from tree to tree. The
director clearly had no vision. I don't know what to say other than
STAY AWAY. STAY AWAY.
