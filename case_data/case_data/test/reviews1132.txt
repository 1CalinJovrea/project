Intricate Escapes and More History on Bond

Spectre is one of the best Bond films yet.. It's up there with Skyfall
and Goldfinger. The movie featured a little more romance than the
usual. The cinematography and the music score for this film really made
the scenes grip the viewer. It was an interesting take to have Bond's
adopted brother be the villain. It made the plot a lot darker and the
fact that he described himself as the "author of all your pain",
implied that this man was a way bigger threat, because he most likely
had been sabotaging things for years. The last scene with the booby
traps and the girl in danger was a little clich√©, but it was nice to
see how much thought went into it. Whether it was CGI or makeup, the
antagonist looked spooky with the missing eye. With the combination of
all the camera surveillance and the immense knowledge the enemy group
had on James Bond, this is one of the few films that really makes the
audience fear for him. It's a nonstop ride from start to finish with a
little humor, and just enough back story to make the people care. WELL
DONE.
