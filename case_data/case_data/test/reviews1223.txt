Enjoyable

Watched this through netflix - I liked not having to go to cinema to
watch it - don't think it needs the big screen for special effects,
sound or big expansive shots. Enjoyed the laughs. Storyline was good
enough, not great - really just a vehicle for funnies. Enjoyed watching
Taylor L act a completely different character. Some of the mushie bits
and the few slap stick body part grotesque scenes were too cringey for
me. Over all enjoyable with quotable parts. There's so many movies out now
but few that I find are more than mediocre - this one just pips over
mediocre mark :)
