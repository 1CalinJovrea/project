Good acting and beautiful scenery

I almost didn't watch this film due to its average rating and some of
the reviews here. I suspect the negative reviews have more to do with
people rigid world views and moral inclinations than actual capacity to
distinguish any kind of subtlety in the way the story unfolds. Interestingly it doesn't actually unfold as one would expect and as
some commentators have claimed. Naomi Watts acting is excellent and the emotions she conveys make the
story believable. As for the 2 young surfer dudes, one of them actually looks a bit like
Julian Wilson (Top pro surfer) which should be a pleasant surprise for
the ladies out there.The location, beach houses, cinematography are beautiful and makes you
want to move to Australia. Just for that the movie is worth watching.
