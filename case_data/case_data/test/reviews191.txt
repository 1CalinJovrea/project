Read the Book the movie blows!

Really the book is much much 100% better. The movie was awful, choppy
crap casting. I realize you can't put everything from a book in a movie
but seriously this movie was choppy at best no smooth flow. Why did you
have to muck the movie up this badly? Rose was supposed to be
beautiful, curvy, Turkish decent, sassy. This movie made here seem weak
and in the books she was not weak. Lissa was supposed to be charismatic
and lovable/likable. The actress didn't pull that off. Dimitri was
supposed to be a Godlike guardian that liked to read western novels.
Missed the mark there. Bad movie makers bad naughty shame on you They
suck at school and you suck at movies. ---Le sigh
