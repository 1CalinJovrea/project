Enough to entertain, but fail to dramatize...

It's always intriguing with an origin story, because it allows viewers
to experience the change, in this case the man who will then become the
monster we know as Dracula. This film did just enough on that part,
while being sufficiently entertaining as an action flick. But it came
with many minor flaws, one that culminates in a less overall dramatic
experience.On the good part, the action sequences were great, supported by some
well worked visual effects. The cast is also brilliant, most notably
Luke Evans and Charles Dance. Dominic Cooper portrayed a bad guy for
the second time this year, and though he can perform, he never really
looked the menacing villain. He never felt like a threat and neither
was his men, so there was little suspense throughout the film. There
was more suspense towards the very end, but it did not culminate in a
fight, promptly ending the movie in it's rather short running time.As an untold story, it's good to see the reasons and the set up as to
how this man had to become the monster, yet it was not properly
explored. The case was that Vlad was supposed to resist the temptation
of human blood, but it was never explored in depth except for one
initial moment. It could have been more dramatic if more scenes show of
his struggle, and then maybe along with the repercussions that he may
be hurting his own family because of this, which will ultimately be way
more dramatic. Several other details like this were not properly
explored, which made it a rather straightforward story, enough to make
the plot move, but not to make it a dramatic experience.VERDICT:Good: Great action sequences, Decent visual effects, Excellent castBad: Many minor flaws in the plot, Little suspenseSCORE: 6.5(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)
