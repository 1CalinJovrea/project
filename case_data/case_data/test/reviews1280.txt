Predictable teen movie

A movie about a tomboy girl who joins a acappela girlgroup which is in
a fight with a boygroup. The girl falls in love with a boy, wants to
change the boring stigma of the acapella group, gets in a fight with
the lead girl (queen B) and has a troubled relationship with her
father: all the classical ingredients for a teen movie.The only reason why I don't give this movie a 1 out of 10 is because of
Rebel Wilson: an extremely talented actress who improvised a lot in the
movie which made it a little bit more bearable.Pitch Perfect is just a typical teen movie: predictable jokes,
predictable characters and a predictable storyline. So its not a
surprise that this movie can be described in one word: predictable.If you are between the age of 14/16; I'm sure you will enjoy this
movie, especially if you haven't seen a lot of these kind of movies.
But if you are in your twenties and pretty much watched all of the
classical teen movies, this is just a waste of your time.
