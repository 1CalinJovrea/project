Connections

I want this movie to come out on DVD now so I can watch all the movies
in the right order :P. I also love how people clapped when they thought
Vin died. I was like have you not seen Tokyo drift? I also like how
they connected this film to Tokyo drift. I finally get the back story
on it. I loved this movie and am looking forward to them making more. I
am also glad they brought in Statham. I was wondering why Vin came to
Tokyo but now I know. All the connections in this film were done very
well. It was good to see the full team back together again and them
come back home where they belong. I am interested in seeing how
Statham's role is for this movie if he plays the same type he does in
his other movies.
