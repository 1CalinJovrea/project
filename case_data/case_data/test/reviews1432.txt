Unfaithful to the source but also underwhelming as a whole.

I liked the book. I watched this with an open mind that it may be
"altered" to be more entertaining as a movie.Still thought it was way too far off from the book to even have the
name "World War Z". If they were going to change this much, there was
no need to use WWZ. To people who don't know the book, they won't care.
To those who do, they will be insulted by the movie. Isn't the whole
point of adapting a book to a movie, based on the fact that the book
was a success? Thus implying that a good portion of your target
audience are the book readers. So why intentionally slap the readers in
the face? It makes no sense when you watch this movie, since it
probably resembles 20% or less of the book's story, concept and
characters.Even with the book differences, I could have lived with this movie
being a solid zombie movie if the movie was actually about zombies. The
"infected" may be fast and united, but the movie is pg-13 and that is
just baffling. How can you possibly expect to make a movie like this
and limit yourself with a pg-13 in an attempt to sell more tickets to
kids? That's pretty much trading quality for quantity...or "selling
out".It was hard enough to watch this and hardly see any resemblance of the
source material that was amazing, but then you are also limited to
pg-13 action and violence for a movie of this nature. There was almost
no blood, diluted violence, bad CGI and annoying "cut-away" action
scenes. Very disappointing.
