Incredibly original in comparison to every horror movie coming out lately.

"As Above, So Below"I pondered this film for some time now. I've been trying to understand
why it's done so poorly for the critics (not that that affects my
opinion about a film). But I just didn't understand how we could have
such stark differences in opinions about this film. I've heard it
called, chiched, forced, just like all the other found footage films in
this "saturated genre". And I thought none of those were true about
this film. Save maybe "forced" in some moments.Where to begin with this convoluted breakdown. The film clearly had
some absurd qualities. First and foremost is the painfully contrived
female protagonist. A mid-twenties girl who is fluent in 4 languages
and 2 dead languages and 2 PhD's. Oh and a black belt in Krav Maga. She
was beautiful, adventurous, intelligent, brave. Really? Too much. Waaay
too much. HOWEVER. I know why they did it. For the sake of the story
they needed a character who could do all of those things. The solution
to this would've been simply to cast an older person. But that wouldn't
cater to the targeted audience. They needed a full cast of young 20
somethings. There were other small things that were a little far
fetched. Like "oh they conveniently had enough cameras for everyone and
they never broke or got water damage." Of course. For the sake of a
film in this type of genre to continue that had to be the case. First I would like to debunk the myth that the "found footage" genre is
saturated and overdone. Let me think of a couple memorable found
footage films: "The Blair Witch Project".... "Paranormal
Activities".... ummmm..... "Cloverfield"? I mean that's really all that
stands out to me, but I'm not an avid horror fan. Maybe "Quarantine".
The point is if you wanna complain about over done genres maybe you
should look more in the direction of "If I stay", or "The Maze Runner"
and movies alike. Or Exorcism movies. Oh. My. Gosh. Talk about
overdone. No other movie has beautifully meshed these two genres together.
Historical-Mystery- Adventure and Horror. Maybe "The Mummy" but even
that wasn't really going for HORROR. And maybe that's why I
particularly enjoyed this film so much. I love the Historical
adventures such as "Indiana Jones", "Laura Croft", "National Treasure".
And they painted an idea that I don't think has been done a lot or very
well. I've never seen a film that has painted Hell like they did. And
I'm gonna be real, I was very creeped/stressed/scared. I think it's
strongest point was it's middle act. It's build up to the finale was
very well done. I continually had a sharp pain in my chest until the
end. Also "George" was a pretty good actor. And the french people.
Change the main girl and you've got a great movie. In the end my reasons for why I liked it so much was that it was a
fresh horror, unlike.. oh... I dunno... the thousands of possession and
exorcism movies that come out every freaking year. And the concept was
really intriguing. As far as horror movies go? 9/10
