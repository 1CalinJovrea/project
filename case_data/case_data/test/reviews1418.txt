It's good (for goodness sake).

Knowing too much about the plot prior to seeing Better Watch Out is
like feeling your presents under the Christmas tree: it will spoil the
surprise. For this reason, I'm going to keep the twists and turns under
wraps, suffice to say that director Chris Peckover has something quite
unexpected in store for you.At first, I thought I had the film all figured out, the opening scenes
following a fairly typical home invasion story-line: a twelve year old,
Luke (Levi Miller), and his pretty babysitter, Ashley (Olivia DeJonge),
are threatened by an unseen menace that warns 'If U Leave, U Die!'. But
just as we are rolling our eyes at the predictability of the plot,
Peckover pulls the rug out from under our feet, and continues to do so
for the rest of the movie.It all works brilliantly, the movie getting darker and more demented as
it progresses, its effectiveness no doubt helped by a thoroughly
convincing central performance from its young lead, Miller, with able
support from the delightful DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as Luke's nerdy
best bud Garrett.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.
