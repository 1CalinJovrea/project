Completely silly waste of time -- for teens and under ONLY, if that

With all the hype over this movie, I had to come in here and try and be
one little island of reason amidst the ocean of insanity. For the life
of me, I cannot understand how it's getting any praise at all, let
alone heaps of it. The premise/plot is colossally stupid, so it's
check-your-brain-at-the-door stuff from the get-go. But even within
those cartoonish parameters, there is not one interesting story element
nor compelling character to be found. The movie is cliché after cliché.
It has this one parlor trick, which surely you've heard about, where it
often syncopates the (ridiculous) action with the music track. To which
I reply, okay, fine. In no way do I see how this somehow elevates the
terrible script and two-dimensional characters. At no point did I care
about what happened to anyone. I hate to overuse simple descriptors
like "dumb" or "pointless," but honestly, I can't use them enough about
this movie. If I can save one over-13 person the waste of time, I will
feel like a hero. Please save your money!
