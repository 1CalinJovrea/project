Walt Would Be Most Proud

An excellent version where every scene is a feast for the eyes, a story
that is a feast for the soul, great acting and a perfect Cinderella.
The fantasy sequences seem real as do the characters. Most of all, the
movie can be watched without worry of radical perversion and bad
influence to anyone regardless of age. No filth, bad language, or
typical Hollywood garbage. I can enjoy this one over and over...my
favorite realistic Disney movie.
