Clint Eastwood masters doing a lot with the bare minimum.

What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell
itself.Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is really
taken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added to
enhance that.Tom Hanks is a fine actor. Not the greatest performance, but it was
cool that Hanks and Eastwood did a movie together.Sully gives us an in depth look at the miracle of the Hudson. Though
the title does state that the we focus on Capt. Chesley "Sully"
Sullenberger who did an amazing water landing on the Hudson in January
of 2009, and got his 15 mins because of it, Eastwood shows us that even
one man can see things in many different ways, as Eastwood goes through
all those angles.I love Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, the co pilot who supported greatly
the pilots decision. He was a great supporting actor for Tom Hanks.In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyone
involved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the well
trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its
about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It's
about how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes will
always shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possible
knowing that he has an incredible story here.
