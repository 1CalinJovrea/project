This movie sucks! No, really, it sucks! This film would need a stake through its heart, if it had one.

No spoiler alert is necessary here because you can see what's coming
about 14 miles off; it's a tiresome 100-minute mash-up of Underworld
(which was pretty good), Harry Potter (which was somewhat better),
Twilight (which was marginally better), and Mean Girls (which was
awful, but not as awful as this movie). You know it's going to be bad
when the opening credits list Harvey Weinstein, that Hollywood,
ruling-class, plutocratic, anti-gun zealot, who's very comfortable with
his own armed guards, but thinks us commoners should not be allowed to
own firearms for self-defense. Oh the humanity! Pouting actresses with
bee-stung lips and hunky actors with sinewy pecs spout quirky lines and
moon after each other. This film was so bad I couldn't tell if it was
satirizing the movies it's derived from, or if it was meant to be
original. Avoid this turkey like a vampire shuns daylight! Zero stars!
