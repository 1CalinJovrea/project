At first, I thought I was dealing with another One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest with the action taking place in a make-shift jail instead
of an asylum. The ways things were going, I thought both guards and
inmates would need an asylum.This is basically a true story of an experiment of creating a prison at
the college to see the effects of prison life on those concerned.
People volunteered to be guards and prisoners. From almost the
beginning of the experiment, things head downhill and go awry quite
quickly due to the brutal treatment of the guards.The purpose of this was to see the dehumanizing process and how it
would affect the inmates. Things got so bad that I thought that the
superintendent in reality was evil and would keep the "inmates" longer
than the agreement stated.
