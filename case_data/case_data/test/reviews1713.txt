Better than what the haters would have you believe..

If you're looking for the Sandler of 15 years ago, or the scoop of
septic that the current comedic "geniuses" have to offer (Rogen,
Attepow, etc.,) then stay home and watch for umpteenth time the
"hilarious" back and forth between Franco and Seth in This Is Then End.For Blended is reasonable, and funny and OK for older kids, as some of
them are facing the same issues that the kids portrayed here are. Adam
plays a widow, Drew a divorc√©e, just working and trying to raise their
kids the best way they know how. Meeting for the first time on a blind
date, they manage to say and do as much as they can to turn off the
other, not that are bad people, but more that they are so unsure of
themselves after being on their own so long. Yeah the logic is more pretzelian than real, they find themselves on
the same African Safari vacation that Sandler's boss had set up for
himself and Drew's business partner. Thrown together, the two adult
characters put forth their best efforts to make the vacation work for
their kids and end up making it work for each other.There is some mildly crude humor, but a lot of it is gentle fun, some
of it predictable, some laugh out loud funny.My family agreed that that crazy fool Terry Crews stole the show! And
the rest of the theater agreed, because as soon as his face flashed on
the screen everyone started laughing before he had even started one of
several hilarious routines, sort of playing like the Greek chorus. Granted, it's not a 10, but it is way better than the 5 that is
currently showing. I give it a 7.
