Strangely enjoyed this...

First off: See this with a good set of friends. Half of the charm for
me was turning to my best friends and seeing the look of horror on
their faces when they realized what I had dragged them to. Here are the
reasons I like this:A. Costumes were cute. They were supposed to be wild and outlandish but
I found myself really strangely attracted to the dresses. B. Julia
Roberts who? The dwarfs were where it was at! They completely stole the
show. C. It's not supposed to be "stick to the storyline" type of deal
because it's not serious and doesn't take itself too seriously. D. Lily
was adorable. With that sort of big name character it's really hard to
keep it simple like she did. E. The innuendos that the children don't
understand will crack you up and no worries parents... they won't pick
up on them. F. People said it was bad. This might be the hipster in me
but... I was really glad that I didn't think it was.
