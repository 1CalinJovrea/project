I don't know why I like these!

I saw the first two Resident Evil movies in the theater. I thought the
first was okay. The second one seemed really pretty bad. Then I forgot
about the movies until the fourth one. I decided, on a whim, to watch
it. And I was very entertained. It was terrible, but not even terrible
in The Room sense of the word.Since then, I've found a strange affection for these movies. I'm not an
apologist though. All of the complaints about the series are completely
valid. The editing is mostly annoying. The plots seem to be either
nonsensical or impenetrable. Characters are mostly disposable.And still... I like them.Why am I talking about the series, rather than this movie in
particular? Since this one ties it all up. As I was watching this, it
was the first time I felt like the plot was well-defined. Maybe it
conflicts with earlier movies, but here, I felt like I knew what they
were trying to do, and I knew that each step of the story moved them
forward toward their goal.Action sequences vary. Some of them are enjoyable, well lit, and easy
to follow. Others are a dark mess, and get dull because of it.One detail that made me feel especially pleased was that whenever there
was an opportunity for a witty comeback when the heroine beats someone,
her responses are appropriate. They're mildly witty, but they aren't
silly.I still don't recommend these movies to anyone. They're a particular
taste that appeals to a specific audience.When the reviews for this one were fairly negative, I was concerned.
But nope - it fits perfectly with the rest of the family, and I'll be
adding it to my collection. And I think I'll go back and watch the
others again.
