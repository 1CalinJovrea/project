completely nonsensical horror movie

i don't understand how you can call this movie average, let alone good.
it has problems in pretty much every event that ever happens.* what are the rules?-> the demon can be exorcised by a priest easily, as shown at the end-> the demon is immune against crosses and prayers, as shown in the
middle of the movie-> the demon can be imprisoned in a room if bible pages are glued
around it-> the demon can easily escape from said prison at the end of the movie-> the demon can teleport-> the demon cannot teleport-> the demon can possess people without their agreement-> the demon needs permission to go into a puppet-> demon fails at possessing the mother because... no reason-> bonus demon appears out of nowhere in scarecrow. or is it the same?
did he get permission?-> demon can appear as ghost girl and demon nun as well as he pleases,
doesn't need to stay inside the puppet that it is bound to-> demon is extremely strong, can rip people in half, but a girl
stepping on its fingers causes too much pain to keep following herseriously, make up your mind.* how stupid are the characters? -> the demon is clearly dangerous, but
let's enter the house again for no reason.-> let's absolutely not make sure the demon stays inside the room by
putting a layer of concrete around it. no, a wooden door will suffice.-> let's not talk to each other. we must absolutely experience the
scariness one by one.-> let's not believe each other, even though nobody has a reason to
lie.-> demon: let me stay in puppet form and let myself be thrown into the
well and only then transform back. why? because i want it to last
longer.
