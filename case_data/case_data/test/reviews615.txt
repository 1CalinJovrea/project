Down with white America !   All 70% of it....

This movie is about a "white" elitist America that wants to rid the
country of 'people of ethnicity'. And the US people of color won't
stand for it. They are fighting back ! Hero's all of em !!Some bylines are white people are cowards, and white people hide behind
money.I especially like the scene with the rich white family surrounding the
poor old sick black guy. They looked like a nice family. I'll bet they
retired to the library after that for some cognac and caviar.We need more movies like this.. that say white=bad. I hope they start
putting this message into our Saturday morning cartoons. I wouldn't
want any white kids feeling good about themselves.Great flick... bring the kids.
