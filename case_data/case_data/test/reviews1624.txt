confused by the hatred

i came into this movie not expecting much after reading all the hatred
and i honestly was blown away by both the movie and confusion at the
negativity towards it.i agree that this movie painted a somewhat favorable light towards
torture, but it never really once crossed my mind until i read the
negative reviews based on it. i'm sorry, but to flat out dislike a
movie based on your political/philosophical views probably means you
shouldn't be writing a review in the first place.people also complain about the slowness of the movie. i honestly was
riveted by it, from the first minute to the last. every single scene
looked to create tension, drama, and purpose towards the goal of
catching osama. how is that boring exactly? if anything, i felt the
director was too shallow in that the movie seemed to favor
over-dramatizing and simplification of the movie in favor of
entertainment value; it was too entertaining if anything. i wouldn't
have minded a more complex, subtle, and intelligent plot development.as far as character development goes, i agree that there wasn't much of
it, but again i didn't even care until i read the negative reviews
about it. i'm confused, because i thought this was a movie about the
capture of osama bin laden, not shawshank redemption. the editing,
characters, and pacing were very sharp and deliberate and they were
supposed to be like that for the purposes of the movie and the content.
the lack of character development in favor of a relentless pace and
focus towards one singular goal to me 'was' the movie and i loved it
for it.honestly, i'm dumbfounded by the negative reviews. i didn't want to
like this movie. i was tired that night and i'm getting old and fall
asleep frequently in movie theaters. this movie earned my attention and
i was on the edge of my seat until the end credits. i've watched all
the major movies this year and this is, in my opinion, the best film of
the year.
