Would have been better if it WASN'T a Peter Pan Story

By the end of the film I was absolutely convinced that what was
produced was NOT the original story or screenplay. Most likely the
writer had a fun adventure planned out for a poor orphaned boy from
WWII England. It was suggested that he was dyslexic, which I thought
had some potential - being myself married to a brilliant dyslexic. In
any case, I imagine that the writer took his screenplay to various
producers who said something along the lines of "That's a nice story,
but no one has ever heard of it. We can't SELL it. Can't you turn it
into, oh, say Peter Pan? We can sell Peter Pan."So the poor writer hacks and slashes his work to conform it to Mr.
Barrie's tale and it becomes an abomination of both his original story
and that of Peter Pan. Visually impressive. A good performance by its young lead, but he is
wasted on such a mishmash of a story. Hook? Grating on the senses.
Tiger Lily? Perhaps in a different universe she would work, with an
entirely different name. Blackbeard? Mr. Jackson should read the script
before signing on to do his next film, although he does make a good
villain. Nirvana??? Utterly inexplicable.
