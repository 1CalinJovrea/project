True Heroes

The overall experience of the World Premiere was incredible, but this
Movie in any venue would be worth the price of admission.Like most, I've seen hoards of "Action Movies", but the compressed time
line and episodic nature of this one puts you into a pressure cooker
that leaves you drained at the end. Probably more firepower per minute
than in any true life account ever shown on the Big Screen.In the final moments, though, you realize just how much these men lost.
Few if any other team of six would have survived such relentless and
massive assaults. But more than anything, it will force you to ask
yourself why our government literally left these men and the people
they saved, to die.
