A rare horror sequel that delivers the same quality scares as its predecessor, courtesy of returning puppeteer James Wan.

The Conjuring was a shocking horror film. It combined every creepy
trope you can think of (ghosts, dolls, music boxes, mirrors, you name
it), and it actually worked thanks to a genre-savvy director behind the
curtains. James Wan has proved himself a capable producer on projects
such as Saw and Insidious, and with The Conjuring, he cemented himself
as a master of the genre. It had the perfect amalgam of horror tropes
crafted in such a way that felt as fresh and spine-tingling as classic
haunted house movies did in the '80s. The Conjuring 2 is another "based
on true events" tale that has us follow expert paranormal
investigators, the Warrens, this time solving the mystery of the
Enfield Haunting. Similar to the Amityville Haunting, the Enfield Haunting sees an
English family plagued with a poltergeist that doesn't seem to enjoy
the presence of anyone in the house. What The Conjuring 2 succeeds at
is giving us both character development and another great story, which
is exactly what a good sequel should do. The acting is uniformly great,
but the true star of the film is James Wan. His shots are designed in a
way to imbue dread and stir it around our heads for a while before
hitting us with the scare. That's what true horror lacks these days,
patience. The longer the anticipation is built and the more atmosphere
is created, the more unsettling the situation becomes until it's like a
ticking time bomb that you anxiously wait to go off. It uses familiar
tropes, such as self-starting children's toys, slamming doors, and
smashing furniture, but they're used as tools to mask the truly
frightening fact that this family is up against something utterly
beyond their control - they're hopeless, and we can feel it.Mind you, The Conjuring 2 isn't without its faults. The runtime is a
blatant offender. Pushing the 2-hour mark is never a good idea for a
horror film, and some fat definitely could have been trimmed. There are
a handful of cheap scares, audio scares to be precise - when the music
gets extremely loud all of a sudden and you find yourself more annoyed
than scared, quickly reaching for the remote to turn the volume down at
the risk of enduring another ear drum shattering noise. It also doesn't
feel as unique as its predecessor, understandably due to the very
nature of sequels, but there are moments that drag on long enough to
remind you that the first Conjuring didn't have these plodding plot
points. For example, it takes about an hour for the Warrens to even get
to England. Also, while in the haunted house, they're able to sleep
through some horrifying sounds that would snap a bear right out of
hibernation. But these dull spots and plot inconsistencies are few and
far between.The Conjuring 2 is how a horror sequel should be done. It's slick,
stylish, fun, and at times, quite terrifying. When a horror movie makes
me want to turn on the lights as I go roaming around the house at
night, I consider that a job well done. The Conjuring 2, well done.
