Enjoy

Enjoyed this movie. If your looking for fast pace blood guts. Don't
bother. I did not read the book, but intend to. Two great actors, and
loved how they touched upon two individuals in their senior years. This
is reality and how they deal with issues and loneliness. It also shows,
you can have a love life at any age. Our society puts restrictions on
age/seniors. We do not value seniors, and young people just want blood
& guts movies.Little slow paced, but nice change from the movies out there. At first
I did not think I would like it, but loved it.Loved the part with the guys in the coffee shop and how jealous they
are, that one of their own is finding a new life and enjoying his life.I would recommend this movie to everyone.
