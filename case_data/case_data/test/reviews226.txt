So much potential but they just couldn't get there

When first seeing the trailers for this movie i was excited because i
remember this couple's story in Knocked Up and it was hilarious but i
think that's as far as it should've gone and i'll tell you why.First the movie, for a comedy, is way too long. 2 hours and 15 min is a
bit ridiculous. because of this the jokes were dragged out and it
caused me to lose sense of the plot. There was so much potential with
this story line and i felt it could've been so great and hilarious but
they just didn't get there. I felt like there should've been a bit more
drama to their marriage, it felt as if they were trying to make it seem
so realistic that it came off fake. a lot of the problems they were
experiencing does happen to real life middle aged couples but not to
the extreme like they portrayed it. There were some familiar faces and
others were just random (megan fox) lol but i also think a little bit
more development for the new characters and maybe the old would've been
nice as well. I wanted to like this movie so much because it had so
many good parts where it could've been great. Maybe if they added a
small portion towards the end of the movie interviewing real life 40
something year old couples and had little exerpts that would have also
made the movie a bit closer to home.All in all i do feel pocket hurt for spending 11.50 to see this movie
because i was simply disappointed. Would i recommend This is 40?
Probably not.
