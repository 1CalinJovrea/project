Amazing movie, Funny, Inspiring, and Fun.

I don't normally write reviews, however I feel compelled to write
something about this movie. I have seen some negative publicity about
this movie and noticed that there was some low scores in the voting. I
have to say respectfully to these people, you're being stupid. The
movie was almost perfect for what it was intended to be, a family movie
about a magical place. There were in fairness some mistakes made in the
plot concerning the relationships between the main characters, but they
were more creative differences I would have and not full blown errors.
Beyond that the movie was brilliant and was in a most pleasant and
surprising way funny and I mean funny. The movie was a credit to the
legend of L Frank Baum and the legend of The Wizard of Oz. I don't
think this movie has any hope of the kind of success The Wizard of Oz
had, but It was far above and beyond the typical garbage being
manufactured in Hollywood these days. I say get the girlfriend,
boyfriend, kids, mom, dad, or whoever and go see it, you will have fun
and have some laughs as well. Thank You for reading my review and God
Bless.
