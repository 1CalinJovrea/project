Decent fantasy-action slightly inspired by The Hobbit

Most reviews will tell you what's so great about this movie and why
it's worth watching, but I figured you should hear the other side of
the story.First of all a small note for Tolkien fans. If you thought An
Unexpected Journey strayed a bit too far from the book: The Desolation
of Smaug looks like the script writers didn't even know there was a
book. The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can,
reducing fan-favorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new
content that feels out of place.But it's not only bad if you've read the book. I really wonder what the
target audience is, because it feels like it's written for 15 year old
boys. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and 'funny'
decapitations every 30. The worst thing here is that the action comes
at the cost of character development. You have a band of 13 Dwarfs and
a Hobbit, yet you rarely see them interact.Now I like Elves more than Dwarfs, so I didn't mind seeing so much of
them in this movie. But having them show up in every place to save the
day feels wrong. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs
wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in
Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept, but they are just
too slow. I feel his scenes mostly serve as an attempt to raise The
Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings' level of epicness. And that just
doesn't work.The story is full of illogicalities. How does entering the mountain to
steal the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs to kill the Dragon to enter
the mountain work exactly?? And remember that heartwarming last scene
of An Unexpected Journey, where Thorin finally accepts Bilbo? Well,
that's all gone again. Even though he keeps outsmarting all the Dwarfs,
Bilbo is back to being an unappreciated 5th wheel of the party. And did
the writers really think viewers would be so desperate for a love story
that they'd enjoy an Elf and a Dwarf flirting it up? Their scenes feel
forced and are painful to watch.Martin Freeman's acting is top notch again, but sadly he hardly gets
any screen time. He only shines in his scene with Smaug. Now Smaug as a
character is awesome, no complaints there. Yet most of his scenes are
way too dragged out. There's a 20 minute scene with the Dwarfs running
around thinking they can defeat him. Only at that point the movie
already hinted at the only possible way of defeating him. Perhaps the
worst aspect is that these scenes make Smaug look like an unintelligent
creature. Dwarfs luring a Dragon around by going "Nana-nanana you can't
catch me!" is not only silly and clich√©, it's an insult to Smaug's
character.Final complaint: the whole movie builds up to a scene.... that's
apparently going to be the opening scene of movie 3. Nobody in the
cinema was sure if the movie had ended, or there was just an awkwardly
long pause when the screen went black.A movie like this you'll want to see, no matter how good or bad it is.
You can't miss out on such a huge release, especially when it looks
gorgeous in HFR 3D. But where I watched each Lord of the Rings movie 3
times in cinema, watching The Desolation of Smaug just once was enough
for me.In the end, most problems of the movie seem to stem from the decision
to turn the cute Hobbit tale into three epic movies that have to live
up to the Lord of the Rings hype. It doesn't work.
