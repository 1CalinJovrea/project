This is a Big Let Down

I feel like I saw a different movie than everyone else. It's simply not
funny, I think I laughed once. We really don't need to see a erect,
giant, detailed, graphic phallus in every movie, it's not funny. Then
to have to sit through an extended portion of Satan walking around with
his junk out is not funny and not needed. I'm not prudish but this
movie adds male genitals just to do it, it was a lame movie. Write
something creative like 40-year old virgin. This movie was lamer than
Pineapple Express and Your Highness. If you expect the wit of Knocked
Up, you'll be as disappointed as me. Save your money. None of the characters in the film are likable in the least, and they
are supposed to be playing themselves. I do not know why people are
treating Seth Rogen like he is incapable of mailing it in because This
Is The End is lazy and feels like it was mailed in to fulfill an
obligation to the movie studio. I also feel cheated by the excellent
reviews this movie received from the paid critics. How did anyone find
this trash funny?
