Awful... Just awful

The story is just so weak but still stretched for the entire length of
a movie.The first half hour was a little bearable, but everything after that
was a huge downfall from the time she becomes this cool chick to the
last 3 minutes where everything just falls into place as if the
directors themselves just wanted to get this over.The 2 stars are for the couple of times which made me laugh. There was
simply nothing else in the movie.I guess the target audience are 40+ year old moms who want to be 30+
year old moms again.
