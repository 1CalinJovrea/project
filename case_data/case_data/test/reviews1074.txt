Yep, it's another feel good high school movie

Fortunately the trailer teaches us what DUFF means because otherwise no
one would know. It's that approachable guy in your group of friends who
no one cares about but is useful for inter-group communications. You
didn't ever know anyone like that? Me neither, go figure. But, as a
film mechanic it works.Remember all that teen anxiety you used to have? Still got it? Yep me
too. You're only comfortable with the people you know but how do you
get to know someone new? If you're in touch with that feeling then this
movie that explores awkward teenage romance will appeal.There are more laughs in this than the average teen movie. The
characters are explored a bit more fully than in the average teen
movie. It is a better than average teen movie.
