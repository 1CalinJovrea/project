What a shame, Just plain boring. (my review doesn't give any plot away)

How do you make Bourne boring? The original film is probably one of my
favourite films. This one however, I just found myself rolling my eyes
every few minutes especially during the first 30 minutes. After about
1.5 hours I had given up and was just waiting for it to finish.When are these film makers going to stop it with the totally
unbelievable computer hacking rubbish? In one scene they execute a
program by typing "run predictive algorithm". In another scene, they
spot someone on a surveillance camera and the female character actually
says "enhance". Come on! How clich√©. What is this, the 1980's?? It isn't total and utter crap. It is as well made as the other Bourne
films, except for that annoying, erratic fight scene camera work that
seems to be in every action film at the moment, So you can't actually
see what is going on. It has some OK action scenes but they do nothing
to make it interesting. Nothing really happens. The plot is weak and
the film is just plain boring. And I'm a fan of the trilogy! (Not the
odd number 4 film which incidentally is better than this) Matt Damon is as good as he can be I suppose. Tommy Lee Jones, who I
like as an actor, doesn't really bring anything to the film because his
character is boring as well. I just can't help but feel they cashed in
and made another one without really caring if it was any good or not as
they knew everyone (me included) would go and watch it because all the
others are so good!
