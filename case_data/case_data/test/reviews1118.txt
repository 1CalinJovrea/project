Long, boring, stupid and predictable

Terrible movie.I would say even the worst one i have watched this Year! Long, boring,
stupid and predictable!Funny?!I didn't find anything funny in it! Unbearable flat, shallow, idiotic
American humor.I can't believe i spent 1 hour and 51 min. of my life lobotomizing my
brain with such a clich√©!Why this people in Hollywood continue making such a crap for God sake!? The only good and maybe funny moment was the Elon Musk scene. I rate it
with 2 and i think it deserved it completely.
