much better than the low rating would suggest

I just don't get why this movie is getting so many low ratings. I
thought it was terrific. The writing was great, the story plausible,
and the acting excellent. The story depicts a technological future that
is nearly upon us. I almost didn't go see it because of the low rating,
but I'm glad I did.
