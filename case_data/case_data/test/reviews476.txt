Great sci-fi fairy tale, but some all too obvious physics/science errors

First I must say I really enjoyed this movie. A love drama in space is
not a very usual theme for a movie. As the movie unravels, I was
wondering more and more about how this will end, because there is no
obvious path, anything would be possible. I liked the end, it was the
only end that would make any kind of sense, yet it was a mystery all
the way.Great actors of course, great effects etc. simply a joy for the eyes. A
great fairy tale in space, absolutely worth viewing.Then all the physics mistakes. I have seen enough movies, sci-fi and
others, to not let physics errors destroy the fun. I take them as part
of the amusement. Still, I cannot stop wondering why these
multi-million projects cannot hire one single person with some master
degree in physics/engineering to at least filter out the all too
obvious ones.1. The ship is traveling at 50% of the speed of light. Then they "sling
shot" around a star in a spectacular view for the passengers. At that
speed there would be nothing to view. It would be all over in a
microsecond. Secondly, the view would be all distorted due to
relativity effects. Thirdly, there shouldn't be any passengers to view
it, yet the ship announces it of the loudspeakers!! Why they would need
to sling shot in the first place, is also a mystery considering the
obvious and rather insane brute force of the ship (50% of light speed
and plowing through asteroids).2. The gravity on the ship is caused by the whole vessel rotating,
centrifugal force. Then there is a scene when the rotation just stops,
creating some spectacular effects in the swimming pool. Why should the
rotation stop in the first place? But, getting passed that question,
stopping the rotation in an instance would case an acceleration in the
tangential direction of several g's (infinite in fact). The ship would
disintegrate. Lets say the rotation stopped gradually, there would be a
tangential acceleration lasting over that period of time causing the
water in the swimming pool to first flow towards the wall. The rotation
also starts in an instance. Well, it is all very, very wrong in the
movie.3. The "thermonuclear" engines are at full speed. The space ship is
constantly accelerating. This will also cause an acceleration giving
the effect of gravitation on board. Yet the engine starts and stops
with no apparent effect.4. The engines are at full speed and both Jim and Aurora do space
walks. This would simply not be possible, because the ship would
accelerate away from them.5. The ship has a "force shield" that clean up rocks in the path. No
matter how you look at this, cleaning out rocks and asteroids in front
will cause the ship to slow down and wriggle from side to side if the
rocks do not hit 100% straight on. Again, the acceleration (gravity)
effects on the ship would be insane. The mass of that ship is nothing
compared to those asteroids it travels through.6. Jim survives the "exhaust gases" of a thermonuclear reactor. This
may not actually be that far out, since these gases were only there as
a ventilation mechanism, To let out the steam so to speak. It is not
clear exactly what the reactor is. Still, the reactor would have to be
some fusion reactor of some kind and insanely hot viewed from the
inside of the ship.7. The engineering of the ship's systems. What can I say. There is no
such thing as a fail safe system. The whole thing seems very messy
indeed, designed by a 10 year old.8. The food problem. Two person would need a lot of food for 90 years.
The ship was designed to have all the people suspended in hibernation,
thus no need for any larger supply of food or any need for recycling
mechanisms or that sort of things. This does not add up in the movie.
