The Avengers (04/27/2012)

After watching the film today, I decided to review this film because I
am literally on the edge of my seat for the sequel and every time I
wake up for university or for work, I view all three trailers and get
even more excited and emotional for the film!I watched the film on 04/27/2012 when it was released in Scotland and
for me to see all the heroes and supporting characters brought in from
their respective films together into one film was dream come true for
me. I always hoped for a Justice League film consisting of Batman,
Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), The Flash,
Hawkgirl & J'onn J'onzz, but I have to admit that DC are rushing things
for their cinematic universe. From the introduction to each hero to
their developing relationships to the funny moments between each
character and to the amazing visual affects, there is not a dull moment
in this film! The Avengers is FANTASTIC! We know who the characters are and their origins developed from the
preceding films - Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man
2 (2010), Thor (2011) & Captain America: The First Avenger (2011).
Seeing these superheroes uniting together to save the world in the big
screen was extremely fun and boisterous. Many fans of the superhero genre want a balance of fighting, explosions
as well as intelligent scenes and Joss Whedon and Zack Penn do just
that with their vision and imagination. The scenes are entertaining and hilarious especially when the
characters are interacting with one another during the film such as
Captain America meeting Iron Man after the confrontation with Loki,
Iron Man mocking Captain America and Thor, the chemistry with Bruce
Banner is poetic in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier conference room and
finally, the scene between Thor and the Hulk is hilarious especially
when Thor is sucker punched by the Hulk. Also, the scene when Iron Man
thrusts the energy onto the shield of Steve Rogers to annihilate a
Chitauri fleet foreshadows events in Captain America 3 or better now
known as Captain America: Civil War. In addition, it's a shame that
Edward Norton didn't return as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo
nailed the scenes in his first film in the role bequeathed to him by
the former. Ruffalo portrays Banner in a phlegmatic manner managing to
control his impeccable rage only to easily let it out when in the Hulk
mode, his performance is AMAZING!!! The best part of the movie for me would have to be the moment when Tony
Stark as Iron Man introduces himself as a team player near the climax -
after being lambasted by Steve Rogers/Captain America earlier - when he
intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the
Chitauri fleet destroying the mother ship. However, the stars of the film for me would have to be Robert Downey
Jr. and Tom Hiddleston. Both actors are superb in their roles as Iron
Man and Loki, respectively.Marvel and DC both have a variety of rich characters and even a
brilliant number of story lines, however, in my eyes, Marvel will
always be number one because they have implemented their films with
careful planning and precision. In the end, when it comes to Marvel
Cinematic Films, you will crave for more because of its awesomeness and
we all know for a fact that Marvel will up their game and will ALWAYS
deliver for their loyal fan base.
