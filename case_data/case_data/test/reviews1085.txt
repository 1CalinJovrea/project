Way too many screenplay contrivances! [+41%]

'Kidnap' looks like the follow-up thriller to Berry's 2013 movie 'The
Call' but the outcome is comparatively underwhelming. Berry plays Karla
Dyson, whose son Frankie gets kidnapped by a hillbilly-vibed couple
during a day at the park, when she is attending a phone-call with
regard to her divorce. What ensues is an excruciatingly long chase and
a few genre thrills that do not add anything new to the
already-saturated plate.If you're a lazy viewer who doesn't have much knowledge on the kind of
kidnap-thrillers churned out these days by international cinema, then
this one could mildly interest you. The screenplay contrivances are
innumerable: a) Karla leaving her son to attend a phone call (in a
public place - Her son is six, mind you! He probably would be less
bothered overhearing his parents' divorce proceedings than when it
comes to choosing his favorite ice-cream flavor) b) Her phone is lost
early into the movie - which apparently delays the 911 emergency call.
Instead of asking a passerby for his/her phone for two minutes and
alerting the cops (she has clearly seen the nature of the woman who
abducts her son and the color and brand of car she uses!) c) When
finally a copper gains attention of Karla's speeding mini-van, he
listens to her story while on the move but doesn't notice the
missing/concealed plate on the kidnappers' Mustang GT, instead wants
Karla to pull over - douchey move that gets him injured/killed. d) She
gets to know one of the kidnappers' names too, almost 30 minutes into
the film and yet does nothing with all the information she's received.
Hint - Read point b) again. e) The tussle between the plump lady
kidnapper and Karla while in her car is so unconvincingly shot - just
split second cuts leading to a door opening and the seemingly strong
woman just falls out. f) Karla gives them their credit card and pin
details and yet the kidnappers decide to tag her along on the ride
instead of getting rid of her g) Let's stop doing this!For a movie that practically rides on Berry's stardom, she reassures
herself a tad too much by way of monologues, which starts to get
annoying after a while. The movie wants her to embrace her "unknown,
special set of supermom skills" and finish the task of getting her son
back by herself, hinting at the inefficiency of the local police
department. One point that the movie gets across is the sturdiness of
the red mini-van that Karla drives - a Chrysler Town & Country, that
happens to endure much more than Karla does.The movie tries to put Karla in interestingly difficult scenarios like
her vehicle running out of fuel, only to execute a clich√©d action trope
a little later. I'm pretty sure Berry must have questioned at least a
couple of plot-convenience devices placed into the script but was
ultimately swept away by the film's idea of portraying her as a
one-woman-army. As an action-thriller too, the movie barely registers. It almost feels
like the movie is slightly better off when the camera isn't jump-
cutting between yellow-lines and steering wheels. The climax sequence,
although moderately better than what preceded, feels drawn out. Berry
is a good actor no doubt, but in 'Kidnap' she looks a bit jaded and her
expressions seem feigned.Verdict: Serviceable trash at most!
