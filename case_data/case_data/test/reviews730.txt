Two clichéd genres for the price of one!

Oh movie clichés. I could go on about all the carbon copies of Superbad
since its release. Pretty much every coming of age highschool nerdy
white kid movie has the same exact set of jokes. The slo mo scene with
the emphasis on the nerdy features of the characters set to gangster
rap.. the plentiful amount of dick jokes. The epic highschool kid party
that would upstage most celebrities (Neighbors, 21 Jump Street,
anything with Dave Franco really). Then you have the zombie film clichés. Dimwitted completely harmless
zombies that cannot kill a bunch of pubescent teens yet managed to wipe
out a town. Flawless head shots through out (of course, only after the
almost immediate realization that you have to shoot them in the head). There isn't much new here.. beyond that character development does
actually show itself to be decent and you may find at least one of the
main cast to be like able.VERDICT: If you love these types of movies then I am sure you will like
this. If you spot these clichés and roll your eyes because it is the
millionth time you have seen them in the last decade pass this one.
