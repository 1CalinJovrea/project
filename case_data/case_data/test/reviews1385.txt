Sinister- See It In Cinema

DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER! or at least try not too. I went into this film
only knowing the title and the fact i was waiting for a scary movie to
actually be... yep scary. Well i was in luck, as Sinister is exactly
that...quite Sinister! I say try to avoid the trailers if u can because
quite a lot is shown, although having said that you will probably be so
absorbed into the film that you'll forget about what you have seen and
still be spooked, BOO! :) All the actors do a good job, Ethan Hawke is solid, not quite sure
about the chemistry between him and his wife but i guess its hardly
relevant in this film. The directing and editing of the film is slick
with interesting angles and shots. The imagery is great and so are your
jumpy moments even if it does contain a few of the horror Clich√©s.The plot is simple and follows true-crime writer Ellison (Ethan Hawke)
as he discovers a box of home movies "found footage" of murders that
put his family in danger. Some people may dislike the believability of
the films central ethos for the evil protagonist; however i liked the
original mythology created here, it adds something new to the table.
Also If the film is successful (im guessing it might be) the Evil
Character aka Bagoul will no doubt be a new item for Halloween stores!
Although not a game changer in the genre, i would easily go and say
this will be the scariest film of the year and if not, well thats just
win-win for us all!! ((star ratings = 7 good, 8 represents very good. 9
superb 10 epic)
