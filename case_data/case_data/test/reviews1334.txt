Painful , very poor

Poor film. How anyone can rate it I don't know . It just makes no sense
. A couple of feeble humans stuck in a building on the middle of no
where while the skin heads have numbers in abundance , guns , human
eating dogs , but a women with a fire extinguisher and a high pitched
microphone can do better. Why don't they all just go in the place in
the beginning and kill them? They know the band aren't armed yet they
don't go into the room with a thin rotting old door, and instead they
send packs of two in. It's just so stupid . It's a situation that in
real life , would have been over in 5 minutes , yet you have to sit and
wait for a painful amount of time for them to escape instead.
