Typical of modern Hollywood.

**SPOILERS** I'll start this review by making it clear that the
original Robocop is my personal favourite movie and has been since I
first saw it 25 years ago. Having felt much trepidation about the
direction the remake was going in (PG-13 rating in particular) I went
in with fairly low expectations but still something of an open mind as
I really wanted this reboot to faithfully kick-start a new, successful
Robocop franchise. I was pleasantly surprised by the first hour of the film and how
Murphy's quite horrifying physical transformation was depicted (there
wasn't much left of him) and the emotional impact upon him. I
particularly liked the first few scenes of him coming to grips with his
new form and his little meltdown in the Chinese factory in which he was
built. Unfortunately the film starts to take a significant nose dive at
the point of Robocop's big public unveiling. A stupidly convenient plot
device whereby the entire Detroit PD database including 17 years worth
of the city's CCTV is uploaded to Murphy merely minutes before he's
about to make his big appearance. This causes Robocop to overload
requiring a change to Murphy be necessitated resulting in him then
becoming more robotic and ultimately making an arrest for murder upon
his big unveiling. This was a clumsily handled plot device done for the
advancement of the plot but defied logic. Why give him a massive upload
at such a crucial time? Others have pointed to a lack of a true
antagonist and this is very true. Main criminal Antoine Vallon is
utterly woeful compared to Kurtwood Smith's vile Clarence Boddiker and
even Micheal Keaton can't hold a candle to Ronny Cox's performance in
the original. There is also little chemistry between Alex and Clara
Murphy both before and after his transformation. The film is best when it isn't trying to ape and nod towards the
original. The use of Basil Poledouris' majestic music in Pedro
Bromfman's new score is particularly jarring and poorly orchestrated.
When I watched Man of Steel at about the 50 minute mark I realised I
hadn't heard John Williams classic Superman theme but also realised
that this was a new take on the Superman mythos that didn't need to
borrow from it's predecessors. Shame this film didn't follow suit. The effects are generally good but alas the Robocop/ED-209 battle is
just a typical modern day CGI fest and has none of the weight of the
same scene from the original. The film's biggest issue is undoubtedly caused by the constrictions of
the PG-13 rating. Hearing arch criminals talk without any swearing
pulls me out if the film and destroys any sense of realism. In one
scene as Murphy approaches a drug factory to make a bust images of the
classic drug factory shoutout of the original came to mind. Alas this
version turns out to be a total anti-climax almost totally devoid of
the carnage so required from such a scene. This follows on to Robocop
taking down Vallon in a night vision shootout where men are shot but no
blood, death or injury are shown in even any mildly satisfying manner.
This shows clearly that gritty subject matter is not befitting of a
teenage rating and similar target audience. Would something like The
Wire work if it was aimed at a teenage audience? No. There aren't any particular standout performances other than Gary
Oldman who almost always delivers no matter the role or movie. Kinnaman
is somewhat wooden in places but gives a decent enough performance even
though at times he looks uncomfortable with the role. One aspect of the
film that did nothing for me was Samuel L Jackson's character who opens
and closes the film and offers his very one sided views throughout. If
this is their replacement of the satire of the original they can keep
it. It's ham fisted and provides little more than uninteresting
commentary on the power of the media and plot exposition. It tells us
nothing interesting that we don't already know and Jackson does his
shouty thing to excess, especially at the cringe-worthy end. I wholly embrace the need to make this reboot from a fresh angle to
that of Verhoven's original but Sony MGM have played it way too safe
with something that would clearly play better if it were aimed at an
adult audience. I genuinely believe that an R rated movie, devoid of
such tight restrictions would have been a far more satisfying
experience. The original Robocop franchise died when they aimed at a
younger demographic. Hollywood greed I fear has caused a repeat of this
mistake. It's not a bad film per se, it's just painfully average and
therefore unable to get out from the vast shadow of its forebear and
like the Total Recall remake, it tries too hard too often to remind you
of the original whilst offering nothing new to compete with it. I doubt
there's even a harder cut tucked away for home release and even if
there was there are plot issues that damage the film as much as the
tame approach. Other gripes include a lack of clarity as to Omnicorp's
role (if any) in Murphy being blown up, and plot threads not being
followed through to any satisfying conclusion such as Murphy's
relationship with his family. The best bits revolve around Murphy's
initial awakening as a cyborg which are very well done indeed. Alas there's not really that much else that's in any way as memorable
as the 1987 classic it's based on. As an example of how modern
Hollywood has become all about excessive studio control above
creativity and maximising ticket sales at the expense of a film's
overall artistic quality then this film succeeds. In all other aspects
it's a bit of a wasted opportunity really.
