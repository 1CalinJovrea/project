Extremely bad.

Completely unrealistic movie. Propaganda film, as the Soviet of fifty
years ago. Do not watch! They tried to fix bad image of American
soldiers and the things they made ​​in the recent wars and have made
some bad mix of Superman and Rambo. People are dropping tens of meters
down a rocky mountain, strike with a head in stone but firing
unerringly, killing hundreds of opponents, who are naturally evil,
dirty and sad examples of human beings. Do you remember the worst war
movie you watched? This one is several times worse. I can not believe
that anyone could give this movie a positive evaluation. In war, people
can overcome their opportunities, especially superbly trained soldiers
but there are limits to what the human body can not handle. Header into
the rock after tumble at high speed down the mountain is one of them.
