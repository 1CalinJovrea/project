This is NOT...

This is NOT ROCK N' ROLL not even close. Cruise has very little range
in his voice and his looks are ridiculous. They made GOOD 80'S rock
into a sissy prissy mess of songs. If you know anything about the real
songs and bands- this will disappoint you. Hough is okay in her role-
nothing more nothing less. Zeta-Jones was again just okay in the role-
the Twisted Sister song deserved better and louder as it's against the
norm not in the norm. Blige again was okay- I've seen better from her
and expected ore from her. Baldwin was good as the night club owner-
again they could have done so much more. I realize they can only do so
much but come on guys- this was a complete waste of time and money.
