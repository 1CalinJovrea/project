Poignant and beautiful movie

Thank goodness I went with my gut instinct and gave this movie a chance
despite the poor critics reviews. I can't think of a movie starring
Will Smith that I've regretted immersing myself in. A necessary see for
anyone who has experienced tragedy through loss. I for one don't always
watch a movie for that "feel good" feeling....I enjoy watching a movie
that is both raw and brutally honest. This movie gave me that
experience and allowed me to reach places in my soul that aren't easily
reached. It can be uncomfortable yet comforting in an extraordinary way
that only a great story line and excellent acting can drive home.
Ignore the poor reviews and see this movie!!
