Keeps the series going strong!

Fantastic film! As a fan of the series, i was a bit skeptical that they
were taking it too far however, if this film is any indication, the
series is as strong as ever! You feel comfortable returning to the
characters for another adventure and i don't see fans of the series
being disappointed. The film is fast and fun and carries excellent
messages of the importance of family and the importance of being
yourself. A bunch of new characters freshen up the film, with a band of
pirates, including a love interest for Diego and Sid is accompanied by
his grandmother who is humorously oblivious to the dangerous situations
the characters get into. Scrat also gets plenty of time chasing his
elusive acorn, with the footage that was released as part of
advertisements (Scrat's Continental Crack-Up)comprising in the film.
However, there is also a hilarious scene at the end where he finally
reaches the treasure island that the map on the acorn (seen in the
advertisements) leads to. A great, fun, family film that boasts crisp and detailed animation that
actually makes great use of 3D. Definitely recommended! *The short film that precedes the film, 'The Longest Daycare'- a
Simpsons short, is a pleasant addition to the main film. It is a silent
short that features Maggie Simpson and Baby Gerald, where Maggie tries
to save a butterfly from the daycare from the clutches of the baby. It
is clever and fun and it is great to see more films having original
shorts like Pixar's fantastic ones.
