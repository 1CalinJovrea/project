First half is some of the best movie-making I have seen in a long time

While the second half is forgettable action fun. A very uneven movie,
which raises enormous expectations in those first 40 minutes, but
ultimately can't deliver. We, the viewer, are still left with half of a
marvelous movie. The main actor is incredible. Not in the Pacino sense,
but more in the Schwarzenegger sense. He creates an iconic character,
which is extremely sympathetic and scary at the same time. The writing
has some obvious plotting issues, but all the way through you'll come
across terrifically written scenes. The direction and overall acting is
top notch. But to me, the greatest thing about the film ia its use of
music. It has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a movie for a
long time. Think Miami Vice crossed with Brad Fiedel's work on the The
Terminator. Really effective stuff.Like I said, the second half is forgettable and formulaic, but still
fun.
