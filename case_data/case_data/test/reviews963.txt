Promising Storyline, Disappointing Movie

Jay (Jason Segel) and his girlfriend Annie (Cameron Diaz) love each
other and have sex in the most unusual places. They get married and
have two children, and soon their sex life is almost inexistent. One
night, Annie leaves their children with her mother to have a night of
sex with Jay, but they are tense and fail. Annie suggests Jay to make a
home video to rekindle their sexual life and they have three hours of
kinky sex. Annie asks Jay to delete the footage but he forgets and leaves it in a
cloud. Soon they search the Ipods they have given to their friends to
promote Jay's songs to delete the video. But Jay receives a phone call
from someone that has had access to the video. Who might be the
mysterious intruder?"Sex Tape" is an unfunny and disappointing comedy with a promising
storyline. Most of the situations and characters are silly or stupid.
The cameo of Jack Black and many scenes of Cameron Diaz are the best in
this forgettable movie. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Sex Tape: Perdido na Nuvem" ("Sex Tape Â– Lost in the
Cloud")
