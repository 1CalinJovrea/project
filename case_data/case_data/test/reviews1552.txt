Artsy Fartsy Boredom

What a God Awful film this is. The only thing worth looking is the
performance of Colin Farrell. Thats it.The rest of the film is so boring, the title of the movie could
actually be "The Boring Movie". Nothing really happens in the entire
film so it may easily carry this title.Artsy fartsy is the common description here, including direction,
acting, casting....you name it, it's horrible, cheap and uninspiring in
any way possible. They probably thought the audience would find this idea surrounded by
waves of boredom interesting. In some sort of weird way. Unfortunately
this is not film making, it's called sleeping in our chairs while this
film plays on.If this didn't have Colin Farrell in it, you would probably never have
watched it anyways. Farrell gives a solid performance I really liked
it, but he looked totally out of place, given the terrible soundtrack
and co-casting. I recommend this film to be made again from scratch
with Farrell and a much better crew, it could be made much much better.NEXT !!!
