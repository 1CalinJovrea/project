I enjoyed it! Really entertaining film.

They finished filming 'Amityville: The Awakening' in 2014 and supposed
to release in 2015, but release date delayed more than once. Anyway, my
waiting time is over. I finally saw it last week! And I have to say
that I absolutely loved it.What's it about? In 1974, 'he' murdered his entire family as they slept
in a haunted house, in Amityville, but 40 years later, a single mother
that moves her three children into that the same house.This movie is terrific, crazy and scary with some creepy moments. But
yet, it's a lot of fun to watch. It has great jump scares! I found the
twists crazy.One thing in this movie made me surprise is that they showed the actual
Amityville DVDs (the original, Amityville II: The Possession and the
remake) and I loved how they showed it in this Amityville movie lol.
They said new versions are boring, so they picked the original to watch
and some of the characters watched it on TV. ðŸ˜‚Let's talk about the characters: Bella Thorne gave a likable character,
good acting and she showed her emotional moments. She wasn't dumb,
neither annoying. She seemed awesome when she was fighting with the
demon in the last scene.Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a creepy performance. She played really
crazy mother who already knew about the 'Amityville Horror' murders and
she thought everything would be better in a possessed house in
Amityville, but she was also good. She did a good job.Cameron Monaghan was really creepy as looking. He was easily the best
and creepiest part of the movie.Remember, it's not a perfect film, and it's not for everyone, but if
you waited to see it in a long time or if you liked the 2005 version,
Rob Zombie's Halloween, etc. you definitely should to see it.Note: It's not a remake, neither another sequel. It's a reboot! By the
way, it's still better than quite a few of the actual sequels. It's
just an entertaining film!
