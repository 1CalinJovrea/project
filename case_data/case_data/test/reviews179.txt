A good film corrupted by Hollywood greed,,,

It is easy to appreciate the high praise for one of Denzel's finest
performances, the wonderful cast, and the quality of the narrative and
storyline over the course of most of the film. This script had great
potential to produce an often compelling story, with fine characters
and direction. (I'm ignoring the fact that in everyday reality, a pilot
like Denzel's character would be impossible, since professional pilots
are subjected to regular drug and alcohol tests.) But, alas, virtually
all the reviews and reviewers are blind to the film's fatal flaw.What so terribly wrong here?? In nearly all action films and
psychological dramas, the writers and director are offered several
different--often competing--conclusions, the final "hook." I watched a
film that deserved an 6/7 for its entire length, until the final 15
minutes, the scene where Denzel's character breaks down in a sudden fit
of moral consternation in the official inquiry. At this point, the film
suddenly is transformed from a serious drama into a sloppy, moralizing
MELODRAMA. What a great loss. But Hollywood will out, destroying an
intrinsically dark tale by providing a redemptive "happy ending" that
is utterly incredible. Of course, 90% the audiences will love this, but
it doesn't change the facts.Think: When Denzel's character's interrogator asks the big question in
the hearing, the real alcoholic he's been in every scene becomes a
utterly different person. He can easily avoid blaming the innocent
stewardess, AND save himself, with one answer: "I don't know." And then
repeating it, over and over. Exactly what a binge drinker would have
done--except for Hollywood and HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars at stake
at the box office!! Concluding the film with the broken pilot preaching
the gospel of AA while gratefully serving his prison term is like
stepping into an entirely different fantasy, one without credible
linkage. Speaking as a professional writer, no one who has read great
novels and fiction critically can come to any other conclusion. But
this qualifier regarding familiarity with supreme fictions will exempt
the vast majority of readers who usually appear on this site.
