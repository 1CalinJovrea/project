Twisty turny brilliance

An avid movie watcher with high standards but this is the first time I
felt compelled to write a review. I occasionally browse over reviews
once I finish a movie to see what others thought, and maybe be filled
in on subtle details I may have missed.I was however disgusted reading a variety of reviews here of shallow
minded people that not only put pieces of the puzzle incorrectly
together, but couldn't appreciate the superb performance of the main
roles.**Don't listen reviews saying "The book was better** Rarely can a movie
pack the punch of a book with hundred's of pages into 2 hour movie. To
those that haven't read the book, we couldn't care less about details
being changed in the movie.It takes a while to get into the movie being that perspective's of
multiple roles are shown to give full context. but it all gets neatly
wrapped up for a climax at the end. Usually I like to pick apart flaws
and poor acting but this was all believable and satisfying. It's a
drama/mystery/thriller so you wont be finding any sunshine and
butterflies here. Dark and sad is the theme.
