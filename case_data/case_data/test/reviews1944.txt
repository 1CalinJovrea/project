Horrible Film, Thanks Michael Bay and Megan Fox for Ruining it.

This movie was just horrible, it had absolutely nothing to do with the
original story and plot of the TMNT. Splinter and the turtles were
April's pets? And instead of Splinter being the rat of his master in
the foot clan mimicking his movements he learns from a book he finds in
the sewer. Megan Fox is also just a horrible actress who happens to be
the absolute most unqualified person to be playing the role of April
O'neil. If Megan Fox was not in the movie it would be slightly more
tolerable, still a horrible movie. Michael Bay proves to have no
creativity and no imagination as this movie looks and feels like his
just as crappy Transformers movies. It has the same dark look as the
transformers. The movie had 1 or 2 fun/cool parts but it isn't worth
watching the whole movie just for those parts. Shredders suit is also
way overboard and entirely made out of metal. The TMNT live action
movies from the 90's seems to be the only good movies considering how
awful this movie is, I cannot express how awful this movie is.
