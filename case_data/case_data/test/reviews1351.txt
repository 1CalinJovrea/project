Please, Hollywood, take note...

... This is how to make a vampire film.I find it difficult to fault this film. The plot is intelligent and
engaging. No one is entirely black or white. The heroes are flawed and
complicated, the villains, for the most part, have motivation and even
sympathy. I found myself rooting for the murderous, vampiric prostitute
as much for the innocent girl trapped into releasing those tired of
life.It's really two films, one set 200 hundred years ago, one in the
present time, with many of the same characters and the same location,
Hastings, once a fishing village, now a tired seaside resort.The actors are very good, particularly the leads. As a resident of SE
England, I recognised many of the locations. The ending was perhaps a
little predictable, but still satisfying.Don't go see this if you like your vampires to sparkle, but if you
liked Let The Right One In and gritty drama, go watch it.
