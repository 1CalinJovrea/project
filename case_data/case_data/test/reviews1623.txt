Unbelievably bad, 10 insane plot lines twisting around.

WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS!Mark Wahlberg in this movie has to face insane odds, and beats them all
with magical luck and his super smuggler brains. His stupid friend
keeps making unbelievably bad decisions, of course. There are some
really really evil characters as well, and of course all the evil ones
do drugs and the goodies have all gone straight. Luckily, despite
everyone seeming to want to ruin Mark's family for no reason
whatsoever, the motives being very unclear, Mark manages to save his
family and become a multimillionaire and lived happily ever after. The
movie also shows us that the bad guys went to prison and were beaten up
by the other inmates, of course! This movie just made me angry that it
had a decent IMDb score and that it pretended to be somewhat on the
scale of possible, so I don't use the phrase 'realistic' because that
would be another spectrum. Very frustrating to watch a cast and budget
botched so badly.
