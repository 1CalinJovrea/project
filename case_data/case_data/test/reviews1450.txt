Numbers Game

Robert Redford is willing to sacrifice hundreds of millions for the
lives of billions, the 'good guys' are willing to kill hundreds to save
the lives of those hundreds of millions. Both are playing a numbers
game, the only difference is that Redford's is on a bigger scale and
isn't hypocritical, he acknowledges the human cost, the 'good guys'
treat the hundreds of soldiers they kill (and the many civilian
casualties resulting from their lavish tactics) simply as necessary to
get the job done. This is a fight of visionaries against hypocrites,
and hypocrites win. An awful message, an awful movie. It also has the
standard 'just in the nick of time' tropes, ridiculous and impossible
fight scenes, a frankly annoying score and the ever-loathable Samuel L
Jackson.
