My brain hurts

OK, I gave it a few hours before I posted this because I thought I
might have missed something. Maybe it is like Pulp Fiction where it
seems like a disjointed mess, but when someone tells you the key
suddenly it slots together and makes sense. But it isn't. It is just a
confused mess. It does homage some 80's movie styling, right from the opening credits
there is a hint of something between Halloween and the Wraith. The
music is good. But then the holes are huge. The story doesn't make sense! He turns up
and they just take him in. Once the daughter figures out he is a fake
everyone just ignores it. It turns out he is 'just' some random
psychopath but part of his problem is that he kills anyone that knows
who he is? Half a dozen trained soldiers turn up but are completely
incompetent to the point that my girlfriend was complaining about their
lack of basic soldiering skills. And what was with the weird tilting guns when turning corners thing
that they were all doing?And of course he survives at the end and none of them can count to
three when removing the bodies? Really?!
