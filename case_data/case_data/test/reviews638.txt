Somehow, it was good

I went to see this movie with a very open mind, and I didn't know much
about the premise. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked
Unfriended. Seeing it in the theater instead of at home was
advantageous-- it was suspenseful since there were no distractions.The acting was one of the bright spots. There was no blatantly terrible
dialog and their reactions weren't cheesy or unbelievable. The editing
was also pretty seamless, and the premise of it being shown entirely
through Blaire's perspective was unique and interesting. We could see
her thought process, as she was typing and retyping things to figure
out the best wording to use. If you like horror/suspense films, give Unfriended a chance!
