Fantastically done

Agatha the angry ghost is magnificent. This whole movie is. The
animation is amazing and the story will warm and break your heart. Good
for those who love Burton and Selick, or just have a good imagination
and a love for films. Unfortunately, I've heard a lot of parents say it
was too scary and/or inappropriate for their children. To each their
own. But for me, if your kids can't handle this, they're most likely
too sheltered and scare too easily. Anything about this movie that
adults deem inappropriate, kids won't even understand until they get
older. This movie teaches an important lesson, and one even some adults
need to re-learn.
