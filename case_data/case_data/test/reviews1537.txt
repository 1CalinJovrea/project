S**t Party

Here's the entire scriptFood 1: F**k Food 2: F**k S**t innuendo Food 1: Motherf**k S**t C**t
(Repeat for all scenes)A great story idea which could've got people thinking completely ruined
by a script with no real jokes. Being British, it's in my nature to
swear unnecessarily every other word, but when will Seth Rogan and his
mates realise that swearing constantly is no longer funny and people
are just bored of it. This film could've been something so special that
would sit forever in that group of amazing did-it-firsts that everyone
tries to copy but fails at. But someone will do it better. This was
just F**king S**t
