Tries hard to be the next Transpotting and fails miserably

Irvine Welsh hates Scotland and he convinced me never to set foot in
his wretched country. As in Transpotting, the main character of the
movie (based on Welsh's novel) is a Scottish paranoid drug addict, only
this time he happens to be a policeman.Bruce is corrupted, depraved and ready to sink extremely low to get
promoted. The rest of the crew he is competing against is not much
better, so right from the start my question was "Why should I care?"
Then came a massive dose of deja-vu: a repetition of most of the gags
seen in Transpotting, only filthier. But the kiss of death is the total
lack of dark humour.The only feature that can make this sort of product bearable is some
fun, but this movie is totally unfunny and way OTT with its attempts to
outdo the most outrageous scenes seen on screen until now.
