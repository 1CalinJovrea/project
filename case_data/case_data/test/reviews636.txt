Where no idiot has gone before

Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the
origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed
to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.So who do they send? A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective
scientific nous is rivalled only by that of the Three Stooges. Within
minutes of touching down (conveniently beside the only 'man-made'
structures on the planet, a'la 1960s Star Trek) the 'scientists' are
yanking off their helmets, on the basis of 'it seems fine to me',
dipping their fingers into strange organic ooze, and lugging a severed
alien head back to an unquarantined spaceship in a sandwich bag.Once there, they speedily discover the meaning of life. Then, while one
of them gets a bit drunk, his two female companions decide it would be
useful to stimulate the head electrically to reanimate it. They don't
say why. They give it a bit too much juice, then too little,then dither
over too much or too little like a couple of schoolgirls fiddling with
a dicky bunsen burner, while the most important scientific discovery in
human history waggles its ears and rolls its eyes - before eventually
blowing up like a frog in a microwave.Are the scientists abashed? Is the man angry? Do they all calm down and
remember they have degrees in clever things, not diplomas in macram√©?
Do they heck.The WHOLE MOVIE is a litany of ludicrous so-called science, schoolboy
errors, and pseudo-profundity about the origin of species. Ironic
really, when none of the crew would have a chance in hell in any sort
of contest governed by Darwinian rules.Crass stupidity is rampant in every department. Hi-tech helmets record
every heartbeat - apparently until anything worth recording happens;
stranded crewmates are abandoned to their fate in favour of a quick
shag, and the spaceship door is opened to anyone who comes a-knocking.
Although, after hitting the 'welcome' button, Idris Alba does do a
double take and go 'Hold on a second!' but that might have just been an
involuntary ad lib at his own character's baffling idiocy.There is spectacular cinematography and effects, but not one iota of
originality has been squandered on plot, subtext, tension or characters
- which are as shallow as the Prometheus's muddy little gene pool.Ridley Scott is a hero of mine, but Prometheus is not the intelligent,
emotionally satisfying prequel that Alien deserves. It's a derisory,
empty experience - and anyone who loved Alien is surely too old and too
smart to be fobbed off with something this bad just because it's shiny.
