A neon lit parable of big city poison.

Nicolas Winding-Refn is a director who defies all analysis. Most
considered him a surefire "Commercial Success" following on from his
exceptional adaptation, Drive back in 2011. However, against all odds
Winding-Refn went darker, more subversive and all together more
polarising with his 2013 release Only God Forgives.The Neon Demon is sure to be equally divisive. I was lucky enough to
attend the red carpet premiere of the film in Cannes and was personally
blown away by it's unique style & vision. It's long slider shots demand
attention and draw attention to every minute detail on offer. It's use
of mirrors encourages the viewer to look beyond the "real" world and
examine what lies on the other side.Obviously, it goes without saying that this film looks amazing. If
nothing else, most of Winding-Refn's supporters or critiques will admit
that his films aesthetics are always incredible. However, despite the
muted dialogues and slow pacing, the film gripped me for its full 110
minute run time. This was because, although the movie is a "horror",
it's so much more. It's an examination of the human obsession with
beauty.Elle Fanning does a remarkable turn as Jesse - a young runaway, trying
to make it big in Los Angeles. Her beauty is so powerful that things
begin to work to her favour almost immediately on her arrival. More
over than that, her beauty seems to encapsulate and draw in those
around her, while repelling her peers who scathe her. Her natural
beauty is something that all the plastic surgery in LA can't generate.Jena Malone steals the film as Ruby - a make up artist who befriends
Jesse as soon as she arrives in the town. She also introduces Jesse to
the vacuous and vindictive pair of models played by Bella Heathcote and
Abbey Lee. If you haven't guessed already this is a film with a real
focus on females. Although there are a handful of male characters
(Dexters Desmon Harrington does an incredible turn as a high power
fashion photographer), the focus here is all feminine. Even down to the
decision to bring in a female DOP to shoot the film.There are too many twists and turns to get into here, but all I can say
is that this could be Winding-Refn's most powerful movie to date. It's
an analysis on the human condition and our obsession with natural
beauty. It claws and scratches at our preconceptions and breaks us
down, revealing the gooey centre; what makes us tick. Stellar
performances, amazing visuals, a banging score and a unique storyline
will cement this as a cult classic - of this I am sure.I cannot wait for the theatrical release if only to have more time to
soak in the films dreamy visuals, take in more of the films subtexts
and once again be blown away by the force of nature that is NWR.
