How could anyone who's seen more than 100 movies in their life, find this awesome?(minimal spoilers)

First of all, don't listen to me cause every useful review is from
people who adore this movie. Just let me tell you my honest opinion,
and then you can make your opinion about this movie.The Bad: Just like any typical Marvel movie, this movie just takes like
literally 2 minutes to show things from the past, that only have a
connection to this movie's plot, not actually showing how those things
were developed, or their connection to the Marvel universe(since they
are including him into that too). It's like: "Hey, we're making this
Ant-man movie, you don't need to know about how he can shrink, only
know that the technology came from a "Howard Stark" period of time".
That's pretty much it! It's like watching X-Men The Last Stand, or a
more modern Marvel movie, Captain America: Civil War(now I know where
that thing with sloppy backstory started), but whatever, people seem to
digest this very easily. Next, it's a very bad thing they started from
Guardians of The Galaxy, and then the next Marvel movies, and is the
badly placed humor. And for a movie made mostly to show what a real
life situation with superheroes would be, moments like when a director
jokes about firing, then not firing, then again firing his employee
it's just plain stupid. It's like, hey let's take this serious
situation and turn it into a scene that might make kids laugh. Well
this might work for your average movie- goer, but for others it's just
plain stupidity. Next and quite possibly the worst part of the movie is
those stupid dialogues when they show flashbacks while some guy in the
present repeats the flashback person's sentences while the flashback is
muted. This might work if this movie was a parody(ex. Superhero movie)
but with scenes like this included in a movie that has a plot or a
somewhat coherent action screams inconsistency. And this is what this
movie is all about... inconsistency. It's just like watching a parody
of a movie, where they mock the guys by repeating their lines but they
would be muted. Quite possibly the worst scenes I've witnessed in a
movie ever(in one that wants to be serious,... yeah)! Next, stupid
science, that goes beyond awful, saying that atoms can get closer? OMG,
if you don't know any science at least stay out of it, and don't
explain it to large public, leave real science to movies like
Interstellar or Contact or other sci-fi documentaries. I mean for a guy
like me who knows some things about chemistry or physics, it's just
plain stupid, and it isn't even possible to overlook, cause is so
stupid. If you want to make sci-fi nonsense that people won't think
about it, do stuff like Star Wars or Star Trek. Next, the protagonist
just happens to find the source of his future power by robbing the
person who'll become his ally, and a lot more of this clich√©-d scenes.
Next, the protagonist has been tracked for years yet, the movie shows
you no evidence of that ever happening... Next, sometimes the writers
don't care about contradictions like when ant-man lands on an airplane,
and how they've said earlier in the movie, the man who shrinks keeps
his weight and force, something should happen to that airplane, at
least if Ant-man stays on a thin piece of metal, that should bend
right? Well not in this movie however... Anyway, I could go on like
this forever, but there's a world limit. Finally, the villain is so
badly developed, and the final battle is so forgettable that I fell
asleep while watching it. It's practically, a revenge bad-guy, and why
he had to battle Ant-man was only kid's revenge like, nothing more.The good: The fight with Falcon was good, and most of the scenes with
the ants were nice too. The story was good as well, but this does not
cover the fact that this movie was a total mess, and a wanna-be-
serious movie that felt like a parody.Conclusion, you can watch this movie, but don't expect anything clever
or entertaining, just bland predictable, and it seems like everything
in this movie is a joke, and nothing is serious, which is unfortunate,
since it contradicts the way Marvel makes their movies right now. This
movie should deserve a maximum 6 or 6.5, but it seems people are this
easy to please nowadays, so my rating will be 1. It is actually
frustrating to see that this movie's rating is the same as Spider-Man
or Spider-Man 2 which are one of the finest Marvel movies to date. This
tells a lot about how low the level of quality in this new style of
movie trend really is.Quite possibly the worst "serious" movie I've seen in a while. Don't
trust IMDb ratings, rate movies by yourself!
