very bad fake

this is a silly and stupid set of stamps and manifestation of an
inferiority complex from a lack of knowledge. In the film, the mass of
historical and factual errors, and the film is not a history of the spy
Rudolf Abel and his exchange on pilot Francis Gary Powers, and a
pretentious propaganda picture.It all started back in the Spielberg movie "Terminal", but in this
movie took a truly catastrophic proportions. Spielberg does not have a
clue about life in the USSR and the GDR, and all of his view of life in
these countries is based on a picture of the American propaganda
magazines and newspapers of the time (ie, during the Cold War. Who
started the United States and its allies, and the Warsaw Pact was
created as a response against the NATO alliance. And the plan of
offensive war in Europe, originally did not belong to the Soviet Union
and the United States and the United Kingdom).If you are interested in the history of flying spy plane U-2 over the
Soviet Union and the subsequent exchange of Francis Gary Powers to the
Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, see the Soviet movie "Dead Season". It is much
better to do than this fake of Spielberg. In addition, in this old
Russian movie authentic costumes, interiors and uniforms of the period.
Unlike Spielberg film in which nothing is authentic, except for helmets
GDR Army.By the way, Francis Gary Powers voluntarily told all in captivity,
without tortures and horrors in "Spilberg style". Upon returning to the
US, he was accused that not blew himself up along with the aircraft at
ejection (under catapult CIA profit laid an explosive charge) and that
did not take the poisoned needle for suicide (Francis Powers
voluntarily gave the needle during the arrest).If you interesting to see a movie about Powers, watch Soviet movie "We
accuse" (1985). As far as I know, in the United States was no movie
about Francis Gary Powers. Although he fulfilled his soldier duty to
the end, and died like a hero - rescuing children from falling
helicopter.This movie - 0 from 10.
