Pointless...

I'm supposed to write here a minimum of 5 lines, whereas my summary
"Pointless..." says it all already. I haven't seen the first movie from
2012 and came accidentally across MM XXL. Even though some reviewers
here say the first one was better... well... I guess I'll simply skip
it. I gave in to watch this one because my wife wanted to watch it.
However, in the end even she thought it was BS.
