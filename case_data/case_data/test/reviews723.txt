The Best Horror/Comedy since Tucker and  Dale

Fantastically enjoyable movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
Sure there are some glaring potholes, but without them the movie
would've been MUCH less fun. I thought the casting and acting were spot
on. the kid that played Jeremy, the neighborhood bully was hilarious.
One of my favorite movies this year.
