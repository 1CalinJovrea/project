Non-existing baby hurting itself!

OK, so far I've only seen everyone praising this movie for how smart,
original and witty it is. Intriguing even! However, most people are
missing an obvious flaw in the design. Why is this movie stupid?Lets suppose for a while that time travel exists, even though its
ridiculous, and lets suppose there is this bureau of time travel (BTT).
At some point in time, someone in BTT decides, that they need an agent
(the fact this agent turned into a bomber doesn't matter) that has no
past, no family etc. So what did they do? What did they do? Seriously!Did they send Ethan Hawke character to the bar to persuade his younger
self to go into the past so he can make love to himself as a woman so
he can be born? No, because it would serve one and only PURPOSE and
that is TO HAVE ETHAN HAWKE as an agent (bomber)!!! This baby came out
of nowhere if you think about it! It is a vicious circle! All the
things that happened in the life of Jane/John were made to her/him by
herself/himself! And also, when did the bureau first accepted him/her
as an agent? When did a new copy of John/Jane came into existence so it
could interfere with itself? Never! Because his/hers existence is
illogical! You can't wrap this in a good looking sci-fi movie and
expect me to believe it!Time travel as a plot is stupid and this movie just proves it!
