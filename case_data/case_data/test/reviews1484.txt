Just missed by an inch of an fraction to become a classic.loved it

I am a big fan of horror but recently i cant remember a movie which i
enjoyed to my heart but then i saw MAMA and it was like a fresh air
which u asked from a long long time. What makes MAMA special and
different is it's Story and Acting.Not many horror movies has it now a
days but MAMA has it all..a beautiful and emotional film with great
horror elements to back it.The performance from Jessica Chastain is
mind blowing.when the movie starts I didn't seem to connect with her
character but as soon as the movie progressed she just blown my mind
with her screen presence and screen fit performance.few places r just
brilliant like the one where she finds lily outside of the house and
she brings her in but Lily tries to escape but the she holds he tight
and make her feel that she loves her from within and Lily starts
looking at her with innocence and Jessica hold her hands blow air on
them and ask Lily that "dose she liked it"..it moved me and i was just
speechless watching it.Just little more detailing would have turned it
into a classic for life.but never then less its one of the finest
horror film I watched in decades.Highly recommended.Loved it!
