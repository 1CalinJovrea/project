A good combination of action & comedy

'2 Guns' turned out to be a better film than I expected it to be. I
liked the plot and it had plenty of twists and turns. It is quite
suspenseful in places and keeps you guessing. It is about a bank
robbery (the masks here were quite cool) that goes wrong and the two
have to team up to put it right.The acting is very good. Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington were a
very good team, they had a good on screen chemistry and I liked how
their friendship developed. The supporting cast were also good.The film is a mixture of action and comedy. There are good shoot out
scenes and car chases etc. Then there is comedy thrown in for good
measure, made even funnier because it's silly humour in a serious
situation. Mark Wahlberg's character has some memorable funny moments
and both do the action scenes very well.Overall it was a good fast paced action film, it had suspense and
humour too. A really good mixture. At 1 hour and 35 minutes I felt it
was a good length, you got everything you wanted out of it and it
wasn't dragged on like some other films would. I enjoyed it from start
to finish and would recommend it.8/10.
