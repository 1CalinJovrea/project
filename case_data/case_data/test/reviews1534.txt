Great movie.

Excellent cast, scrip and acting (yes, acting). You can't expect Sly
and Arnie to play Shakespeare, and they won't. They are meant to kick
ass and that's what they do.The story goes by smoothly and fast. Dialogues and sequence are really
well written. Main characters bring you in the movie and Jim Caviezel
is great as the villain. So is Vince Jones and the rest of the
characters.This isn't for everyone but I can't believe this movie is flying so
under the radar. What a shame. This is old school, action packed
thriller.
