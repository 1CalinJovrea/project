A Waste of Money, I Felt Truly Ripped Off

OK, I'm not sure how I can review this one without dropping a few
spoilers here and there, so I marked this one as "contains spoilers",
just in case. First, you need to know the point of view from which I
approached this movie...in order to understand why I rated it awful. I
did not read the books. I did not read any of the books. In fact, I
can't remember a single book I have read in the past 10 years or so. I
*DID* however see the first movie in the series, Hunger Games. I went
to see Hunger Games only because I'd read it was a really good movie. I
was NOT disappointed. Hunger Games (the first movie) was one of the
best movies I have ever seen! 10/10, simply awesome!!!In fact, it was because I enjoyed the FIRST movie so much that I felt I
definitely had to see the SECOND movie in the theater. And so I went to the second movie knowing NOTHING about it, other than
having remembered that the first movie was awesome...The first hour or so of Catching Fire was pretty boring. But it was
easy to sit through it, as it was building anticipation for the action
that you knew was coming. And oh yes, there was plenty of action to
come later. But just as quickly as the action started, the action
ended.In fact, as the credits were rolling, I was glued to my seat. I was
refusing to believe that it was over.I've had a couple of days to ponder how to review this movie. At first,
I was thinking something along the lines of... "It seems like the
producers ran out of money halfway through filming, but decided to
release it unfinished anyway..." But later, I realized... What I'd just
watched (Catching Fire) was actually a two-hour trailer for Hunger
Games 3.No conclusion of plot here, just setting up plot for a future movie. I
paid 10 bucks to watch a trailer. I feel ripped off.
