Hush is a perfect home invasion thriller after a long time with an engaging screenplay,lot of nail biting moments.

Hush (2016): Home Invasion thrillers (sometimes termed as horror too)
can impress only if they are nail bitingly perfect.But now-a-days home
invasion thrillers are nothing but dull rehash of the same stories.Hush
is not exemption from that too because Hush has the same plot like
other home invasion films but 2 major things gabbed the interest of
mine. 1)Here the lead role is deaf 2)Directed by Mike Flanagan,the one
who brought Oculus which is one my favorite horror film.So how is Hush?Plot: Maddie (Kate Siegel) is a deaf author, living in a remote house
in the woods, settling in for the evening. She's trying to finish her
latest novel while avoiding distractions, such as calls from her
ex-boyfriend. But there's someone outside: a masked intruder (John
Gallagher Jr.)with an arsenal of weapons, and Maddie has to figure out
how to keep him out and then how to escape.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: Character development is the major pro in
this film.We instantly get connected to Madidie's character and her
deafness.Mike Flanagan used this point and crafted a brilliant nail
biting thriller without any dull moments.He's a rare modern horror
director who still prioritizes suspense, and he frames the tense
altercations between the pair to maximum effect.All the trials made by
Maddie created a tension in audience and whenever the psycho finds out
about it,we feel more tense than Maddie.2)Performances: Kate Siegel is brilliant in the role of Maddie.Be it
her expressions with sign language with her friend or her first
confrontation with psycho clearly shows us that she has a bright future
ahead.John Gallenger looked more terrifying especially in mask.3)Duration: A duration of just 1hr 21 min is a perfect duration for
this home invasion thriller.Flanagan perfectly edited this movie
without any drag.So,Hush is a perfect home invasion thriller after a long time with an
engaging screenplay,lot of nail biting moments.My rating 7.5/10 Image may contain: one or more people, text and
