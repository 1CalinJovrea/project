Funny and Comedic At The Same Time

I just recently saw "The Other Woman" and I found that the film was
funny and comedic at the same time. Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, and Kate
Upton have the perfect chemistry as a trio of women who all find that
they have been played by the same man with Mann's character Kate as his
wife and Diaz and Upton's characters as his mistresses. The scenes that
are completely hilarious are when Kate is putting estrogen pills in her
husband's smoothies while Carly has put laxative powder in his drink.
Taylor Kinney as Kate's brother Phil is so hot in this movie that any
girl or woman even would just swoon when he's on the screen. Nikki
Minaj may only be in a few scenes but she doesn't steal the show from
these veteran actresses. You will have a great laugh when you see this
movie because I know I did. Any woman who has ever been cheated on will
gladly root for the downfall of this cheater.
