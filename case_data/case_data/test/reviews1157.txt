Sits right on the edge of being awesome

The DUFF is quite entertaining and has a really nice poignant message.
The film captures life, I mean the characters, and I'm mostly referring
to Wesley (Robbie Amell) and Bianca (Mae Whitman), are realistic,
humanized. I got a weird sense that I was watching people I knew and
not a stereotypical film version of them. The movie has that
documentary feel to it and it's due to how the leads portrayed their
characters and how easy it is to relate to them.The only real disappointment I have with the movie is that I thought it
would be funnier. It's still a comedy but it's a little more serious
than I expected. Watching the trailer I thought that I would laugh a
hell of a lot more, specially when you look at the established comedic
cast in it. Whitman and Amell do have good comedic timing and The DUFF
is fairly funny but the quality of the jokes are not as high as I
hopped they would be. The story is intelligent, insightful, and kind of funny but it's still
very predictable. The DUFF is on the edge of being great but it's not. @wornoutspines
