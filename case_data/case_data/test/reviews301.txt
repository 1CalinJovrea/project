Total let down

This movie is one of those remakes which is not as good as the original
90s version. In other words it was pointless.There is some continuing action that keeps one mildly engaged but the
story is weak. The Arnie version had a clear and interesting plot with
charm and wit remember "Sweetheart, be reasonable. After all, we're
married!", "Consider this a divorce". Also the climax was grand and
fascinating - the lack of oxygen bug eyed thing.There are some vast multi level future cities that resemble an
overcrowded Hong Kong or Shanghai. But the chase routines that race
through them are repetitive after a while.Kate Beckinsale's character kept popping back too many times and there
is no reason why she is so relentless. Maybe just because her husband
is the director. It was nice to see Jessica Biel in a big budget movie
again. Colin Farrell plays a more regular guy than an action hero which
is good but he doesn't have interesting lines to deliver.Overall, see this if you want to but be warned it's not as good as the
90s version.
