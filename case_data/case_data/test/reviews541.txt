Superficial Tosh

Poorly scripted film, with no intention (or in any event achievement)
of character development. The result - I just did not care what
happened to who.An example - Dr S is a top notch surgeon who must have achieved top
notchedness by amongst other things assessing risks. So - said Dr
decides to drive a car at silly speeds, in silly weather, in a silly
way and then decides it would be cool to forget the driving and take a
phone call; and look at a medical image.Another example - Dr S gets a right kicking in Nepal from some serious
heavies. I mean this is going to severely damage you kicking. Barely a
scratch.And guys - there are 7 cervical vertebrae. You will not have a C7/8
injury C7/T1 sure.The FX are standard stuff and better done in Inception.Save your money.
