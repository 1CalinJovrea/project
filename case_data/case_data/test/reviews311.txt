good enough for a high school movie

I guess, I was too old in age to watch this movie. It might aim at
teenagers. To me, a grown-up middle aged man, the movie was boring and
predictable. All boys and girls have stereotype characters. Especially
boring is the fact that all characters are very conservative thinking,
not much youth in them. They all go a bit wild during playing the game
"Nerve". But after moral (not ethics) catches them up they fall back in
place and will live ordinary boring lives. What remains after leaving
the cinema, is the depressing fact that our digital world can only be
thought as going mad, that internet brings out mostly the bad side of
people, but very seldom the good. In these kind of movies the happy
ends finish with the heroes turning off the computers or mobiles. But
the kids going out of the cinemas don't.
