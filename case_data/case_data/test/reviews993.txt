Jeepers Creepers 3 fails to hold up to the first two

If you chose not to get tickets to the only night that Jeepers Creepers
3 would be in theaters, congratulations, you dodged a bullet. As most
movies go, the sequels tend to make things worse with the more numbers
they add to the end; especially with horror. I've been keeping my eye
on this one for years as it was continually rumored on IMDb forums
(R.I.P.  but that's another post for another time). Victor Salva
finally decided it was time to revive The Creeper (aka Victor's alter
ego). I have something lined up to discuss the directors background a
little more, but for this post I'd like to focus on the movie. I'm
going to keep the spoilers to a minimum but be warned there will be a
few minor ones.The Good: If you watched the first Jeepers Creepers and remember The
Creeper's bad ass meat wagon  it's back. Not only is it back but it's
got all sorts of fun little devices that make his hunting just a little
more vicious. Plus, I think it answers a few questions as to why nobody
has ever made it out of the truck alive, even if they went in as such.
It does make you suspend disbelief a bit with some of its features and
make you ask yourself more than a few questions; but then again, you're
also watching a movie about a winged creature that regenerates parts
from eating people, so remember that.Speakin' of that handsome devil, I think he looked much better in this
than in Jeepers Creepers 2. He just looked like some weird, naked
lizard and I appreciate that they made an effort to rectify that a bit
in the new movie. Most of the characters in this aren't much to speak
of nor do any of them have the kind of charm that Justin Long had in
the first but there were a couple worth mentioning. The Creeper hunting
squad leader (Danny) is a pretty likable fellow along with his
counterpart Sgt. Tubbs who provides some comic relief.The Bad: Usually when a character is added in as comic relief it's
because the movie is too heavily weighing in one specific direction and
needs the levity. The problem with the comic relief in Jeepers Creepers
3 is that the whole movie felt like more of a comedy than a horror and
it didn't need the extra comic relief added in. Some of the laughs were
intentional, but I found that people were laughing at parts of the
movie not intended to be (usually from bad slow- motion scenes). The
whole movie reeked of a straight to video or bad SyFy original. It's
very unfortunate that this movie fell so far from the tree, where the
first delivered true terror and an atmospheric creepiness that
resonated for days.After 14 years I was shocked that this movie felt rushed and
under-budgeted. Not rushed in the sense that the pacing was too fast
but just that the story seemed disjointed right out of the gate. It
kicks off with "23 years later" but then immediately puts you in the
aftermath of when The Creeper flew off at the end of the first one. By
the end it segues into the second movie.Now, it's been some years since I've watched Jeepers Creepers 2 but I
don't recall any of the kids on the bus knowing what the **** it was
they were actually dealing with (other than the girl who had the vision
of Derry). I have a bone to pick here; why would one of the surviving
kids of this attack not immediately tell everyone, "oh **** I just
dealt with this thing like a day ago!". It's bad storytelling is what
it is, and an unnecessarily shoehorned way to connect all three movies.
Then before they roll credits, it turns out the "23 years later" part
is intended to indicate the person who narrated the beginning and end.
It then leaves it somewhat open for another installment. Which, bad
news Victor, but I don't think that's happening any time soon. Rant
over.This sequel didn't add on anything that we didn't already know. I can
get on board with a sequel so long as it expands upon what we already
know, even if it's just a little bit. I wasn't expecting to find out
where The Creeper went to school and learned all of his nifty sewing
tricks, but at least throw your audience a bone every now and again.
All we really learn is that it (he?) apparently gets very sad and goes
on a crow genocide when he has to destroy old limbs. Which I won't
spoil exactly what's involved with that, but I'll just say the fact
that this plot device wasn't used to give the audience a little more
history into The Creeper was a huge miss.The Judgment: At this point it's no secret that I wasn't a fan of this
movie. It failed to deliver on multiple fronts which makes me
reconsider why they really gave this a limited release. I could have
forgiven some bad CGI and slow-motion effects for a good, creepy story.
I'm hoping that the next sequel for this movie stays on forums as a
theory and never makes it to production. If you're really curious and
were a fan of the other two movies, it might be worth the couple bucks
you'll pay at Redbox for a bad horror movie night.See this and other reviews at TheCynicist.com Edited for IMDb
