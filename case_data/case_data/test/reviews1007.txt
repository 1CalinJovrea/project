Do not let the slow pace fool you.

So this movie was not for everyone, I personally thought this movie was
great.An exorcism movie that does not involve the devil is refreshing to see,
and the experience of the movie is played out quite well in the pacing
and how events unfold. The fact it features the Jewish religion over
Christianity is a very nice touch, one you rarely see in a movie of
this style as most people hear exorcism and assume the Catholic church.
While many may complain it is too slow, and other such things let me
ask you this question.What were you expecting from a movie that was purely plot driven?Personally the acting was also great, I could empathize with the
characters and understand them. The father was just worried about his
daughter, who hid her signs of the problem well until things got bad. I
mean when it really showed and she was hitting the kid at school, that
looked like something that night happen in school over even something
small like a favorite pencil or item. There was in my opinion no weak
performances in the acting, coupled with a solid and strong story makes
for quite a good movie.Lastly the execution was some of the best I had seen this far, it
flowed and was not jumpy like say the bourne movies. Nothing was out of
place and the movie felt creepy and eerie throughout with all of the
silence that you could almost hear in many parts of it. If your looking
for a truly good movie that will have you walking away satisfied this
is one of them.It is a well written, acted, and executed movie that while it may seem
slow moving is well worth the watch. Think of it what you will, but I
recommend this movie as one of my top ten movies of 2012.
