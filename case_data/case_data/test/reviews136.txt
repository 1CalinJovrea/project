Brilliant film!

Now "The winter soldier" is everything a Captain America movie should
be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the
trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them
combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes
different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen. Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course
it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the
century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack
from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a
mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me
the 70's political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another
Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes
the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes
regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it
never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if
it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers
replacing the viewer's voice on screen. At one point there is a talk
about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one
of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not
get this stuff these days!Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the
mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found
time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!)
to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a
confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky's memory
recall, Natasha's kissing talk. They could have easily skip these
"crap" but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent
with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to
the on screen counterparts. However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set
higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors
(of the "Community" fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap's
shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In
addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent
examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I
truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator
fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the
encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo
brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car
chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something
for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen.
Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips,
wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing
sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron
man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no
less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and
blood too).The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came
out as a bit arrogant in the "Avengers" and the least interesting
character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought
what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in
protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era
of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds
himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one
point he even considers himself Fury's caretaker of terrorist
"problems". The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury
and Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson
expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in "Iron Man" to a fully
supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin
Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far
there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing
heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move
and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo
brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational
dialogue that kept surprised me for a "summer" and "mindless"
blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is
very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic
sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected?
probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly
unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret
considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout
the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light
hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes
rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue. Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging
forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot,
intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying.
This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart,
immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended.
