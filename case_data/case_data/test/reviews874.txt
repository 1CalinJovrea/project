Disappointed

at how incredibly awful 'Pompeii' was. Sheesh, it was such a cheap rip
Ripoff of 'Gladiator.' It seems as if Hollywood assumes the 14 to 24
year old kids have never heard of or seen 'Gladiator.' So they do a
cheap "Cliff Notes" version of it.But in the new extremely dumbed down version, they start with the scene
in Morocco where Russell Crowe kicks butt in the arena.Then they introduce the "high class" girl that falls in love with the
cute slave guy.Then they veer off into the teen soap opera BS.Good God Man!!!! The hero and the African gladiator start off as
enemies. But what do you know? After the little cute guy Orlando Bloom
look a like that is 5 foot 4 earns his respect, they become best
friends. Who could have predicted that? It's a cotton candy film with
bad CGI. Pathetic really.If they had wanted to make a good film, they'd of had the volcano erupt
at the beginning and made it 'Pompeii, Zombie Apocalypse.' I would have
watched that until the end, unlike this piece of trash.Oh, my cat that was sitting next to me told me.
