The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to.

"Things change fast here in Benghazi." Jack Silva (Krasinski) has just
been reassigned as a guard for the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi,
Libya. What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11,
2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill
the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision.
Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help
their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I
was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting
and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it
was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of
special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director
that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I
was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the
drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is
not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I
liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good
Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+.
