Insect Horror meets Sci-Fi

6.25 of 10. If you're looking for something beyond another spider film,
The Fly, Spiderman, or the Thaw, this adds something new to mix. It's
also ahead of the curve on the zika-like infections.Excellent visual and sound FX for a low-budget, indie film where the
writer and director are the same person.So much horror is fantasy based that another strong part of this film
is that there's reality/science integrated into the horror. If you want
horror that's not based purely on nonsense, you'll definitely
appreciate this film.The only weak part of the film involves the casting. With more budget
and bigger actors, this could have easily been a more recognized film.
As it is, it will probably pick up a cable audience and eventually turn
into a cult hit.
