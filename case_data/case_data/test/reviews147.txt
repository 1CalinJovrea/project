A Nice Dream

Project X was exactly what you thought it was going to be. The movie
spends a very brief 20 minutes establishing the plot line and
introducing the characters. The rest of the time is spent delving into
a teenage male fantasy-complete with drugs, booze, and hot babes. As a teenager myself, I found this movie interesting because it felt
like I was there, at the party. For 88 minutes I (and probably all
other teenagers) got to see our fantasy play out on the big screen,
this was the stuff we could only dream about. Hard core Movie lovers will hate this film, and I don't blame them.
It's true, Project X won't win any awards, and it'll probably be
forgotten in a couple months once bigger productions like John Carter
and the Hunger Games come out. But what Project X lacks in the "theatrical masterpiece" department it
makes up for with a message. That message is the plight of teenagers
around the the world- which is the desire to be accepted. Basically
this movie says that if you aren't popular, then do what society has
deemed "cool" and throw a huge party. Even though I'm a teen I don't
agree with this message (shocking I know). Sure it would be cool to
ATTEND an epic party like that , but would you really want to throw
one?? At the end of the movie the main character, Thomas Kub, says "I
burned down my neighborhood, bankrupted my parents, trashed my college
career and I'll be in debt for the rest of my life.." Wow really?? I
may be 18, but there's no way I would destroy my future for ONE night
of epicness. What most teenagers don't realize is that this "pubescent
angst" period is a drop in the bucket of our lives. It seems to me that
trashing 80% of your life (just so that 10% can be spend bathing in the
false admiration of people who, after high school, you'll probably
never meet again) isn't worth it. Project X lets teenagers fantasize about what could, not necessarily
should, be like. There's a reason why it's a called "Hollywood" because
like most movies, this is a fantasy created to draw audiences, not to
be taken seriously.Project X was an epic 88 minute dream, but like all dreams, when the
lights come on, it's time to wake up and get back to reality.
