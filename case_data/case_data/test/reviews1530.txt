Catching Zzzzzs

Before you catch fire this weekend, be sure to rewatch THE HUNGER
GAMES, because for the first half of this brooding, inferior sequel,
the characters do nothing but wallow in their extremely complicated
past With banal, pretentious dialogue even worse than a soap opera, the
teen-adored romantic adventure has reached an extremely corny level...
Even the preparation for the games, introducing a new crop of teams and
contestants, is dull and uninteresting. The overall plot involves a post-apocalyptic world wherein The Capitol
rules with an iron fist, and to avoid the threat of revolution there
are televised games in which young people fight each other to the
death... Making one highly resilient warrior, Katniss Everdeen
(Jennifer Lawrence), a revered folk hero risking everything for love.Well if that sounds both intriguing and exciting, it sure was... But this time around, the cutthroat survival aspect has been replaced
by a wannabe JURRASSIC PARK with fanged baboons and other acts of
bizarre nature including killer fog, thunderstorms and tidal wavesThis overly computer-generated switch-up, attempting to raise stakes
from the original, ultimately leaves the audience  both within the
film's game show and inside your local theater  nothing and no one to
actually root for.
