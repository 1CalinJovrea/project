Kidman shines in an unfulfilling mystery

A film that for its entirety is crying out for a satisfying ending to
make all that has come to pass worthwhile, Strangerland fails at its
final hurdle and becomes a tale with huge potential that remains left
in the dusty plains of the outback wherein the stories mysteries lie.Strangerland is most certainly a unique disappearance mystery, a
strange hybrid of domestic drama moulded into the intrigue of just what
happened to the two Parker children, last seen wandering off into the
great unknowns of outback Australia, but despite consistently
threatening to become a great addition to the recently mostly barren
Australian cinema classic handbook, Kim Farrant's film just can't gel
into something totally recommendable or overly memorable.First time director Farrant does show glimpses of a filmmaking talent,
her images of the land and direction of some of her actors is of a high
order and Strangerland's tone is often nerve rackingly eerie and
there's an air of dread that permeates through most of film. From
Maddison Brown's performance as promiscuous teen Lili, the town of
Nathgari itself and the looming shadow of the barren landscape that
surrounds our characters mixed with Keefus Ciancia's atmospheric score,
all combine to give Strangerland a unique identity worthy of lead
Nicole Kidman's committed turn.In the doldrums for some time now it's great to see Kidman showcase her
considerable talents once more with a layered turn as the conflicted
mother of the lost children Catherine Parker. Kidman's performance is
both brave and unflattering and she's a highlight of Strangerland's
ensemble. Ably supported by the evergreen Hugo Weaving as the local
detective, Kidman elevates the film despite the overplayed presence of
a distracting Joseph Fiennes who once again reminds us as to why his
been largely forgotten about since his appearance in Shakespeare in
Love. Young Australian performer Meyne Wyatt is also worthy of a
mention in his role as young Aboriginal local Burtie.Strangerland has moments; it also sucks you into its mysterious centre
only to drop the bundle in the films last act. If Strangerland had in
fact had a better catch on its hook it could've quite easily become one
of, if not the Australian film of the year but as it stands it's going
to be remembered only for a timely reminder that Nicole Kidman can in
fact act and lead a film. A disappointing result for a film that just
might have been.2 Â½ high quality skate parks out of 5
