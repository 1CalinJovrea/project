One of the best zombies film i ever seen

Very good scenario and the actors are excellent. This film keeps you in
stress until the end.If you like zombie film don't miss this great movie. Those monsters are
very fast (like in "28 days later") and very very aggressiveKorean director are very good in making thrillers film. Now you can
count on them for horror adventure and zombies stories.You can also see "Seoul station" from the same director. A very nice
animation from the same director and from witch "Busanhaeng" is the
sequel.2 hours of pure anxietyNice images of train crash
