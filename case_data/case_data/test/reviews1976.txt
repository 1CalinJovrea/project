Cultural Marxism at its Finest

A cute female rabbit becomes a police officer and is instantly the best
officer the world has ever seen - surpassing all of her dumb male co-
workers who belittle her for being just a cute dumb bunny. The film
then descends into a commentary on racial issues as the rabbit says
that a bunch of predators may be attacking people as "its in their DNA"
and the media and politicians whip up mass hysteria to control the
people (ok, that part is pretty valid). The rabbit then learns her
lesson about how it's wrong to call out dangerous criminals if they're
all from the same race, and that it was really the government
manipulating the predators into being evil.The sloths were pretty funny, though.
