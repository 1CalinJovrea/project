Great Superman film and this film is Comic Book Superman post crisis Not Donners Silver Age version

All in all i have to say Man of Steel is a great film, saw the early
screening and believe me this film is up there with TASM and Batman
Begins. I expect the film to be divisive for the reasons being this
isn't the Donner Continuity. Matter a fact most of the critics of this
film kept referencing to the Donner Films every paragraph in their
reviews. Let me get this out of the way right now and this is a sad
reality to people who are fans of COMIC BOOK Superman. Nobody knows
comic book superman a lot of people claim superman was always light
hearted, that is BS when Jerry Siegel and Joel Shuster made superman he
was a very serious character and wasn't a boyscout the popular idea of
Superman being who he is ( which is slowly changing with MOS and post
crisis version) is Silver Age and that's a fact a lot of fans don't
want to admit. Man Of Steel does a amazing job and giving us Modern Superman better
then Brandon Routh ever did in all honesty. His Superman was too
selfish. Henry Cavill Superman serious demeanor is pure Kingdom Come
superman and Golden Age Superman and Bruce Timm superman from the 90s(
the original vision of the writers superman was supposed to be taken
has a serious science fiction character has superman earliest adventure
dealt with crime and corporate greed and a lot of his villains dealt
with Transdimsional travel like some Bioshock Infinite stuff. Comics
Code came along and we have Silver Age campyness. Anyways the special
effects and the acting are solid. Superman is a bit to serious but i
really don't care there are Superman in comics that are very serious
like Kingdom Come Superman and to me Cavill Superman falls under pure
Golden Age Superman personality.Russel Crowe was awesome in this film he has more screen time and
everyone will agree this is the best Jor El ever in all honesty better
then Brando IMO. Micheal Shannon has Zod was the only this that was disappointing but he
was still good none the less and still way more threatening then the
Mandarin of Iron Man 3 or the Real Mandarin i might add. DC at least
showing that there villains are not throw away characters.Amy Adams has Lois Lane is great and i expect there relationship to
expand more in the sequel to this film ( which will definitely be
better since WB wants Star Wars Empire Strikes Back Writer and Lost Ark
Indiana Jones film) I have a feeling that she is the best Lois Lane and
why some people may think its a miscast it is not IMO it isn't.Kevin Cosner and Diana Lane are great in this showing a more realistic
depiction or should i say NOT the Silver Age Superman's your destined
for great things Pa and Ma Kent like we had but the more Golden Age
Version when they were very over protective of Clark has a child.Action in this film rivals the avengers and the spectacle is absolutely
incredible MOS fight scenes have Heart the critics are BS a lot cause i
didn't see them say anything about Iron Man 3 fights don't you. Man of
Steel has raised the bar on action in Superhero films and i expect the
action will be toned down for the sequel a bit more cause of the
possibility of Lex Luthor has the villain. Man of Steel for me has a
Comic Book fan of Superman and love for DC and Marvel characters Man of
Steel is a thrilling experience and will entertain Man of Steel will be
the Anti Iron Man Fans love it audience love it critics pan it. But for
me Man of Steel is a 9.8/10
