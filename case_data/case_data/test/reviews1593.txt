Yule Probably Turn it Off After About Forty Minutes

A sick, nihilistic film with one and only one plot twist. A half hour
into the movie it takes the worst possible turn, and you know where the
rest of it is headed. At that point it becomes neither horrifying nor
thrilling, but just plain nauseating. It's not fun and violent the way
the similarly- themed and much more engaging The Babysitter is (a film
which is properly labeled a horror/comedy, unlike this film). It's not
gross out gross like the comparatively soulless torture porn Saw/Hostel
movies. It's not even fascinating as an exploration of sociopathology
as was American Psycho or Twisted Nerve (which is the film it most
closely resembles). It's jaw-dropping only because I find it hard to
believe that those involved thought it would be entertaining as is. The
trailer hides the twist and sells it as a fun exercise in the little
brat left home alone turning the tables on some home invaders, only
with blood and carnage as a result rather than Three Stooges sound
effects. That is not what this movie is. Not even close. But that's
what The Babysitter is, so watch that instead.
