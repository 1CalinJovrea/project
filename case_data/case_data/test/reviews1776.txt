Meh

I didn't have entirely high hopes for this, despite Mark Strong who in
the main delivers great work, and Jamie Bell, who despite reminding me
overtime of Billy Elliot has also done quite well in his roles in my
opinion, but I thought it could be an interesting tale of this
historical event.In the main it wasn't terrible, Mark and Jamie act well enough, and the
tell of the story is accurate enough based on what I remember of these
events and subsequent stories written thereafter. Its not really an
action movie, there is little to none of that... it's more about the
thriller (perhaps) relationship between Mark Strong and the Hostage
takers.... which was adequate, though not enough to stop me from
wandering off and looking up twitter and Facebook midway through the
app.The worst element for me however is Abbie Cornish. The fake British
accent was simply awful, clearly she is no better at doing an accent
than she is at actually acting, it was bad, just awful. I was surprised
to see that this movie was funded or in some way involved the New
Zealand Film Commission (who clearly couldn't find a NZ script worth
funding?), so maybe that explains the random appearances of kiwi and
Aussie actors and accents popping up. It was simply distracting and
irritating to me.Overall, it was a meh film, as I say, it didn't keep my attention and
the annoying accents, fake accents and terrible acting just added to
the woe.
