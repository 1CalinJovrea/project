Mads for president (or something like that)

A very well made period piece that did quite a lot of things right.
Costume design, set design and the other departments are spot on. And
when you have actors like Mads M., you know you won't be able to not do
good. While this is based on real characters, one can see that it
surely must have dramatized a few things (I didn't read up on the
story, so it's only guessing).Still, even with that "criticism", the movie and it's clich√©s does
pretty well. It works as a drama and a character study as well. There's
not that much violence, which makes a few scenes with blood, work even
better. But there is a bit of nudity, so be aware of that, in case that
bothers you.
