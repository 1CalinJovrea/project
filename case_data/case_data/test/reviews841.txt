A piece of garbage

I sometimes wonder if I live on the same planet as critics on IMDb.
This is easily the very worst movie of the year and one of the ten
worst of all time. Poorly written way way way way too long and so
filled with lies clich√©s and stupidity it boggles the mind. I admit as
a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are
tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause. That
Jackman would make this movie after his magnificent performance in Lez
Miz could only have been for the money. His role is a one-dimensional
idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G
has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what
is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids.
There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were.
This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time. Its length is
inexcusable, its plot beyond idiotic and its actors were like very bad
run of the mill nobodies. They all should be ashamed of themselves--the
writer, director actors and everyone else. Don't see this film. Boycott
it, and if not tell your friends to forget it, God it was awful!!
