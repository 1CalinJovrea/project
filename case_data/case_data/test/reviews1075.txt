Not for everyone

If you are religious at all, don't watch it and don't make a fuss over
the fact that others don't believe in your faith. Move on and live your
life, stop trying to impose it on others.Now that this is out of the way. The movie is hit and miss for me. A
lot of the comedy that didn't get me is because nuns are doing or
saying it. To me, personally, nuns are a joke by themselves so having
them do human things is not funny. There is were the problem with the
movie his. If you are religious you will be offended and if you are not
you probably won't care. To make it simple. If you think that a nun
swearing is funny than you will love it. If not than probably you will
be board.The story is basically 3 nuns exploring sexuality in there own way. One
mild, one confuse and one to the extreme. The only thing I actually
liked about the movie was Aubrey Plaza but I always like her weird way
witch I suspect is not acting at this point but just the kind of person
she is.All in all, not a terrible movie per say but will be good only to a
selected few. I would not recommend but I would also not discourage
someone from watching it.
