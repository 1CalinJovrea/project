Shazam!!

This film is about four magicians brought together to perform the
ultimate trick...to rob a bank (or so they would have you believe). I
think that's as far as anyone really got with the plot apart from a few
obvious twists along the way. Each of the four magicians is drafted in
for their individual talents however these aren't really highlighted or
explored during the film in any detail. In fact there is no character
development at all which is more disappointing given the fact that the
cast includes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman among others. So a few minutes in and they perform their robbing a bank trick, the
FBI man and the Interpol girl, who are somehow teamed up, are flummoxed
so they take the magicians in for questioning. This doesn't go well for
the FBI as the magicians use their mind/card tricks to outwit them and
in the end they are let go. So the FBI calls in the help of Morgan
Freeman, whose job is working out and explaining how tricks are done,
to help. He has clearly seen this all before and explains the bank
robbery within seconds. This is where i kind of lost interest in the film. Anyway there are
some attempts at this stage to add some depth to the movie but these
all fail. The confrontations between Caine and Freeman are tired and
they both just seem to be going through the motions. The love interest
between the FBI man and the Interpol girl is forced and comes from
nowhere. Basically she is hot and they are working on a case together
so they fall in love. Even the main four cast members have no chemistry
or likability. So moving on a couple more tricks are performed and the cat and mouse
game with the FBI continues. I wont ruin the disappointing end but
let's just say there are a few twists that anyone who has seen a movie
before would have worked out by now and then the film ends. All in all the worst film I've seen in a long time and shame on Woody
Harrelson for following his excellent performance in Seven Psychopaths
with this garbage.
