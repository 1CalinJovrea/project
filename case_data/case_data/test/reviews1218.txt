Brilliant, finally a musical worth watching

I feel compelled to submit a review for this movie, purely because some
of the atrocious reviews I've seen contributed by others.To give context, I grew up in the 80s and 90s, and pretty much know all
the songs backwards - surprisingly... decades later. I did not grow up
in LA, or the States for that matter, but I most certainly grew up with
just about every song played in this movie.I absolutely hate musicals. With a passion. So, even though my friends
encouraged me to watch this movie, I resisted. Eventually I caved, and
all I can say is that I absolutely loved the movie! My wife loved the
movie, but in all honesty, our 10 year old thought it was OK - purely
because she didn't know any of the songs.If you love rock, and grew up with 80s rock, this movie is for you.
This movie isn't called Rap of Ages or Pop of Ages or R&B of Ages or
Classical Music for the Ages... it's called Rock of Ages. Reviewers
posting they walked out after 15 minutes, really shouldn't contribute
here. And quite frankly, you need to have a serious problem if you are
analyzing the actors voices with respect to the original artists. This
movie is good fun, and true to the times... This movie is THE musical for all rockers out there! Absolutely
wonderful fun for the family, with a stellar performance from the
entire cast. A good couple of chuckles in there, and if you're over 35
years old... I dare you to not sing along with some of those classics.
With so much rubbish coming out of Hollywood to keep the nay-sayers
busy with their critical reviews, this is a refreshing change.If rock is not your choice of music, skip this movie... but if you grew
up in the 80s, you should appreciate the music, fun and experience
portrayed in this movie.This movie rocked!
