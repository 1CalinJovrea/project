Leave the kids at home for this one  this revisionist take on the classic fairy tale is an entertaining blend of horror and humour that is as gory as it is vulgar

What you may or may not remember about the Brothers Grimm' story is
over and done with in the first ten minutes of writer-director Tommy
Wirkola's revisionist treatment of the classic tale, which basically
imagines what happens after the happily ever after. And so Wirkola
fast- forwards the story many years later, where he would like us to
believe that Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) have
found their calling as witch hunters, travelling around from village to
village killing the evil ones who kidnap children and rescuing their
abductees in the process.One particular such mission brings them to the town of Augsburg, where
a beautiful blonde-haired woman named Mina (Pihla Viitala) is due to be
drowned in front of an angry crowd by the shifty Sheriff Berringer
(Peter Stormare). The Mayor (Rainer Bock) is not so fast to pronounce
judgment on her for the spate of disappearances, and has hired Hansel
and Gretel to get to the bottom of it. Seeing no visible signs of
sorcery on her, Hansel and Gretel free her, inadvertently setting
themselves on a collision course with the Sheriff.But the bitter Sheriff and his band of hunters are the least of their
problems  indeed, their most pressing concern is the Grandmother Witch
Muriel (Famke Janssen) and her hench-women, who have been keeping the
children they have kidnapped locked up in wait for a much more sinister
plot to make them even more powerful. Of course, as narrative dictates,
Muriel's plan would have something to do with Hansel and Gretel's own
past, as well as their extraordinary ability to be immune from the
spells of witches.Savvy viewers will be able to spot the connection once the clues are
laid, so don't expect a revelatory surprise at the end. That doesn't
mean however that this reimagination is predictable; instead, Wirkola
keeps you riveted with a surprisingly effective blend of horror and
hilarity often within the very same scene. Case in point? Just before
she forces someone to turn a shotgun on himself and splatter his brains
onto the wall, Muriel comments how the room they are in looks somehow
drab and could do with some colour.That same irreverence pervades the entire movie, which shouldn't come
as a surprise if you paid attention to the opening credits and spotted
Will Ferrell and Adam McKay as producers of the movie. Their brand of
rude cheeky humour is very much alive in Wirkola's first
English-language feature, who had demonstrated through his debut movie
lampooning Quentin Tarantino  Kill Buljo  that he is perfectly in
tune with their sensibilities. But Wirkola also brings his eye for gore
 seen in his sophomore film 'Dead Snow'  to this movie, so be
prepared for exploding flesh, crushed skulls and some particularly
nasty decapitations that is good reason why this grown-up version of
Hansel and Gretel does not carry a kid-friendly rating.Amidst the gore and adult humour, Renner and Arterton unfortunately are
left with paper-thin characters. While Renner pretty much looks dour
throughout the movie, Arterton seems determined to have fun with her
ass-kicking female heroine of a role, and her portrayal of Gretel
resembles a Lara Croft for the medieval ages. The scene-stealer however
is Janssen, the former Bond villain once again relishing the
opportunity to play against type as the villain and putting in a
deliciously over- the-top performance as Muriel. Other supporting
actors don't make much of an impression  including Thomas Mann, a firm
Hansel and Gretel devotee who gets some laughs from his fanboy
behaviour and eventually sees his wish come true to be a witch hunter
like his heroes.And we suspect, how much you will end up enjoying this new twist to the
classic fairy tale will also depend on your expectations. Compared to
the recent spate of fairytale-inspired Hollywood movies like 'Red
Riding Hood' or 'Snow White and the Huntsman', it veers most far off
from its source material to tell an entirely different story. The
result of that novelty is something bloody all right, that can also
prove to be bloody good fun if you're looking for an adult-oriented
blend of action, adventure, fantasy, horror and comedy. It might not
sound intuitive, but this fairy tale is best enjoyed without the kids.- www.moviexclusive.com
