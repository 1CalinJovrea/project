Battleship is easily the best stupid movie I've seen since Armageddon -
it is infinitely better than every Transformers movie ever regurgitated
onto the screen (apart from the Cartoon Transformers one from the
80's).Battleship it is the romantic story of how a 26 year old former high
school jock John Carter, with no qualifications or experience, ends up
in charge of a giant battleship because Eric from True Blood is his
brother & he runs a battleship.High School Jock John Carter and has to destroy an alien invasion in
order to impress Naval Commander Liam Neeson so he can marry his really
hot daughter that wore that yellow bikini in Just Go With It - he does
this by letting Japanese people do everything for him. They use a grid showing the surrounding floating Tsunami alert devices
(because the aliens disabled the radar you see) to actually play the
game 'battleships' and blow up the aliens using complete guess work &
then they ask Old retired war veteran people to borrow their museum
battleship & help them blow up Hawaii after they broke all their own
battleships while playing battleships with the aliens earlier on - and
then at the end he takes the credit for it all, gets a medal & goes for
a Chicken Burrito with Liam Neeson. Despite the fact he knows nothing of the man, Liam Neeson agrees to let
him marry his really hot daughter as thanks for letting the Japanese &
the old people save the world while he stood around and watched.Rhianna is in it too - but don't let that stop you watching the movie
as she is like a hot version of Vasquez from Aliens - and to the movies
great credit, but also to my great disappointment, at no point does the
movie allude to the fact that Rhianna has breasts. Amazing Wonderous
Breasts. Also that freaky little guy from Ghostbusters II that plays the museum
director Dr Janosz ("The joyfulness is over!") plays the President of
the USA - what's not to like here?
