Lindelhoffed /'LinDelHôfd/Verb:1 a : Similar to a "Rick Roll", when one is conned into viewing a
series of moving pictures with no conclusive finale, despite the viewer
investing a lot of emotion and time in the story.b (1) : a bottom feeder (2) : to Lindelhoff, much like a cock tease,
when a sexual partner brings the other to the point of climax but then
bails just before reaching orgasm.PROMETHEUS Plot holes AND IRRITATIONS ***SPOILERS***1. The dreams sequence. David can watch Shaw's dreams. Amazingly this
technology also cuts from scene to scene like a movie camera...Please.
No one dreams like that.2. How did they randomly find the temple so quick? This is an entire
planet surface!3. Why was the landing so soft and easy?4. Why does Fifield start screaming at Shaw like that? Calm down
mate..jeez..And later on with an Alien cobra he is cool as ice.5. Why does that moron Buddy Holly scientist try and touch the cobra
alien? not once....not twice...but 3 TIMES!!!6. Why on earth would a scientist remove their helmets in a possibly
infected temple? I am just a civilian and even I understand the concept
of VIRUS CONTAMINATION ON AN ALIEN FRIGGIN PLANET. They then have the
cheek to talk about Shaw's strict quarantine fail-safe
procedures...please7. What does this Black Goo do exactly? Accelerate worm growth? Infect
crew members? Cause pregnancies? Create life? Pick one and stick to it
please8. Why does Ford straight away start giving the head electricity for
kicks? Do they not have procedures? What is this fun with Frankenstein?9. Why does the head explode?10. Why are the medical staff so damn careless with a possibly disease
ridden and bacteria infested decapitated head? I swear they didn't even
wear plastic gloves.11. How did Shaw know the Jockey was heading to Earth to destroy it?
Pretty big assumption from a couple of punches thrown.12. How does David know the Space Jockey is heading to kill Shaw on the
Medical Bay?13. How does Shaw know her baby will attack the Jockey?14. i was really amazed that Shaw has this 'baby' but fails to mention
the horrific and super extraordinary situation she had just been
through. ''oh hey guys, ha ha, nearly forgot. FYI, you won't believe
what just happened to me on the way here''....''i just gave birth to an
alien..'' ''yeah, i know CRAZY right, considering i had sex only 10
BLOODY HRS AGO!!''15. -The whole Vickers' Star Wars 'Father' line...16. -The 'bet' between the co-pilots was cringe-worthy17. HUGE ONEHow the hell does Shaw walk after abdominal surgery? If
abdominal muscle is cut you can NOT walk, the muscle needs to be sewn
backBut no, a few staples and she is good to go18. Why does the tentacle creature have tentacles from the evil Planet
X?19. Why do the space jockeys allow any old tramp to walk in an use
their security systems?20. Why does the space jockey want to kill, kill and killYou'd think
an advanced race would be a little civilised?21. What was the point of Guy Pearce as Weyland? Why was he even there?
So he just assumed this temple would contain a fountain of
life..right.I guess he 'chose to believe' toof**k meHonestly there are so many more I can't even write them allBut this
movie has more plot-holes than the Iraqi Navy
