Autistic reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.

"Vicki Maloney is randomly abducted from a suburban street by a
disturbed couple. As she observes the dynamic between her captors she
quickly realizes she must drive a wedge between them if she is to
survive." Let us start off by saying that the second this movie starts (slow
motion effects) it immediately lets you know you are in for a very
unsettling, uncomfortable and disturbing movie. The movie slowly
introduces us to each character bit by bit. The main focus is Vicki and
her horrible relationship with her Mother. But within the first 20 mins
the story wastes no time in getting really tense. The acting was absolutely brilliantly played by everyone involved. This
would not have been an easy role for Ashley Cummings to play Vicki, the
girl who went through and goes through hell. Stephen Curry does a great
job at playing the childish, yet ringleader of as John White. While he
may be skinny and not looking so tough...trust us...actions speak
louder than words. And while he maybe childish he is a leader and one
not to be messed with, especially if he loses his temper. Last but not
least...Emma Booth. She seriously gives an Oscar Worthy Performance
here. Her role is so powerful, and yet so terrifying and horrible and
disturbed that she is twice as bad as John (Stephen Curry). At times
you feel sorry for her then she does the unthinkable! I doubt it will
happen but Emma Booth truly deserved an Oscar for this role if the
movie gets more recognition, because it's her best role yet. A truly
terrifying villain. Newcomer Ben Young does excellent as this is his first feature Film,
and he is off to a magnificent start. While people may complain that
this is a student film and it's incredibly low budget...try to look
beyond that and see just how disturbing and terrifying and
uncomfortable this film will make you feel. Me and Nick (The Autistic
Reviewers) wouldn't recommend it to the faint of heart, because so many
people would be offended over a film like this. It's a great movie, but
only see it if you have a high pain tolerance. 5/5 stars.
