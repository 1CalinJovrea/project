Misleading trailer

I was hoping that someone was finally going to cater to those of us
with depraved senses of humor, I loved the trailer and wanted to see
this so bad that I went to the 10:30 showing on Thursday the 24th. The
first skit was moderately funny, but the rest, well... if you've seen
the trailers then you've seen the funniest parts already. No point
paying $8+ to see this thing.Fortunately for me, I work at a movie theater and didn't drop a dime on
it, making it that much easier to walk out on it. I had just seen the
Best of Rifftrax one showing earlier and I laughed more at it than I
did Movie 43. SNL is funnier and I hate SNL. When I got home I had to
put on something really funny to cleanse my palette of this Cleveland
steamer.I love the kind of humor contained in the trailer so I'm not one of
those people putting this movie down because it's extremely lowbrow. If
Haunted House is still showing and you have to choose between this and
it, choose Haunted House, this movie isn't worth what Anna Farris wants
her fianc√© to do.The movie should be considered a spoiler for the trailer instead of
vice versa.
