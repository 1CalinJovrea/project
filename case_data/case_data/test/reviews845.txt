Better than it had any right to be!

Even though I've been severely burned by M. Night Shyamalan's
commercial misfires (or rather miscarriages) like Lady in the Lake
(ugh!), Airbender (what the hell was he thinking?) and After Earth, I
decided to give him one more shot in the shape of The Visit. What
worked in his favor was his superb work on the small screen in the form
of the 2015 mini-series Wayward Pines - which made me believe that deep
down inside Shyamlan's heart still resides a true artist, and not some
lazy hack who tackles big-budget flops just to get paychecks from the
studio. His recent talk in interviews about gaining back artistic
control of his products was another positive step in Shyamalan's long
path to cinematic forgiveness.And so I entered The Visit, a somewhat short and intimate tale of two
precocious teenagers, a brother (13) and sister (15), who travel cross
country to meet and spend a week with their estranged grandparents,
whom they have not seen or met since birth due to a big family feud
their divorced mother (Kathryn Hahn, the most recognizable face in the
cast) refuses to talk about. The sister, Becca (the promising Olivia
DeJonge) also happens to be an aspiring filmmaker, out to make a
documentary about the big reconciliation, which ever so conveniently
sets the movie up in the popular found footage sub-horror genre - but
also opens a wide crack for endless jokes and self-aware nods towards
the unsuspecting audience.Anyway, as you could probably tell by the previews, something isn't
quite right with Poppa and Nanna, and even though at first they seem
like reasonably nice elder folks, their strict rules (do not get out of
the room after 21:30, do not go down to the basement) and strange
manners (you'll see what I'm talking about) soon enough make it clear
to both Becca and Tyler (the smaller brother portrayed by the superb Ed
Oxenbould, who at 14 shows endless promise) that they better get the
hell out of there - as fast as they could.Besides the trademark Shyamalan twist, which actually works here and
seems reasonable in hindsight (unlike, say, The Village), the extremely
self-aware script and the very natural and authentic brother-sister
relationship between both co-leads, lends further credence to
Shyamlan's pet project. You can see that he cared for the characters,
and you can also easily remember that this is a director who made a
reputation for himself because he managed to facilitate such an
emotional and iconic performance out of then-11-year-old Haley Joel
Osment, so obviously he's good with kids. I don't know if young Ed
Oxenbould is the next Osment, but he sure does deliver the goods
through and through - and gives one of the best children/teen
performances I've watched in a while.
