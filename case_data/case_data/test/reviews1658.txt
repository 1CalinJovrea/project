A work of art , a masterpiece

This is a unique movie and it is not just a movie. It is a whole new
experience ! simply amazing and breathtaking , I almost cried in many
parts just by thinking how much work and effort has been put in order
to make this film come true. A real masterpiece .A movie suitable for
all ages and all types of film lovers. When I came out of the cinema
the only word I could think about was "masterpiece" . I have nothing
bad to comment about this movie really. Nothing to complain. 10/10
