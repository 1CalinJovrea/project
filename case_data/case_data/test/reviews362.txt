Saw it, loved it, nuff said.

I was of course hoping that Dreamworks would have a hit here after the
unfortunate demise of Rise of the Guardians (I actually enjoyed the
first ROTG book but couldn't get through the second book) which killed
that franchise. I saw The Croods on opening day at a matin√©e and I
loved it. I laughed, I cried (yes, just a bit) and I had so much fun
that I didn't want it to end (Dun Dun Daaaaa). I've been reading the
early message boards and prior mixed buzz so I was a little worried
here and it's unfortunate that folks are so quick to try and tear
something down based on a trailer or someone else's opinion. Go see it
for yourself and have fun! I give this 10 big stars and can't wait to
add it to my collection. My only regret is that I went to the first
showing rather than wait for the 3D screening. I'm a little jealous by
some of the great 3D comments. Even in 2D, the animators create a
wonderful world, make us feel good and really get us excited to get out
and have an adventure.
