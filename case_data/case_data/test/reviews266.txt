One of the worst Marvel films ever

Just saw it. Not gonna go in depth but incoherent plot with lack of
motivations for a lot of the characters to even fight to begin with.
Didn't like the actor who played Spider-Man, his jokes were bad and
misplaced in the middle of action scenes. Spider-Man seemed like he was
added in at the last possible moment of production as he seemed out of
place. I mean Tony Stark shows up and just blindly follows Tony. Black
Panther was alright but oh boy does his mind change fast but like
Spider-Man, he was shoehorned in. Ant-Man dragged along to be beside
Captain America, he just blindly follows Cap.Too many jokes in the middle of action scenes. Winter Soldier almost
killed some of the Avengers but Captain Americas gay love for bucky
blinds him from him. Captain America being so stubborn and showing his
true colours as a terrible individual as he doesn't seem to care about
anyone's safety. I thought Cap was suppose to be a leader but really,
this movie only showed lack of leadership skills as he almost got
everyone killed.The highly praised airport fight was not impressive. I'm not sure what
people saw here. Zoomed-in action scenes, close up to the faces, lame
jokes in between, Black Widow asking if were friends to Hawkeye, camera
shaking. The heroes just scatter/disappear and end up on the raft?.Terrible pacing from one scene to the next. Captain America just having
a casual talk with Spider-Man while they are fighting and you can see
Evans laughing after he mentions that he's from Brooklyn ugh. So bad
and so cheesy. Cap holding the helicopter ugh so cheesy.They say bucky is brainwashed but in some scenes, he seems to have it
together but in other scenes, he don't. If he is brainwashed, why does
Zemo need to activate him when he says the code?. After Zemo says the
code, he almost killed some of the Avengers but later on, he fights
alongside them?. And now he has it together or what?. Is he brainwashed
or not, what's going on here?. Why is he back and forth on killing the
Avengers and then working beside them?. Ugh so awful.Chris Evans wooden acting. Lack of facial expressions for the intense
moments of the film. Captain Americas lame letter to Tony Stark.All these Marvel movies and they still can't make War Machine the true
badass he is like in the comics. The character has been under utilized
since Rhodes has put on the suit. They made him a laughing stock in
Iron Man 2. The character has very little screen time in every other
Marvel movie. Absolutely awful how they treated War Machine in this
movie and previous movies. Terence Howard should be happy that he's not
playing this character anymore. Disney/Marvel made him a joke.RDJ as Tony Stark/Iron Man is fantastic as always. No complaints here,
his motivation for killing Bucky makes sense here. Captain America
protecting bucky nope other then that they are friends from back in the
day.A lot of the faults people give to BvS which are warranted is also in
this movie Civil War. This is not even a Cap Movie, it's a Avenger
movie. It's a overcrowded mess with too much going and too many
shoe-horned characters and too many characters lacking any real
motivation for even fighting each other.I could go on about why I think this is the worst Marvel film to date.
I'm not sure what critics saw here. I rated it a 1 as a place holder
and reserved judgement until I saw it. I finally saw it. I'm leaving it
at a 1/10. An absolutely awful dreadful film that's only to please the
fanboys and children.
