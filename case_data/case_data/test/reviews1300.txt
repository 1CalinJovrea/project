Please don't watch the movie if you liked cars 1

In which movie does the main protagonist chickens out before the final
showdown (boss fight or the race in this case) and says to his trainer
that you have been training with me so you can go and win it for me.The whole point of the movie is that Mcqueen gets to decide when he
should retire and so he trains hard to beat the rookie and just before
the final race he turns to his trainer asks her to race in his place.F**kers i went to watch the movie expecting that it will be about a
comeback story of Mcqueen and not how he is forced to retire.
