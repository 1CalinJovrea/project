American Mary

American Mary is a sleek and sexy film that is unpredictable and fairly
unique. The story is dark, daring and entertaining, and solid
production gives it clean and smooth look. It's body modification theme
is edgy yet tasteful, and at times quite thought provoking. Katherine
Isobelle plays the lead brilliantly; cold and brutal, but at the same
time, empowering and elegant.As for Faults, well, American Mary is a great film, but it peaks
two-thirds of the way in, and by comparison it's ending feels a little
timid and noncommittal.Now, this is a bit over critical on my part, and it's only a minor
flaw, but one that stands out as there are so few in the film. It's the
cameo from the Soska sisters, I get it, I do, If I made a horror film,
I'd want to be in it too, but this just wasn't the parts for them.
Although I suspect they probably wrote it with themselves in mind. It's
only a short scene but one with so much potential. The Soska sisters
play big characters in a scene that could have been wonderfully
unsettling, but instead its a bit flat and clumsy. The girls just
didn't have the physical presence or screen confidence required to fill
out the roles.American Mary would have been excellent if it wasn't hindered by a few
minor flaws and a weak ending. Overall, a delicate, but by no means
tame, addition to the torture porn sub-genre. This film could easily
become a horror cult classic, and deservingly so. I will be interested
to see what the Soska sisters do next.
