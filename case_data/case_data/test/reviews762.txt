Just the ticket!!

I rented this movie to watch on my thirtieth birthday after I put the
kids to bed (I know, wild night). It was the perfect pick!! Loved the
chemistry between the characters and much of the flirty banter made me
laugh out loud!! It may be my favorite of this genre since the movie
One Fine Day. It's different- deeper, and oh so good! Super impressed
by the leads and think it's just the ticket for anyone looking for a
romance. It's one that I'd recommend to girlfriends for sure. I
actually can say I loved this movie. There were times I was so into it
that I had a giant frozen grin on my face and my husband looked over
and said "you're lovin this... It's right up your alley." If you're the
type that's turned on by true romantic connection, consider this your
emotional porn. It included interesting and meaningful notes without
seeming forced or contrived. Such a good one!
