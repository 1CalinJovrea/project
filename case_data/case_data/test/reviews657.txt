Great Animation, not so great story

Animation is spectacular, great setting in the Scottish Highlands.
Voice acting is above par. However, this movie is not among the top
Pixar films, by far. I felt the sickening presence of Disney all over
the film -- weird politically correct preaching, overdone action
scenes, and generally random and weird plot.The story is really disappointing. What exactly makes her 'BRAVE'??
They should have named the movie 'PETULANT'. She's selfish, and the
entire plot is about how she can get out of the results of her
selfishness while remaining selfish. The magic feels out of place, lots
of wasted scenes, and the whole bear thing was just plain annoying
after a while.Not a lot of funny moments, and generally boring! I was really looking
forward to this movie, and I did not like it.
