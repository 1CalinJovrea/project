avoid critics and enjoy

I luckily avoid reading opinions before seeing a movie. This movie was
a perfect entertainment for the less than 1h50 that it lasts. Although
I had enjoyed watching TNMT anime when I was adolescent, I've never
been a hardcore fan and it is true that I cannot spot any of the traits
that other purists criticized about. What I certainly know is that it
was a nice combination of Transformers/Batman/Martial-art material
based on a plot that seemed solid and justified. Megan-April was more Megan than April, but she is the right actress for
that sort of character. She is not the true red-hair girl I would
prefer to see, but she is not less successful than fake blonde J.Alba
in Fantastic4, or fake-redhead Scarlett J. in the Avengers. She has the
right age and overall stature for the role and she is always fun to
watch.The turtles were very versatile and realistic in all ways and I liked
that each one got an emphasized ability (or weakness!), differentiating
from the anime where all looked quite the same.The action sequences were mind-blowing, synchronized at the ultimate
speed the human eye can perceive them. Unlike transformers and other
movies where the action and fight are so messy, shaken and difficult to
follow that you wished to just skip forward to the outcome, in this
case it is absorbing, spectacular and humorous. Which is what all TNMT
productions are really about.The music, production design, voices and sound are exactly as they
should be to throw you into the screen.It might not be a 10, but in front of all those purists destroying
franchises, 10 is the least I could give to hope for at least 2
sequels. And I don't mind who ever purist out there may just avoid it.Don't miss it!
