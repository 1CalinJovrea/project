Not even attempting to be good

Somewhere in Hollywood there are people who think children are morons
and when they set up to make a kid movie, they do it starting with this
premise. Morons they may be, but not in the sense their brains don't
work well, but because they don't have enough experience. As such, this
kind of films appear to me made for retarded (in the real sense of the
word) people.As a sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth from 2008, it is not
that bad. The only character remaining, though, is Josh Hutcherson's,
so I was at first confused if this is the sequel to that film or to
Race to Witch Mountain, which stared Dwayne Johnson and some kids.
Also, all the characters are male but for a teen that has no real role
in the film. So I was really missing Anita Briem.The effects were not bad, rather average. The plot itself, taken from
afar and with the grain of salt that one has to take with a movie made
for children, had potential. I also liked how the characters completed
one another, instead of the lone hero knowing and doing everything.
However the script to this plot was so incredibly bad that I could not
like it, no matter how much I tried.Bottom line: a franchise dedicated to the sense of wonder and discovery
in Jules Verne's books should make more of an effort for actual
education. Dropping occasional (and conflicting) science facts that
don't even apply to the situation is not enough. Also, having silly to
the point of idiotic characters doesn't really inspire kids, either. I
grew up with the books of Jules Verne. This entire series has nothing
to do with them.
