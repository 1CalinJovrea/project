Must See(Again!)

Annie was a beautifully entertaining film about a fostered girl in
modern day America whose big dream is to one day meet her biological
parents. She faithfully awaits their return as she encounters one
cunningly opportunistic adult after another. The film's messages are so simple and cliché in the Western world as to
not worth arguing about(that's a good thing): The love of
family(biological and chosen) is more important than material gain.
Lonely people are still lonely at the top. Everybody needs love. Greed
leads to evil. It's a children's movie for Pete's sake!My toddler and middle-schooler-both boys-were hooked from start to
finish, but so were my husband and I! The music was catchy and upbeat.
Quvenzhane Wallis was a bright shining star and was such a joy to
watch. She really was a heart warmer and a convincingly hopeful foster
child. In fact, the entire cast was charming, including Carmen Diaz. Many of the ratings here were questionable until further reading. How
does a movie get so utterly slammed before it's even come out? Go home
boot leggers! Complaints about Quvenzhane Wallis not being the "real"
Annie abound. I've seen the word n**ger tossed about and believe those
bitter sentiments are the source of the majority of the negative
"audience" reviews. Critics missed the entire point of this film and
can safely be ignored.We live in an upscale part of Boca. It's predominantly white, as was
the viewing audience. I'd read the reviews prior to seeing the movie
and intentionally watched the audience to see their reactions. I mean,
if a movie is a 2-star overall, it should reflect that in a random
audience, right? People should be disappointed and bored! But no.
Adults and children alike, black, white, Hispanic, and some Asians,
were all tuned in and appeared joyfully entertained throughout. A group
home for teens with Down's Syndrome were seated in front of us. One of
the young men was so excited for Annie that he was standing up and
cheering for her along the way. We all were. A middle aged white mother
with her two blond haired daughters was seated next to my eldest son,
"This is so great, isn't it?", she asked enthusiastically at the
movie's halfway point. My son beamed and told her he loved it. Annie
received a sustained applause at the end and I knew it would. The
audience had fallen in love with her journey and with her. Annie is cheesy, simplistic, clichéd, redundant, auto-tuned, and almost
a full 2-hours long. It's also whimsical, joyfully entertaining,
heartwarming, packed with talented performances, groundbreaking in its
characterization of Annie as a little black girl, and supports messages
about family and love that are virtually inarguable. In other words,
it's an excellent holiday film!Ignore the ratings slam that the movie is receiving, many of of which
are from people who are quite obviously racist and others subtly so,
and see for yourself. Oh, and if you loved it, please rate it.
