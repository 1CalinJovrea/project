How much money did Mark Walberg owe the mob to be forced into this movie?

I never thought I would see the day when Mark Walberg appeared in a bad
movie. Of course the usual clueless eggheads and elitist wannabes had
to give it rave reviews because, in their minds, some jittery screen
effects made a boring, classless movie 'artsy.'The movie was boring, the dialog was inconsequential and dragged out,
and there was no plot or theme. The characters, including the main
character, were not developed at all and the romantic interest was
basically a one night stand that at the end of the movie was made out
to be Romeo and Juliet. By the end of the movie and the so called
"surprise twist' I couldn't care less about whether Walberg's character
won or lost, lived or died. The only redemption was the superb acting
by Walberg and Goodman, but they didn't come anywhere close to saving
this movie. It was simple boring and nonsensical. I'm glad that I saw
this on 12/31/14, because if I had seen it a day later, then it would
have ruined the New Year for me.Now I understand why people pirate movies. After getting their pockets
picked by movies like this, it is only right that they would look to
pick the pocket of Hollywood right back. Do yourself a favor and see
any other movie. Even Plan 9 from Outer Space would be better than this
dog.
