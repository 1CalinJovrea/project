Oh god...

Being honest is one of the biggest crap I've seen in the last 5 years,
but first I'll talk about the only good thing the movie had.This "thing" has very good music, either in the Bratt scenes or in the
absolute stuffing (but I'll talk about that), I really mean the style
of the 80s and the atmosphere that creates the movie related to this is
pretty well done, Now, to burn this "thing".The first thing is that the film is not funny, many say the first 2
movies are very funny and if it is true but this third installment has
2 factors when applying your mood.1-Eschatological humor (For example: Of gases) 2-Highlighting all the
bad and evil that come to GruAlmost all the scenes of the film seem that they are an excuse to make
Gru like miserable person.This movie has no conflict, at first sounds quite original with the
part of the TV series "EvilBratt" but then we get that Gru has a twin
brother who is forced to give some support to the movie, That Dru
discovers this secret, I wonder.How did you find out? At no time in the first 2 films are we shown to a
close family member, not even to his mother, who knows of the existence
of Dru.How is this possible? Thanks to THE ARGUMENTAL HOLES OF A MEDIOCRE
WRITER, YAYYYY!And here are other things in which the movie fails miserably.-Is very boring -Repetitive -One of the worst villains in the trilogy
-The performances of the voices of the characters STINKS, well, it is
more I spell it to you S-T-I-N-K-S!The only thing that is saved is the animation that has a large color
palette and looks nice and bright but in the rest, it is very meh.Conclusion: A TRASH without remedy :)
