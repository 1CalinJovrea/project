Surprisingly Bad

I intend to write reviews of movies where my opinion goes against the
majority opinion. Unfortunately I usually see movies either in 2nd run
theaters or on TV, which is okay if the movies are over a year old or
classic films, but is generally too late to matter when it is new
movies. But I'm putting my two cents in on this film.This flick received generally good reviews from both the public, and
critics. I'm not sure I was watching the same movie as everyone else.
First, the hand-held camera gambit was annoying. I know that the
thought was for it to add an artistic element, but it was just plain
perturbing. It reminded me of my father taking home movies back in the
day. A lot of the "action" scenes were just fast-moving, indiscernible
images, as though the camera were being flipped and spun around like a
football. If not for the audio I would not have had a clue as to what
was going on. Also, everything was too dark, meaning that there was a
need for more daylight scenes. And it looked like scenes were spliced
together ad hoc. Maybe that was part of the alleged "artistry" attempt
in the movie.Some of the scenes of the evil Mexican gang were almost funny in their
absurdity. There was one scene where the Mexican outlaws were riding in
a van and shouting angry, obscenity-laced threats at each other in a
thick Hispanic accent. I leaned over and asked my co-viewer sitting
next to me what they were yelling about and she shrugged her shoulders
and then whispered to me that she thought they were debating the
scientific possibilities of inter-galactic travel. It was the high
point of the movie.I'm not sure how anyone could care about the two main characters. Any
attempt they made to show some personal depth and heartfelt emotion
came off as either false, or aggravatingly macho. Just not good. When
everyone, good guys and bad guys alike, were apparently killed in one
scene near the end, I felt a relief that the bewildering and/or poorly
drawn characters were gone and I would soon be in my car going home.I have seen a lot of movies in my day and this one may not be the
worst, but it is probably in the bottom 20%.
