Reminds you why there are rules of story telling that you should not break

I considered myself a fan of the Hunger Games films prior to watching
the films, despite Mockingjay part 1 being a fairly obvious cash in. As
a movie divided in two, I never expected a satisfying conclusion from
that film, but I don't feel I got one from this film either.I'm going to spoil everything for my review, so don't read on if you
haven't seen.There is a pretty crucial rule in story telling where your heroine must
be relevant to the plot's conclusion. In this movie, Katnis isn't even
conscious for the tedious finale to the rebellion - which was what
Mockingjay was all about.Supreme leader Snow is defeated rather easily by the rebellion. I guess
the rebels must have made lots of progress in the war effort while we
were following Katnis around the city, but we never saw any of that so
it just seemed a bit random. Katnis' plan to defeat Snow, was literally just to walk in to his
house, which was foiled by the fact he had guards at the gate. They
didn't factor that in to their plan? Seriously? Katnis is then knocked
out by a bomb and wakes up to find the war is over, making her
irrelevant to the conclusion of this plot.Afterwards, another sub plot suddenly takes primary focus. Katnis'
unease with the leader of the rebellion becomes far stronger after she
takes the word of the series' primary antagonist and decides to murder
the leader of the rebellion. The movie doesn't really present a
watertight case for the rebellion leader's guilt over the bombings.
Were the bombs definitely hers? Did she mean to murder civilians? Are
we morally free to kill President Obama since the US forces blew up a
hospital a few months ago? Her idea for a 'symbolic' Hunger Games seems
to be the point where her guilt crystallises in Katnis' mind, but then
Katnis votes for it, so it appears she would rather murder people for
their insane ideas rather than try to talk them down when given the
chance.Another disappointing aspect to the finale is Katnis' reaction to the
death of her sister, which is significantly delayed. You do see a quite
visceral reaction in the last few scenes of the film, but why did I
have to wait around ten minutes for that as Katnis just went about her
daily life meeting dictators and murdering heads of state? The
franchise begins with Katnis sacrificing herself to save her sister in
the first movie: you would have thought that the death of that sister
would have had a more immediate reaction, given it was the character's
primary motivation for all her actions in film one. It kind of felt
like it was just put on the back burner for a couple of scenes.Prior to the conclusion the film felt badly paced and meandering, but I
overlooked that due to profit based decision to split the film into two
at the expense of the story. I guess I'll have to look back on the Hunger Games franchise as a movie
with one sequel, as I really would prefer not to remember this
conclusion, as it has not done the first two movies justice.
