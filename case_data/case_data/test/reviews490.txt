A Bit Outdated But  MiB3 Is Still Fun

Well, whaddaya know, the "MiB" have gone MiA for 10 years already! No
wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and
Bodysuits (aka The Avengers, Batman, Spider-Man, et al) have been
hogging the cinemas while the "Men In Black" go missing-in-action. No
matter, they are still a barrel of fun in this three-quel that comes as
more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.And with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed
US$215-million production, it is a nostalgic film in more ways than
one.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of
the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on
Earth. The 'odd-couple' have their work cut out for them when
extra-terrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement)
escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back
in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K's existence, it's up to him
to venture through time, look for a young K (now played by Josh Brolin)
and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.I have never been a fan of time-travel plots and I still don't like
them. However, the time-travel subplot here is just to provide the
"Back To The Future" fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative, as
well as the mood and tone of the movie, are light-hearted, fun and
always on the outer limits of credibility. Again, it is nice to see how
a deadpan face like Jones' can generate so much mirth. The Smith &
Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of
how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied
by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.One of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that
suggest alien origins. In MiB3, we have a 'twist' that suggests a
certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still, the
mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker's creature designs and make-up
rendered in 3D. The 'monster show' does not disappoint, especially that
of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes,
there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant
wheel hoover-bikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole, Agents J and K
still provide the 'L'. - limchangmoh.blogspot.com
