An Adorable New High School Comedy in the Vein of Mean Girls and She's All That!!

I really enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. Probably
the best high school comedy since 'Mean Girls' Bianca Piper is best
friends with two popular girls, but she's invisible to the popular
crew. At a party, her neighbor, Wes informs her that she is a DUFF
(Designated Ugly Fat Friend) Wes is a popular jock and dating the
hottest most popular girl in school, Madison. Bianca and Wes make a
deal; if she helps him with his science grades, he'll help her become
more cool, confident, and popular. The road to popularity is not as
easy as it seems when an embarrassing video of Bianca goes viral at
school and Madison sets out to tear her down. Will Bianca meet the boy
of her dreams and overcome her label as a DUFF? If you love adorable
high school chick flicks, I'm sure you'll love THE DUFF!!!
