Surprisingly Solid movie with a good message

This movie comes at the perfect time with the craze of Pokemon Go; a
time when you literally see millions of people obsessed with an app -
where you can find videos of hordes of people in NYC all running after
a particular Pokemon.This is essentially the premise of the movie: a new app (game) comes
out that takes teens in a particular city by storm, except the
consequences can be much graver.As to not give anything away, I try to be brief:The acting was great; the pacing was great, the color pallet and tone
of the movie were all top notch. That being said, the plot - as it developed - felt "obvious", I wasn't
surprised by anything and I wasn't ever emotionally "moved." The movie
knows what it is, and it does it pretty well - it's a teen thriller. What the movie explores is far more important: the way people interact
with each other when they are hidden behind a wall of anonymity. The
movie has a good message. The BOTTOM LINE: I rate movies on whether it is worth spending the $$$
to see at a theater, in my opinion this one is worth seeing at a
matin√©e showing ($5), but probably not dolling out $12 - $15. I hope
that helps.
