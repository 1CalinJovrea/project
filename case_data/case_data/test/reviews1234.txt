"I may not be the hero of this story, but at least I can see how it ends"

JACK the GIANT SLAYER is a nice flight of the imagination, exercise in
fairly mindless (though not stupid)entertainment. The film has a
Disney-like flavor, and though it makes only a half-hearted attempt to
convey the medieval setting, the cinematography is very fine. Good
performances by Hoult, Tomlinson, and McGregor.The story may be missing a piece or two, and the modern day ending is a
bit tacked-on. There's an interesting mythos here, but its
underdevelopment is a little dissatisfying. Nevertheless, it's clear
from the beginning that this is not a film to take too seriously:
Simply fun to watch for children of all ages.
