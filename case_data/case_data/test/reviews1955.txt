Good versus evil .... without the 'good' = awful!

Saw the great ratings and then was on the verge of bailing for the
first time in years. So the first 'intelligent' robot hangs with dope
dealing, violent thugs, wears gold chains, swaggers and finally when
Chappie tells them he can not commit a crime they easily convince him
that by not using his gun he can stop cars, toss the drivers a hundred
feed in the air (which might kill them) and take their cars... all the
while Chappies can not figure out, with all his 'intelligence' that he
has become a major felon like the rest of the gang. Before this mess is
over Chappie never saves even one innocent civilian but does manage to
draw blood from an innocent armored car driver as he commits yet
another major felony.On the sci-fi part of the equation... we know Chappie's creator has
invented a program that allows for the first 'thinking' robot.
Suddenly, out of no where we're seeing the ability to transfer human's
conscience to a robot. No explanation about how or way that is suddenly
possible.The IMDb description of the film is nonsensical. Chappie, is hunted
when he is seen committing crime and not because he is trying to save
humanity. The stars of this film and role model for Chappie are on the
verge, several times, of executing Chappies creator. They are low life
armed and dangerous dope dealing thugs.Chappies amazing 'intelligence' finds him mindlessly following whomever
is the latest person talking to him. Reasoning, morality, free will are
out the window. Tell Chappie evil is good and he'll run with it. Finally a gizmo, the size of a flash drive can put the city at peril.
Yet, it seems easy as pie for employees to snatch it and do very dirty
deeds. There is way more security on your local bank's safety deposit
box. Nonsensical script and a cute named but felony loving, law
breaking, dangerous robot. Yes, I was rooting.... for it to END!
