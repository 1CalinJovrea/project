Not the worst movie ever, but certainly one of the most easily forgettable

Loosely based on a "real" story, the plot is about Margaret, a divorced
mother and the painter of kitsch big-eyed children, reproduced on
countless every-day items that infested the markets some decades ago.
For many years Margaret allowed her second husband, Walter Keane, to
claim authorship for her work, while she churned out one canvas after
the other and lied to everybody.I am not a Burton's fan and I watched this at home, because it did not
seem worth of a cinema outing. I also find those kiddies'paintings very
kitsch and did not care much about the author, therefore my
expectations were low. Turns out, not low enough.Amy Adams is a good actress, but even she cannot make a sympathetic
character out of a woman who - allegedly - lied to her own daughter for
years and secretly painted hundreds of canvas of creepy kids to please
her hubby. How did she do that? Apparently Margaret's studio was a
locked room and her daughter did not found that weirdÂ….Christoph Waltz is unfortunately in full sociopath-Hans Landa mood,
therefore unbearable. I never liked him much and I positively detested
this interpretation. The courtroom scene is hard to bear. It was not
Johnny Depp playing weirdo yet again in a Burton movie, but that did
not improve the plot.I am not sure what would constitute a spoiler for this, since the plot
is so bad and the movie irrelevant. However, I will not disclose the
"surprise ending", even if you can find out what happened with a simple
search.
