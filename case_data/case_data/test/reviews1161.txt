Complete and thorough Hollywood disconnection of reality

I was a crewchief assigned to the Group that lifted the SEALS to
Abbatobad. I will not make claims I am associated with the mission,
because I wasn't. Nonetheless, this movie disappointed me to the point
I fell asleep at the 1 hour mark. Without going into a rant, I would
hope everyone understands the actual events. "Maya" didn't sacrifice
anything; she did find UBL, but was well compensated financially the
entire time she was looking. The basis of this movie is her work
finding UBL, which makes my stomach turn. It's so easy to sit behind a
keyboard and act like you are changing the world. Her line in the movie
to "kill Bin Laden for me" will resonate until my death. I can promise
you, UBL wasn't killed for Maya and it is pretty obvious that once he
was found, the true heroes were summoned. Her remarks in the movie
about "you guys showing up with your facial hair and dip" is so
disullionist, it should be edited. She is a coward and her
glorification in this movie sickens me.
