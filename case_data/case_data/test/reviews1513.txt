Complete letdown

Originally I was quite hyped and interested in this movie, though once
I viewed it in the cinemas I was completely let down. To be honest i
lost interest in the movie after maybe 20 minutes, the only thing
stopping me from heading out the cinema doors was that my sisters
boyfriend was with me.Clich√©, generic and predictable plot, that is if you even consider that
this even has a plot. Complete lack of pacing for character
development, i'd argue that character development was just slapped on
for the hell of it. The only thing masking the awfulness of this movie
was its "action" - which it of itself is done by, if not better by most
films released nowadays anyways. In summary this is yet another mindless "action packed" Hollywood
release designed to trick consumers by masking its non existent plot
behind explosions and millions of dollars of CGI.
