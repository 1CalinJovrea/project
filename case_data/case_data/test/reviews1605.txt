Loved It!

We are often told by others what should and shouldn't be important to
us, especially when we are young. As a juvenile, Frank's sister, Diane
was strictly prohibited from making her own choices based on her own
values. This strict and controlling upbringing lead her to a life of
anger and misery. Prior to taking her own life, Diane charged her
brother with the task of raising Mary differently than that. She wanted
Mary to get to be a kid and learn what life is really about. 'Gifted'
is a story is about Frank's fight for what he values, what his sister
valued, and most importantly, what a little girl named Mary values more
than anything in the world.
