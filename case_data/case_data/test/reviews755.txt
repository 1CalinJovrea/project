After all this time of waiting we finally know what it's like...mostly fine.

After four or five years of countless problems in pre and post
production, trying so desperately to get released this movie finally
does...in one of the saddest ways that is pretty unbecoming of
something that fought so hard for so long, by throwing it out digitally
for free, plus with a severely limited theatrical release later
on....wow. The story is about a teenage girl named Belle (played by Bella Thorne)
and her family that move into the Amityville house. Her family consists
of her mom (Jennifer Jason Leigh), her little sister (Mckenna Grace)
and her twin brother who is in a coma for two years (Cameron Monaghan).
From there, freaky things start to occur around the house to the point
where Belle isn't sure what is real anymore. Within a short amount of
time of moving into the house with a terrifying past, it appears that
her comatose brother's state begins to improve; however the tensions
between Belle and her mother increase, making us wonder where the real
threat lies in the family. Her possibly possessed brother or the mother
that refuses to let anything stop her from making the family whole
again.Anyways, after all of this time of waiting and wondering what could be
so wrong about this movie to warrant such a long hold on this
production and I am still not entirely sure what the problem was. It's
mostly fine. There are some problems with it for sure; particularly
some scenes that are fairly obvious re- shoots/additional content
filmed and edited in at a later date from initial production; because
there are characters that practically have nothing to do with the plot
aside from providing needless exposition about things we already know
and also declaring that the "Amityville Horror" film franchise exists
as movies in this movie's universe...that's perplexing to say the
least. I mean, why? That's just confusing and also is something that
kind of makes the lead character look dumb for not knowing about the
Amityville house since the movies exist in her reality. I am curious as
to what these 're- shoot' scenes had replaced, because I feel like
there was probably some more material that delved into the relationship
between the family or maybe the medical investigation going on with the
brother, but was unfortunately cut and replaced with some pointless
characters and uninteresting dialog.Also there are some disturbing themes that the movie very briefly
introduces, but does not flesh them out or resolve them in much of a
satisfying way. Plus there is a sequence about halfway into this movie
that feels out of place or cut incorrectly because a certain 'scare'
occurs in this movie that involves the youngest sister, but then is
completely dropped and forgotten literally in the next shot. It was
jarring. There is editing like that which pops up here and there, but
is never too terrible to enrage or confuse too drastically.Aside from the gripes I've listed, I will say that this movie is still
mostly fine. It has a decent enough story with decent enough
characters. There's nothing groundbreaking in terms of its writing, but
it works enough to carry itself along in its very short run time. The
actors all do well in their roles, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh who
has to play this mother at her wits end in her attempts to bring her
son out of his vegetative state and will do anything to make that
happen. There are times where she feels legitimately intimidating
without playing it over-the-top. The majority of the scares work pretty
well, particularly since this movie focuses more on character and plot
and less on jump scares, even though there are some that happen from
time to time. Luckily the jump scares that do happen aren't many, nor
all that badly handled. In my opinion, this is an okay movie; it has enough character
development, story, scares and atmosphere to hold itself up. I feel
that it has had a lot of fluctuation over the years in its quality and
it may have been better if it hadn't gone through all those years of
post-production hell. Comparing it to other films that have gone
through similar experiences though, I will say it is probably one of
the better examples of its kind. So if you give this movie a shot then
you'll most likely watch it and be fine with going about the rest of
your day. It won't stick in your mind as anything great, but a
serviceable flick. Sometimes that's all you need from a little horror
movie around Halloween time.
