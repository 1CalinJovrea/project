Ahh.....

For this one, I will not need many words to write a review. This one is
plainly stupid. Unnatural human behavior, unnatural dialogues, plot
filled with holes like a good Dutch cheese! Just one example: Director
controls shutting of doors in an underground technical tunnels of the
distant city, yet he needs to infiltrate a city with a person to talk
one of the leaders into pushing a button to get a gas flowing into the
city! Would be a good idea to have that function also on a remote
control, wouldn't it? Or if everyone will forget everything, why not
fly a freaking squadron into the city and have this button pushed? A
separate word of praise to movie industry censors! Killing where blood
is seen  R rated and kids can't watch it. Killing when no blood is
seen  kids are safe to watch. How could one make it all be more
ridiculous? The guys gets a headshot from 1 inch distance, falls dead,
but no drop of blood to be seen anywhere Come on guys, someone needs
to get real.
