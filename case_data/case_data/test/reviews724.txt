Urrrrgh.

Wow, I just cannot believe all the accolades this movie is getting. The
only reason why it must be getting all these awards is that is is a
movie about Hollywood, and Hollywood loves itself very much. The acting
is vapid, the dancing mediocre, the songs forgettable, the singing
abysmal. Everyone sounds like a bad choir audition-- weak, breathy,
without focus or "ring". No legit Broadway-style singing technique. I
cannot imagine what real Broadway singers and dancers must be thinking
about this travesty.I think it must be an exercise in navel-gazing, as the awards bodies
see themselves in these two characters. Haven't they all struggled to
get auditions? Haven't they all had screen tests? Haven't they all
tried to "make it" in Hollywood? of course they have. The awards givers
like looking at themselves in the mirror. Personally I do not like what
they see. Don't bother wasting your energy, or you will quit halfway
through, as I did. 0 out of 10.
