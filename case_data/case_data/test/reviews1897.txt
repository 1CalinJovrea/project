Decent enough to be entertaining

The Spoiler tag is there just for some details that in my opinion don't
give away the plot nor damage a first time watch if you read this
review. This movie is a straight to DVD/BR but don't let that fool you because
thanks to the team behind it, it doesn't look cheap nor rushed, in fact
the balanced usage of the money at hand is one of this movie's
highlights (It relies heavily on practical effects and the little CGI
used looks pretty good).Story-wise, it's a mixed bag as what initially proved to be the saving
grace turns into the bag of stones that drag it to the bottom towards
the end: the movie takes place after the initial trilogy and right
before the awful Bride and Seed so it's enjoyable to try and guess how
it ties to the first three movies (even if it's a long shot, it's still
plausible) right until the end when (for the love of God i wonder why)
they can't help themselves and link it to the rest of the sequels.
Apart from this inconvenience it's still a decent sequel, closer to the
original in mood, kills and overall atmosphere. Gore-hounds will be
disappointed, even the Unrated version is mild in comparison to other
titles (even compared to the sequels) but like i said, the movie is
closer to "Child's Play" not to "X of Chucky". The movie looks good and
there are a few instances of very smart usage of camera angles and
lightning that put this one above the usual "straight to DVD"
offerings. Unfortunately even if as a whole the movie stays away from
over-used slasher film shenanigans there are a few inconsistencies that
might pull you out of the movie making you wonder "why the hell did you
had to use that when you kept it anchored in reality so far?" Acting-wise Fiona Dourif is great and has a very likable screen
presence making her character believable all the way till the end and
the few scenes Brad Dourif appears in are played in tune with the
Charles Lee Ray we know from the original. The rest of the cast, while
not bad, are just decently played cannon fodder bordering on
stereotypical characters.As a conclusion, while the intention is applaudable, honestly i think
it's a shame that they tried to satisfy both the older and the new
fans. Fans of the original "Child's Play" trilogy will like this one
right up until the end when they'll realize it actually links to the
dreaded campy sequels and fans of the "of Chucky" sequels will find it
dragging, boring, lacking gore, anticlimactic and i don't think the
ending segment that ties it to the newer movies will be enough for
them.Still, and enjoyable watch and a good effort considering how much it
feels like the older movies.PS: there is a scene after the credits so make sure you don't miss it.
The good part? it's well executed and it's hilarious. The bad part? it
kind of negates the ending prior to the credits.
