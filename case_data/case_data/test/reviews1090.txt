Silly nightmare made out of boys' dreams

Zombie gimmick has become so redundant in recent time, even the mockery
of it created another actual subgenre as it has spawned many clones
this year alone. Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is as juvenile
as it sounds, some of the jokes are either downright bizarre or
blatantly aggressive. Still, its simple theme and full commitment to
awkward crudity are surprisingly effective on creating a few laughs.Story is incredibly straightforward, it's basically written in the
title. Three scouts find themselves in a zombie outbreak, and with the
help of a hot chick they form some silly version of A-Team. Characters
are not original. Maybe the main lead is pretty likable, but most of
the characters are absolutely simple minded and comical or
stereotypically comical. Its use of friendship tone is decent, it may
be the only working drama angle here.The entire movie is satire made out of clich√© and some freaky stuffs
way outside the box. Don't bother with logic or continuity, since they
are admittedly flawed, at some points the plot seems shaky at best. As
for the jokes, they are simply brash. This is definitely a visual
clobbering as well as a jab at genre's silliness. Those wanting
maturity or deep psychological study will find themselves lost.It's similar to humor from gag website or forum comment threads,
coupled with mandatory bloody gore and obtuse use of breasts and
buttocks for viewer's pleasure. Normally this kind of overwhelming
sensory overload can be appalling, yet the movie is unapologetically
bizarre that the comedy works more than it falters.This is a juvenile showing in purest form, using primitive jokes,
nudity and even random singing. It should not be this entertaining, yet
surprisingly it is.
