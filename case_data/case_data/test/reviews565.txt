The next horror cult classic

Honestly Universal should be paying me for the amount of hype i've
created for this film among my friends and their friends. I was without
a doubt super excited for Krampus for two reasons. Firstly it's a
horror film that isn't from Blumhouse, honestly with every horror film
these days being "from the producers of Paranormal activity, Insidious
and The Purge" I was starting to think Jason Blum made a pact with the
devil to produce all mainstream horror films. Secondly this was the
kind of film I hadn't seen in ages, something along the lines of
Gremlins but more horror focused was what I've been wanting for a long
time. So after seeing Krampus I was not disappointed at all. Was it a
horror masterpiece on par with The Exorcist? No it wasn't but thats not
at all what I wanted. I wanted a fun imaginative horror film and one
that finally does justice to the long overlooked legend of Krampus. The
idea of a Christmas horror film is nothing new but all the well known
ones (Black Christmas, Silent Night Deadly Night) are always slasher
films with human villains when Christmas had it's own traditional
villain with Krampus why has it taken so long to bring him to the big
screen?But anyway Krampus is unlike any film i've really seen before it's both
lighthearted and funny but also surprisingly horrifying. I mean it when
I say there's some nightmare fuel in this film even if i didn't find it
that scary It is still in my opinion a legitimate horror. The Visit
proved to me that horror and comedy can mix well. When a horror film is
100% serious thats OK as long as it's warranted. When a horror film
takes itself too seriously though it can make it a boring watch. A
great comparison is A Nightmare On Elm Street from 1984 and it's remake
in 2010 the remake was largely panned because it was too serious while
dealing with some ridiculous subject matter whereas the original made
it into some morbid humour which worked much better. Krampus does the
same although it is obviously more of a comedy than Elm Street. Krampus himself looks fantastic being made entirely of practical
effects and carries a great presence in may opinion he is a classic
horror villain in the making. Of course he isn't alone and is
accompanied by demonic toys and wicked elves who's sadistic and playful
nature makes for some truly horrifying visuals. Oddly enough though
this is still a Christmas movie and does manage to bring me those warm
holiday feelings. I think this film in it's own right will hold a
special place in my heart as a holiday movie with a wickedly twisted
side that I just loved so much. In conclusion Krampus won't win Oscars but I think if you go in wanting
to have fun and experience some scares along the way you'll be more
than satisfied. Krampus is one hell of a Christmas gift.
