really liked this film

Good plot - took you to Congo, Spain and London. Something to think
about what may or does go in Africa with the corruption of their
natural resources.Well thought out, no silly stupid explosions, villains held their guns
right and for a change there were no Chuck Norris's or Bruce Lee's in
the fighting.And that is the biggest gripe of mine when it comes to action film -
most films are too far fetched. Need more films like this and such as
the 'Heat ' Leon'. Why cant they make real films anymore? The only bit
that spoil it for me was an illness - didn't need it in the script
