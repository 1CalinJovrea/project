Pointless tale that doesn't add up

This is two hours of my life i wont get back. Why a bunch of Australian
actors (speaking in US accents) in an Australian funded movie would
shoot a story based in New York is totally beyond me. The location is
irrelevant and almost takes away from the story. The central plot about
the letters is so labored as to be groan worthy. I kept waiting for
some twist in the story - i am still waiting. This is a hackneyed plot
that draws from so many other movies is like playing "spot the
influence". (A Beautiful Mind plus many others). To top it off it the
plot doesn't even make sense. Why, at the climax how does the guy run
away from the police who appear to stop chasing him?? And they only
fire one shot?? Plate glass windows into Grand Central station? Why
does the bad guy do what he does without any warning? Avoid.
