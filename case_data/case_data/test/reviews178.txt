A movie void of any emotion

I do not understand the reviews... What the heck? This movie was maybe
not worth 1 star, I agree, because I enjoyed the brutality to some
extent. But it falls very short of being the sort of masterpiece it is
made out to be. I chose to rate it 5.First of all, I am not a fan of Wolverine but I've always admitted that
Hugh Jackman was made for this role. And his role in pretty much every
X-men movie so far was outstanding. He is the Wolverine.In this movie however, he bored me out of my soul. Even in the brutal
scenes he played in, I was not convinced. I understand he is weak and
old, and ravaged by Adamantium. But even so, it was not him. He kept
whining and suffering and yet I felt nothing. I felt like a narrator
who remains as distant as his character as he can. It was cold
acting--I do not like cheesy actors either but he clearly left me
unaffected. Too bad for a movie that relies on emotion to try and stand
out.Now on to the girl. I felt no emotion whatsoever for her either. There
was no emotional build-up or any anchorage point I could tie my heart
with. She was a dull character. The way she growled and made faces was
overdone and... ridiculous. Her role was blurry. She begins as a beast
bent on savagery and blood. And a few days later she calls Wolverine
"dad"? And she actually has friends waiting for her? Let me have a
laugh, I almost fell out of my chair. Several other people summarized
her role in action parts; she goes on a killing spree for the first
heated scene but at the end of the movie she cannot handle a small
troop with her mutant friends--who make the cut by boasting their
powers against a man already down and apprehended while she and Wolvie
eat dust. ??? Charles-Xavier's lines were bland but at times I was
almost convinced. If it wasn't for the unlikable character that the
little beast is I'm sure his words would have affected me more. His
death was not even moving--and God knows how much I love Charles
Xavier.The black family was forgettable. Nothing with them engaged my
attention. Except the fact they served as a redemption for a Wolverine
that had given up on standing for what it is to be an x-men. And even
so he failed. Because of a plot twist character who was there for the
sake of adding more Jackman for fan service.But most of all... What happened? For the whole movie I craved some
flashbacks, some relevant explanation for Caliban, Xavier, the
disappearance of the other X-men, for Wolvie degrading so much, for his
copy's reason to exist--why not copy much more powerful mutants that
must have been out there. My head was dizzy with lack of information
and all it got was a few sentences.I am honestly quite the easy-going guy. I was not full of expectations
prior to the movie. I actually expected the movie to be bad so that I
could be less critical or hyped up. I wanted to avoid being
disappointed. And while the beginning looked promising, it just went
downhill when I felt my questions were poorly resolved, or when the
girl's incoherent role showed more and more.Perhaps the unmemorable soundtrack played its part, perhaps the
questions I kept asking myself and the writing inconsistency spoiled my
appreciation of the movie. But so it happened and whereas I know the
movie tried hard to be emotional and do Wolverine justice, it actually
did the opposite.In a movie in which all I can remember are screams and growls and
bloodshed a la Tarantino, Hugh Jackman's last role as the Wolverine is
forgettable and painful.
