Peter Jackson: The New George Lucas.

We all remember how George Lucas created an amazing trilogy called
"Star Wars," then went back later to do a prequel trilogy and tried to
destroy the franchise by focusing on ridiculous visual effects and
neglecting the story entirely; so too has Peter Jackson fallen.The five points I have given are purely for the visual aspect of the
movie. It is amazing. But we all expected that.0/5 for story. Tolkien wrote an amazing little (LITTLE) book called the
Hobbit. Jackson could have fit the important and relevant parts of "An
Unexpected Journey" into about an hour. It is the same here. There is a
ridiculous amount of filler, needless side-plots, and a stupid (for
lack of a better word) love triangle that makes a Ryan Reynolds
romantic comedy seem deep. And I mean OK, I expect filler if you're
going to turn a tiny book into three three hour movies, but at least
keep what happens in the book if you're going to make stuff up. A few
times scenes that were actually written by Tolkien feel rushed and cut
short, while filler scenes seem to drag endlessly.Smaug had the potential to be great, and started out that way, but the
gross on screen overuse of his character makes you think of a brainless
rat running through a maze searching for cheese rather than the
majestic dragon we all grew up reading about.I could keep on listing things I did not like (like bringing Legolas
into the film to draw fans, and then overusing every cool thing he ever
did in LOTR until you're sitting in your seat begging him to stop {ex,
he surfs on EVERTYTHING}) but I am going to stop.Go see the movie on principle, but don't go looking for the nostalgia
of LOTR like I did. Because even though it should be there, any chance
these films had of greatness was lost in the desperate attempt to turn
what should have been one great film into a three year money making
machine.
