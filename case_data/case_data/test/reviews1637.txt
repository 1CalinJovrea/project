$50M special effects budget, $10 screenplay budget

The 3D special effects for this movie were fantastic. The screenplay
was so bad that it became a comedy, probably better than some comedies
I have seen recently. Literally the audience was laughing out loud. All
of the trite lines were there. But more disturbing was the not so
cloaked attempt by Hollywood to get their message across:1. The Democratic President is a hero. 2. HIs Secretary of State, a USA
isolationist who wants to destroy American's enemies before they
destroy us, is the bad guy. At least Ed Harris didn't try to look like
Trump. 3. A self-driving car was the escape vehicle. 4. Global climate
change is real and so bad (2019) that it could destroy the world. 5.
The strong blond sexy female Secret Service agent could (and does) out
do any man. Don't mess with her, she will shoot you dead. 6. Males need
to bond more. They need to be soft and caring and their early boyhood
competitiveness can destroy sibling relationships.. 7. An Iranian (by
the flag on his uniform) is one of the villains, but in the end the
Arabs of Dubai are saved. 8. A Mexican is the one who ultimately saves
the overly masculine protagonist and the strong German female partner
(Ach Du Lieber). The Mexican savior literally points to the flag on
this sleeve at the end of the movie. 9. A precious precocious little
girl looks forward to saving the future of the planet.Not that I disagree with any of these principles necessarily but
goodness. I haven't seen a propaganda movie like this in a LONG time.
Based on the trailers, it obviously is supposed to appeal to males...
so get them in the seats and let the sermons begin. Hollywood...
please. All that money should have been given to the starving children
around the world. Imagine how far it would go!
