Not as bad as you people think.

I almost laugh at commenters who give this movie 1 Star. One person
referred to people as "morons", one said that having a seemingly dead
character dead wasn't original, and another didn't even see 3,4,5. Went
to go see the movie last night and it seemed to be much better than 5
in my opinion.Similar to Fast 5, The Team(Diesel, Walker, Luda, Gibson, Kang, Gadot,
and Rock) is back, excluding the other two guys. While amnesia is not
the most clever and original idea out there, it is not something seen
in most films and gives writers a reason for Diesel to take the job. If
it were any other criminal, Diesel would probably refuse. The amount of
destruction, the customized drag racing cars, the fights, it just goes
to show how much The Fast series has evolved.Fast 5 did have the rest of the cast helping out in the mission, but it
was just some small stuff. Undercover work, opening safe, helping
during the chase. Really, the everyone else wasn't that significant to
the mission. This time, EVERYONE has a major part in this. You have
Gadot with gun, Kang and Gibson get their ***es whooped and help more
during the tank chase, Rocky is seen beside Diesel, and then there's
Ludicrous standing on the sidelines. The members of the team seem more
important this time around.What some people do complain about, and I understand, is that this
movie is less about Fast Driving and more about fighting. I get it; its
easy to feel this way. While very slightly sad about that, 6 seems to
have much more comedy and humoric jokes. They might mostly revolve
around Tyrese Gibson, but nonetheless the jokes are still funny. Taking
snacks out of the vending machine, foul mouth during the tank scene,
the grappling hook, BIG FOREHEAD. So while less about the fast street
racing like in the original, it has added a few more jokes and fighting
which isn't that much worse.What does impress me most is the progression of the Fast Movies. First
the main ant was an Asian gang with Uzi's and motorcycles. 2 was a
white guy with 2 Spanish henchmen, 3 was a Japanese teenager, 4 was(I
actually never fully saw 4. lol), 5 was a corrupt Spanish police force,
and this time involved guys from the same breed. As mentioned, these
are not cops, these are the best criminals in Europe; they are fast and
deadly. They have their own set of custom cars that are faster to begin
with and have ramps on their hood. They have advanced and modified
weapons like the chips. Last importantly, "They Got a Tank". The series
went from something as small and minor as guys on motorcycles to
extreme drivers with a tank and drag cars.I do honestly enjoy this movie much more than 5, though watching this
in a theater did hurt my eyes from all of the explosions and bright
lights. The engagement of supporting characters is a good feature for
the first time also, along with the twist near end. Can't wait until
this comes out on DVD
