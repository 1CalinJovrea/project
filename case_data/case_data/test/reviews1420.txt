This is just one long running mistake pretending to be a film.

Wow, don't get me started. Actually, this is a site for reviews, so if
I have to do this anywhere, it should be here. my 12 year old blind dog
could defecate something more artful and thoughtful than this piece of
trash. It is almost to the level that its so bad its good, but then it
passed that and became one of the worst things ever created. with a
plot that stays on track about as often as a Malaysian plane, it burned
my eyes and scorched my soul, no movie has made me want to strangle
myself more than this one. the director could not have been less
helpful in making a good movie if he was dead. i sure hope he is now. i
rate 1/10, i could smash my face on the keyboard and write a better
script. did you guys lose money on this? i hope you did because
everyone involved in this movie should get hit by a plane and eat a
cactus. one love and im out.
