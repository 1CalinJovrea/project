Interesting Dynamic

I saw this film at 0 Cinema in Miami and my fianc√© and I were so
surprised how original and unpredictable it was. I watch a lot of films
and not since Apocalypto was I so clueless as to what direction the
story was going. There's a great dynamic with the main characters that
makes you wonder what are they up to and what's going to happen next.
The pace is a tad slow, but it helps build suspense and acting is top
notch. I usually hate kid actors because they're stupid kids with their
stupid kid faces but every actor in this is good.
