Better than recent "Sci  Fi" blockbusters

An interesting film from start to finish, far more polished a
presentation than the budget would suggest. It's a mixture of previous
film styles like Star Wars, Alien and Mad Max but none the worse for
that with a good well paced story line. No one will be up for an Oscar but the standard of acting was really
good with well filled out characters that you actually grew to care
about or dislike!.Throw in some good special effects and photography
together with a quality sound track and you've got a good film to
watch. The only drawback for me was the last part of the film where it
seemed an hours worth of story had been condensed into 30 minutes. It
may be the film was cut to fit a 90 minute time span rather than 100 to
120 minutes but it seemed very choppy at the end. Any one interested in Sci Fi should find this an excellent afternoons
entertainment.
