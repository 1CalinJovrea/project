Enjoyable, though exposing the difficulty of adaptation

From the novel by Jonathan Tropper, This is Where I leave You is the
story of how a dysfunctional family gets together for a week to conduct
the Jewish ritual of sitting Shiva for seven days after the passing of
their father, for whom this was his dying wish. Judd, played by Jason
Bateman, is fresh off the shocking revelation that his wife has been
cheating on him with his boss, while his 3 siblings are wonderful mess
of their own problems. The mother, played by Jane Fonda, is an over
sharing woman who published a book over 25 years earlier about their
childhoods and their family secrets. For her, nothing is secret but for
the adult children, the book stands as an obvious lasting scar. After having read all of Jonathan Tropper's novels, it is hard to avoid
the thought that they seem to have been written for the screen. His
dialog, his wisdom, his humor and outrageous situations have always
seemed destined to be made into films. When I saw that This is Where I
Leave You was to become a film, I knew that if nothing else, it would
reflect many of the same elements that make his fiction so much fun.What I guess I didn't count on was the fact that while this is a very
solid movie, it still exposes the difficulty of adaptation. Much of the
wisdom and humor of the book must be conveyed in a series of one on one
conversations between characters, which, after a while start to feel a
little exhausting. Tropper, who did the screenplay himself, chose to
stay away from doing flashbacks to convey back story, hoping to work
the relevant information into the plot. It is not a bad choice, but it
does deprive the audience of some of the information that we would like
to know: like what exactly happened to neighbor/semi-adopted child
Horry that caused him to be brain damaged? It is referenced but never
fully explained, which would seem important because of the apparent
role the Tina Fey character had in it. I can only think that maybe some
bit of dialog somewhere was cut out of the final edit. The bit at the
beginning with the birthday cake was underplayed in comparison to what
happened in the bookÂ—probably not a terrible choice, though I might
have enjoyed seeing the whole sequence end with something more
explosive. Still, This Is Where I Leave You had some great moments and the story
and performances carried the day. Jason Bateman as Judd is a great
everyman; Adam Driver wins an MVP for his role as the goof-up brother,
Phillip; Corey Stoll as Paul, the brother who holds down the fort for
the others yet has his manhood challenged at every turn; Kathryn Hahn
as Judd's Ex and Paul's Current (awkward!) ; Jane Fonda is convincing
as the overbearing mother; Tina Fey as the alcoholic sister; Rose Byrne
as Judd's hometown love interest, Penny Moore and Connie Britton as the
goof-up brother's older woman--all perform the admirable job of making
this rather dark comedy enjoyable.
