No CGI overkill, just some fine acting and directing

Denis Villeneuve is without a doubt an upcoming director and I can't
wait to see Blade Runner 2049. Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival
(haven't seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how
to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his
films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on
story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I
have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many
hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw
to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse
movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining
no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions
extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action,
no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good
directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I
felt bored.
