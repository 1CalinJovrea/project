Loved It (SPOILERS)

Contains spoilers, pass this review if you don't want to see any
spoilers, such as end scenes and more.I actually wasn't planning to watch this particular movie, until my
friends told me it was a good movie and that I should watch it.I decided to try it and see how it goes. I instantly fell in love with
Baymax. He's huggable and simply adorable. Along with that, he's a
HEALTHCARE companion! It was certainly a HILARIOUS movie, and I enjoyed
every last bit of it.I love how that Hiro, originally a boy who was interested only in bot
fights, decides to do something big- starting with joining the nerd
lab. There. he meets people like Wasabi, Fred, Go-Go, and more. This movie also played with your emotions. And no, not just a little
bit, but a lot. Disney seriously did a good job doing that. This movie
was one of those that actually almost made me cry. Near the end, Baymax
had supposedly "died" and that made me very emotional. I was so happy
that at the end, Hiro managed to make another Baymax using the chip the
original Baymax had left behind. All I have to say is that this movie is definitely one worth watching,
especially if you like humorous animated films.
