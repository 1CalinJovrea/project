Pretty bad (no spoilers)

If you turn your brain off, it's exciting I guess? Mediocre action
movie. The action sequences are awkward though and there isn't really a
plot. There are lots of poorly executed details that continuously
distract the viewer with how bad or unrealistic they are. This movie
left me feeling annoyed after viewing.
