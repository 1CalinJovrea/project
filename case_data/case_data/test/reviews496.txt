Good, but some judicious pruning needed

Based on the trailer, my anticipation for seeing "The Judge" was high 
 Robert Downey Jnr, Robert Duvall, Vera Farmiga, Billy Bob Thornton
great cast. And whilst the film is still good, it suffered in my view
from getting rather bogged down in family melodrama.The film opens with a series of stills of various items, all of which
play a key part in the plot as it unfurls. Robert Downey Jnr plays
hot-shot Chicago defence lawyer Hank Palmer who has a reputation for
getting guilty clients off the rap in return for a big fee. He has a
hot house, a hot wife and various hot cars. The death of his mother
forces him back to his childhood home in Indiana  a place he has not
been since his turbulent teenage years. A key reason for his absence is
his father Joseph, the Judge of the title (Robert Duvall), with whom he
has something of a difficult relationship. When on the day of the
funeral Judge Palmer gets into his own brand of legal trouble, a battle
ensues as to whether Hank can overturn his father's stubborn views that
he is better represented by the local hick lawyer cum shopkeeper C.P.
Kennedy (played extremely well by Dax Sheperd).Surrounding this main story are the various sub-plots involving his
relationship with his three brothers, his past high school flame and
his hauntingly torrid past within his home town.There is great acting on display here. Veteran actor Robert Duvall in
particular is exceptional in the lead role, struggling to balance the
conflicting demands of his defence with his reputation within the
community. Also on top form, Billy Bob Thornton plays a devastatingly
fearsome prosecution lawyer  looking like a hawk, you would hate to be
in the witness box when he started on you! Robert Downey Jnr, when he
gets his teeth into the meatier scenes, is also exceptional: one scene
in particular with Thornton in the police station office is just
riveting. However, I felt Downey Jnr sometimes drifted into being (as
my son neatly put it) "a bit Tony Stark-ish in places": playing out the
old disarming comedy schtick works brilliantly in the Iron Man or
Sherlock Holmes films, but in this intense drama it sometimes detracted
from the character of the film. The ever-reliable, and this time
blonde, Vera Farmiga plays Samantha, the high school beauty he left
behind who he finds still serving behind the bar of the local diner
(although with a nice twist). However her role really isn't fleshed out
particularly well and she feels underused in the plot and the film in
general.Where the film struggles is in the screenplay which seems to be bogged
down with too much 'stuff' that needs to be worked through. The core
story, albeit rather formulaic, is good and compelling and doesn't
really need all the extra baggage. A more judicious (no pun intended)
edit and a reduction in the running time would have helped. The film
also seems to try to play a 'fish out of water' card of the hot-shot
lawyer in the backwater town, but rather misses the mark. Nice try but
no cigar.Another significant criticism for me was in the sound mixing
department. This might be my 50+ year old ears, but what with the fast
delivery of lines and Duvall's gruff style, a lot of the dialogue
didn't successfully make the short journey between ear and brain. And
there were some really key lines of dialogue that I missed. If this was
on the TV, I would be constantly hitting rewind to catch what was said
 unfortunately they don't let you do that in the cinema.Outstanding though was the cinematography (by the great Janusz
Kaminski). The film was shot in Massachusetts (principally the town of
Shelburne Falls) and it looks beautiful, with clever boom work
delivering sweeping and cleverly composed shots of the town. In
particular, there is one stunning shot of Downey Jnr driving into town
near the start of the film which is just superb. I'm not sure how it
was done, but I'm thinking possibly a drone attached to the moving car
that was then untethered and flew away? Breathtaking almost worth the
ticket price alone! In summary, not a perfect film but one with enough
emotion and acting talent on display to be worthy of your multiplex
investment.(If you enjoyed this review please sign up for my future reviews at
