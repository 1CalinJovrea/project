A Loser's Ultimate Wet-Dream-Come-True, Chronicled

*Note* Possible spoilers! Here's Chronicle's message to all-time loser teens?In order to gain any acceptance at all from any of your peers you must
first acquire super-powers. That's right. It's the only way. Otherwise
you will continue to be subjected to the same, old treatment that you
so rightly deserve - Like being punched in the head at least 3 times a
day by not only your fellow classmates (while others, doing nothing,
look on), but by your very own father, as well.Now, I ask you - Wasn't it just the most amazing coincidence imaginable
that Andrew suddenly started to diligently record everything on camera
just days before he and his mates just happened to discover the hole in
the ground and, thus, miraculously becoming the 3 bad-ass "superboys"? I know that Andrew, Matt & Steve did actually return once again to the
site of the mysterious hole and it was, at that point, filled in. But,
what doesn't make sense to me was, later, when their super-strength had
increased, why didn't they return again to open up the hole and maybe
that way they could've gotten some sensible answers to this whole,
weird phenomenon?In Chronicle it totally killed me that pretty, little Casey was also a
hand-held movie camera fanatic, as well. I mean, she clung to her
precious camera so possessively that even when she was falling from
Seattle's space-needle, and Matt caught her in mid-air, she never let
go of the frickin' thing. And while she was filming during this fall
the shots were all totally 100% clear with only a minimal amount of
shaking.... Sheesh!Chronicle was one of those films that just about bored me to tears. It
took a whole hour out of its 84 minute running time finally to get to
all of the mayhem and carnage stuff and by that time I was so fed up
with this utter crap movie that I couldn't have cared less what sort of
awesome destruction was about to take place.And finally, I ask you - After you've killed someone, don't you think
that it's just a little too late to be saying complete nonsense to the
dead person like "I'm sorry", and especially the most nauseating line
of all "I love you"???? In my opinion, Matt's hypocritical, little speech to now-dead Andrew at
the end of the film was so bloody hollow and despicable that at that
point I really wished that I could've leaned over and spit right there
in his stupid, smug, little face.
