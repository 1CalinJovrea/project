A good thriller that delivers

In reading some of the very negative reviews posted here, I sensed that
some of those writers were more interested In Oliver Stone then the
actual contents of the movie. I am not such a great fan of Oliver Stone
and thought Wall Street 2 was not well done. Savages, on the other
hand, was quite close to the book, gritty, and well done. If you have a
problem with the portrayal of Seals or the realism of the scenarios
then lay the blame on the book not Mr. Stone. Some of the scenes were
certainly quite gory, an increasingly common occurrence in many films
these days. So if that turns you off then don't watch the movie. On the
other hand if you want to see a good thriller that will keep you
entertained and are comfortable with the topic area, drug dealing and
violence, then by all means see this movie and do not be put off by the
any bad reviews.As for the ending, it was changed from the book and I think for the
better. That's my personal opinion and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie,
despite my dislike for Mr. Stone.
