Clever, suspenseful and creepy, a must see horror film

From director André Øvredal (Trollhunter) comes one of the best horror
movies of 2016, The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Suspenseful, clever and creepy
from start to finish this horror movie follows the story of father and
son (played by Brain Cox and Emile Hirsch), both coroners, as they
experience unexplained and paranormal events while examining the body
of an unidentified woman (played by Olwen Kelly). Execution is superb,
from directing, editing, camera-work, color grading, sound editing,
dialogue. Movie also features some fine acting, most notably from Brian
Cox (no surprise there) There is not a single moment where I felt
bored, tension is always present and creepy atmosphere makes it very
enjoyable. Also scares don't feel forced but rather real and well
earned. Maybe couple of shortcomings or sins here and there prevent it
to be a masterpiece, but it is still a very damn good movie. Simple
story skillfully executed. Horror is not dead, it is still here and
very alive, you just need to have passionate and talented people
working behind the cameras.
