What a Waste

I think we've been pretty spoiled with great survival movies in recent
years. 127 Hours, Gravity, The Revenant, Lone Survivor, or even Mad Max
have given us a keen sense of a perilous journey with an emotionally
satisfying finale. It seems like we get a great one every year, but The
Mountain Between Us just the opposite. It uses the setting and climate
to produce cheap drama and dialogue that feels like something out of a
lifetime movie. With award winning actors in Idris Elba and Kate
Winslet, it's hard to believe that there's little chemistry between the
two. But I guess that's what happens when the script is poorly
constructed.Usually it's beneficial to get to know characters before putting them
in a life-threatening position, that way you actually feel for them
when put in horrific circumstances. One second we're in the airport
following Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in the airport as they separately
try and and book a new flight during a heavy snowstorm, and under 5
minutes later, they are on a private plane together fighting through
the wintry forces. It all just happens way too fast. After seeing the
entire film, I'm glad there isn't any more to the runtime, but perhaps
if there was more time spent setting the characters up, I could have
enjoyed some of the interplay between them later on.However, as I said before, the dialogue doesn't help the situation at
all. When all you have is two actors, a bunch of snow, and a beautiful
labrador, there's not a whole lot you can do creatively. Yet, there are
movies that have done more with less. And when you don't have a ton of
chemistry with your leads, your instinct would be as a director to give
the dog some screen time, and the lab certainly gets that. Being a dog
person, and with thinly written characters, I cared way more about the
dog's whereabouts than I did whether or not Kate Winslet would drown in
a pond of ice. That sounds harsh, but it's true, there's just not a lot
of meaningful depth given to Winslet or Elba's characters.Can you guess what may unfold when a man and a woman are stranded
together for weeks on a mountain top? Yep, eventual romantic feelings
are expressed and it's just as forced as you can imagine. As if i
wasn't already disliking the movie at that point, that was the final
nail in the coffin. Really, the only redeemable aspect to this film is
the beautiful labrador making the trek along with the actors, and a
pretty impressive crash sequence (technically). Other than that, this
will go down as one of the more forgettable films (that had promise) of
the last few years. 3.3/10
