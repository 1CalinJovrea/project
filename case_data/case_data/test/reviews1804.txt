An unexpectedly good time

I didn't intend to watch this movie but my kids wanted to see it. I was
doing other stuff while they were watching it and somehow I got into
it. The songs were really nice with some new ones and some covers of
80s songs. The story is pretty basic but the dialogue is very funny.
Cooper made me laugh out loud with his sparse lines. Its too bad that
we didn't get to know each of the trolls as they seem all interesting.
The movie is not that long so I guess there was not enough time to
flesh them out.Overall, its a light-hearted fun movie which will put you in a good
mood... if you give it a chance.
