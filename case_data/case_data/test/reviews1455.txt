Yet another mis-advertised movie...

So, if you watch the trailer for this film, you might be forgiven for
thinking that it is a fantasy romp suitable to take your children to
see. The fantastic elements of the film are prioritised in the trailer
and the addition of a stirring, epic theme might make you think it is
all going to be good fun.But look again. The dialogue should tell you that there is something
dark going on in this film but don't be tempted to think it is just an
"obstacle" for the characters to overcome. It really is dark.What the film is, is a coming of age drama about a boy whose mother is
dying of cancer and his struggle to come to terms with that. The
fantastic elements are, much like Bridge to Terabithia, simply the way
that the boy makes sense of the events over which he has no control.Unlike Terabithia, however, A Monster Calls has no light moments
preceding the darker moments of the film. It is all darak. Dark, and
dreary, and terribly depressing. The eventual catharsis the boy
experiences at the end of the movie can in no way wash away the
downward mood swing this feature will engender throughout its runtime.So be warned, despite the trailer, this is not a kid's movie in any
way, shape, or form. If I'm honest, I'm not sure who would find this
movie entertaining. At most, it might make you think a little but, if
you've ever had any kind of childhood trauma you might consider giving
it a miss. It really is that depressing.On the plus side, it is reasonably well acted, especially by newcomer
Lewis MacDougall. Others, less so, and I have no idea what Sigourney
Weaver was doing with her accent other than to say I've never heard
anyone English talk like that.Visually, it is very striking, but that is really all that is going for
it as a form of entertainment. The band Fallout Boy once wrote a song
with the lyrics "The best of us can find happiness in misery..." This
movie puts a lie to that assertion. There is no joy to be found is this
movie, only despondency and sadness.Mostly, I think this just goes to show you should never trust a movie
trailer to judge a film's content by. Another recent example of this
was Mr. Holmes, which portrayed its subject matter as a light hearted
romp as well. At least that one doesn't leave you feeling miserable by
the end of it.In short, not a fun movie in any way and woefully misrepresented by its
marketing media, which seemed intent on simply getting as many bums on
seats in the auditorium as possible.SUMMARY: Horribly depressing look at life, and its end. Not for
children, ever. Not really for adults, either. Well made, but dreary
and terribly badly marketed. Avoid.
