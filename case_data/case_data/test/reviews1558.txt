An insult to the franchise

I'm a big Terminator 1 and 2 fan. They are 2 of my favourite sci-fi
movies of all time. Terminator 3 and 4 were decent but both quite dull
and not even comparable to their predecessors. Terminator 5 is one of
the worst movies I've ever seen. There are no words to describe how
awful this is. They couldn't have made it any worse even if they tried.
Everything from the acting to the script to the special effects is
absolutely laughable. And yes I did start laughing at some point,
thinking 'what the hell is going on here?'. The people who wrote the
script should be fired, the actors should go to acting classes and
Arnie should apologise to the fans for this monstrosity. This should
have never been made. What a joke of a movie.
