A Cure for Wellness- A short review

Visually, this film is a masterpiece and the shots are breathtaking.
The castle where most of the movie takes place is a great setting, it's
a real place in Germany called Castle Hohenzollern. Every shot is a
piece of art, framed and filmed with the utmost respect for the craft.The story is an interesting one, you'll be thinking to yourself for
most of the movie, what is the cure for wellness? They do give an
answer to it later in the movie. The plot has a man working for a big
finance company out to retrieve the CEO of the company from a wellness
center in the Swiss Alps. Along the way, he meets some interesting
characters and tries to figure out what exactly they're trying to cure
up there on the mountain.The only thing I thought the film could have done better was with the
twist, it could be seen from a mile away if you were watching the
previous part of the movie with even a little bit of concentrated
focus.My suggestion: See it! this film is the reason people go to the movies,
to be entertained to the extent of leaving a lasting impression.
