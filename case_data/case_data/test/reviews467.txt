please please please say you did not pay to see this clunker

OMG! one stupid clich√© after another, and after about the 5th
ridiculous coincidence, one just throws up one's hands. Endless chase
sequences that lead to nothing, huge amounts of destruction, but it's
an action moving that is weirdly static. How did this thing get made?
Plot holes the size of Costa Rica, ridiculous and simply factually
idiotic elements: an rpg taking out an abrams tank, (I know, so what,
right, it's just a little thing, but it is one little thing amongst
many little things, and big things, pu!) Also, the need for hostages,
the capital being blown up, again, for no purpose. I could go on and on
and on. I feel for the screen writers. Hope they got paid well. As did
all the good actors, doing yeoman work in service pure crap. But for
those who paid to see this, I'm so, so sorry.
