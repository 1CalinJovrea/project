Comedy Of Horrors, perhaps

Maybe the intention was to make a terrifying comedy about, about,
about...well, I'm not sure. A Mother! like that with an exclamation
mark? An artist with an ego bigger than their house? Who knows. I
certainly tried to cling on to something but I couldn't. It seems like
a terrible confession to make but the truth is I couldn't care less
about that mother because I didn't believe in her plight and couldn't
understand her behavior. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress we all
know that but here, she screams and screams while I glanced at my watch
with mounting impatience. Borrowing from other, better films, doesn't
help, on the contrary, it irritates. Rosemary's Baby came to mind as
well as The Tenant, Apartment Zero, Common Wealth. All films that
terrified me without explicit gore and superb screenplays. Mother!
seems like an interesting idea totally derailed by an out of control
ego.
