Not a great movie

There is a huge gun battle so those who are watching for that will be
satisfied. Sadly this movie could have been better written. The dialog
isn't clever in fact it sounds dumb most of the time. The humor falls
flat too. There are some silly plot elements and a draggy middle
section.It was fun to see them fortify and how their traps worked out. The
filming is beautiful and the scenery is more colorful than the usual
Westerns.The big battle delivers a huge climax. The machine gun thing was out of
place. Sometimes it was hard to make out who was shooting who and who
was getting shot.The ending was weak. Why Bogue would just walk in there and have a one
on one with Denzel is just illogical. As a modern twist the brown red
and black heroes are the ones left standing.The cast is generally likable. Ethan Hawke looks haggard for someone in
his mid 40s. Denzel looks trimmer than of late. Chris Pratt could still
lose about 20 pounds. Byung Hun Lee is okay. The standout is Vincent
D'Onofrio who really acts different in different roles. See him in
Daredevil? Cam Gigandet looks like a classic Western bad guy. Haley
Bennett is quite believable - not too pretty to be unrealistic.One major casting mistake: Peter Sarsgaard doesn't have the malevolence
required to be a villain. His sing song way of talking sounds slimy not
nasty.Not a must watch.
