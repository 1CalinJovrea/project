Powerful Statement, Outstanding Acting, Stunning Cinematography

Gifted is a story with not a lot of surprise elements, but it wins the
audience over with its powerful statement, outstanding acting and
stunning cinematography. Mainly, Gifted has a very dramatic story line.
However, Gifted offers much more then that. Viewers also get a subplot
of romance, friendship and strong family values as well as some comedy
here and there to keep a dramatic movie light.The plot begins when Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace) starts first grade. She
isn't like the other kids in her class. Her teacher, Bonnie (Jenny
Slate) soon learns that Mary turns out to be a genius in mathematics.
She can easily do equations higher than high school level. Despite her
clear giftedness, Mary's uncle, Frank (Chris Evans) refuses to put
Maryin a school for gifted children, trying to keep the girl's life
normal. Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), Mary's grandmother insists on making
her do mathematics around the clock and training her to be a math
prodigy. What follows is a custody battle between the two for Mary.My favorite scene really stands out due to remarkable lighting and
camera work. The scene really doesn't contribute to the plot, but the
cinematography makes it one of the most excellent in the film. The
scene shows Mary riding on Frank's shoulders. Behind them, a giant
sunset completely fills the sky. The lighting from the setting sun
comes out stunningly dazzling. Even though it doesn't add to the
complexity of the story, the scene is very impressive and demonstrates
the closeness of the uncle and his niece.One of Gifted's weak points waters down to the story. Even though the
film is unique from other stories about genius kids, by focusing on the
family values and relationships instead of Mary's exceptional
mathematical skills, it still comes out very predictable and rather
simple. The main conflict never really feels like a major issue but
rather, just a side story. Despite those issues, Gifted still
entertains through the acting. All the actors deliver outstanding
performances. Mckenna Grace, despite being only 10-years-old,
completely steals the show. Never does the acting feel forced and the
actors seem to authentically connect with their characters and have a
true bond on-screen.There are a few adult references in the film, but nothing too worry
about. I recommend this for ages 8 to 18 and give it 4 out of 5 stars
because, although the story needs work, the acting and cinematography
make Gifted a very entertaining and memorable film.By Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit
