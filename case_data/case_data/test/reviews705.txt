Cheesy....Chick-flick

Good thing I Like Cheesy Chick-flicks....but if your are not a
chick-flick person DO NOT WATCH THIS!!!....But on the other hand if you
do...this movie is cute, funny and has many great actors and actresses
that i really like...The Dude Group is Hilarious...If you have Kids you
will relate to many of the things that happens in here...It's all about
Baby Delivery and everything that come's with it....OBVIOUSLY the Title
says it all.For the Moms... this movie is funny..I guarantee you will relate to at
least one couple in this film.for mom's to be... This movie is nice to watch and wont traumatize you
in anyway.BTW...Joe Manganiello is shirtless in many of the scenes in this
film...YAY!!!
