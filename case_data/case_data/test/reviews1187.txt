A horrible sequel

In 2008, I enjoyed the film Taken mainly because of Liam Neeson's solid
performance, which added deepness to the screenplay because of his
conviction and intensity (I will refrain from mentioning that the TV
series 24 was quite popular in that time, and Neeson basically played
Jack Bauer, but on the big screen). Now, 4 years later, we have Taken
2, which unfortunately is a pathetic action film with an incredibly
weak screenplay, insipid direction and some of the most boring action
scenes I have seen in the last years.Neeson made his best effort in rescuing Taken 2, bringing the
seriousness and conviction from an authentic professional actor who
trusts in the screenplay...or at least pretends to. For the rest, the
film is a collection of forced domestic melodrama (Kim couldn't obtain
her driving license; Bryan distrusts of Kim's new boyfriend; Lennie has
problems with her new husband; etc.) and confusing action scenes
completely lacking of any energy and impact. I was almost falling
asleep during the car chase through the narrow streets of Istambul; and
the fights are edited into micro-shots of less than a second, and as a
consequence, it was very difficult to notice what was happening.But the worst thing of all is that Taken 2 retroactively harms Taken,
because the villains are so inept that they make us doubt about the
hero's ability. He was maybe just lucky of finding a gang of idiots who
leave him alone during long periods of time in order to give him the
opportunity to escape; kindly allow him to make phone calls while they
are having him held at gunpoint; and start to endlessly make a
monologue when they should be having the revenge they enjoy mentioning
so much. As for the violence, Taken 2 is strictly PG-13 material; the
main character employs magic bullets which always hit the spot, but
without shedding a single drop of blood; on the opposite, the villains
employ bullets which inoffensively dissolve through the air, or at
most, only work on walls. In conclusion, Taken 2 is an unbearable film, whose 90 minutes feel
like 180 because of the poor screenplay and director Olivier Megaton's
laziness. I liked his previous film (Colombiana), but he fell so low in
Taken 2 that it will be difficult to have any enthusiasm in his future
films. In other words, save your time and your money, and don't watch
Taken 2. I just hope that this piece of junk isn't economically
successful, and we won't have a third part, in which Neeson will have
to look for the cup of coffee he accidentally left on his car's roof.
After Taken 2, I think any foolishness would be viable for producer Luc
Besson.
