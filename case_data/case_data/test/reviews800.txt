Ending Changed

I saw this wonderful movie in 2014 when it came out in the theaters & I
thought it was a beautiful depiction of young love, loss & second
chances. You figure out early that something tragic will happen since
Dawson really believes he survived the drowning for a reason,
especially after they get back together. Then Amanda's son needs a new
heart & you just knew what was going to happen. I left that theater in
tears, I hated that Dawson had to die so Amanda's son could live.
However, I just watched this movie again today on TV & it has a totally
different ending. He does not die and they walk off into the sunset
together. That should not have happened & I think selling out to
criticism by changing the ending is bad form. I was going to buy this
movie but not now. I would have given it a 10 had I not seen it today.
