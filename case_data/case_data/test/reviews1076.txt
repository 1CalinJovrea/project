The boys are back

Being an American Pie fan since the beginning, I was excited about
American Reunion. The boys are back for another crazy, sexual, and
over- the-top adventure.Since the last film in 2003, I thought they wouldn't be able to perform
as well together. But from start to finish, they played their roles as
if they never left. This movie will definitely keep you laughing, especially if you are a
long time fan. Not to mention Jim's dad finally got the screen time he
deserved. Now, I don't think it was as good as it could have been. The plot, as
mentioned in other reviews, was plain. But all in all, It was an
amazing sequel to the series. Better than the first? I don't think so.
But as good as the first? YES!I do recommend watching the last three American Pie movies before going
to see this. You will understand the movie much clearer, and not to
mention the little surprise(s) will have you rolling on the floor
laughing.Cons: It wasn't dirty enough. The jokes were hysterical, but I wanted
more! I wanted more F bombs, sex jokes, and pie humping! But I guess
that is what the previous Pie films were for ;)If you are a fan, you will enjoy this film. You will NOT be
disappointed.10/10 stars
