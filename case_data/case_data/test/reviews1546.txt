The obsession creates monsters!

I have been waiting for the movie since may, when i first watched the
trailer. It was fascinating from the first moment, despite i do not
like horror movies, i felt that it hides something special. And i was
right! It is Gothic romance with elements of horror and the key role
takes the relations and deep feelings between people.The movie is extremely enchanted. You are submerging to the Victorian
era from the first moment, it was like to buy a ticket to the past. The
atmosphere is full with mystery and anxiety. The main role here takes
the castle. It is unbelievably beautiful, but at the same dark and
frightening. I have got the most aesthetic enjoy i ever had.Jessica as Lucille is the best in here. You can't take a look out of
her. Even Tom is in the shadow in comparison with her. Her demonic
nature hides under the fatal appearance. Tom's performance is perfect as always. He plays Thomas Sharpe - a
gentleman with immaculate manners - his eyes are full with sorrow. I
will not say too much about him, in order not to reveal all the
secrets.Just Mia was a little disappointed. I didn't fill her intense position.
She acted superficial. This is only minus i caught.Overrall, the beautiful lyrical story is worth seeing.
