A Well Done Adaptation

More and more lately I am discovering a disconnect between myself and
the vast majority of movie critics. I have loved a lot of movies this
year that they've hated, and that trend continues here with The Legend
of Tarzan. As far as live-action interpretations of Tarzan go, this and
Greystoke are the two champs, with The Legend of Tarzan edging out
Greystoke by a teeny bit.The Legend of Tarzan is unique in that it's not an origin story. While
the origins of Tarzan are explored in a few flashback scenes (reminding
me a lot of Batman Begins), the movie is really about John Clayton,
Lord of Greystoke (aka Tarzan's real name and title). Tarzan has been
living in England with Jane for the past few years and has left the
jungle behind him, but when he is asked to help expose a slavery ring
in the Congo, he is drawn back to Africa.Harry Potter director, David Yates, manages to breathe new life into
Tarzan thanks to the modern technological wizardry that CGI enables.
The vast majority of this movie was all shot on sets in England, with
pretty much all of the animals and African environments created by a
computer. This sells the reality of the story, much in the same way
that The Jungle Book did a few months back. Of course what really makes
this movie resonant is not the craft on display, but the story between
Tarzan and Jane.Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie portray Tarzan and Jane in this
movie, and they actually make you care about these two characters.
Skarsgard plays Tarzan as a stoic gentleman trying not to be the animal
he was raised to be, while Robbie portrays the feistiest Jane you've
ever seen. Then there's the charisma and humor of Samuel L. Jackson as
real-life historical figure, Dr. George Washington Williams, who joins
Tarzan on his quest to save the Congo. Couple that with Christoph Waltz
being Christoph Waltz as the bad guy, Leon Rom, and you've got a fun,
emotionally resonant pulp adventure that Tarzan author, Edgar Rice
Burroughs, would most likely be proud of.When it gets right down to it, don't listen to the critics on this one.
Your enjoyment of The Legend of Tarzan all relies on how much you enjoy
the idea of Tarzan in general. If you think Tarzan is hokey, then this
movie probably isn't for you, but there is nothing wrong with the movie
itself. The script is good, the movie is well directed, the
cinematography and musical score are beautiful, and there are many well
choreographed action sequences. The bottom line is, if you have an
affinity for the character, The Legend of Tarzan is the Tarzan movie
you've been looking for.I give The Legend of Tarzan an 8 out of 10!
