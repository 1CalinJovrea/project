An unneeded remake of the Equalizer

Why oh why are Antonio B and Ben K in this utterly predictable (I knew
the ending after 35 minutes down to the exact scene), lame and
unoriginal film? Boring, pointless and without anything new, Security
is mostly the same as Denzel W's The Equalizer. Except it's not nearly
as good. After Gandhi, Mr K always plays bad guys. Psycho bad guys if
possible. And Mr B is a fine actor (who can forget his Puss 'n Boots?
;) ) who can really bring mystery and menace to a role. But this? It
gives turkeys a bad name.
