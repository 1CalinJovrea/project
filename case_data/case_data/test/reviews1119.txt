Why was this made?

What the hell is this crap? What happened here?This is so by the numbers, so bland, so boring. Check it out: every
single jump scare in this movie, which is pretty much every single
"scare", is accomplished with an ear piercingly loud sound. Seriously.
Every time. A car horn. A dogs bark. A bang on a door. And the sound is
so ridiculously loud, while the talking is super low. Man I was just so
effing angry. It pains your ears. And the sound is not even accompanied
by scary imagery! Most of the times it's just a fake scare. With SUCH
loud noise. JEEEZ.The best thing about the movie is Sophie Cookson. She does the best she
can with a very uninteresting and boring script. There is very little
gore, the little there is is OK. There are a couple of effects, they
also work. But all in all it's just very tame. The story, I think,
leans on being "true". Unfortunately it's still boring.I should probably give this a lower score, but if my mood were better I
think I might have enjoyed it more. Also, the movie does have some
qualities, it's just all to by the numbers.
