Legends

Tom Hardy gives an all time great performance, double acting as both
the notorious Kray twins. The story is also quite comedic, clever and
full of some great thrilling scenes. One of the great things about this
film is you know what you're going to get, and it delivers, then some.
It's bloody on top of witty, charming and fun. Legend serves up one of
the great films of the year, whilst also being quite modest in its
approach. With Tom Hardy's already established terrific acting skills, Legend
becomes something more then a typical gangster crime film. It feels
invested into making the viewer content with its two hour runtime,
whilst always respecting. The award for best actor goes toÂ… Tom Hardy,
for sure.
