Slow as a wet weekend, with a truly annoying end. Possible spoilers.

This film was agonizingly slow. But I persevered, as the scenery was
good, I like Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving and I really wanted to find
out what happened to the missing kids.I wouldn't say it was like watching paint dry, as there was always
something nice to look at and some of the characters had interesting
quirks, I wanted to know more about them. But it never delivered.The movie is one long build up, from beginning to end and offers no
minor resolutions, let alone the big one. It finished over half an hour
ago and I still feel frustrated.Unless you enjoy being left hanging, avoid this one like the plague.
