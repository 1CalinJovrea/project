deeply disappointed...

Lured by the good reviews we watched it - actually I was looking
forward to it very much, but I was left deeply disappointed. The movie
is well made, the story might be a little bit foreseeable, but it is in
most "teenage movies", but the main character is so difficult to relate
to, it's horrible. Every other character is more likable, it somehow
hurts to watch and ruins the whole movie. The teacher played by Woody
Harrelson is great and that's what earned the three points. You somehow
want to make it stop, but still obviously due to some masochistic
tendencies we endured it till the end. It could have been great but it
simply isn't, as much as it hurts.
