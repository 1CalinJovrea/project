Absolutely hilarious!

This is one of those movies that you watch and you just can't help but
come out smiling afterwards about. It's so rib ticklingly funny and it
really gets you feeling happy. It's seven years after first movie, Jonathan and Mavis get married,
have a kid - little Dennis and gramps the Count Dracula wants him to be
a half vampire. The Count tries all sorts of things to bring this side
out. I will let you watch to see what happens. The characters are just fantastic, especially Count Dracula, Jonothan
and Mavis. You also get a chance to see more of Murray's (mummy) ,
Griffin (invisible man), Frankenstein and Wayne's (werewolf)
personalities in this movie. Love them and they really make you smile.
Also funny is Blobby - a green jelly mould. He's so sweet don't know
why he's scary but who cares. Loved Jonathan's in laws in this too! The
human intake had a great side and the little boy Dennis plus girl
werewolf Winnie was a brilliant cute factor. The vampire camp and tower
scene is just without doubt brilliant to see. It's got a few scary moments with red eyes and teeth coming at the
screen which may scare kids if they are jumpy but otherwise the music
and look of the film is spectacular. Loved the flying together moment with Count and Mavis. Such a tender
fun father daughter time. I just can't recommend this movie enough but go and see it - It's
funny, touching, scary in parts and will leave you smiling for hours.
Great for anyone whether young or old
