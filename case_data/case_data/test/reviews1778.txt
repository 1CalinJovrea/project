Fun, Action Packed and Adorable

"Big Hero 6" is a movie that shows the best of both Disney and Marvel.
It's funny, has exciting action scenes and has enjoyable characters.Baymax (Scott Adsit), the inflatable huggable healthcare companion for
Hiro (Ryan Potter) was, for me, the best part of the movie. Baymax
brings laughs in almost every scene he is in, has a lot of action
scenes and you end up loving him. Hiro is the most developed of the
human characters (he is funny, his actions, however rash and dangerous,
are understandable and he grows and learns from his mistakes) and he
along with Baymax makes the movie great. Although the other humans are
all fun in their own way, I wish we got to know more about them.The villain in this movie is good as well. Just goes about his job
doing evil stuff in an evil manner and is threatening throughout.My only issue was with the ending which unfortunately went as
predicted. However, this was still a very fun movie which did go places
(dark intense places) I did not expect and improved the movie for me.
Big Hero 6 entertained me a lot and will be fun for the entire family.
