A movie requires more than one decent metaphor to hold its own for 2 hours.

I agree with a lot of people here who say this movie is undoubtedly one
of the best looking movies of the year. It's probably no surprise
coming from a director like Tom Ford, who was a fashion designer for
Gucci before chasing filmmaking. This movie looks like a Gucci ad for
the majority of its runtime and it's hard to fault him for having an
impeccable attention to detail. Whether it's a closeup of Amy Adams'
face or a wide shot of a deserted landscape, Ford certainly has a hell
of an eye for a shot.It's too bad that that's all there is to this movie. If this film were
made by a less talented director, it would probably be a Lifetime
Channel movie, and for most of the duration it feels like one; one
artfully directed Lifetime Channel movie with masterful acting, but
even still, Lifetime-tier. It's a shame that such a talented cast
couldn't help elevate this film above its mediocre script. There are
some deviations from the norm, like the main character being rich and
being the owner of an art gallery she doesn't care for (which I'll
admit I found to be an interesting dynamic), rich and still having a
good relationship with her ex husband (ish), there's a few more but
that's the few I can name off the top of my head.Lots of people are claiming that this film is one complex masterpiece
or whatever, but they couldn't be more wrong if they tried. The whole
film is a metaphor for how awful divorce is, and problem is, it's so
easy to tell, and it's all the movie has to exist on aside from a good
performance from Amy Adams. It's clear from the fact that Jake
Gyllenhaal plays both Edward (the ex husband) and Tony. Hell, the
original book this film is based on is called "Tony and Susan". Susan
basically reads this graphic and violent metaphor for how apparently
horrible she is and feels bad about it. The metaphor is only
communicated through the movie-within-the-movie to the point where the
movie's actual plot is literally just... Amy Adams reading a book for 2
hours and feeling bad. That is literally her whole character arc. She
reads a book and she feels bad. There is literally a scene where she
looks at a live video on a co-worker's iPhone only to see the character
in the novel that is supposed to be her jump at the camera lens. It's
about as subtle as a brick to the face.Not just that but the film handles how apparently horrible she is so
callously. In the book, the plot is that Tony lost his family when a
man and his deranged friend captured them and raped and killed them. So
uh... what did she do to "rape and kill" whatever he had? Oh right, she
had an abortion. Because heaven forbid a woman should choose whether or
not she wants to keep a child from a man she's no longer with. And what
happens after she gets the abortion? If you guessed "she feels bad",
congratulations, feel free to take a cookie. Seriously, I'm no feminist
advocate or whatever, but the treatment of women in this film is so
callous it's beyond belief. We get it, divorce is tough. We don't need
a violent perfume ad disguised as a movie to remind us of that.When all is said and done, Nocturnal Animals is basically just a pretty
looking A-list student film that thinks it's more clever than it really
is. If this didn't have a master of aesthetic directing it, it would
basically have just ended up as the Lifetime Network movie of the week
it probably should have been. It's not offensively bad, it's just
gorgeous mediocrity and a weak metaphor carrying a movie on fumes. It's
like a bag of chips that's 80% air passing itself off as a full meal.
