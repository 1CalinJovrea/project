Lovely comedy

I have never written a review before but I had to as I don't understand
the negative reviews at all! I really enjoyed this movie. It made me
laugh. I enjoyed it better than any Adam Sandler movie including 50
first dates and Wedding SInger starring Drew and Adam together as well.
I actually hope for a sequel to this movie. - note: I am rating this as
the movie it is. A lovely, touching comedy. Nothing more, nothing less.
With this in mind it is worth a 10 from me. So if you don't like Adam
Sandler maybe this movie isn't for you...otherwise I think you will
enjoy it.Two families are "blended" as they - after a horrible first date- end
up at the same holiday resort. I loved the holiday setting and the way
all the characters come together.
