Mildly Amusing Occasionally

Mafia boss Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro) and his family are in
witness protection, and relocated for the upteempth time to Normandy
France. Agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) tries desperately to
keep this crime family in line.Director Luc Besson is trying to make a black comedy, but it's only
mildly amusing occasionally. It's cute to see Dianna Agron smash a guy
with a racket. And it's cool to see Michelle Pfeiffer blowing up the
convenience store. Of course, Besson is winking at us as Robert De Niro
enjoys a showing of Goodfellas. But it's doesn't translate into a funny
comedy. At best, there were a couple of chuckle worthy moments.The movie probably needs a comedian. Looking around, there isn't one
known comedian in the bunch. I can't imagine somebody who thinks the
pairing of De Niro and Jones would result in hilarity. They could be
funny, but only if paired with a great comedian. De Niro needs Ben
Stiller for the Meet the Parents movies, and Billy Crystal for 'Analyze
This'. And Grumpy face Jones can really only do the straight man. The
Tommy Lee Jones role would be better played by somebody funny. Grumpy
face is not that somebody.
