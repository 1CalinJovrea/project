What the heck is going on?

This movie was so repetitive and boring but at least it made me realize
that IMDb and RT have definitely been bought by some Hollywood
conglomerate giving the most terrible movies awesome reviews. Do not watch this movie and never trust the ratings on here or IMDb
because they are obviously a bunch of fake accounts.It is sad what has become of the internet these days. Very sad.IMDb has become useless to me ever since they removed the forums. What
a nice way to treat its user base.
