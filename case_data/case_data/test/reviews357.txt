What the HellÂ…?

Short version: Read the book, but don't see the movie. OR, go see the
movie, but don't read the book. Just DON'T do both.Long version: There really are no words to describe how far away this
movie was from the book. It was like going into a theater expecting to
see The Terminator, and seeing Braveheart instead. Both great movies,
but NOTHING similar about them. Besides the character names,
lightening, and some sand, NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING about this movie
resembled ANY part of the book. Nothing. I read the book in one day,
two days before I saw this movie. I was so excited to see this
fantastic book come to life, and I left sorely disappointed.I'm not sure if the author of the book was involved at all in the
decisions that went into the writing of this movie, but they completely
bastardized, completely changed EVERYTHING about his story. Even the
core motivation behind the 'who and the why' was different.It simply was not the same story at all. I've seen many books made into
movies and I'm familiar with the huge and often disappointing changes
they inevitably make, but this was off the charts. I've never seen
anything like it.If you haven't read the books, then go see it. It was fun enough. But
please don't bother if you enjoyed the original story; because it's a
completely different one.
