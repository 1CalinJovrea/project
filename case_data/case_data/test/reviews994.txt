An overall excellent movie

A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be "a
kickass Korean zombie flick", so naturally i went into this movie
expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I
in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a
tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it
in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The
zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you,
without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is
taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel
claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap
tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are
seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood
standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this
genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional.
Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the
story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the
characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out
about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go
for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally
invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting
performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by
the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick.
It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is
action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep
you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play
around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre.
However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and
characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10
