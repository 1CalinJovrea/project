Disappointing

After the Rise of Cobra (2009) not that it was a great movie, I
expected much more as the sequel especially as it comes after fours and
honestly if you may believe the first one seems much better than this
one. The movie has nothing new to offer in terms of plot, which is wafer
thin. The SFX do try to make up for the same. Barring, the acrobatic
action sequence in the snowy mountains, nothing else held my attention
in the movie.The acting is below par as expected of 'Blockbusters', but even the
humor is missing. I really don't know why Bruce Willis is there and it
seems clearly an after thought of having him there to add to the 'STAR'
power.I watched it in IMAX 3D and really felt as I wasted my time and money,
if you really want to watch this one wait for it on DVD.2 out 5...
