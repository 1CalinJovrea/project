Well-made, well-acted, but mostly predictable

It may be because I kept reading and hearing about how many
"mind-bending twists" this movie contains, but I was somewhat
disappointed with it. The one central twist of the plot is quite
predictable, especially when you consider that there are only two
possible "truths" about what you have already seen happening, and the
film desperately wants you to believe one of them....there IS at least
one genuine surprise (the "truth serum" test), but it's a fairly minor
one in the whole pattern of things. So, while "Side Effects" is
well-directed by Steven Soderbergh and well-acted by a well-selected
quartet of stars (plus some key supporting players), it's not really
the mind-blower it's being hyped as. ** out of 4.
