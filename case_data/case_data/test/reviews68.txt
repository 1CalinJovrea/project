Saying farewell to childhood

It is Halloween and a bunch of mean boys are going out to have some
fun. One of them is starting to out-grow the group, especially when
they pick on another boy he knows from when they were kids. The bullied
kid black mails his old friend to spend the evening with him.This is a coming of age film with a heavy under lying sense of menace,
the horror element is very slight indeed.The film has a slight surreal feel about it, all the adults leave the
kids to run amok across town and everyone bumps into each other in the
most unlikely of places.There is a certain inevitability about this film that could be seen as
predictability but I quite liked it.The dynamics of the gang are portrayed with great zeal and shows how
strong personalities can cloud the better judgement of others.Well filmed, produced and acted. Some of the kids look a little bit old
but their acting skills make up for it.You will see the ending coming a mile off and there isn't much meat to
the story but this was a very enjoyable Netflix watch.
