Watch only if you need to lose 2 hours of your life.

First of all let me tell you that I rate movies on a scale from -10 to
10 with 5 being the average and negative numbers for differentiating
the awfulness of certain movies that are terrible.That said I give this movie a 0, even though I like Seth Macfarlane's
work this was an absolute disaster. We got a movie with 1 dimensional leading characters of Ted and John
that didn't provide you with a single emotional reaction, while Mila
Kunis character was at least somewhat comparable to a person although
not at all complex. Supporting cast is the only part worth mentioning
since Flash Gordon absolutely stole the show with the 4 minutes of air
time he had, his lines were consistent and witty unlike anything main
characters did.Story in itself falls apart since it is not built on anything real, the
movie is completely clownish for the first 1 hour without any character
build up and then randomly inserts "emotional" parts which left me
completely indifferent, it was awkward and out of place.I could have said something nice about the atmosphere if the movie was
consistent as it was for the first half but it started to take itself
seriously which ruined the composure.I wouldn't recommend any movie enthusiast to watch this terrible movie,
and reading movie reviews on IMDb in general I'm sure at least 90% of
them as well as votes are sponsored by companies, too bad for this once
great site.
