Early Showing of The Ritual

Went to an Odeon Scream Unseen showing of the film. The first part of
the film was well done and kept you in suspense.It developed well without knowing who or what thing was causing the
terror.As we progress to the disclosure of the creation of the terror I felt a
little let down as the ending was weak and I felt it could have been
done far better.
