I gave it a 10 because I didn't think anyone else would.

First and foremost, this is the first movie I have seen in years that
actually has something to do with my life. I read through the threads,
and I wasn't surprised that people found it depressing. They were
probably expecting to see Knocked Up or I Love You Man. It lacks the
stoner cool single guys being all zany about porn. Instead the comedy
comes from things that forty somethings deal with: mortgage, kids,
hormones, diet, expectations, etc. I rarely get to see a movie about
people my age or having problems and solutions that don't involve guns,
drugs, superheroes, cartoon birds, and people who have 8 figure life
styles without ever having a job. Okay, so he's a groovy record co.
guy, and she has a chic boutique.... Definitely way more California
than my life, but still it is pretty real to life. I will concede that
there are some gags that don't quite work, but like I said: I'm
stickin' up for this one because I think it is getting a bad rap based
on expectations. Thanks to Judd Apatow for making a movie about life
instead of (hip jobs aside) hyper-situational life.
