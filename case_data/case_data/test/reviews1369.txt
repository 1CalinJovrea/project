Waste of an excellent idea

Good, unusual and entertaining idea, mixing together dark character
drama with comedy, sci-fi, and Kaiju fun in a near-surreal mix.
Unfortunately this movie has the same big flaws as Vigalondo's earlier
movies: He has good ideas but is horrible with character work. He
always sacrifices characters towards his ideas and plots, and they end
up chaotic and inhuman. These people make no sense: "I just killed a million Koreans. Oops. What should I do? I know! I'll
get drunk again and show my new friends how cool it is to mass murder.""I'm going to have a hissy fit and kill a million Koreans just because
it makes me feel big and because I want to control a girl. But in
between I am going to be super nice to her, support her, give her tons
of things for her house and give her a job." "I love my boyfriend even though he dumped me and wish he would take me
bac... hey let's sleep with some random cute guy in the bar and have
fun!" "How should I stop him from killing Koreans? Should I get my friends to
hold him down? Demonstrate this phenomenon to the police and have him
arrested? Maybe sit with him and convince him not to commit
mass-murder? Nah, I'll go to Korea and kill him." "I had to dump her because she was intolerable when drunk. But now that
she is even worse and slept with other people, I want her back." Etc.And none of them are even remotely convincing as drunks. Maybe if they
actually acted like obliviously self-destructive drunks it would have
helped a bit.Somebody should re-use this idea in a better movie.
