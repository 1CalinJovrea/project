What was the point?

I swear to God I really really wanted to like this movie. I am kind of
a fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like Johnny Depp was
appropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making
the Violence believable. What failed was the writing. There is never
really any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be
Whitey or why he wanted to be Whitey. His kid is dead his marriage
ruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money? Why? He
apparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from
the IRA. The whole thing just makes no sense. The whole thing just
seemed apathetic.It could have been a real classic but they fornicated
with the puppy yet again. It was just Depp looking weird and enjoying a
WHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed
informants. Thanks Hollywood. I suspect you can blame the producers.
