Very Disappointing

I saw Django Unchained with the expectation of any Tarantino fan. But I
left shaking my head in disappointment. This is not a bad film, but I'm
not saying it's a good one.The length of the film is one of the main flaws. There are many scenes
that do not serve a purpose to its characters and story. Which leads to
its pacing problem. These irrelevant scenes exist in the film that
often slows it down. It is very unbalanced.Mostly, it's the characters and performances. Many are giving praise to
Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio. Waltz, first of all, is in
similar territory when he was in Inglorious Basterds. He and his
character served their purpose and Waltz was just fine in the role, but
nothing to highly praise. DiCaprio as Calvin Candie was nothing worth
noting. Either its in the performance or the script, I never really
invested in him. It's as if Tarantino wanted to write a great movie
villain and that's what DiCaprio took as his only direction. There is a
scene where he gets the evil monologue, but it comes very forced with
ultimately ends up destroying the character. Jamie Foxx, first of all, was the right choice for Django, but I
believe that Tarantino did not trust his protagonist. It takes a long
while to get invested in him, but at that point, why bother? BUT, the
standout for me was Samuel L. Jackson. He takes his character Stephen
is able to go beyond the material that is given. There is fun in his
performance which is what the film should be.I am well aware that I will be in the minority, when it comes to
disliking the film. How people will try to tell me that there was more
to the story than meets the eye, how it's a great revenge tale, how the
characters were great and well written etc. But this is not a good
Quentin Tarantino film. The film is too long, with characters that hold the most minimal of
interests. I will be really dishearten to see this film receive awards
and praise. Maybe it's the love of Quentin that will jade people. I
know it will. But after coming out of a strong year for film, Django
falls flat.The movie lacks the confidence of character(s) and story in a hyper
active world. It loses it's identity somewhere along the line and the
little scenes of greatness cannot save it. Most of all it does not have
the joy of film that often add life to Tarantino films.
