Everything I expected and more; better than the original

This move is excellent! Sure, we all know Cinderella's story, but I
don't see why people are saying it's clich√©. There are so many changes,
and it is better than the original. Here's how and why:Better than the original: We still have the mice, and one is named Gus,
but they don't talk or wear clothes. Nor do they make a dress, crawl
into the stepmother's pocket and grab a key without her noticing, or
trick a cat. Too much was focused on the mice in the original. Also,
there's more reasoning of why Cinderella wants to go to the ball and
why the prince wants her. He met her in the forest and admires her
because of what she says, like, "Just because it's done doesn't mean it
should be done." Speaking of the prince, he has a nickname or actual
name, so his first name isn't, "Prince." Cinderella's dress
transformation is much longer, more beautiful, and grander. Whatever
magic would look like, this is it. You see transformations, and they
are not seeing what the item is, cloud of smoke or magic, seeing what
the item becomes. You see its transformation. The stepmother has much
more motivation and reasoning. We get to see Cinderella's mother and
hear the words she tells Cinderella, or just Ella, at the time-- "Have
courage, and be kind." The words are a bit weak, but Cinderella isn't.
She eventually shouts at her cruel stepmother, and we see her strength
and bravery that was veiled under her kindness in the 1950 movie for 65
years. There is also a way Ella ends up as "Cinderella."Actors and acting: Cate Blanchett was perfect for the stepmother Lady
Tremaine. Her eyes look cold, and I can't see how she is an actor. She
puts so many different things into the stepmother--vain, hate,
jealousy, worry, fake smile, and more. Again, I can't see her as Cate
Blanchett. All I see is the stepmother. Lily James was perfect for
Cinderella. She doesn't look exactly like the cartoon, but no one can.
The stepsisters were obnoxious, meaning the actors did a great job. The
prince had much more character and didn't seem bland or blank. He has a
sense of humor and happiness, yet reacts to things that go wrong. He
even cries at one point and makes me want to as well. There is a bad
guy on the good guy's side, and he drives me nuts, meaning the actor
stayed in character.Appearances: Cinderella's waist seems incredibly thin, which isn't a
good idea for girls and teenagers to see, but the actor Lily James is
wearing a corset, and it's also about comparison to the part of the
dress on her shoulders. The prince isn't called Prince Charming, but he
is still quite charming. We have a new African-American character and
Asian people in the background, but I don't see why we couldn't have
had more, or major characters being a different race than the cartoon.
The magic looks real, not just some glitter. The mice almost look like
real mice. It is not as good as the live-action Jungle Book, in which I
was asking myself, "Is that really CGI?"Songs: There is only one song and its reprise. We do not have any of
the songs from the original, and Lily James is a soprano, meaning a
high singer. Cinderella was an alto, a singer on the lower side, in the
original. Lily James's voice is beautiful and makes me want to sing,
too. Romance: The two fall in love pretty quickly, which is possible to
happen in the real world, but not too quickly, which I like. Cinderella
actually talks to the prince and has a good bit of time with him before
she leaves the ball. In the animated version, besides singing, the
first word she said to him was, "Oh!" and then she said she had to go
and see the prince. Here, Cinderella and the prince get to know each
other much more. There is a wedding at the end, and that is when they
kiss. It's not long, and they're married, which I like.The live-action Cinderella is amazing and better than the original.
Even a friend of mine who loved the original all her life found it
better. If you didn't like the cartoon, give this a try, or if you
haven't seen this at all, watch it. It's worth watching again and truly
an incredible story.
