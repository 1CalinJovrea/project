Writers are under-aged morons who have no clue about comedy

When will Hollywood comedies of this decade hire writers who at least
have a clue of comedy? Why hire immature morons who think the idea of a
dick is funny and can replace a good script. Hollywood seems to be
obsessed with male nudity and full frontal at that in this decade.If it
is in the right context it could be funny but haven't seen one this
decade. What happened to the writers of 40-year old virgin,knocked
up,etc? This movie is a pathetic excuse for a comedy and is
particularly sad since there was an opening for a new franchise which
has been firmly grounded. Avoid if you are lucky and watch 'Central
Intelligence' if you want to see the Rock in a good comedy!
