I've waited for this movie since childhood

"The Legend of Tarzan" is joyous.Since childhood, this is the Tarzan I've wanted to see on screen,
faithful in spirit to the Burroughs novels. The jungle is raw. The
dangers are "real." The villains are badder than bad. The historical
period may not fully satisfy the Tarzan chronologists, but it's close
enough and serves the exciting story it wants to tell. The gorillas are
gorillas-plus (mangani). We even get a glimpse of the gates of Opar.But most important, the portrayals of Tarzan and Jane are spot-on. You
believe this couple from start to finish.Is the movie perfect? Probably not, but it comes so damn close that I
don't care.
