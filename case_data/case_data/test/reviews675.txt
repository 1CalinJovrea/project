SPOILER ALERT! If you have not seen the original (which I pray that you do) or you want to see the remake then DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!!!

With that being said let's get to the point.There is a MAJOR lack of character and plot development in this movie.
Major lack of attention to details. Much of the plot is left out.The majority of the plot rested on Joe Doucett in the beginning to make
sure everyone knows he is a jerk. Where the original allowed you to
actually feel sorry for the main Character, Dae Su this remake does not
allow for this. The main character Joe Doucett is an alcoholic bumbling
buffoon of a man that does not even have decent street smarts. He
manages to get out of the prison and out into the world, But you do not
want him to win, you do not like him he is a JERK. This was a major
mistake in my opinion. You can't go into the movie hoping the
protagonist drops dead.You don't get to the imprisonment until about minutes into the movie.
Then you get Josh Brolin's naked booty forced into your face (no it
wasn't pretty), and watch him work out for minutes. The infamous fight
scene that everyone loves in the original is badly hacked in the
remake. Choreography was TERRIBLE, You watch certain people swinging at
the air with a bat for 2 minutes before finally getting hit.Also The Antagonist in the original was shown as suave, cool, calm ,
collected. Very smart and VERY calculating. From the hypnosis to the
bug in the shoes, he was everywhere at once and you knew by the end
that everything that everyone else did just played into his crafty
little hands. In this remake the antagonist comes off as a High Society
sniveling snob, who is getting back at Mr. Doucett because his family
was ruined.Now for the kicker. In the original the major twist is prolonged at the
end. Giving it major emphasis to the point of Dae Su crawling on the
ground barking, and begging to be Woo Jin's bitch In the remake they
tried to make it a little more twisted. But the delivery was almost
comical while the Antagonist, Adrian sniveled about his "Happy family
being ruined" The ending is very short and much left to be desired.
While the original left you in doubt in the end wondering if Dea su
actually still remembers, this remake takes the easy way out.This movie falls WAY short of the original for what I feel is one main
reason. The small details. Where the original took time out to tell you
things (IE the gas, the School mascot, etc) This remake fails to do any
of that hoping that you will catch on. But it was that attention to
detail that made the original the classic that it is.At the end of it all I give this movie a 3 out of 10. Unlike other
remakes of recent days this movie can't stand up as a remake or on it's
own. It is mediocre at best. Wait for it to hit VHS before watching it.
