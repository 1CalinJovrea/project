Life Of Pi = Best (Art + Story Telling + VFX)

According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different
forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against
such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By
maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that
God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good.
That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time
in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to
watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book
of same title.Piscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his
dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born
Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins
to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity
and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of
relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on
a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing
the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And
so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening
feline animal begins.There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger
gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to
produce the Tiger didn't go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the
way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes
are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape
changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day
father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love
between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they
may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his
introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny
characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at
sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger
alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately
yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words
those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work
is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with
special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself
devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does
lighten up the few still scenes between the two.Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his
efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some
tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as
well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with
the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and
dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb
with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors
contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real
salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful
pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema,
he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile
director in my book.The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him
that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that
amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in
a single movie. Who would want to miss that??
