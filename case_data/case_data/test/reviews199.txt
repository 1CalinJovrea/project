A Masterpiece

I saw this movie a couple of times already and it still lingers in my
head everyday. The tone and imagery of this film crawled inside me and
nestled itself in my mind like no other had in a long time.The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition)
created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch
watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare. This was
the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every
aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas
with striking confidence.Calling this movie scary doesn't due justice to how truly powerful and
intense the horror scenes feel. He doesn't hold back, shy away with the
camera or use bullshit jump-scares to frighten you. Rather he composes
scenes like an artist would a painting. In fact, I would almost say
this film could be seen as a Fransisco Goya painting brought to life.
He focuses in on the evil at hand, while still maintaining a sense of
unknown and wonder. He is brilliant at what he shows you, but more in
what he doesn't show.Films like these don't come around very often. There is true passion
seen here by a very hungry, driven and intelligent director. I am truly
impressed and hope he has a long and successful career.
