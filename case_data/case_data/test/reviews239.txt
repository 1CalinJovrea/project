Feels like the movie I was born to watch

Every once in a while, you can witness something that hits you at your
very core. I've felt this very few times in my film loving career. I
gazed in awe at the sight of dinosaurs in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic
Park, marveled witnessing the birth of the universe in Terrence
Malick's The Tree of Life, and now, I sit in sheer admiration and
respect at the magic that is Richard Linklater's Boyhood. Nothing you
have read, heard, or seen about the film will prepare you for the
experience that is this cinematic rarity. Filmed over twelve years,
Boyhood tells the story of Mason, who we follow from ages 5 to 18. Starring Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and Lorelei
Linklater, Boyhood assembles the finest cast of 2014 so far. Each
player, dedicating themselves to the greater cause, allows themselves
to evolve. Fully realized, and oozed with every rich element of movie
making, Linklater writes the most authentic characters to grace the
screens in years. Ready for more hyperbolic thoughts? Doesn't make it
less true but get ready. Boyhood, potentially, could be one of the best
films ever made. Last year, I referred to his third installment of the
Before series, "a masterpiece." I stand by that even today. Boyhood
however, is something that is a once in a lifetime endeavor that will
be studied, criticized, admired, and bring all the discussions about
film to the forefront. I feel blessed just to have watched it.Ellar Coltrane is simply stupendous. As you watch his transformation
before your eyes, his subtle and restrained performance will floor you,
scene after scene, year after year. It's astounding how Coltrane
interprets young Mason as a boy, bringing him through adolescence with
grace, and then fully realizes what kind of man he has become. There's
an intimacy in which Coltrane decides to finesse Mason upon the
audience. He thoroughly cares about him, understanding his confusions,
and even more, realizing his flaws. It's one of the year's most
outstanding performances and one of the best delivered by any child
actor.Ethan Hawke continues to be one of the more undervalued and
underutilized actors working today. Though he has three Oscar
nominations to his name, two for co-writing Before Sunset and Before
Midnight, and one for Best Supporting Actor in Antoine Fuqua's Training
Day, I'm still unsure about how Hollywood and the world perceives his
abilities. As Mason's Dad, Hawke takes his character to the brink of
sheer brilliance. Showcasing an unrestrained and eager willingness to
connect with his children, Dad, as he's only called in the film, is a
sensational and intriguing look into fatherhood and being human.
Chasing the dreams, and believing you are destined for something
greater, Dad allows the audience to relish in his quest to be connected
and complacent. Hawke shines once again, involving both mind and
spirit, into a man we may know all too well.As Mom, Patricia Arquette ignites the spirit in a performance that
should land her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
Headlining a career that has produced impressive work on TV's "Medium,"
as well as in films like True Romance, Arquette's prowess is her
ability to be a fallen character without requiring pity or persuasion
from the viewer. She interprets a woman, desperate for a connection to
other aspects of her life, and reinvents the foundation of the broken
mother. Arquette's beautiful yet exhilarating turn often feels like
riding on the edge of a cliff, unsure if we're going in, but even more
excited just to be on the ride with her. Pure and raw talent exists in
her, and it's been worth the wait to finally witness it all unravel.Richard Linklater casts his daughter Lorelei Linklater to play
Samantha, Mason's older sister. Without even realizing or thinking
about it, you secretly and solemnly fall in love with her
transformation from girl to woman. She is every bit as brilliant as any
person in the cast, delivering on all beats, allowing her awkward yet
sweet demeanor to pierce through yet not forgetting her annoyance and
overbearing nature in which she came. Honestly, it's a performance
destined to be forgotten during the awards year but it's something I
will recall for years to come.There are other supporting players that we meet throughout the journey
particularly Marco Perella and Zoe Graham, who completely make their
mark during the picture.Running at 165 minutes, this dramatic, coming-of-age epic had me just
yearning for more. I wanted to stay with them, see their journeys
continue, and just relish in this dream a bit longer. I walked out
secretly (or not so secretly) wishing that Linklater is quietly filming
these same characters for the next twelve years, and will not reveal
the plans until it's all finished. Talk about the surprise of my life.
At 42 years old when and if that happens, I will be excited for the
ride. Shot gorgeously by Lee Daniel and Shane F. Kelly, and edited with
clarity and love by Sandra Adair, Boyhood succeeds as a technical
marvel just as much as a narrative and performance piece. Linklater's
writing, on virtually every level, is the best thing since Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Originality, and taking a fresh
perspective on a genre that could feel stale for some, Linklater will
make you a believer again. His direction is even more impressive. It's
the single best thing that he's ever done and probably ever will do.
It's the pinnacle of his career, and is his offering to cinema for
all-time.In essence, Linklater's Boyhood is a must-see film for any lover of the
movies. It's the type of film that was imagined when they invented
film. With tears in my eyes, I marveled and wept for a creation I still
may not fully understand but am anxiously waiting to revisit very soon.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)
