Nonsense - waste of time.

Little to say that hasn't been said but wanted to comment as this film
is just so disappointing. It failed for me (and those viewing with me)
at every level ... far too slow in many scenes nearly sent me to sleep
... metaphysically absurd (Spirited Away from Ghibli was much more
interesting)... I do like Affleck but will someone please remind him
that this medium is audio-visual, we need to be able to hear what is
said. I'm tired of him mumbling (about the only time is almost made
sense was in Manchester by the Sea). If you like good films then avoid
this one, it has virtually nothing to redeem it.
