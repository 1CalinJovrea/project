Shyamalan Is Back!

Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense'
followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After
that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The
Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the
worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a
decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally
positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the
troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities
inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from
Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't
tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his
best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the
reasons to watch this movie. The clich√© points in the movie are
watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition
from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to
other personalities are amazingLast but not the least, is the traditional "Shyamalan Twist". Trust me,
this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion.
This twist doesn't match up to the "The Sixth Sense" one but it's a
thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in "Signs". I won't
forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out "WHAAAAT?!"."Split" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a
"horror" tag. A "psychological thriller" sounds better. Nevertheless,
this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just
for James McAvoyWelcome back, M.Night Shyamalan
