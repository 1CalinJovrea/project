Absolutely gripping short stories

Being a horror and thriller fan, this movie was very interesting.Stories of revenge one after the other will keep you on the edge of
your seat! And the stories told are short. Filled with suspense. You
will not know what is going to happen next. And the stories will seem
so real. Stories of day to day anger and real life occurrences. The actors are
very convincing in their roles. Pace of the short stories is very
gripping.Some of the shots captured are amazing. Overall very thrilling! And a
must watch!
