Poor

Well what can I say, Olympus has fallen is much better. In one day a
dad can go from being a loser to a complete hero! It's a shame to see
good actors with such a poor storyline, full of so many holes. At one
point we did wonder if it was a spoof comedy as we did laugh in quite a
few places. By the end we just wanted it to stop, stop god please
stop!!!!If these people were in charge in real life you really wouldn't sleep
at night.Thank god for the flag twirling at the end, oh and the watch that saved
the president. How lucky....
