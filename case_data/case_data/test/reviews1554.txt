A Sad, Ambiguous Story Lacking Closure

A friend of mine had a sister go missing in the 1980's, in central
British Columbia, Canada. I remember being quite young, but it made the
local news, and we put posters up on telephone poles. She returned a
few days later, after staying with an older boyfriend, and she claimed
she was upset at her parents so she ran away. I remember it really
taking a toll on my friend's family, and it tore them apart. I can only
look back on it through my childhood memories, but as an adult I began
to understand their frustration with her and the danger that she posed
to herself.Strangerland introduces us to one such family, living somewhere in the
Australian Outback. Joseph Fiennes and Nicole Kidman join together in
this film about an extremely fractured family struggling through one of
the most traumatic events a family can go through. The movie has a
somewhat slow pace, and lacks a sense of dramatic urgency one would
expect in a situation like this, however it does an excellent job of
showing how this family goes through different stages of grief. I found
most of the drama perhaps too focused on their dysfunctional little
family and characters were a bit to one dimensional at times. There are
of course some relatively boring moments in this film, but I certainly
liked the story. The one thing that was really out of place here was a
strange sexual undertone from Nicole Kidman's character, which in my
opinion was rather detracting from the overall plot. Nymphomania didn't
really seem like an idea that would cause all of this to happen.Perhaps the director was too focused on this sexual theme, that at
times it really took away from the terror a situation like this
instills on a family. I think any family who has to go through this
situation must have different horror stories that they must go through
themselves. It's a sad and sickening thing to have to ever happen, and
the grief must be unbearable at times, and as time goes on, many
families never truly get the closure they need as the days become
months and months become years. A similar theme to the movie Prisoners (2013), but a much slower and
perhaps boring story for some, yet it does make you think about how
families must cope in situations when a child goes missing.5/10
