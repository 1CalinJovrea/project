Another Cookie Cutter Heist Film

Once again I'm not really all that sure why I saw this because even
though it is a heist movie, it pretty much follows the cookie cutter
script that seems to be the standard for heist movies. In fact I saw
another heist movie earlier this year that was almost identical except
that the main characters were pensioners who had been diddled out of
their retirement as opposed to a bunch of hicks whose injuries have
resulted them being left on the scrap heap, and when I say almost
identical I actually mean literally scene for scene.Okay, I was going to say word for word, but that doesn't really work
considering the previous film was set in a major city (New York I
think) where as this is set in Charlotteville, North Carolina. Okay,
they also have a prison break, and they robbed a speedway as opposed to
a bank, but the way the film progressed, especially with the police
investigating it and then coming up empty, and the protagonists
(anti-heroes if you will), getting away with it. Mind you, it was
pretty clever what they did, and how they covered their tracks, but the
funny thing is that these guys didn't actually come across all that
smart. Also, there were some pretty cool laugh-out-loud moments, at
least for me.One of the things that did stand out was the setting  Charlotteville,
and it was rather ironic that the whole protests occurred the week or
so before I saw this film because it really gave me an idea of what the
culture is like down there  very working class. In a way it created a
picture of a region of the United States that had been ravaged by
globalisation, and a world where if you are injured then nobody wants
to touch you, or hire you. In fact our hero was basically told that he
could no longer work because he had a pre-existing injury, which was
the catalyst for the whole heist.While I would suggest that it was a fun movie, the reality is that
there wasn't really all that much different here than the film that I
saw earlier in the year (Going in Style). Sure, the setting was
slightly different, and the way they went about committing the heist
was different, but in the end it seems like it simply came out of a
cloning factory and really had little to no substance, or thought, to
actually making it an individual film (except for a couple of really
cool jokes that is).
