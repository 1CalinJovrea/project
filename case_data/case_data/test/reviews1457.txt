Review Â– Hush (2016)

'Hush' is a fast-paced modern slasher flick with a twisted take on the
genre. Well, the twist here is that the lead protagonist is deaf and
mute from her teens and the director-writer combo of Mike Flanagan and
Kate Siegel (who also happen to be husband-wife in real life), places
this character in a stuck-up situation where a killer is on the prowl
and all odds are stacked against her. Questions start piling up but a
good thirty minutes into the film, the viewer is given enough leads to
estimate where the film is headed.A film such as this, where the entire scenario revolves around a
minimalist location, one feels inclined to applaud director Flanagan's
knack for not making the film look like yet another typical
home-invasion flick. The protagonist Maddie's inability to speak or
hear is put to good effect in the screenplay. I won't spoil those
brilliantly written and choreographed scenes in this review, because
that is exactly what puts this flick a few notches above the rest in
the genre. Equally inventive and enthralling are those scenes where
Maddie's imaginative capability is put to test.The cast (that comprises of just four characters, out of which the film
revolves majorly around two!) is adequate as well, and lends ample
support to the overall mainstay of the flick. Flanagan's directorial
skills, which looked rather unimpressive in Absentia (2011), after
which he made a notable Oculus (2013), has considerably improved over
the years, all the while sticking to modest production expenditure.
Aided in writing by his wife Kate Siegel, the couple seem poised to
astonish us yet again this year in the sequel to the strictly sub- par
Ouija (2014).Hush is a pleasant surprise amongst the shitload of low-budget slasher
garbage that is handed out to us every now and then. It is by all means
worth a watch for thriller buffs.
