Romance Between Two Damaged People

Rust and Bone a.k.a De rouille et d'os in French is a French-Belgian
romantic drama film that stars Marion Cotillard and Matthias
Schoenaerts. The screenplay is based on Craig Davidson's short story
collection with the same title. It tells the story of an unemployed 25-
year-old man who falls in love with a disabled killer whale trainer.
Jacques Audiard directs.The story starts out with an improbable tragedy. Orca whale trainer
Stéphanie has an accident at a tawdry seaside aquarium that leads to
the double amputation of her legs. Ali arrives at his sister's house in
the same ramshackle Mediterranean town of Antibes with his 5-year-old
son in tow.Ali's broke, aimless, ill-equipped to tend to son Sam.
Stéphanie and Ali first meet before the accident at a nightclub where
he has taken a job as a bouncer. She has a boyfriend. He is tough,
bruising, confident in his skin and in the sack. He gives her his
number. After her trauma, Stéphanie calls and they enter into a
relationship.Whatever digital trickery is used to strip Cotillard of her legs, it's
so beautifully and simply done that we soon stop thinking of her
amputee status as a special effect and accept it as a simple physical
truth. When things do get sexual between Ali and Stéphanie, their love
scenes together are frequent, naked, graphic, and sizzling hot. It's
easy to believe that these two very different peoplean educated animal
trainer and a barely verbal meathead  share a powerful connection at
the level of their bodies, a bond that they need more than they
understand it. Not every viewer will be seduced by Rust and Bone's style, which might
be classified as romantic naturalism. There's plenty of roving,
intimate hand-held camera in the style of the Dardenne brothers but the
movie's tone couldn't be farther from Dardennes' emotional austerity.
Audiard is partial to long poetic montages of light on water, copious
lens flares, and the pull-out-the-stops manipulative power of American
pop music. A short scene of Stéphanie rocking out alone in her
wheelchair to the sound of the B-52s' "Love Shack" tells us everything
we need to know about the mojo she's slowly recovering. And a later
scene, in which Stéphanie returns alone to Marineland to re-encounter
the orcas who deprived her of her legs, must surely represent the most
exhilarating narrative use to which Katy Perry's "Firework" has ever
been put.Looking back at the movie,you may feel surprise, even shame, that you
managed to care so much about this none-too-original story of two
damaged people whose unexpected connection helps them each find their
way out of a bad place in their lives. But it is a movie about letting
go of shame and making way for the advent of pleasure.
