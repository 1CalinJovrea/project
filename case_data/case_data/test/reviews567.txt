IMDb has failed me.

For as long as I could remember this website was a beacon of light
guiding me throughout a vast ocean of bad movies, actors and directors.
Tonight, i feel disappointed. This picture was SO AWFUL I don't know
even where to begin. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE that it has 8.0+ score? Gal Gadot is beautiful, sexy and physically looks like Diana Prince,
but she's not an actress. Well, at least not for a character with this
depth. I actually felt sorry for Chris Pine, which is the only
salvageable thing in this 2h20min disaster. The movie has zero continuity, it's so bad written it makes you wonder
how these guys ever got into a position to have had the chance to write
something like this. It seems as an 11 year old could have written it
on the car ride before school.I don't want even get started on the details, because everything major
on this was wrong. From now on, I'm not sure how I'll trust IMDb again.
