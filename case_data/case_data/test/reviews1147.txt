2:22 is a movie about a man who has a premonition. He then tries to understand this following a series of patterns. Doesn't sound so terrible, right?

2:22,that's as much as you should see about this movie. Or well, if
you're expecting some dump plot that might entertain a few people, then
watch it, but i can assure you, there's nothing memorable about this
film.The acting wasn't particularly good, the script was simple and
predictable, the direction was flat... This is one of those movies that
yes, may have the money and resources to make a good project, but just
lacks a soul. Let's forget all the things i said before about acting,
direction and script, let's just talk about how i felt while watching
the film. Did it make me fell...excited? No!, sad? No!, happy? No!, and
i could continue but i guess you got my point. The only thing i felt
was getting bored and regretting the money i paid in the theater.PS: Dario, just stay with Danny, she has 3 dragons.
