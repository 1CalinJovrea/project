The Legend is really Tom Hardy

I read The Profession Of Violence by John Pearson some years ago which
this film is based on - and wanted to see a movie about the Krays - I
watched The Krays with the Kemp brothers and despite many an accolade
bestowed thought it was just an average film - so armed with that I
approached Legend with some anticipation. Growing up in rural Britain
my film hero's were like many of us Deniro,Pacino,Walken etc - Never
had a real British film star I was amazed at until Tom Hardy came on
the scene - so after watching Lawless ,The Drop and The Revenant was
extremely proud of having a British actor that in my mind measured up
to said heavyweights! Legend is a true representation not only of the
book but of the Krays story - yes there were some comedic moments in
the film with Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie - but they captured the real
essence of Ronnie's mistrust and paranoia. The supporting actors are
brilliantly cast and noteworthy performances by Emily Browning
,Christopher Eccleston and the very brilliant David Thewlis - not to
mention a great cameo by Chazz Palminteri make this a must see film. I
would have given this a 10 but waiting for Hardy's next film to do that
