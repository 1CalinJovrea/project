Modern spy movie with a lot of twists

If you like movies with a lot of twists and turns then you definitely
have to give this one a shot. Because if there is one thing that this
movie doesn't lack it's twists. At one point it wasn't easy to follow I
thought but at the end it all fits together and you get a clear view.
Unlocked is a modern spy movie with a lot of action so you don't have
time to get bored. The main character Alice Racine is played by Noomi
Rapace and she did a good job. As a CIA agent she gets caught in a web
of intrigues and betrayals. The rest of the cast with excellent actors
such as John Malkovich, Orlando Bloom, Michael Douglas and Toni
Collette only adds to the quality of the movie. You never have a dull
moment and the movie requires your full attention all the time.
Certainly worth watching if you like this kind of movies.
