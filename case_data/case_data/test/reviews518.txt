Home Alone.

After getting a check-up at the dentist (which I passed with flying
colours!) I felt like seeing a short & sweet flick. Finding her Legally
Blonde movies to be charmers,I got set to see Reese Witherspoon go home
again. The plot:Separated from her husband, Alice Kinney (whose dad was a film maker)
tries to balances work and raising her two kids. On a night out, Kinney
meets budding film makers George,Harry and Teddy on a night out,who she
invites round her place. The next day the guys reveal they have nowhere
to stay,which leads to Kinney letting them stay at her place and
starting a romance with Harry,that gets interrupted by her husband
unexpectedly coming home again.View on the film:Joined by the easy-going trio of Nat Wolff/Pico Alexander and Jon
Rudnitsky as Harry,Teddy and George, Michael Sheen gives the fluffy
tale a touch of gravitas as Kinney's worn-down husband Austen. Carrying
the breezy mood of the movie, Reese Witherspoon gives a sweet
performance as Kinney,with Witherspoon giving Kinney a strong
self-belief,and an ease with lightly comedic one-liners. Running at least 30 mins shorter than the Rom-Com epics her mum usually
makes,debuting writer/director Hallie Meyers-Shyer brings out some
interesting twists on the Rom-Com,from everyone being budding film
makers,to Kinney's toy-boy romance,and the surprisingly romance-free
ending. Whilst shot in a slick Rom-Com style by Shyer & cinematographer
Dean Cundey,the screenplay by Shyer oddly decides to leave out any hint
of conflict in the romance,as any disagreement or romantic feelings
anyone has is pushed away just five minutes later, as Kinney goes home
again.
