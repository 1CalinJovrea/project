Eerie, Creepy, but Not Quite Everything it Tries to Be

--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen
the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film,
it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Sometimes a movie tries to do a little too much, and Stoker is a great
example of such a film. I feel as if I am one of the few who while
watching this movie wasn't very impressed by anything it tries to do.
It's a story about a girl who grows up shying away from society and all
it's norms, and begins to become inspired more or less by her
charismatic, yet outwardly creepy uncle, who shows up to comfort her
mother after a tragic car accident takes her husbands life, who also
happens to be said uncle's brother. He in turn is infatuated with her.The obvious things about this film that should be creepy are as eerie
as can be without gore and disturbing imagery, but what keeps this from
being a good watch is more due to the ever widening gap between
blockbusters and indie films. These middle of the road films that try
to look big budget with modest financing all to often grant themselves
a campy and dated vibe, almost having a made for TV type gloss to their
finished product, and when this movie in particular chooses to be
stylized from time to time it often ends up looking amateur and even
clich√©. The flow of these stylized moments also lack good pacing as
they occur either in quick succession or disappears all together for
extended periods only to start showing up in troves again at a later
time. It's far more distracting than it could ever been seen as a means
to accentuate the film; and it makes things feel less serious and
organic.It's other weakness is in it's decision to favor the less than
plausible over sensibility and logic. One would assume for
entertainment reasons, yet it's a mystery to me how any entertainment
could be found most of the time during this film. Mia's character gives
a good hour run just buying into this mans insanity, only to pull a
complete 180 in the last fifteen minutes. It's also beyond hard to
believe that no one single authoritative figure could pieces together
how suspicious it is that her father just happens to die the exact same
day that he picks up this mentally ill uncle from an institution he was
committed to for something very similar in nature when he was growing
up. Don't people have to sign release forms and stuff at those places? It's almost as if is movie was written without a clear intent or a
consistent motive planned throughout, and in the end a jumbled up
puzzle of confusion and creepiness prevailed without any solid message.
It's clear why everyone's the way they are, yet their resolves, their
choices, and even their actions throughout the film feel forced from an
illogical world of ridiculousness, as if the only reality that exists
is within the perimeters of their house, a highway, and a restaurant
type place. When Nicole Kidman, who plays Mia's mother, begins to piece
everything together, why would she call the uncle she suspects of foul
play into the bedroom upstairs of all places? Again, in terms of logic,
it couldn't feel more like a sandbox film.Maybe if this film was deliberately shot low budget as a showcase of a
friendship between the uncle and niece that budded into a unique
understanding of one another through not accepting society and people,
it would've been a much more interesting movie, or even more so as a
period piece during the 1800s or something. But instead, it's a messy
blend of style and eerie atmosphere that lacks proper pacing and feels
very haphazardly put together. It tries to empathize with it's leads
and give reason for their madness, but instead it comes off as
relentlessly grim and faithless all too often, as it doesn't give much
of a chance to things like hope or even common sense as plausible tools
to pull a character through a situation. It paints a picture of the
introverted and angst-ridden individual as a kind of 'different' that
automatically rejects all basic human reactions to norms and
situations, like no one trait could exist without all the rest of an
assumed identity or label to be present, inevitably leading to the
worst. Case and point: **Biggest Spoiler** Mia's character ultimately becomes
her uncle in the end by taking his life and begins her pursuit of
freedom by following in his footsteps, which is all the more evident
that he understands this by smiling at her before she offs him. This
could've been a unique and creative film moment even if disturbing, but
instead the film's aforementioned grim and faithless interpretation of
introverts makes this an eye roller rather than an "Oh My God!" moment.
Fortunately, you will find some moments of resolve if you stick this
one out till the end; where you may go "yes! thank you!", but those
moments are short lived, as it's clear they only exist as a way make
sure in the end that more people enjoyed their experience watching this
than hated it. Color me jaded; I did't buy most of Stoker.Anyways, just to clarify, the subject matter and the story on a whole
had potential to tell decently disturbing tale, and the ideas on
display where not the worst, nor where they the ultimate problem. It's
depth just suffers serious sense and direction, and it's surface seems
like it would've been much more suited for a gritty horror film, or
even a lower budgeted blatant indie type art thriller more so than this
unfortunate throwback made-for-TV-meets-straight-to-DVD fare it tries
to pass off as something much more grandiose in the end.
