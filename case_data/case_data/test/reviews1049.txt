John Carter: Stunningly Effective

Hearing about this Disney film's story sparked my interest in seeing
this right away! I finally did and overall, the characters, the
setting, and the plot flowed seamlessly well together! It's like
Disney's formula of "Star Wars" and "Avatar" meets "Prince of Persia:
Sands of Time." So, the plot revolves around a Civil War veteran who is somehow
transported to Barsoom (aka Mars), where he must help a princess and a
colony succeed in a heated battle against another feuding colony.Director Andrew Stanton delivered well in this epic take of John
Carter. Sure, star Taylor Kitsch seems like he's trying a little too
hard as the lead guy, but it looks like he's heading toward the same
path left behind by Jake Gyllenhaal for "Prince of Persia": serious
character figure, yet sometimes able to show unintentional humor
usually without noticing. Though not bad on either one's part! Since John Carter was conceived as a story back in 1912 by Edgar Rice
Burroughs (of Tarzan fame), I have to say that this movie is certainly
NOT a rip-off. A film like this deserves more credit than initially
given! Epic action/adventure films like "Star Wars" and "Avatar"
wouldn't exist today without these early roots! It pretty much sparked
an influence on the sci-fi, action, adventure genre films that most
audiences came to know decades later.It looks like Stanton's following exactly what his fellow Pixar
colleague Brad Bird had done with Tom Cruise in "Mission Impossible:
Ghost Protocol," stepping up as director for once in live-action! Not
bad for their first time.
