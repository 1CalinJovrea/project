There are many legends about The Great Wall, this is one of them...

I just saw it in Romania in a good 3d cinema. The movie tells a legend.
And it tells it so beautifully! The cinematography is breathtaking and
for all the duration I was more than a movie spectator, I felt part of
that legend, a character from that story, present among the troops
defending the wall. If a movie succeeds in delivering such an
experience, the rest is not important anymore. In this point, I don t care anymore about plot holes or historical
inaccuracies, because I came to cinema to see a fantasy, a Chinese
legend with monsters and heroes. And there I was, in a war story, set
in a different world, filled with amazing elements of the old Chinese
culture, surrounded by exceptional warriors, beautiful landscapes and
bloodthirsty monsters. I am very saddened to see the negativity among
critics and public surrounding this movie. Complaining about historical
inaccuracies or being racist about the mix of races is so misplaced. I
hope people will go see it and ignore the bad criticism and prejudices
about it.
