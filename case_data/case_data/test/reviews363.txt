The ultimate so-what experience..

Stoker, a half baked thriller with overly lush visuals about the
infatuation of a young woman with killing and the sudden appearance of
an estranged uncle who apparently shares the same interest.Rather than being suspenseful, the film turned out to be a patchwork of
silly acting, awkward scripting, listless pacing and an
incomprehensible choice of narrative structure that is simply unsuited
for this kind of film. Someone ought to revisit and study the classics
and until such time, apply for a job in the food service industry. It is obvious from the get-go that the girl and her uncle are psychos,
so why limp around aimlessly for two hours getting a point across that
couldn't have been made more clear already 10 minutes into the film? Is having a plot too much to ask these days?3/10
