This is funny enough to have been called CARLY'S ANGELS!

I'll admit it. I went to this film expecting it to be a bigger flop
than KNIGHT AND DAY. But, man! Was I proved wrong.Cameron Diaz is perfectly believable as the modern WSF yuppie who has
it all. Looks; brains; a high-paying job; and a sexy boyfriend (played
by Nikolas Waldau) she's been dating for two straight months. But, when
Waldau blows off meeting her father (the still-versatile Don Johnson,
now playing the same type of lovably lecherous old codger James Gammon
played in NASH BRIDGES), she goes to spy on him. Thinking he's simply
being commitment-phobic.Imagine her surprise at meeting her boyfriend's cute-but-na√Øve
redheaded wife (played by Leslie Mann)! Followed by the two of them
meeting--and befriending--the buxom-yet-sensitive Kate Upton!I won't spoil the rest of the film for you, except to say that Ms. Mann
practically steals the show with her character's ditziness.* And, Ms.
Diaz still looks as good in a bikini as Ms. Upton! The latter is not
just eye-candy, however. She's very articulate. And, Waldau is almost
_too_ believable as the unfaithful con artist they now love to hate.Of course, I must confess that Ms. Diaz and Mr. Johnson are the only
two names I recognized in the opening cast credits. Ms. Upton, Ms.
Mann, and Mr. Waldau all being completely unknown to me! But, I sense
all that's going to change for these three in the very near future. So,
go see this film and suspend all disbelief. Because that's the best way
to shamelessly enjoy it...like I did.* "It rhymes with 'schlintercourse.' " Lol!
