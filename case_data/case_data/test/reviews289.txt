Appallingly dreadful film

If you're going to make a film about magic that at least pretends to
have some relationship to reality (e.g. involving the police and
Interpol), then why not try to make it very slightly credible? This was
mind- numbingly awful, totally unbelievable on every level and an
insult to the intelligence of everyone watching it. Total drivel. How
established stars like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (who usually
appear in good films) were persuaded to take part in this rubbish is
beyond me (although Ben Kingsley was recently in a worse one, so they
are not the only offenders). I don't mind suspending disbelief when
watching a science fiction or comic book based film, but not when
watching one which tries to pretend to even a bit of reality. Complete
garbage and a total waste of time.
