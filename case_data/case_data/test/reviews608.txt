Redmayne and Vikander Barely Keep it Alive

"The Danish Girl" is a beautiful package that came with plenty of
anticipation. It is the story of a pioneer, an opportunity to showcase
the talents of two talented performers, and had it been in the hands of
a more capable team, it would have reached heights that very special
films are able to attain.There's nothing wrong with the performances of the leads. In fact,
Redmayne might be even better than in his Oscar winning turn last year.
Vikander continues to show she's an acting powerhouse. Her range is
incredible, and she handles the drama and complexity of her role the
way more experienced actors could. She and Redmayne work very well
together, and it's a pity that even with all the other members of the
team, the director has managed to give us a film that is even more
frustrating than "The King's Speech". That film benefited from Firth
and Carter's chemistry. This time, the themes are darker and more
controversial, but they have been stiffled by the way an otherwise
gorgeous score is constantly blaring and drowning the emotional life of
the performances. Scene after scene we are "cued" to feel wonder, pity,
sympathy, or whatever emotion the musical score is supposed to signal.
It's a pity because if the music had not been there, the film would be
very powerful.Yet,it's not the only problem. The script seems scattered. Had it
followed a more streamlined and straightforward path, it would have
been better appreciated. Instead, the production relies too much on the
gorgeous photography, the exquisite outfits, the sensitivity of the
class these people belong to. Are they bohemians? Are they artists? Are
they really talented? They are supposed to be free-spirits, but they
certainly struggle with the different possibilities they encounter.Redmayne conveys the torture and confusion nature has presented him
with. He knows what he feels. Hopper makes sure we see him caressing
the fine fabrics, but he remains sensitive and rarely achieves
femininity the way those three actors were able to project in the farce
"Wong Foo". Redmayne is way too classy. Still, his eyes can show pain,
fear, and anxiety, and that certainly helps the film. One asset and a
problem is his mate. She's powerful, expressive, can deliver lines with
certainty and emotions. She shows loyalty, affection, love, lust, and
confusion and matches Redmayne in just about every frame. Vikander
steals the show.There's much that is important here, and its power is lessened by the
lack of confidence on the subject matter, and because we are constantly
distracted by the aesthetics, forgetting what really matters is the
bond, the souls, the hearts...I missed the rawness of dialogue like McLaine's in "Terms". Life is not
exquisite, is flawed, is full of pain and that makes the special
moments precious. This is a showcase for performers of all types, but
there is hardly any unity. It's that isolated masterpiece in the museum
that we are supposed to admire, but we can hardly gather any true
liking for it.
