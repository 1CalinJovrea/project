Well done

I was able to view an advanced screening of Saving Mr. Banks. I will
have to rate it as an excellent movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry
and it certainly brought back memories. I enjoyed it very much. The
film was on the most part incredibly true to era. I felt the
transitioning from one time period to the other was done smoothly and
poignantly. Obtaining the screen rights for the making of Mary Poppins
and the childhood of P.T. Travers are intricately woven. The entire
point of the movie could not have been made without this aspect. It was
brilliantly done. I see many Oscar nominations here. Tom Hanks was
outstanding as always as well as Emma Thompson. Colin Farrell was
remarkable. The interactions of all the characters was beyond well
done.
