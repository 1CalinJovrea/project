watching teenagers being abused

This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a
musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental
abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer
said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was
seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the
dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to
'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human
like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do
some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient
state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason
why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the
military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will
make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being.When it comes to music however it is impossible to achieve great
results with these methods. It can only lead to a soul- and heartless
disaster. A fitting result would have been an aggression build-up in
the main character which would have prevented him from ever playing
anything worth listening to again. This reaction has been seen in other
movies where usually the people that are socially connected to the main
character will have to suffer from the violent state of mind that this
mistreatment is causing. The other possibility is a simple resignation,
either by quitting music or by quitting life.But what is displayed here is wrong on many levels, because it tells
you that this abuse leads to something beautiful. That it is all worth
it because it pushes you to your limits and then you will be a great
musician. Whoever made up this story is either suffering from a severe
psychosis or has the intent to justify abusive methods in education by
presenting them as effective.If you treat people with violence they will get violent too. Either
towards others or towards themselves. This is the only result you will
achieve. And in this case it would also completely destroy the main
character's ability to be a musician. Music is not the military. You do
need discipline and training, but this comes from mental strength. And
you do not get stronger by being abused. It will only weaken you.It makes me sad seeing that apparently this movie is entertaining to
people. This can only be the case if they do not see the utter failure
in judgment that is presented here. And if they do not see it then they
are blind in a way that is worrying.
