Beautiful

I have already read the book, so I decided to most definitely see the
movie. I think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation,
because they didn't change too much from the book. The movie was
beautifully made, and fit just what I and others who have read it in my
city had pictured for the movie.The casting was brilliant, as with the portrayal of Louisa and Will.
Both characters were charismatic, and enjoyable, and matched the
dialogue of the book, which I thought was great.The movie itself was heartbreaking, hilarious at points, and just and
lovable. The story itself is well thought out and great. One of the
best things about this, is it is not just your usual love story. The
real love doesn't take over the whole plot. It isn't fully made to feel
intimate, but just to feel real.So I say: Go see it. If you are a boy or girl, it doesn't matter. This
movie is memorable for everyone.
