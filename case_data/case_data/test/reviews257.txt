Predictable Drivel

Somebody needs to tell Tyler Perry his one-trick pony (a/k/a Madea) has
been beaten to death. Boo! A Madea Halloween is a perfect example. The same recycled,
hackneyed, one-note, shallow, and unfunny situations are present
again--complete with the same people. At least this one wasn't about
some beaten down black woman/girl who needed to find her place in the
world, stand up to her man, and ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz. It is mind boggling
how he can pop out these POS and always manage to attract an audience.
Madea's answer to everything is violence. If that is not bad enough,
Perry is now blatantly stealing comedic material from DEAD people, i.e.
the line "beat her till the white meat shows" is a line straight out of
the late Bernie Mac's "Kings of Comedy" routine. Shameful. And if he
thinks for a minute that I believe anybody could go to a frat party and
NOT find drugs, liquor, or copulation, well, he is a fool.Rated PG-13. I would rather watch a cow scratch its ass on a fence than
another installment of this crap.
