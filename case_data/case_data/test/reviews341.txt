Did the producers of "Gravity" pay for glowing reviews?

When I saw the film in IMAX, the reviews on here were 98% positive.
Hmmm...Six things in honor of my six score:1. I should say from the get-go that I'm a product of the 80's, so I
have a different impression of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney than
most people. To me, Sandra Bullock is a clumsy and silly lady who can
occasionally drive a bus at high speeds. And George Clooney is that guy
from "Facts of Life". They can act in other films, but some early work
set their images in my mind. Sandra was a medical engineer? I think
not. Why not Rachael Weisz or Tilda Swinton? How about Cate Blanchett?
And for the guy, how about someone who seems like he can focus for
longer than a minute or two? 2. The cinematography is wonderful, and it does get very suspenseful. I
found myself holding my breath at times.3. It goes from dead silence to eardrum-piercing in 2 seconds flat
throughout the movie.4. They spent over four years on this movie, and yet some things seemed
incredulous. George was supposed to know so much about motion and
gravitational pull, but couldn't be bothered to take of his backpack
(or anything) and propel himself backwards towards Sandra even though
he was at a dead stop. He didn't even attempt to use the propulsion to
show that it was out.5. The Chinese craft was already heading toward earth...how?6. They kept banging into things very hard. This never seemed to
modulate. Wouldn't somewhat smart people begin to learn to lessen the
propulsion? Or did the guy who figured out that special effect go
overboard in his demands for scenes? When Sandra would open a door to
the crafts, she'd be thrown very hard against the side of the craft,
and yet at no time did she let go...couldn't she have attached herself
and then get thrown beyond the door and have to pull herself back? It
just got repetitive and ridiculous.But it's still a 6!
