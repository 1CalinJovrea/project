If you watch this movie then you'd... Better Watch Out

It was fairly predictable at first then goes down a very dark hole. The
first half of the movie was well done and entertaining. Then the rest
just goes downhill from there on. The main character is so insufferable
that you want nothing more than for the movie to end. I kept on looking
at the time and hoping that it would speed up so that I could watch
something else. I suppose that I was disappointed with this movie
because I was expecting a comedy/horror and what I got was a horror and
a sense of creepiness.I see no humour in watching a 12-year-old drink, bully and try to
"roofie" a teenaged girl, attempt to get to "second base" by tying her
up and killing half a dozen people. I watched nothing funny throughout
the whole movie. So if you watch this movie then...you'd better watch
out.
