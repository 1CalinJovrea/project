It isn't what you think--superbly acted and directed

Side Effects (2013)Tightly scripted, superbly cast and acted, well-crafted movie all
around. This is in a conventional story-telling style but the details
are so finely tuned it's a pleasure, and a suspense, all through.I'm not sure who gets more credit, Jude Law in his role as Dr. Banks, a
truly well-meaning psychiatrist or Rooney Mara as Emily, the patient
(in various stages, and not always so well-meaning). Both are brilliant
and believable. You half expect them to click romantically, but that
you'll have to see about.The plot, at first, has to do with Emily dealing with her husband
getting out of jail (he was in for insider trading). Then with her
depression coping with it all. Then with the pills she's taking for
same. Then with the apparent side effects of the medication, which loom
as a whole new horror story.And that's just the beginning. There are surprises (one of them hinted
at in the opening scene) and then further and further twists. The plot
threatens to get overly sensational but somehow keeps itself in check.
So the movie becomes increasingly a thriller with its feet on the
ground. Always interesting.Director Steven Soderbergh is a true artist movie maker. And you can
feel things finely tuned and in control here. He has never been the
kind of auteur as the famous greats like Coppola or Kubrick or more
recently even Nolan (whatever the excesses of the latter). But within
the conventions of conventional movies, he usually makes really
watchable, polished, and visually beautiful movies. That's very true
here.
