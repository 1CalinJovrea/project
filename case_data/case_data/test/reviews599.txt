One of the Best Movies I've Seen in a While

Rise of the Guardians is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a
while, besides seeing Wreck It Ralph last weekend (also a must see
movie for a blast-to-the-past) I loved this movie, cried during most of
Jack's story, I know the feeling of being alone and feeling like I'm
invisible/under appreciated/ignored/looked down upon. I would defiantly
recommend it to any age, it gives you a total blast to the past of
being a kid by bringing together all of the childhood hopes and dreams
you had before they were crushed. The animations was excellent, the
storyline was so sweet, and I can not wait to hear if there is going to
be a second movie or not.
