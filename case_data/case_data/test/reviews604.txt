I don't think I've seen another movie that induced as many eye rolls.

I am actually the target audience for this movie- a teenage girl. If I
Stay is about Mia Hall- the one sided protagonist- who gets into a car
accident and must decide during an out of body experience if she wants
to live or die. Mia is supposed to be "quirky" and "loveable" but I
hated her. There are only three things she likes. 1. Cello. 2.
Classical music. 3. Adam. As if there weren't enough "I love him so
much I'd waste away without him" movies already. Speaking of Adam, he was a manipulative douche bag and I feel sorry for
any teenage girl who takes him as an example of a good boyfriend.
Apparently, if you kiss your girl and break into her house enough, that
makes it OK for you to get mad at her for making her own decisions
about her own future without consulting you, which is actually a huge
red flag. One major plot point that didn't make any sense was that Mia liked
classical music while Adam and her family liked rock. According to If I
Stay, people can't like more than one genre of music, and if they like
one different than someone else, it's gonna be real hard for them to
get along.If I Stay is set in Portland, close to where I actually live. I can say
with complete certainty that Portland is a very diverse city, yet the
only POC I saw in this awful movie was the spiritual black woman
whispering advice to Mia's comatose body. The main characters could
have been a lot more varied, but apparently only white people are good
enough to make a movie about. Seriously... even the other members of
both Adam and Mr. Hall's band were white and they were barely even
seen. Speaking of diversity, when we find out the piano player in Willamette
Stone is a lesbian, it's only because Mia is jealous of her
relationship with Adam. Huge red flag. Her lesbianism is only used to
further the assumption that boys and girls can't be Just Friends. In the same sense, Mia's family is only killed off just so Adam can be
the one to motivate Mia to stay, because it's """true love""". Give me
a break. Don't give your money to this movie. You'd be better watching The Fault
in Our Stars and pretending the cancer is a car accident and imagining
the Anne Frank House as a boathouse.
