great creature feature!

Boy did I enjoy this film.forget plot and logic. This is an all out creature feature...It is
called Skull Island because that's where the action takes place with
all the neat creatures.There is a LOT of screen time devoted to Kong and the monsters. And
LOTS of cool death scenes. Pretty gory, in my opinion, and surprised
this got a pg-13. Some scenes would be very frightening for little
ones.Most surprisingly, it is the the acting of John Goodman and J.C. Riley
that stands out - even overshadowing tom Hiddleston. I am not a big fan
of Goodman or Riley, so this really surprised me.For the plot - people go to Skull Island. They encounter Kong and
various giant monsters. Mayhem and death ensues. Some return home. The
end.Doesn't sound like much but the monster scenes really made the movie,
and Kong was fantastic. They really had him move - he was almost like a
giant Hulk smashing those airplanes!Oh, and PLEASE stay after the credits. What was shown put a BIG smile
on my face... No spoilers.. you have to see it for yourself.My wife and I had a blast. The first 20 minutes were regrettably lame,
but the rest of the movie was a hoot.8 out of 10 for fun factor.
