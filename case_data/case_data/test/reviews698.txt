Plot Holes Galore

1. When Logan recovers from the atomic bomb blast, why does his hair
grow back perfectly styled?2. When he loses his healing ability and he extends his claws on the
train, then retracts them, why do his knuckles instantly heal?3. After Logan is shot several times in the chest, wouldn't the last
thing he would want to do is go chop apart a huge fallen tree? Wouldn't
his wounds open up and cause him to bleed to death?4. It is very convenient that is Prometheus there was an alien removal
machine and in Wolverine there was a color x-ray machine, but how could
Logan operate on himself and reach to his heart to get the parasite?
Beyond the fact that it would be awkward, beyond the fact that heart
surgeons have to crack apart the ribs and then use a rib spreader,
beyond the fact that his ribcage is saturated with adamantine, wouldn't
the pain have caused him to black out?5. If all Shingen had to do to get Logan's healing ability, wouldn't it
have been easier for him to have drilled into his claws when he had him
trapped in the chair, rather than building an adamantine transformer?6. If Professor X found the ability to reintegrate his molecules like
Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, why didn't he fix his spine so that he
didn't have to use the wheelchair anymore? And grow some hair on his
head? (eh, you even gotta wonder why in the 24th Century, Jon Luc
Picard never heard about Rogaine)7. If only part of Logan's adamantine claws were chopped off, why do
complete bone ones grow back? What happened to the partial metal ones?The movie was far too long on ninja fight scenes. I was beginning to
fall asleep. Sad that the bad guy turned out to be someone whose life
he saved. The Viper character was just creepy without any definable
reason for why he was even there.All in all, it was a waste of bad popcorn.
