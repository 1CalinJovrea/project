PLEASE Let This Be The Final One

So here we have it...the 6th Installment of the Wrong Turn film series,
and what an absolute stinker it is. In saying that, though, it's not
the worst movie in the series - that title belongs to the dreadful 5th
installment, but this 6th film comes pretty damn close to being just as
bad.In this one we have Danny, a young man who has mysteriously inherited a
small fortune and a resort by the name of Hobb Springs in West
Virginia, and accompanying him are his girlfriend, Toni, and a few of
his friends. When they get there, Danny can't really believe his luck,
but the more he and his friends look around the property, the more they
discover that all is definitely not what it seems.This has all the elements of a dire horror movie. Exceedingly thin
plot? Check. Plenty of nudity? Check. Sub-par acting? Check. If you are
looking for those three ingredients for a movie then you will enjoy
Wrong Turn 6.The story & plot of the movie were left wanting because, well, there
really wasn't one. I mean I knew not to expect an award-winning story,
but I was hoping that it would be better than the 5th. At least the
latter part came true...just. The thing is, the story actually takes
the series back to where it all started out with the 1st film...into
the backwoods of West Virginia. It wasn't in a town somewhere or a
mental asylum, and the movie did start off quite decently in all
honesty.About 20 minutes or so in, however, is when it just started to go
really downhill as it gradually got more ridiculous with one of the
main parts being how Danny so easily accepted who he was and his
family's history (if you watch the movie you'll see what I mean).Just as a side note: despite what some people say about this
installment as well, there is NOTHING to indicate that this is a
prequel to the 1st film. It is just a really horrendous sequel to the
previous installments.Do yourself a favour...skip this pile of trash.
