Formulaic Cheesefest

The trailer got me into the cinema and it wasn't even at the halfway
point that I realized I'd made a mistake. The premise is interesting. The outline seemed reminiscent of the dark
and clever Cube. Unfortunately this film is squarely aimed at the
younger, hunger games crowd. Pacing is terrible. There's endless exposition and pointless dialog
throughout. The characters are cookie cutter predictable. I feel like
we've had variations on this story 1000 times. Instead of using a
really interesting premise, the film went exactly where you'd expect.
Right down to spelling out the sequel for us in the final act. Uninspired garbage. It's the kind of film Christopher Nolan could turn
into a piece of art. It's a pity the writers and director turned this
film into derivative mediocrity.
