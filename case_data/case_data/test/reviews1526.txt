Could not find anything wrong with it.

I am 29 years old and it has been a long time since I have seen a
really good movie or at least I should say this kind of movie that does
not turn out cheesy and how you expect it to. This looked like a
Lifetime straight to TV movie when I saw the trailer and I won't lie
that is what attracted me because good thrillers do come along but you
gotta wait for them sometimes. What I liked most about this movie is
that it portrayed it'self as a low budget small studio film but while
your are watching it you can clearly see it's not a crappy low budget
film at all even though you may not see many fireworks. The director
does a good of trying to get inside your head for the entire movie to
the point where you just have to piece everything you watched together
before you can determine of the film you are watching is even
interesting. It seems the director easily keeps your focus with movie
by making your brain piece clues together to figure out what, where and
why things are happening. Great acting and great directing made this a
10 out of 10 for me. I am not going to spoil anything because I think
you will enjoy this movie and not only will you enjoy but it you will
be surprised at how much better this movie is than you thought it would
be.
