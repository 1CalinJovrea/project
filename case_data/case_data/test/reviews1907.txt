Back in the cage

Vin Diesel was vying to be the new 21st Century James Bond character as
extreme sports action star turned super agent Xander Cage. Despite the
success of the first film, Diesel skipped the sequel.The film begins with Gibbons (Jackson) trying to recruit footballer
Neymar to the xXx team when a descending satellite crashes on them.The Mcguffin is a high tech Pandora's Box that can control and crash
satellites orbiting the Earth. It has been stolen from the CIA office
by four highly skilled operatives led by Xiang (Donny Yen.)Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is sought out to retrieve the box and asked to
assemble his own crew. Cage finds out that Xiang also used to be part
of the xXx program and he stole the device to prevent its misuse.The plot is hackneyed and also rather daft. The film has enough
entertaining set pieces to give it momentum but you feel that with the
multi national and diverse cast that the producers were aiming for a
more inferior version of the Fast and Franchise type film and this is
what you get.
