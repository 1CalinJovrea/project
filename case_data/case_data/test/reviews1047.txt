There's still originality in Hollywood horror movies !!!? I'm scared !

This was one of the rarest horror movies that managed to keep me
totally scared and mostly uncomfortable from start to finish in years
and years. I don't get this new trend of hating everything Shiamalan
does. This new movie is one of the best horror concepts I've come
across in a very long time and uses simplicity to the best effect. I don't get what people these days expect an horror movie to be. If you
don't think this a good example of a simple concept that works like a
dream...or a nightmare, I don't get what passes for horror in Hollywood
no more. The idea for this movie is fantastic, and it's very well executed. I
really don't get why people complain that nothing happens in this
story. It's that type of simplicity that keeps the scary atmosphere
throughout the entire movie. This is not a cgi crap action so called
horror thing for teens, this is a classic old school horror, it's
filled with a creepy atmosphere and uses perfectly all the ideas for
each character to keep the viewer feeling uncomfortable all the time. There's a couple of good scares ,but most of the horror really happens
inside our minds. This is the best thing in this movie, it creates such
an atmosphere of tension with simple things that when something really
dramatic happens on screen we get ten times more startled and there's
no need for any cgi on this movie at all to scare teenagers and bore
the rest of us to death with the usual clich√©s. Not on this one.This is clearly an horror movie for adults, its not edited at two
hundred frames per second and it has a classic structure that simply is
not targeted at young audiences. This is an horror movie for horror
fans, it's not a popcorn movie for general audiences so ignore the bad
ratings on IMDb, because if you remember the good classic stuff from
the 70s like The Omen, The Changeling, or all those movies built on
atmosphere instead of action, this movie is for you.Absolutely brilliant. In my view the only thing that does not work is
the final sequence after the twist is revealed, simply because the
movie stops being a a story that creeps us out and becomes the usual
fight for your life action bit we've seen hundreds of times. But until
that happens this story is scary. Not because of what it shows but
because of what keeps making us expect it's going to happen next.Shyamalan is really back and this screenplay is the best thing he's
ever written since the sixth sense and unbreakable. Also the casting is
simply perfect with brilliant performances from everyone.True horror is back folks. Ignore the bad hype from the multiplex
popcorn crowd. This is a real gem that deserves to be among the very
best horror titles of recent years and it will creep you out if you
like your suspense atmospheric.
