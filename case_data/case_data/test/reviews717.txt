Commentary on Hollywood inaccuracies

Before it seems that my "review" seems one-sided and completely
negative, I want to emphasize it shouldn't take away from the
performances from the two lead actors. I think they have done an
excellent job overall.My major criticism centers around the continuing inaccuracies of
Hollywood and very simplistic portrayals of the complicated themes and
issues affecting the players during the 1980s and 1990s during the US
AIDS epidemic.I understand the target audience is not going to need to know accurate
history, certainly not in America, and also appreciate this is strictly
intended for entertainment. I just find it ironic that political
extremes always denounce propaganda while continuing to use it for
their own means. I found the script very poorly done and wholly
inaccurate with such severe bias after researching the real Ron
Woodroof.Conflicting information 1. Ron likely wasn't as extremely homophobic as
portrayed. He was never as confrontational as depicted in the movie. He
was also never in the rodeo. 2. All the treatments he was marketing
were wholly ineffective in treating HIV/AIDS. Read for yourself on DDC
(Zalcitabine) and others were downright harmful. In fact due to the
lack of follow-up of the patients, many may have had an accelerated
demise due to some of the combinations used (impossible to say of
course). 3. The FDA had already loosened some of the restrictions on
drug trials to fast track treatments. There were never any dramatic
seizures like in the film. 4. Dr. Saks, who was horribly portrayed by
Jennifer Garner and Rayon are fictional for dramatic elements only.I could continue on. My issue is that proponents always say how great
it is of Hollywood to raise awareness on a film. I appreciate this but
it distorts history and harms how people react to ongoing crisis if
this should arise again. It is like trying to pass on an action movie
as based on a reality when we know it should be purely for
entertainment.
