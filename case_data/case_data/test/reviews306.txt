could have been better.

This movie let me down in so many ways. I do understand that most of
the time the book is better then the movie for obvious reasons. Time
restrictions,budget and movie rating system. But to not even come close
and Im talking not even in the same ball park is a huge let down.Spoiler coming.... Biggest error of the movie was that the director
failed to show how heartless "The Iceman" really was. Let me explain.In the book "The Iceman" would sample new weapons on people mostly the
homeless walking under the East River Parkway near the Brooklyn bridge.
The police most of the time just wrote it off as the homeless killing
each other off. One of his more horrendous acts was to drive a victim
to the deep woods of Pennsylvania and seek out a cave. He would then
tie up his victim with food all over him...He would then video tape the
rats chewing the victim alive. Im not getting into every murder he did
but, This does sum up the point that the movie somewhat just skims the
surface of how ruthless and heartless the "Iceman" really was.As for the movie as a whole...I rate this as a somewhat average run of
the mill crime drama. I left feeling like I just wasted 2 hours.
