Crippled, abused woman finds spirit and fulfillment in painting.

An Irish director casts a British woman and an American star in the 
thus  quintessentially Canadian film about a national treasure, Nova
Scotia folk artist Maud Lewis. As a woman and as an artist Maud is a heroically resilient figure. She
survives life with a brutish husband, accepting a succession of
indignities, some outrageous. Gradually she establishes her own rights,
identity and even name. Though crippled with arthritis, Maud becomes a
famous and esteemed artist. (Now you can add "expensive"  those little
five-dollar painted boards go for $9,000 at the gallery.) As her craft advances, her domestic status improves. Husband Everett
gradually assumes the Womans Work  sweeping, peeling, darning  so she
can earn money with her art. Maud's art is gloriously naive. It springs from her wistful imagination
more than from her actual environs. It's the triumph of spirit over
perception. If it's representational it represents the figures teeming
in her imagination not those actually outside and around. In rough parallel, she stays with vile Everett because she sees more in
him, a softer self, than not only we see but that he himself doesn't
sense. She dies knowing he loved her  despite his never having said
anything like that, or shown it, or indeed ever acknowledging it even
to himself. But the feeling does out, even if it's in the subtle shift from her
walking behind him on the horizon line to him pushing her in his
wheelbarrow. Love takes many forms. As does art. And marriage.Perhaps Everett's most loving act is taking her to espy her daughter,
whom Maud's family took away and sold, telling her the baby had been
deformed and died. The film's dominant palette is the grey gloom of cramped unlit
interiors and a hard scrabble, penurious life. The fish seller makes so
little that five cents for a painted card becomes a windfall. The point about that unrelieved darkness is Maud's response to it:
flowers and animals painted in bright, unmodulated colours, a
brilliance that her crippled hand uses to express her indomitable,
spirited soul. Because she has spent her life in the shadows  from the
shame of a humiliating pregnancy and helplessness to Everett's abused
cleaner  she finds in art the joy and brightness of life. It proves
contagious.
