A Rewarding Struggle

Wild is based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed about her lone hike on
the Pacific Crest Trail. This journey is meant to be an escape from her
personal problems and possibly rehabilitating herself from a troubling
past. It expresses these feelings thoroughly; at every turn, there has
to be a reminder of what she's been through, but also deals with a
potential danger in this hike. The movie lives up to its sentiment, the
pain and obstacles that the story goes through feel genuine and it
leaves us such a rewarding experience. There are some parts that can
feel a little uneven, but its spirit stays intact, enduring what the
movie is meant to be.There are several conflicts in this hike. Firstly is how inexperienced
Strayed is in the wilderness, trying to reach her destination with a
heavy backpack, tight shoes, raw meals, and even faces anything that
could possibly harm her, including wild animals and strangers that
appears to her as a threat. The other is basically remembering the past
of losing her mother and her addiction out of depression. The main
point here is how she deals with these problems; the flashbacks may be
just any other drama, but it helps clearing out her motivations and
fleshing out who she is. Though, the emotions are more genuine when she
is simply isolated, helpless from any conflict until she learns lifting
herself back up, literally and metaphorically.It carefully lingers at how difficult to proceed this walk which makes
her seemingly small actions look like a truly serious risk. The camera
just lets the audience experience the same feeling of pain and
exhaustion on what she is doing. Reese Witherspoon naturally pictures
the vital parts of Strayed's emotional and physical struggles, while
building a full character along the trek. But the movie doesn't always
have to be tough, whenever it stops into places with people, there is a
real pleasant feeling around, especially when she is just expressing
her thoughts to whoever she just met.There are a some flaws that are worth mentioning, specifically when it
occasionally takes turn to a far different direction later on, somewhat
abandoning the consistent emotion it accomplished. The very last part
also ended up verbalizing the entire theme, kind of dropping the poetic
intentions. But they didn't outweigh much of its merits. Because no
matter what happened there, Wild is still a journey that earned
something satisfyingly heartfelt. Most of the credit may go to Reese
Witherspoon as she thoughtfully carries the whole film. Even when it
sort of stumbles in some parts, the movie still delivers the story with
sincerity and real emotions that made it this great.
