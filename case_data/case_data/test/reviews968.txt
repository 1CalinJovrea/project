Absolute success for a diretorial debut

When the CEO/founder of my favorite music label released the trailer
for American Satan, I was intrigued. Due to a limited release, I had to
drive to federal way from school just to watch this film. Suffice it
say that the wait, anticipation, and the drive to go watch this film
was absolutely worth it.The plot is relatively simple; A rock band and their manager move down
to Los Angeles to chase their dreams of being rock stars. When things
aren't going their way, they decide to take a shortcut that ultimately
leads to the band spiraling into a downward spiral into a world of
influence and depravity. Plenty of Sex, drugs, Rock n' Roll and alcohol
of course. The entire film of this singer and his band is their journey
though heaven and hell. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
There wasn't a moment where I checked my phone. The soundtrack is
terrific for all you Rock fans out there.For a directorial debut and an independent film, this is as good as you
can get. The production value is also very good. This film serves as a
cautionary tale as to what happens when you get into the business of
music or specifically in this case, Rock music. The acting is
wonderful. No doubt with a loaded cast (Malcolm McDowell, Drake Bell,
Denise Richards, etc.) like this. Especially the two main character,
being their first film (who are actually rock stars in real life,
imagine that) did a superb job portraying their characters.The only gripe I had with this film was that there was not enough
character development for certain characters, and certain plot holes,
but it didn't bother me that much. Overall, a film definitely worth
checking out. You will not be disappointed.
