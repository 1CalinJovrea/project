Ludicrous movie which ripped off Oz big time

Give me a break, so the lead starts out as a yuppie with a great job,
great house and a family, goes out with friends one night, has some
drinks, gets in an accident and gets a friend killed, ending up in
maximum security prison?I've never been able to verify this is true, that you do get sent to
Max for DUI manslaughter, but if you had to ask me, I'd think it was
unlikely. I also would think it's unlikely someone would become a big
crime lord while in prison, especially coming from a DUI manslaughter
charge. Come on.Like Oz, I think this movie was solely aimed to scare middle class,
rich suburban types to attract more attention to it. Some ex-cons have
shared their prison experiences on some other sites and basically said
it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Many ex-cons also do
not fit any sort of stereotype. For instance, looking at the lead
coming out of prison with his hair and his shirt was hilarious. Got a
huge red flag from that itself.
