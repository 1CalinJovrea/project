Weak script, OK execution=unmemorable horror movie.

Look I'm a fan of the genre and it's always great to see a small budget
film get made in the United States and get a big release and make
money.I'd love to say the film deserves all this success, but I was let down
by it. The writing is pretty poor--the "ghost" is explained in several
talky scenes in a row--making for a dull section of it right when it
should take off. One scene involving a recorded audio flashback is
unintentionally funny.The whole idea of a ghost that can exist only in the dark you'd think
would lead to unexpected scenes or the lights going out or the ghost
finding ways to put the humans in the dark, as in DON'T BE AFRAID OF
THE DARK--for instance. But instead these scenes just randomly happen
and, in a real horror movie cliché, characters are constantly wandering
off on their own to put themselves in trouble and then not much real
trouble ensues anyway. Once you've seen one such scene in this movie
you've pretty much seen all the rest of them, and there are a number of
them. None of it builds in pace of suspense of horror.Sure it could have fallen in for a cliché ending, but they fall into
too many traps from other films and it's not well enough directed or
acted to overcome predictable stumbling around in the dark
sequences--of which there are many more of then there are scary pay
offs. No one scene in this film is as good as the cheap short from
which it was expanded.It's relatively bloodless on all levels. If you think this is a great
horror movie you really need to spend some time tracking down the truly
great ones, cause this ain't in any of those league.
