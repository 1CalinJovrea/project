Twisted Story with Excellent Performances

Even though it wasn't as scary or gory, as I wanted it to be. It still
managed to creep me out and get on my nerves, with it's very creative
and elaborate story and excellent performances from all it's cast. I
really enjoyed the chemistry between the two younger actors played by
Annalise Basso & Garrett Ryan, and the relationship they had as
characters, which added a lot of heart and sentiment to the whole
story. Moreover, this movie was more a drama with some horror, because
it didn't played with the whole scare and gore factors, but instead it
was more about the the story behind the mirror and the effect it had
with the people that surrounded it. It would be a good idea to make
this a franchise because of how extensive its universe could be, as
well as how many different stories and characters it could incorporate
and continue to haunt, even though it's ending was melodramatic to me,
it felt conclusive and eerily heartbreaking. Overall, it was a very
good little drama-horror film that goes more farther than you could
imagine and think.
