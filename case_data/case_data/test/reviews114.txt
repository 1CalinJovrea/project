It's lousy. It hits you over the head with the message that no one

clubbing you upside the skull every couple of minutes with further

over the top mockery.The movie also makes a stand against reactionary mob mentality, both in
the 300 year old judicial murder of the 11 year old "witch" of town
fame and the modern townsfolk's panic at the rise of 7 zombies who hurt
absolutely no one. And why does all this happen? Because no one is
