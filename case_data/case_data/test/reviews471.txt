An enchanting flick!

Big Eyes is in a way reflective of a feeling every artist goes through
when someone else steals credit for their work. It is a crime that
Walter Keane, played superbly by Christoph Waltz, commits without
batting an eye and Margaret Keane, portrayed by Amy Adams, endures for
the better half of her life. Screenplay coming from Walter Keane is
very reassuring as he inspires Margaret to not underestimate herself,
and drops soothing lines to make her believe she is gifted."You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. Your heart's in your work."
BREAKING DOWN THE FLICK Music is endearing and so is its editing. Has a
constant charming pace that keeps everything strung well in place. Tim
Burton's intelligent style of film-making can be read through his
thoughtful frames that occasionally drop off humorous subtleties to
make things alluring and delectable.The paintings of Big Eyes have a telling veracity that is told my
numerous stunningly drawn children with their beady eyes. As Margaret
expounds:"Eyes are windows to the soul." Big Eyes beautifully captures the
struggle one had to go through in order to be seen. Even though art was
revered profusely, beginnings were still as relentless as baby steps of
any creative profession.SPOILER PAINTINGS AHEAD: Christoph Waltz does a fabulous job as he
tries to convince the whole world of his lie. It is hard to see through
him. He is that good! Hell, he convinces you in the very beginning that
he is for real. It is kind of a slow reveal when you start guessing his
ugly facade.MARGARET'S SILENT SUFFERING At times you can't help but feel sorry for
Margaret and wonder why she doesn't revolt. Trying to look at things
from her perspective you realize she was pretty meek and weak. Also, he
had a smooth talker for a husband who would always bring her around,
probably why she was always in a constant dubitation. Also, there was
moolah being pressed out on a regular basis; one of the major reasons
for her mum.You might wonder, despite the conning, Margaret does fairly well for
herself, with a lie that helps both parties entailed. But for an artist
who is fond of one's work, money is always secondary. It is pride that
matters the most, which Walter exploits profusely.The fact Tim Burton doesn't toy with the flick to make the biopic
darker will compel you to raise brows. Dramatic elements don't induce
gut-wrenching feels which could be a downside to Big Eyes. But it does
fairly well walking on its pleasant and bewitching theme to manifest
eclipsed art and an engaging tale in its truest form.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com
