Well.... that was horrible!

So... Without spoiling the book OR this movie; the movie sucked, the
book did not. There is way, way more sci-fi then necessary, and BAD
sci-fi that is! It's really poorly done, bad CGI and stuff. And where
the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright
dumb and mad no sense. The biggest book-moments were cut out, probably
to make room for the bad CGI... I kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause
the 2nd one wasn't that good either. It also seems the actors get less
and less convincing with each movie. Contrary to the Hunger Games (that
also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho), these
don't live up to the books at all. If you read them, don't watch the
movies. If you've watched the movies but started liking them less and
less, read the books instead! They're worth it!
