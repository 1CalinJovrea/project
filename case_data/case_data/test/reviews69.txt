A Fresh Perspective

Hardcore Henry was a tour de force of action and sci-fi. Guns, gangs,
and cyborgs set in a modern Russian landscape of despotic lunatics
conveyed the desperation of intelligence. There was a quasi-human mind
embedded in a nearly indestructible body where persecution of free will
tested the limits of perseverance. Video game lovers would quickly
adapt to the film's first person point of view originally found in
games like Resident Evil and Doom. This first person perspective in
cinematography was reminiscent of the 80's action-comedy movie
"Innerspace". Hardcore Henry's tempo integrated with carnality, comedy,
and irony boldly re-defined the boundaries for patrons of the robot
movie genre.
