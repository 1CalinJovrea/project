Dreadful.

I have a perverted sense of humor and do not mind Family Guy, so I'm
not sure what I was expecting. But this nasty, pointless, unfunny
drivel was a complete waste of my time and money. About the only thing
achieved here is an effort to showcase Mila Kunis as completely
gorgeous; on all other counts it is a fail - unless you like gratuitous
eff words and references to bowel movements/flatulence/anal sex
(oooohhh how shocking, and how boring)*Spoiler Alert* See this and tell me if you can believe Mila Kunis
wasting a perfectly good wish on having the world's most repulsive
little furball come back to life. Only for sophomoric morons with no schools to vandalize or cars to
torch.
