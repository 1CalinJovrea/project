movie we saw is just a single frame of  the larger story

- and so would my rating, if possible, break out the limits of 1-10
What is most funny is that we cannot be sure of absolutely anything
depicted, because it is likely this movie is only limited period of a
story far beyond it's frame.It is clearly shown that Laurie and Mike have no recollection of each
other, as if they haven't met before. A director's clue is almost
explicit in line "I guess it must be another girl that Kevin dated and
Amir is hooking up with". Besides, it is stated the technology failures
occurred during the day of the dinner party, the comet was affecting
the world throughout some time.The whole "original house" may not even be as original, because the
group goes outside to watch the comet, and when they return in, one
glass on the table is broken. It seems the have changed the entire
setting (the house itself) as a unit.Bonus clue for the never-ending ending debate: there are two rings
after the comet falling apart. If material objects are preserved, so
may be are people as well.. Especially if we consider another line told
by Lee (or someone else), how the house is the box and they are the
Schroedinger's cat. Therefore anyone in the house is not affected by
outside turmoils. Original Emily has left her double in the bathtub, in
the house. She simply.. cannot be dead or evaporated. Besides, if the
strange effects started before the nighttime of previous day, why would
they end with the sunrise? Another interesting phenomenon is the last
house itself. It seems not to have been impacted at all, by the comet.
No note, no one knocking, no interferences according to their behavior.The other interesting phenomenon are the electric blackouts, happening
for unknown reason. In one interview the director clued on following
Emily at all times. However these blackouts are cutting us from her,
and that may also be significant.The last thing I'd like to mention is the scene by the car, where Emily
and Kevin meet, and realize they're not from the same realities. This
scene is one of the most eerie scenes I have ever seen.Thank you for this movie, it is a treasure for humanity.
