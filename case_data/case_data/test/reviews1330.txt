Ambitious one...

After Drive, i was very curious to see what he was doing next.This movie was fairly ambitious in its own ways, visually is a stunning
mix of colors and beautiful composed shots, which elevates the whole
mood of the movie. The story itself is a fairly simple one, however it
is told in a way in which depended heavily on the actors performance,
and this is were the movie fails. the way some of the actors fail to
act the parts almost like shadows of themselves, sometimes overacting
and being too much aware of the camera detracts from Nicolas
intentions. Gosling is good here, so is Kristin Scott Thomas, the rest
of the cast is hit or miss in some scenes. The overall surreal way of
telling this story could've worked a lot better if they had solved
those issues. I liked the subtext behind the whole relationship between
Chang (who in is own ways has a twisted God complex) and Julian's
character.In the end it makes me a little sad, i think with a little more time
put into working with the actors, it could've elevated the movie to
another level, also without spoiling anything, i think the out of the
box scenes could've been pushed a little more!! 7 out of 10!!
