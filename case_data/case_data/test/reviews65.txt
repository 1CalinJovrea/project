disappointing on many levels

Shallow story. Excruciatingly long scenes. Comparing to this
Tarkovsky's "Stalker" is a fast-paced action movie. Non-believable
characters. Ridiculously out-of-character CEO on a bro-trip, drinking
too much and swearing to appear close to the "peasant programmer". CEO,
supposedly genius programmer himself, could not even get to the source
of his power outages that happen many times every day. A super-smart
programmer confused that he might be a robot himself. An AI that is
overly concerned with its own sexuality. An AI that's stupid enough to
get away from the power source - it's been constantly charging its
batteries while in the house. Seeing this movie made me go through the
trouble of creating an account on IMDb - to warn others. There's
nothing to see in this movie, please watch something else.
