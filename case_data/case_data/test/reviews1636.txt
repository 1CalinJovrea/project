I enjoyed it

I'll begin by saying that I haven't read the book and had absolutely no
idea what to expect. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by what is an
exciting science fiction adventure.Harrison Ford is the reason I watched this, and he is first rate. It
might be argued that Ford is playing to the gruff stereotype he has
essayed in any number of recent films, but I like this performance.The younger members of the cast were unfamiliar to me, but they acquit
themselves well. I was drawn into the story and the emoitional journey
within.The visuals are stunning. Even the most cynical or jaded critic cannot
deny the movie is beautiful to watch. Worth the cost of a movie ticket.
