Gone girl Gone

Currently watching this. Like it. At around halfway now. Story is quite
unpredictable. It could go in any way. I'm real stoked about seeing the
rest of it.Checking the movie's prospects out on Wikipedia, I was surprised to see
that it is considered a failure, and that there are so many people
putting it down. From what I've seen so far, I can just conclude that
there are lots and lots of people who expect something totally
unrealistic from their movie experiences, and when they don't get
even-they-don't-know-what, they gripe all huffy and disgruntled and
bring down the overall scores.Objectively seen, it's a tense psychological thriller, with Amanda
Seyfried starring as a very intense, very watchable protagonist. She
gives a damn fine performance, so what in thunderation more could the
people want?I will be back sometime in the next week with my review. Meanwhile, I
have the rest of the movie to look forward to. Early on in the movie I
realized that the title could be interpreted several ways. Missing,
mad, eventually shot dead? But now I'm speculating the girl's talking
the truth, there is a guy stalking her. I'm suspecting that detective
guy. He is the wolf in sheep's clothing.Addendum, 8 December 2014. Okay, so I was completely barking up the
wrong tree. Good movie. Amanda was great! More than great!
