Another awful MCU movie; BvS is a much better movie!

1st, Civil War is basically a copy of BvS. A government building gets
blown up by a bomb, killing a prominent government official. A villain
manipulating heroes into fighting.2nd, too many characters just popping up without any reason at all and
just shoehorned into the movie - Ant-Man/Giant Man - Black Panther -
Hawkeye (was retired, now suddenly abandons the girlfriend and kids to
come back and help a fugitive escape from the authorities) - The
Annoying Spider-Kid (more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom
Menace; did more talking than fighting)3rd, after all the buildup about a disagreement over the issues of
collateral damage and government oversight of the heroes, those issues
were completely trivialized by a "big fight" that was nothing more than
a friendly sparring contest with bad one-liners thrown in: "Are we
still going to be friends after this?" "We haven't met before?" "Mr
Stark. What do I do now?" "You have a METAL arm?" "I'm from Queens. I'm
from Brooklyn."Was the "Civil War" supposed to be a real fight for something they
believed in, or just a "Joke-Off" to determine who could deliver the
best jokes?4th, MCU fans had been saying for months that Captain America was
justified in opposing government oversight of the heroes because he
didn't want the Avengers to be controlled by HYDRA. But it wasn't HYDRA
who requested the Sokovia accords. It was the United Nations.The Avengers had caused massive deaths and destruction so the United
Nations wanted oversight of the Avengers. But Captain America didn't
want the Avengers to be held responsible and have to answer to the
people for the massive deaths and destruction that they caused.Captain America wanted the Avengers to be the supreme authority
(exactly like Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein made themselves the
supreme authority) to make decisions on what's best for the people
instead of letting the elected representatives of the people make
decisions on what's best for the people (like the way a Democracy
works). So basically, Captain America opposes Democracy and favors
Tyranny.5th, plenty of plot holes and lazy, contrived writing. Tony Stark had
called Secretary of State Ross to evacuate the airport prior to the big
fight. So Ross knew before the big fight that the Captain America and
the Bucky were planning to hijack a plane at that airport.So why didn't Ross just have military fighter jets hovering in the sky
nearby in case they succeed in hijacking a plane? There's already a
"shoot on sight" order for Bucky so if they succeed in hijacking a
plane, then the military fighter jets can just fly in and either shoot
at their plane to force them to land or shoot down their plane.Since Captain America and Bucky can't fly on their own, their powers
are useless when they're inside a plane being fired upon by military
fighter jets. And their plane wouldn't be able to evade military
fighter jets. But the script needed Captain America and Bucky to escape
so that it could set up the final fight between Iron Man and Captain
America.Also, the 1st half of the movie is all about Tony Stark trying to get
all the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords, which state that the
Avengers would operate only when approved by a UN panel. Then in the
2nd half of the movie, Tony recruits Peter Parker to join his team even
though Peter is a minor and wouldn't be able to sign a legal document
and thus wouldn't be approved by the UN panel to operate under the
Sokovia Accords.Another egregious error is that the whole movie set up Bucky as the
killer of Iron Man's parents, thus setting up the main conflict in the
movie, but why would there be video footage of their accident on some
random back road in 1991? And how did whomever filmed the video footage
know to place the camera at that EXACT spot where their car crashed,
and not a mile ahead or a mile behind where the car crashed?If there was video footage, then wouldn't Iron Man or Jarvis or even
Ultron have stumbled across it by now? Tony hacked classified
government networks in seconds in Iron Man 2, hacked Shield in The
Avengers and has apparently been watching Peter Parker on a regular
basis. Seems like he would have found video footage of his parents'
deaths a long time ago.And better yet, how could the coroner rule their deaths an accident
when the ligature marks around Maria Stark's neck and the fist imprints
in Howard Stark's face would have been immediately evident in the
autopsy? Was the coroner just incompetent?Also, Tony Stark believed his parents died in an accident and never
suspected foul play at all. So how did Zemo know that their "accident"
from 25 years ago was actually foul play? How did Zemo know there was
video footage from 25 years ago of Tony's parents being murdered and
how did Zemo find that footage when Tony never knew about or found that
same footage?Tony Stark was more angry at Steve Rogers because Steve knew but didn't
tell him. So how did Zemo know that Steve knew the "accident" 25 years
ago was actually foul play?Those are massive pills we're asked to swallow that exist only because
they conveniently set up the final conflict between Iron Man and
Captain America. Now that's some mighty contrived writing.6th, another forgettable MCU villain. Zemo was about as invisible in
Civil War as Luke Skywalker was in The Force Awakens.7th, critics and haters of BvS complained about how Lex knew Superman
is Clark Kent and how Superman knew Batman is Bruce Wayne, but there
was no explanation at all for how Tony Stark knew Spider-Man is a high
school kid in Queens.
