Finally, proof that trolls and spoofers have the upper hand...

As I write this review, there are around 200 reviews posted. As far as
I can tell, fewer than 10 of them rate this film at 7 stars or above,
yet its average rating is slightly more than 7 stars. In fact, while
the vast majority of reviews on the first five pages give it only 1
star, the ratings summary says that only 1.2% of those rating it gave
it just 1 star.This is a long way of saying that it's now inescapable fact that
trolls, spoofers, and studio shills dominate the site. A system is only
useful until enough people figure out how to game it, and this is
(sadly) now the case for this site.On to the review: Neighbors had a big challenge to overcome with me, as
I just don't normally find Seth R. and his "Seth Pack" to be very
funny. Unfortunately, this film fails on every level to provide either
humor or entertainment. It's a rare film that can depict all characters
as totally unsympathetic and get away with it. After all, the viewer
needs to be able to identify with SOMEONE in a story or film, even if
it's the third-party narrator. This movie has absolutely no sympathetic
characters in it at all. It's the essence of comedic nihilism. I didn't
like any of the characters, none of them said anything that was vaguely
funny, and I didn't identify with any point of view expressed in the
film. To make matters worse, the director relied solely on profanity
and T&A for shock value.Totally worthless movie. Don't waste your time.
