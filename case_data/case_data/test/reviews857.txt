Another distinctive film from Bong Joon-ho about wholesome values vs. society's self-interest

A teenage girl wants nothing more than to remain with her lifelong pet
and companion  the super pig Okja  in Korean auteur Bong Joon- ho's
latest film. Everything else is just stuff that gets in the way.Bong delivers one of Netflix's better high profile original films in
"Okja," a quirky yet topical yet big-hearted film. Similar to Bong's
2006 breakout film "The Host," a monster movie about a doltish dad who
will do anything to rescue his daughter, "Okja" plays to family themes
(a girl and her pet) but presents them through a mature, adult lens
(corporate greed, environmentalism, genetic science). So the context of "Okja" is complicated, but the story is quite simple
and human. 14-year-old Mija (An Seo-hyun) has lived with her
grandfather on a mountainside farm in South Korea for most of her life
with Okja, a super pig gifted to the farm by Lucy Mirando (Tilda
Swinton) and the Mirando Corporation as part of a competition to
develop the pigs as a non-GMO food source to help fight hunger. When
the corporation and super pig judge Johnny Wilcox (Jake Gyllenhaal)
come to collect, Okja is clearly the finest of the super pigs in the
world, and they endeavor to take her to New York City. Mija follows
them to Seoul and attempts to get her friend back, coming up against
the corporation and a group of animal rights activists, all of which
have different agendas for Okja.Hilarious and deeply disturbing, violent but also quite warm, Bong has
created another distinctive film that makes him one of the most
interesting filmmakers that not enough people are talking about. The
mixed bag of tones will certainly turn off viewers who aren't sure what
to do with a film that doesn't fit in any one neatly labeled genre box,
those with an open mind will appreciate the way he tells extremely
accessible stories that address complicated themes.Okja means a lot of things to a lot of people: friendship and stability
to Mija; money, science and reputation to the Mirando Corporation;
injustice and corporate greed to the animal liberation group; and
affordable food to the masses. The plot is essentially these competing
interests sorting themselves out.Part of what makes "Okja" distinctive is the caricaturized supporting
roles that make everything feel just a shade unusual. As she did in
Bong's last film, "Snowpiercer," Swinton so effortlessly creates a
wildly larger than life character portrait that simultaneously feels
grounded in reality. Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, is infuriatingly
grating as the eccentric loose cannon TV personality, but his character
is a signal to the audience of how to look at and think of the world of
the film. Bong has such a specific perspective on society that comes through in
way subtle and not in "Okja." He brilliantly whittles the story down to
one pivotal moment at the end, and the outcome of all this chaos
suggests he's neither pessimistic nor optimistic. Perhaps he would
argue that it's not his business to come down one way or another, but
simply to use a giant hippo-like pig to at least prove that our world
is majorly  and maybe unnecessarily  complicated~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
