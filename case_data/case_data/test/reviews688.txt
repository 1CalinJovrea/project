Everyone Calm Down!!

In my opinion this is the type of movie to see if: 1)You love and
support Jeremy Renner 2)You're in a mood to see cool but not overly
flashy effects 3)Love for dark fairy tales 4)Awesome make up and
costumes (the witches were very VERY well put together) 5)Just an all
around chill movie with gore violence and cool effectsDon't see it if: 1)you expect high quality acting 2)Over the top
graphics and effects 3)Complex plot line 4)Extremely witty scriptBecause Jeremy Renner was in big time movies, people are over analyzing
this one. It's suppose to be fun with a hint of dark, and entertaining.
I was very entertained. I also loved how it was only 88 minutes versus
the 2-3 hour movies that have been coming out. I appreciated the
toughness of Gemma in the film and Famke as head witch was genius.
Overall it served it's purpose.
