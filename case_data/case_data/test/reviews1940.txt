Are you serious?

I am sorry but i can't believe all the reviews here. I left the movie
theater before the movie was over. This movie has nothing at all that is interesting. Nothing, nothing and
nothing! Come on... Every movie should be giving something new and interesting. Being
original is very important in today's industry. Or at least it should
present some extraordinary acting. But this movie? It has nothing worth to see! A very ordinary story
line. Very ordinary characters(perfect boy, perfect girl, grumpy old
man). Very ordinary dialogues that i thought was left 30 years ago .This movie is waste of money and waste of time.
