Stronger Than Most Biopics

(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A gritty and emotional film that couldn't ask for a stronger
performance than the one given by Jake Gyllenhaal.SYNOPSIS: A biography of Jeff Bauman, a survivor of the Boston Marathon
bombing. JIM'S REVIEW: The odds against Jeff Bauman surviving the horror of the
2013 Boston Marathon bombing were slim and the chances any moviegoer
won't be moved to tears and uplifted by this one man's personal tale of
survival while experiencing David Gordon Green's Stronger are even
less.This heartfelt film takes on the before and after view of this common
man. First seen as a hometown boy (before being cast as an hometown
hero to the world), Jeff (Jake Gyllenhaal) was a fun-loving avid Boston
Red Sox fan caught in an on-again / off again relationship with his
girlfriend, Erin (Tatianna Maslany). He lived an ordinary life, one
filled with bars, beer, and blue collar stock characters. Then came the
terrorist bombing which changed everything.The story itself is predictable and manipulative, yet emotionally
gripping. John Pollono's screenplay follows the formula to the T, or
should I say from Point A (the horrific event) to Point B (overcoming
the obstacles and hardships) to its uplifting Point C ending (pride and
redemption). That said, it all works most effectively, due its honest
depiction of a man in crisis. And having that person played by the talented Mr. Gyllenhaal, a fine
method actor who immersed himself in this real life role, gives the
film the honest integrity and authenticity the film needs which helps
to separate the movie from most biographies that wallow in self-pity
and inner strength. Watching him struggle to come to terms with his
injuries and finally walk with two prosthetic legs is gut-wrenching and
Mr. Gyllenhaal shows his character's human flaws and intrinsic hopes
with the least amount of melodramatic excess. His performance deserves
award recognition.Where the film truly succeeds is in avoiding the clichés of most
biopics by making our hero too heroic and unreal. Mr. Gordon's
direction is concise and insightful. He never allows Stronger to
weaken. His film doesn't flinch from the ugly side of Jeff's
rehabilitation, his dysfunctional family, and his sacrifices just to
lead a normal life. It wisely covers the issue of instant fame and
becoming a pawn for network news, a necessary symbol of courage for a
nation, even if our hero wants none of that adoration. The film does
end on an inspirational false note, as most film biopics do, in a scene
at the ballpark that takes a misstep into gross sentimentality and an
unabashed shout-out to patriotism. But the story always remains
compelling and the acting is superb.The rest of the cast could easily have played their parts rather
routinely and still bring about the emotional clout: suffering
girlfriend, loyal friends, worrisome parents, etc. But the actors shy
away from the obvious and give their characters some gravitas. Ms.
Maslany makes a fine partner as Jeff's supporting girlfriend, showing
the pain and frustration beautifully. Carlos Sanz as the man who saved
Jeff's life during the bombing, has a quiet and touching scene that is
so nuanced and heartbreaking in its subtlety. It shows the collective
despair of survivors and their kin. Miranda Richardson, as Jeff's boozy
mother, is so memorable in her supporting role that she becomes
unrecognizable, creating an indelible character while exposing her
human flaws. Her rivalry with Erin brings needed tension to the family
dynamics which separates this film from the run-of-the-mill
inspirational saga. There are many scenes of undeniable pathos and
melancholy, insightful moments in time, especially the parking lot
confrontation between the two leads that builds to an emotional zenith.Stronger is a rarity, a powerful film based on a true life story that
is true to life. With a strong central performance, fine direction, and
a screenplay that works on many emotional levels, this is one of the
year's most satisfying dramas. Do not miss it!Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com
