A Truly Dreadful Waste of Time ... Don;t waste your time even for free

No Story No Style No Atmosphere No Suspense Awful Effects Edited with a
hatchet by the looks of it Directed and written ( ? ) by someones with
no talent who should go work in Walmart The first Silent Hill was made
by someone with talent and imagination ... It created a unique and
visually stylish world This thing lacks all of that ... In fact it
lacks most things needed to make something a film This looks like some
random scenes thrown together by the syfy channel as a trailer for some
film that someone else should have made Absolutely atrocious ... I want
the 90 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this nonevent
Burn Hollywood ... Burn
