Brave has little Heart

I knew Brave was in trouble from the first few words spoken in voice
over as the film began. Merida (Kelly Macdonald) uses the words "fate"
and "destiny" interchangeably. This muddle is at the heart of the
film's problem.What's the difference between fate and destiny? Philosophers through
the ages have distinguished the two based on choice. Fate is something
that happens TO you. Destiny is something that happens BECAUSE of you.Fate is at the root of such words as "fatal" and "fatalistic." It
implies LACK of choice. Philosopher Rollo May says fate is what we are
born into, something that cannot be changed and that we have no control
over, such as race.May says destiny is what we create based on what we were given. Destiny
is all about CHOICE. It's what we choose to do with what we have.Merida is born a princess. She can't change that. Her mother, Queen
Elinor (Emma Thompson), is grooming Merida for a role as future queen.
After a long series of wars King Fergus (Billy Connolly) has united the
four clans. Merida's duty is to help keep the clans unified though a
judicious marriage.Merida is a wild rebellious child with special talent as a rider and
archer. The demonstrations of her skills are absolutely breathtaking.
She is unique and extraordinary and initially looks very much like a
Power of Idealism character.These kinds of characters are driven by their passion. They abhor what
they consider to be a mundane, boring, or mediocre life. They want to
seize some grand destiny that is uniquely theirs.Well-drawn female protagonists in this vein are: Paikea (Keisha
Castle-Hughes) in Whale Rider and Jess Kaur Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) in
Bend it Like Beckham. Unlike Paikea or Jess, Merida doesn't fight for
what she believes is HER destiny. Merida, instead, decides to change
her mother! Perhaps this is because Merida has no clue about what she
is really called to do.Now the story gets even muddier. With the help of an old witch's spell
Merida does indeed change her mother  into a bear.Instead of figuring out who she is and what she uniquely is called to
do, Merida must again deal with who her mother is. In the struggle over
the middle part of Brave, Queen Elinor becomes the protagonist.The definition of a protagonist, in my book, is the person who makes
the biggest emotional sacrifice in the story. It is the person who
undergoes the most profound transformation. This is clearly Elinor on
every front.Queen Elinor is a Power of Conscience character. She is a strict and
demanding taskmaster, a perfectionist, and is driven by a strong sense
of tradition and duty. Over the course of the story she recognizes her
daughter's uniqueness and fully appreciates Merida for who she is.The first important glimpse of Elinor's change of heart is the brawl in
the great hall after Merida has disappeared. When Merida strides back
into the hall it is Elinor who puts words in Merida's mouth. Elinor
speaks through her surrogate about going against tradition and marrying
for love. It is Elinor who makes an eloquent plea for choice and
following one's heart. Merida is just her passive interpreter. At the
end of the film Elinor is willing to sacrifice her own life in a battle
with the ancient cursed bear, who one would assume, was the monster who
took off her husband's leg. Or not? Who knows?Even more confusingly this monster turns out to be the legendary
brother, it would seem, who destroyed the ancient kingdom so long ago
because of his pride and selfishness. How how did he turn into a bear?
Was it mother love or something else that breaks his curse?When a legend and curse is set up so carefully it should have a pay-off
having to do with Merida or her destiny if the film is really about
Merida.And what does Merida do that is so brave? She scurries around looking
for the witch's house after her mother turns into a bear. She stitches
up (with big clumsy childish stitches) the tapestry she slashed
separating her from her mother. She does a lot of running away and
running around. She is ineffective in battling the monstrous cursed
bear. And she collapses in tears remembering her mother's loving
kindness as the second sunrise threatens to make her mother's bear
curse permanent. In other words, she acts like a child or worse a
girl.At the end of the film, Elinor has changed but not Merida. Merida is
the same galloping wild child as she was in the beginning. It is a
sinking back into carefree childhood rather than striding toward an
adulthood based both on duty and and an individualistic sense of self.
If you are a young woman, what is the lesson here?Brave offers no alternative vision of how Merida might help unify the
clan in some way that is uniquely hers. It provides a very unsatisfying
resolution. How has Merida changed or grown? What happens when King
Fergus and Queen Elinor are too old to rule? What is Merida's role
going forward? What exactly is her destiny?For the full review go to my website ETBscreenwriting.
