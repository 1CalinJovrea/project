Too much magic.

Just terrible. If you're easily fooled by tricks and enjoy shallow,
time wasting plot lines, this one might be for you. The tired mechanic
of using a foreign location to add some weak validity to the mystic
crap is turned on full throttle in this one. Like batman on the
mountain, How else could Dr Strange come to learn these neat-o things?
NEPAL, of course. Just another overblown monstrosity to cram in your
face while doing the same with 17 cups of popcorn. Whether it's because
of the wild and overused "mindfuck" CG, or the tired attempt to make
the protagonist seam likable, in a Tony Stark, ass-hole sort of way,
this one is best left for $2 Tuesday, and you decide which. Three
thumbs down.
