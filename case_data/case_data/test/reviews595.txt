Trippy, Weird, Amazing and Jawdropping!

I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to
witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but
i'll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I
also had myself!Acting (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters
instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange
was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one
killed it!Action (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on
par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this
scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main
characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else
do you want?Story(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how
and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable
one for once(stab, you're welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though.
The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There
is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange "the
magic" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with
great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic
movie yet of marvel.Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn't THE best marvel
movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason
borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the
hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it
for once!Some questions that my friends asked:"Is this better than civil war?" - Well visual-wise on par, but
story-wise civil war is better for many reasons including the fact that
civil war had a lot of background information to work with. This was
more of a standardized origin film. "Is there a post-credit scene?" - Ah yes sir! Apparently there are two,
but we got to see only 1. "Is this the most mind-boggling thing you've ever seen on screen?" -
Ehm yes and no. Yes, because the effects were amazing and things I've
never seen before. No, nothing was so mind-blowing that it made me
think different of the world or something.
