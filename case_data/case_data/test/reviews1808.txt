Well Executed but Boring

The execution and quality of the film making was great, but overall I
quickly got bored watching this movie as none of the character's
motivations seemed realistic or made sense to me. The action sequences
were great, but didn't do anything especially unique or carry any
suspenseful weight with the plot that I found myself yawning during
much of it. Perhaps it needed more shocking gore.The movie seemed to be a bit confused in its tone, mixing stylized
violence with comedy and serious heist elements. It was set in a
realistic world, but the characters and their motivations were not. It
felt like it was trying to rekindle the essence of a Tarantino cool bad
guy heist film like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but missed the
mark. I found myself not believing the heist scenarios enough or having
enough of a stake in them. It needed a stronger overall macguffin.The use of Music was unique, but I would've have got more out of it if
more obscure music was used, like what the GTA video game series does
curating amazing forgotten B-side gems from famous artists.I felt like Jamie Foxx's acting talent was a bit wasted, and the bland
Atlanta backdrop seemed like a production budget restraint. I wonder
what city was written in the original script? I doubt anyone writes for
Atlanta. Rather than transporting us to a cool city that feels lived in
and feels like a real location, this just felt like a boring block of
downtown brick buildings to shoot car chases and shootouts in.I love most of Edgar Wright's other films, so I'm not sure why this was
so boring for me. It just didn't do anything new for me and will
probably be forgotten from my film memory years from now.
