Brilliant chemistry between the leads along with wonderful supporting actors

With the premise of an internship at Google; you get the whole deal
with product placements. Luckily "The Internship" manages to stay
afloat as a two hour enjoyable and rather funny Google advert.The film begins with Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) losing
their jobs as fast talking watch salesmen facing an uncertain future
thanks to the digital age. Managing to talk their way into an
internship (against all odds) at Google, they find themselves facing
off against smart and tech-savvy college kids aka "a mental Hunger
Games" for jobs at the on-the-line search giant. Ending up with a team
of out casts and facing mostly unreasoned challenges (Read: Quidditch
match), Billy and Nick manage to turn the odds on its head for the
perfect (and predictable) "Lived happily ever after" ending.With previous individual failures Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson come
together once more to share their amazing chemistry on screen. Vince
Vaughen plays the exact same role he has played in every possible film
you've seen of him lately. Since he's co-written the film; I guess he
likes to feel right at home. The same may apply to Owen Wilson who's
landed himself in a similar rut. It does make the whole process rather
familiar but there is no denying that the chemistry both these lead
actors share gives the films premise a new pair of legs every time it
starts lagging a little. Both these actors clearly know their
limitations and have managed to work around it well this time. Also
since this was a PG-13 rated film, some of the vulgarity that you might
associate with these actors is kept to a bare minimum reducing what I
feel are just distractions.Tobit Raphel as home-schooled Yo-Yo was a complete scene stealer as
more often than not he'd have you laughing out loud with his crazy
antics on screen. Dylan O'Brien on the other hand balanced it with his
controlled cynical act of 'know it all' Stuart. Tiya Sircar as Neha was
brilliant as you watch her character go through its curve. Josh Brener
as the 23 year old Team leader Lile starts off brilliantly as he tries
to portray himself as a cool dude but fades away as the love interest
angle falls into place quite predictably.Max Minghella as the films main antagonist Graham is underused and left
with one-liners that are too far and few. Rose Byrne as Wilson's love
interest apart from a single scene comes across as a postscript. Aasif
Mandvi as the internship programs head Mr. Chetty is stereotypically
brilliant and the short chemistry he shares with Billy is entertaining
to watch.Brilliant chemistry between the leads along with wonderful supporting
actors makes you forget the flaws and plot holes blatantly staring at
you. You just go along with that warm fuzzy feeling with a smile
plastered on your face.
