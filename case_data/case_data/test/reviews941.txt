Astonishing and heartbreaking

I just saw this at LFF. It is a brilliant piece of cinema. Clearly it's
central theme is slavery, and the depravity human nature can so easily
reach; but it has many other small moments that trigger thoughts about
wider issues - the role of religion being one for example. It is
violent, and in some respects awful to watch, but this is the story of
Solomon Northup told truthfully. There is nothing saccharine about the
way Steve McQueen presents this and that is what makes it so
astonishing. You cry because what you witness is truly terrible, not
because the violins are out and the director's tugging on your heart
strings. All the acting is first rate, as is the score by Hans Zimmer.
This really should be essential viewing for everyone old enough to
understand it.
