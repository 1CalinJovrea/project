Enervated View with a Vampire

Wasn't planning on watching this, but so many films had it on the
preview reel, that pushed me over the limit. As others have said, this
doesn't add much to the vampire genre, indeed as compared to other
films there doesn't seem to be much at risk.No one's being hunted or haunted, well aside from having a problem when
an in-law comes to town that injects a little life into the film. There
are luxurious scenes of blood as absinthe, orgy-in-a-glass drinking
shots. There's some ham-fisted citing of the world's greatest artists
(even a fake Shakespeare citing, which had gone into hiding for a
while). And there's homage to vampire lore, notably the requisite of an
invitation in.I guess this is a mediation on how love is all that there is to the
world, but as John Hurt's Marlowe points out, why do they (Adam and
Eve...ugh...) live apart? Well, great artists are important as well,
but perhaps only as their art captured their passion.Overall the film felt less passion infused, and more a slow, distracted
foreplay for an MTV debut of a single from the talented Yasmine Hamdam.That's a little unfair, but I walked away contemplating whether I'm a
bit overmusch in my Jarmusch intoxication. Perhaps trace elements of
the vampire ennui infected me? Certainly a film for fans of costume and
props and to a degree locations. Warren Zevon, RIP, would have really
loved to have met the tailors of these Nosferatu two.Please see "Ghost Dog" and at least listen to "Dead Man" first.
