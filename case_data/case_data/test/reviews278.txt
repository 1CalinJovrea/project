Disappointment to Fighters; Plays on Stereotypical, Hyper-Aggressive Male Boxers; Not a Credible Story

As a previous fighter, this movie is a disappointment. The movie
stereotypes boxers as hyper-aggressive characters who need vice and
aggressive behavior to handle the short comings thrown their way.
Gyllenhaal's performance was pretty impressive in contrast to his
previous roles, however it does not save the movie from its bad writing
and directing. Although some of the boxing sequences aren't bad, some
of them are awful and some are impressive, good fight sequences don't
make a story great, and for that matter, a movie.The movie just doesn't have a very credible story, as Billy Hope
accepts fights as early as 4 weeks away from one another, not nearly
enough time to actually prepare for a new opponent. His wife takes on
the "momma knows best role" as she makes the majority of decisions for
him and his family, including their decision for Him to stop fighting,
and when she is accidentally shot, Hopes life spirals out of control.
After engaging in a spree of self- destructive behavior, CPS takes
custody of his child until he can prove that he is a responsible adult.
Normally, this would imply that the movie should be about the Hero
overcoming and conquering himself and his aggressive habits. He is
instructed to go to Anger Management classes, which are not present in
the film, and gets suspended from professional boxing after
head-butting a referee, after his corner throws the towel in for a
fight. After losing his luxurious lifestyle from not having the cash to pay
for his bills, he finds a new gym that is ran by Tick Wills (Forest
Whitaker) so that he may teach young men how to box in hopes that it
will lead them to grow up and become responsible men. Billy Hope cleans
the gym at night for a job and trains with Tick in the mornings so that
he can improve his image and possibly get a few side fights. After
fighting for a charity event, Hope's agent (50 cent) finds him yet
again pressuring him to get back into the ring, that he can get his
suspension lifted and makes a $30 million offer to fight Miguel Escobar
only 6 weeks away, a disgustingly short amount of time away to prepare
for a fight. Understandably, these quick fights are supposed to
represent the greed of his Agent making money, but fights like this at
the professional level, at the championship level do not happen this
quickly, ever.Billy Hope takes the offer and continues to train with Tick Wills, but
for this upcoming fight, it's back to fundamentals. During a montage
with Eminem in the background, Billy Hope is working on basic things
like stance, bobbing and weaving, blocking punches, blocking punches
with your shoulder and other very basic things like that you couldn't
have previously won a championship without, that apparently Billy Hope
did. Meanwhile, Miguel Escobar is doing hardcore ab-workouts, and going
hard on a double-ended bag, things that real professionals work on,
also things that you couldn't otherwise do at that speed, without
previously working on basic things like Billy is currently working on.
Billy also works on boxing Southpaw upon Ticks suggestion.Night of the fight, Billy and Miguel go at it, it is a very close one,
and of course Billy Hope is hit with a low blow and whenever Miguel
can't win the round, he mentions something to Billy about his wife
which causes him to get very angry. Round 12 comes around and after a
long round Billy connects and then connects again with a left handed
uppercut.The movie shouldn't be named "Southpaw" just on the premise that the
winning punch was left handed. I really thought I was coming in to see
a really awesome Southpaw performance out of Jake Gyllenhal, as those
fighters give a different dynamic to a fight; Southpaws screw everybody
up, even other Southpaw fighters, because everyone is used to fighting
right-handed fighters. I give this movie a 5 because it plays on
stereotypically, hyper-aggressive male behavior in boxers, and because
the story just wasn't very credible. Impressive fight- sequences don't
save a movie from the use of too many melodramatic scenes of one on one
dialogue.
