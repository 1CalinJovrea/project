Annoying, Silly, Boring and Disappointing

A screenwriter (Chris Evans) is assigned to write the screenplay of a
romantic comedy by his agent Bryan (Anthony Mackie), but he has
difficulties to deal with the theme since he was abandoned by his
mother when he was a boy. He unsuccessfully tries to have information
about love from his friends that are also writers. When he meets a
beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) in a charity event, he is shaken by
the unknown feeling and they become friends. Further, he discovers that
she is engaged of a man that represents stability for her."Playing It Cool" is an annoying, silly, boring and disappointing
romantic comedy with an awful story of a man that does not believe in
love due to a traumatic experience in his childhood. Indeed it is a
collection of clich√©s. The characters are shallow and not well
developed. The beautiful smile of Michelle Monaghan is the best that
this film can offer. There are also many cameos only to give their
names to the credit. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Deixa Rolar" ("Let It Go")
