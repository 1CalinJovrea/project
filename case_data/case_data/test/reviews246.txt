What is wrong with the world !!

This was a great movie and exactly what I needed! I know from now on to
not listen to most of the reviews on here at all. They are the opposite
of good!? This was along the lines of Into The Wild, not as good but
not bad at all and worth watching. Well done! This could be called a
chick flick for real women who want substance, Strength and
encouragement from the female in the role. When the world gets to much
and is sucking your life away- Get the heck out and walk, climb a
mountain , ride a horse ! Push the boundaries of what you think you are
capable of and learn! I cried , it was good. I didn't know anything
about it until I watched it. I have been coming to IMDb to pick movies
with good ratings and people giving good reviews. Only to be
disappointed time and again. If you like the Idea of the film , you
will likely enjoy it as much as I did.
