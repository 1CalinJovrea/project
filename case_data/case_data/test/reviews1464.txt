The deer was killed by its tail

Yes well-crafted, yes gripping, yes different and somewhat
thought-provoking. But..........a good thriller is all the better if
it's believable, and unfortunately a couple of seriously implausible
plot twists really took the edge off it for me....as in, I didn't buy
into the ending. Shame.
