Ask yourself, what am I expecting from this (or any) experience?

I honestly don't understand the bad reviews behind this film. I'm
writing this, not as a review of the events or themes that take place;
but rather, a questioning of expectations from the average film viewer. It should be fairly obvious that to enjoy any motion picture, one must
enable their sense of disbelief. This means when you watch a fantasy
film or show you don't question the reality of wands, spells, dragons,
etc. Instead, you allow yourself to be immersed within the story. After
all, the entire point of art is to transport yourself within the world
of the artist. I take issue with criticism from professional critics to the average
person on the basis of "realism," "continuity," and/or any other tropes
related to the experience of (in this case film), art.This movie uses certain themes that have a major impact in the possible
near future as its basis for storytelling, and therefore, I can see why
some might attempt to hold the themes as a basis to grade its merits. I must contest this though as I would say you don't read an Asimov,
Clarke, Dick, novel and complain that your predictions of the future
aren't the same as the author's do you? While watching this I'm
reminded of my experience of watching "Minority Report" and it's safe
to say that that version of the future hasn't come close to existing
yet, but nonetheless it's a masterful bit of storytelling. The point
though is this, sure there are holes in almost any plot, especially in
films that don't coincide with our present day notions of reality; but
what has that to do with our ability to enjoy a film?Be honest with yourself for a moment, when you're watching anything but
a documentary (and even then..) you're primary concern is the
entertainment value. To which, this film delivers in spades. There's great drama, great action, great acting, and one person playing
7 roles. What more could you ask for? Anyone who denigrates this film,
I have to know, what are your expectations, and what are your favorite
films? 8/18/17 23:38
