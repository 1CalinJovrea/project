McG is back.

Music video director McG's first feature, Charlie's Angels, received a
fair amount of critical backlash, but I found it to be pretty
entertaining in an inconsequential and undemanding way; however, the
subsequent stinker of a sequel and the abysmal Terminator Salvation had
me writing the director off as a no-hoper. Now, Netflix original The
Babysitter, a tongue-in-cheek tween horror, sees McG bouncing back,
delivering a film that, while short on logic and heavy on the gimmicky
music video style editing, guarantees a lot of mindless fun.Judah Lewis plays timid twelve-year-old Cole, the target of local
bullies; Cole's only friends are pretty neighbour Melanie (Emily Alyn
Lind), and his sexy babysitter Bee (Samara Weaving). When Cole's
parents leave for the weekend, leaving him in the care of Bee, Melanie
dares the boy to stay awake to see what his babysitter gets up to after
he is in bed. Spying from the landing, Cole sees Bee and several
friends playing spin the bottle followed by a spot of ritualistic
murder and some dabbling in the occult. Panicking, Cole tries to make
his escape, but in doing so, alerts Bee and her pals, who give chase.
What follows is like a demented version of Home Alone, Cole using
household items and cunning to prevent himself from becoming the next
victim of Bee and her friends.Admittedly, it all gets a bit far fetched at times, particularly with
the surrounding neighbours seemingly oblivious to the explosions,
gunshots and general mayhem occurring across the street, but solid
performances, the fast pace, and the creative and gory death scenes all
go to making this a very enjoyable time-waster.
