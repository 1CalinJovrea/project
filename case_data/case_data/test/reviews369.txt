A punk rock band is brought into playing at skinhead club. After their
set, whilst hey are leaving the club, by mistake they end up in the
wrong room and witness a murder. Tension rises between the club
managers and the band who are forced into a room and trapped in there
whilst Darcy (Patrick Stewart), the head of the skinhead fellowship as
well as the owner of the club, tries to put together a plan before
things go too south.Written and directed by one of the most promising rising directors of
this time, Jeremy Saulnier, "Green Room" is one of those perfectly
packaged thrillers, with originality of premise and style, perfect
pacing and tight well-knit editing and whilst it may be a little
chaotic it never looses the investment in character.One of the big surprises of 2016, after all the buzz I simply couldn't
wait to check this movie out, its intriguing premise and unique cast
were fascinating and I can confidently say that the film delivers on
both.Whilst we have had many thrillers in the past where people get locked
into a room and have to find a way to escape, we haven't yet had one
with this unique voice behind it. Saulnier manages to spin around with
the premise and deliver a thriller that is stylish without being noisy
or overdone. The catalyst of the whole plot works perfectly and the
characters who are set up brilliantly in the first ten minutes work
wonderfully in this environment.The instant world building the director manages to convey through
visuals is absorbing, it places the viewer right in the middle of the
chaos and manages to never loose the geography of the setting. The
cinematography of the film early on delivers some beautiful and
insightful shots that perfectly serve the story and set up, but once
sh*t starts hitting the fan the editing of the film comes majorly into
play and does a superb job. The tense atmosphere conveyed through color
and pace never leaves the screen and pervades the audience in every
second of the movie until the end.Just as deserving is definitely the make up department which has a
couple of really key moments that hit the viewer like a brick and
contribute in giving a sense of anxiety and fear that once again is
appended to the audience for the whole duration. Ultimately it also
comes down to the three central performances by Yelchin, Poots and
Stewart, whom are all remarkably great, the highlight definitely being
Poots for me who manages to totally disappear in the role to the point
that I didn't know she was in the film until I read the cast list. I
have been a big supporter of her and can't wait to see what she gives
us in the future.Where the movie slightly looses its flow is in clarity of motivations
and the logistical movements where I found myself repeatedly uncertain.
As I said before, you never loose the thrill nor the location and
empathy for the characters, you are always behind them and want them to
get the fu*k out of that hell. The problem resides in the fact that too
many times I was unclear on why what was happening was happening, why
were the skinheads acting the way they were and why were they going
batsh*t crazy. This also takes something away from Stewart's
performance which on its own stands as great, yet never really plays
into the big picture because of the chaos which ensues not being ever
understandable by the audience."Green Room" still remains a more than worthy effort, a great thriller,
a fantastic lesson in editing and a magnificent does of anxiety and
adrenaline.
