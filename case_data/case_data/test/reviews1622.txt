Nothing new to offer

Movie Name : The Expendables 3 Genre : Action Rating : Average 2.5 /5Expendables 3 was better than its predecessor where bunch of popular
tough guys from early 80's and 90's collaborate and gives you gun-
throttling action popcorn entertainment.Barney must locate and confront the ex-member of the expendables,
Stonebank before he eliminates Barney and his team members.Directed by Patrick Huges, The Expendables 3 promises to have more
impact then its predecessor but falls flat on the face. It is just an
average flick with old wine in a new bottle. If you have been a great
fan of Stallone , Schwarzenegger , Mel-Gibson , Statham then you might
enjoy the film otherwise the screenplay has nothing new to offer. . Few
scenes were entertaining with punching dialogues ... good action
sequences ... good story line !! Unfortunately , it is just a
time-pass. It is Stallone and team which makes this worth-watching at
least once.Overall , if you have liked 90's action stars , this movie is meant for
you otherwise stay away from it !!!www.facebook.com/FilmyChowk
