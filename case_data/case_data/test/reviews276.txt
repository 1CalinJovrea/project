Our every year ritualistic going-to-the-theater-to-watch-a Marvel-movie finally begins.

I feel like a drone. Every year Marvel comes out with its new set of
movies and every year like drones we all go out to see them. And for
this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or
originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we
have been given a command: "This year you will see the following movies
and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!" Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time
special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing.
Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big
budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in
Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars
(ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the
Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum
in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing,
so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the
flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie
that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame
myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie
and then decide.And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to
Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer
has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as
seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt
Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of "No/Luke....I
am your father." It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and
special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words
"enjoyable" or "exciting." I'll just say, "Ritual completed, onto the
next superhero movie."Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for
seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us
who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which
are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs
thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$,
hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you. If
ya got nothing better to do then what else should ya do??I'd just like to rename this movie: Guardians of Ga'ahoole: The Owls of
the Galxay.
