Headache

If you really like fighting with your spouse for two hours, then this
movie is for you. When Delpy and Hawke aren't arguing, they are
throwing around cheap, pop culture observations about feminism,
careerism, child rearing, divorce, literature and philosophy. The Greek
scenery is just a silent backdrop to their incessant prattling. The
movie could have as well been filmed in Peoria. The first and second
movie in this trilogy, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, had charm and
some dramatic interest, plus European settings that related to the plot
and action. Aside from a long dinner table conversation with some other
couples that was humorous and stimulating, Before Midnight was
essentially boring and pointless.
