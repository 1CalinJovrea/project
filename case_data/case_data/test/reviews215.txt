Fulfills Its Popcorn Intentions But Little Else

Safe House is a movie that fulfils its popcorn intentions, but
metaphorically brings to mind the image of a bobble-head  a bloated
brain supported by little else, springing uncontrollably in different
directions. When the action ramps up, Safe House is at its best,
providing ample energy, a plethora or gunplay and a number of gritty
combat sequences. When pausing to forward the plot, spew exposition or
focus on perfunctory romances, it grinds to a halt. Safe House would be
better viewed with a remote equipped with a fast forward button nearby.Thankfully for Safe House, the sequences with action outnumber those
without, so it comes out on top on a percentage basis alone. What makes
it slip just out of the realm of solid praise is that it really fails
as a tense, psychological duel of wits. I mean c'mon you have the one
of the coolest actors working today (Denzel Washington of course)
trying to escape his confines with only a lowly safe house guard (Ryan
Reynolds) in his way  use it! The trailers and radio ads prominently
feature the line "I'm already in your head", but the movie itself
offers little in the way of subtle manipulation or mind games. All we
get are a few scenes where Washington's Tobin Frost intimidates the
crap out of the inexperienced operative and forebodingly warns that the
CIA will screw him one day. Now that I've kicked this movie while it's down, let me tell you what
it does very well: bloodshed. I already mentioned the ample high-octane
set pieces, but of course volume of action does not always translate
directly to a solid film ("Transformers" springs to mind) it has to
bring something to the table. Safe House earns its R-rating in many an
instance with sometimes uncomfortably realistic shootouts, brutal
interrogations and wonderfully choreographed (but wince-inducing) hand-
to-hand combat sequences. If you think that John McClane looks rough at
the end of a "Die Hard" flick, wait until you see how Reynolds looks
when the credits roll. Refreshingly, this is not the kind of movie
where a character is shot, grits his teeth a little bit, holds his
wound and then ten minutes later they have apparently forgotten about
it. You feel every punch and when somebody gets stabbed they writhe on
the floor in pain and when somebody gets shot they are likely not
getting back up. There are also a handful of lengthy chase sequences through the streets
of Cape Town, a soccer stadium and the slums of Langa and in all
instances deliver. They are easy to follow, high-energy and far more
real-world than we're normally accustomed when talking about a
Hollywood car chase. In all of these sequences (automotive or
otherwise) we have Reynolds front and center. Safe House is really a
Ryan Reynolds movie masquerading as a Denzel Washington film, though
that is not to say Washington is relegated to a just supporting role,
it is simply more focused on our in-way-over-his-head rookie than the
lethal pro. Reynolds is the surprise here, not only holding his own
against the veteran but delivering his best mainstream performance to
date (there is not a hint of his wise-cracking The Green Lantern or
Deadpool characters to be found here). Curiously, there were very few one-liners delivered by Washington and
though he oozed charisma through his presence alone, I would have liked
to see a little more sizzle; one more duty that lands on the script,
which just offers nothing in the way of interesting dialogue, insights
into the mind of a killer or even a brisk pace for that matter. As a
movie to pop in the DVD player with some buds, however (one that you
can tune out the downtimes between action set pieces) it delivers
absolutely and does offer one of the rarer instances for Washington to
do his bad guy thing  a welcome sight.Rating: 6.5/10
