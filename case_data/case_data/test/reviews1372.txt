Great movie for father-son cinema trip

Walking to cinema with my 5yo I had big doubts if this will not turn on
like Lego Batman. An overly dynamic film with nothing but gags. To tell
the truth I was physically tired after watching Batman, due to all this
chaos that was happening there. Ninjago is totally different movie and
as a family movie it works better than previous two Lego movies,
maitaining dynamic action sequences. What one NEEDS to know is that
this is a complete restart of Ninjago universe (like with Spiderman
movie series). Although characters are the same, whole story, origin,
background is different. Can you imagine Ninjago without Spinjitzu?
You'd better, because only time we will hear about it will be in a joke
scene.This is a new generation's dawn of Ninjago. It can easily turn into a
series. What I regret is that movie does not relate to TV series.
Basically you can be totally fresh in Ninjago universe and go watch
this movie. My 5y did not complain though :)
