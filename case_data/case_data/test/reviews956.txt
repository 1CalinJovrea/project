VIEWS ON FILM review of Daddy's Home

Will Ferrell's latest is a 2015 release that's less amusing than his
boldest endeavors (The Campaign comes to mind). Let's just call Daddy's
Home Ferrell lite shall we. At 96 minutes, "Home" as a comedy is stupid
funny without being hilarious. It's like a mild hack job from director
Sean Anders. Sean's leads (Willy Boy and Mark Wahlberg) are perfectly
cast with a few laughs seeping through. However, the screenplay by
"Home's" three writers is just meh. A creepy Thomas Haden Church (he
plays a radio station owner) giving insensible advice is not amusing. A
gag involving a dog who looks ragged while possessing silver-colored
eyes is also not amusing. A scene where characters dance with each
other instead of fight each other is kind of half-baked. And finally,
what's with the adage of locales used in Daddy's Home. Twenty minutes
in and I thought things took place in Los Angeles, California. Come to
find out that New Orleans, LA was the primary setting. I guess a car
license plate and Pelicans basketball gave it away. Natch.Anyway, the three main characters in "Home" are in a sense, labeled.
Their identities are sledgehammered towards the audience as if they
were types. Brad Whitaker (Ferrell) is the dimwitted stepdad, a doofus
lacking self-confidence and an easy target for ridicule. Dusty Mayron
(Wahlberg) is the biological dad, a manipulative jerk who deals in
childcare MIA (he's also a slimy badass). Finally, Sara Whitaker
(played by Linda Cardellini) is the spouse of Brad, a beautiful yet
dull housewife who seems to be caught in the middle of it all.Slapstick antics of the obligatory kind ensue with Brad Whitaker
crashing a large motorcycle into his house, Whitaker punching Dusty
without so much as a flinch, Whitaker getting drunk and hitting a
cheerleader at a basketball game (with a b ball), and finally, Whit
getting electrocuted while trying to skateboard in a backyard
half-pipe. I chuckled, I winced, I checked my phone, and I eventually
left the theater. The whole time I thought, this flick got
green-lighted because of actor notoriety. There's no other explanation.The story is as follows: Brad works as a radio executive and shares a
beautiful house with his wife Sara plus her two kids (Scarlett Estevez
and Owen Vaccaro as Dylan and Megan Mayron). He loves being a
stepfather to them even though they haven't warmed up to Brad yet. Just
as he is about to make a connection with said ankle-biters, in walks
Dusty Mayron, their real father who's been away too long and is making
up for lost time. Dusty I guess, works in black ops (that's what a
couple of other reviews said but I wasn't entirely sure). He drives an
intimidating chopper, he can build an intimidating tree house, and he
has the radio voice to make mad royalties. Dusty's motivation is to get
his kids back, remarry his ex-wife, and eventually give her another
baby. He even persuades Brad and Sara to let him stay at their home for
an extended period of time. What happens next is you guessed it, an
old- fashioned "dad-off". Both of these dudes compete against each
other for the affection of two adolescent tykes. Examples would be
early Christmas for the kids (in April), complete with tons of presents
including a pony. Another example would be the kids meeting Kobe Bryant
while sitting in $18,000 seats (at an NBA game). Oh and who can forget
Dusty telling fun, bedtime stories while slipping them each twenty
bucks. I wish I got that kind of dough when I was seven.All in all, watch for a lot of erratic jokes, PG-13 fare that doesn't
really push the envelope, Ferrell being Ferrell, and Wahlberg being
Wahlberg. And despite feeling like a vehicle that was cooked up over a
couple of days, Daddy's Home has already made a ton of money ($162
million-plus). Bottom line: Everyone involved (the filmmakers, the
producers, the studio executives) is probably laughing all the way to
the bank. Rating: 2 stars.Of note: I read somewhere that Mark Wahlberg has achieved enough
success to the point where he's not trying to impress critics or parlay
audience members. He now does movies for his family, or for his own
self- satisfaction, or because he's got clout, or whatever. "Home" is
proof of that. Also of note: For the record, I couldn't tell you
whether Daddy's Home is better than Ferrell/Wahlberg's earlier screen
pairing being 2010's The Other Guys. I have yet to see that cult
worthy, monster hit. Finally, I have to give "Home" points for picking
actors who look alike (this applies to immediate family relations). I
get annoyed when this is not the case (see my review for This Is Where
I Leave You). In reality, if Wahlberg and Linda Cardellini had
children, they would probably look exactly like the young troupers
featured here. Bravo to the casting department.
