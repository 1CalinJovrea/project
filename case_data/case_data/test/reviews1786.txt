Cashing in

My wife and I began watching this with enthusiasm; we respect and love
the main actors in this film, but after 45 minutes, we had had enough
and left the theatre out of respect for our memories of their other
great films.It has a nice concept, older guys having a blast in Las Vegas, but it
constantly has the impression that lots of scenes were filmed apart,
and put together to make it look like they're all together. When they
are together they gel well enough, and they deliver their lines,
fulfill their roles... That's it. It's mildly amusing because it is set
up. It doesn't flow naturally.The best parts of what I saw in half the film were the lead actors; the
worst are all the other actors who aren't strong, and are clearly
trying to not take the spotlight as if it might take focus away from us
having to focus on the main cast.It is a film about De Niro, Freeman etc., not about the characters they
portray. It's just another excuse to get lots of famous people together
for fun.It's not terrible, it just isn't good.
