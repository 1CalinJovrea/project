Awful remake - another Asian gem destroyed by Hollywood

It seems like destroying Asian masterpieces is Hollywood's latest
obsessions if they're not whitewashing roles or putting out racist
stereotypes.Here are some of the more Asian stories that they have destroyed:
Avatar: The Last Airbender Battle Royale (with the atrocious ripoff,
the hunger games) Dragon Ball EvolutionThis film is no different. They changed the story and it blew up in
their face. Whatever tension you felt in the brilliant Korean original,
you will miss in this iteration. It's just cliché after cliché with
boring acting.It's a terrible film that even their racist casting can't fix.Serves you right, racist Hollywood. All your garbage remakes will fail
just like they always have.Side note: it's funny how racists love calling Asians "copy cats" yet
look at who is copying Asian stories. Just saying....
