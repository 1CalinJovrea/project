Robocrap

OK, this movie probably isn't a 1 out of 10, but when you remake a
movie as memorable as the original Robocop, you'd better do something
interesting. They didn't.No, I didn't watch the original first, I watched it afterwards and that
is the problem. You watch Robocop 2014 and think "Meh, pretty
entertaining" and then you watch the original and get taken on a roller
coaster ride.I'm not going to re-hash the original movie here, it would be a waste
of effort. Just do yourself a favour and don't waste your time on Robo
2014, search out the original Robocop. You won't be disappointed. The
flick isn't nearly as dated as you would expect aside from the clothes
and the vehicles. The humour is dark, dirty and noir at its best.
Detroit looks nasty - the way anyone who has never been to 2014 Detroit
would expect it to look. The criminals are drugged out wackos - the
type of criminals you expect to see in 2014. The cops are cannon fodder
- unlike the cops of 2014, who are far more trigger happy and eager to
save their own skins. Clearly Paul Verhoeven didn't understand the
magnitude of the police state that America would become - google the
number of American's in prison if you doubt me.Really simple here, folks - watch Robocop 1987, not this generic crap.Hollywood, you would have made more money re-releasing the original.
