At first i want to say that this is my first review and i'm pretty
exited to talk about this amazing film.What i liked most about this film is that it's just as beautifully
filmed, acted and told as the paintings Maud painted.I loved the cinematography in this film. If you're a fan of cinema I'll
bet you'll like it.The acting is also incredible. Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke are
amazing in this film. the rest of the cast is really good as well.This is easily one of the best drama's out there. So i suggest you
watch it.I want to tell you more but it's better to see for yourself.Thanks for reading this (short) review
