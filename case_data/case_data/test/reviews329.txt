A Truly Bad Movie and I was a huge Before Sunrise fan

I can consider myself a fan of the before series of films, I saw Before
Sunrise years before the sequel came out and hipsters started jumping
on the band wagon of this film. To explain why before midnight fails I
need to explain the film from the perspective of both Before Sunrise
and Before Sunset.Now Before Sunrise was a slightly flawed yet still really captivating
and original film about two people who randomly by chance meet in
Europe, Jesse the American and Celine the french girl. They walk around
together for a day until dawn and then Jesse must catch his plane back
to America and thats it the end, they agree to meet up again a year
later but as we find out in Before Sunset that falls apart.Now Before Sunrise is cute because they are both supposed to be 23 in
the film and its OK for 23 year olds to have stupid ideas or be overly
dramatic because hey they are young and thats how it works. In Before
Sunrise the cracks started to show, the film still held up but the plot
began to meander into strange directions, first off when they meet up
again they still decide to be "cutesy" around each other which is a
little odd for people in their thirties to be that way. But the
cuteness of the situation is allowed as they haven't seen each other in
a long time, also the weakness of Before Sunset exists because get this
Jesse writes an acclaimed book to get Celine back and the book is about
how they both met.The concept of Jesse as an author is weak because it is very apparent
that the guy is kind of stupid and a goof, there is never any
indication of depth or being an articulate human being. The other thing
is in Before Sunset you get the feeling these two should not be
together, they are different and Celine gets annoyed by Jesse but that
of course is all very slight. The "celine getting annoyed by Jesse"
plot line takes the front and center part of the stage in Before
Midnight.Really this should have just been two movies, I truly believe that. In
part one they separate at the end and in part two they get back
together and stay together and just leave it at that. Before Midnight
first off doesn't function quite well because of this fact, Jesse and
Celine still have stupid cheap back and forth banter between each other
except that doesn't make sense because now they aren't 23 and they
definitely haven't gone a long time without seeing each other so they
are 40 somethings who argue about nothingness.During the first segment of the movie, Jesse and Celine driving back
from the airport with their daughters in the back, Celine gives Jesse a
hard time about eating one of their daughters apples but in a way a 14
year old would taunt another 14 year old not the way a couple in a long
term relationship would act. There are many examples of that and thus
begins a two hour long film filled with Celine's passive aggressive and
aggressive aggressive attitude towards Jesse.You get the feeling Celine truly and genuinely hates every aspect of
her life, she is with a guy that she thinks is dumb, she has two kids
when she never wanted any kids, her environmental job always results in
failures and having to work with idiots shes annoyed by every aspect of
her existence and its truly miserable to have to watch her. There's
nothing entertaining or charming about Celine, she is simply very very
bitter at Jesse for "ruining" her life by getting involved with her.Now the argument here is "well this is reality" OK watching paint dry
is also an element of reality it doesn't mean I want to go to a movie
theater and experience it. This film is different there's none of that
whimsical carefree attitude that exists in the first two movies. The
few brief moments of entertainment come from Celine not being around,
Jesse has some conversations early on with some author who invited him
out to Greece to stay with him.Also when Jesse and Celine arrive at the hotel the owner of the hotel
asks Jesse to sign a copy of the books he has written then begs Celine
to sign them which she refuses because being angry and bitter is all
she knows how to be in this film. Finally Jesse pressures her into
signing them, but shes angry as always. Also twice Celine is on the
phone with Jesse's son and then hangs up before he has a chance to chat
with him, which is actually pretty rude.This was such a garbage movie, an utter waste of time and talent,
although probably not that much of a waste of time for those who made
it I am sure they shot it and scripted it in about 5 days. The critics
have all praised this movie but they only praise things that are
different, and sitting and listening to two people argue incessantly on
screen for 2 hours is certainly different but also stupid.
