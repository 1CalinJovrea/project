Damaged people damaging themselves further.  Good but not great.

I had a conversation recently with a friend who stated "The French only
make good films." His reasoning behind this statement was that all the
French films he's seen on general release here have impressed him. The
same may be said for German films. And Iranian. And Korean. And The
reason being that, generally speaking, films that perform poorly
domestically aren't worth promoting on the foreign markets. Hence he
judges the French film industry on Jean de Flourette, Belleville
Rende-vous, La Haine etc. (just don't tell him about Les Visiteurs or
the god-awful Asterix films!). Rust and Bone will serve to perpetuate
the myth of his own making, though it is certainly not the 'great' that
some have implied.More than anything, Rust and Bone is about damaged people and the
challenges and relationships that arise from such damage. Alain
(Matthias Schoenaerts) is Damaged Goods Number One and arrives in
Antibes with his son to stay with his estranged sister and her husband,
who have plenty of issues of their own, not least of all financial.
Taking a job as a nightclub bouncer, Alain meets Stéphanie (Marion
Cotillard), Damaged Goods Number Two, who appears to solve her personal
issues via rough sex with strangers. Alain 'saves' her from herself one
night and months later, having suffered rather more 'damage' (I'm being
cagey here lest I inflict unwelcome plot spoilers on you), Stéphanie
contacts him again and a relationship of mutual protection and support
ensues.Rust and Bone isn't an uplifting film in the manner of, say, Oscar-bait
Intouchables but it does leave the viewer with a generally positive
feeling. For those who hate their bodies, it's a little like eating
half a Big Mac (it tastes quite good but your body will suffer for it)
and for those who look after themselves, it's like running a half
marathon (it hurts like hell but the sense of achievement makes it
worthwhile). There are some genuinely shocking moments but most of
these are the result of realizing how troubled the protagonists are.Performance wise, both Schoenaerts and Cotillard give their all and
succeed in making us pity them, judge them and wish that we could show
them another way to get through life. Maybe they are extreme versions
of what we see around us every day if we care to look, but they are
convincingly sad, broken and brutal nonetheless Rust and Bone is a good
film. But don't judge the French film industry on it. There is so much
else on offer that reaches the both ends of the scale.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at
