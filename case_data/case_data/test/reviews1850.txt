Gyllenhaal is excellent with a strong supporting cast

STRONGER (2017) *** 1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Tatiana Maslany, Miranda
Richardson, Richard Lane, J r., Nate Richman, Lenny Clarke, Clancy
Brown, Carlos Sanz. Gyllenhaal is excellent in his portrayal of Jeff
Bauman who lost his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing and the
aftermath of his life in an attempt to regain his life for better
including his estranged yet super supportive girlfriend Maslany
(equally good) with his friends and family included for better or
worse. The struggle to not only physically acclimate to the near
impossible is only counterbalanced with the emotional and mental
anguish to move forward and also to become a better person in the long
run. Filmmaker David Gordon Green wisely shows the warts-and-all of a
real-life character and a strong screenplay adaptation by John Pollono
on Bauman and Bret Witter's book.
