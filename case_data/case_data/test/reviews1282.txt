Worst film in the franchise. Almost unwatchable.

Went into this with high expectations which weren't met. Most of the
film has the Avengers fighting each other, with themselves being the
bad guys. Lots of phony CGI action, lots of preaching about how bad the
Avengers are because some innocent people got killed while they were
doing their thing. Most of this film was boring, as I had a real
problem suspending my disbelief. Seems like the social justice jerks
made this film.Toward the end I couldn't see how any happy ending could take place,
and there wasn't one. Maybe if there's a sequel the Avengers will be
friends again, but I'd much rather not have spent all this time waiting
for something that didn't happen in this film. This movie tried to be a
drama instead of an action movie, but that's not what I wanted to see. If you really like watching the heros beating each other up and
spending lots of time in jail, you'll like this film. If you like lots
of agonizing over broken families, you'll like this film. If you think
the collectivists at the UN ought to keep the Avengers in line, you'll
just love this film. Oh, and there's physical therapy for broken
Avengers, ain't that just grand.I thought this movie sucked. There are lots of things that would be
more fun than this film: hitting yourself with a hammer, running
headfirst into a wall, or tearing off your fingernails with pliers come
to mind. Any of those things would be preferable to watching this lousy
movie again!
