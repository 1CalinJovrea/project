Really worth watching.

I found this film to be all that i hoped it would be. It was thought
provoking, with brilliant acting from all the main characters. People
today will find it hard to understand that these things really could,
and did happen, because it took place in an era of "Non Politically
Correctness". Although I agree that it does stray somewhat from the
Books original story-line, it does not detract in anyway what the
Author was trying to convey. Well done to a film that uses no Mirrors
or Special Effects, but relies solely on a Good Author and an excellent
cast.
