Good retelling of the events

It's a realistic portrayal of the events that happened, so don't expect
action packed Hollywood style heroics. It reflects the growing tension
of all participants over the 6 days until the climax of events. As
others mention the Kate Adie character seems pointless other than
filling out time. Overall well worth watching.
