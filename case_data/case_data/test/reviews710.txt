Dumb, Dumb, and Dumber

I would pay money to not see this movie. Honestly, these wonderful
actors deserve a better plot line and script.I was disappointed that so
many of my favorite actors where in it. Its just a disgusting film. In
reality, most of the actors were forced to act in this due to
legalities and contracts. Also,a good rule of thumb: do not see a movie
where the top three words to describe it are the following: shame,
embarrassment, and gross-out. Why would a director think it would be a
good idea to throw in a scene where parents sexually harass their kid?
Regardless of humorous intent, this film is mean. Please do not let
your kids see this movie, unless you want to have to deal with the
repercussions.
