Just amazing

"The Handmaiden" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by
Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a
pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich
woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of
course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.Chan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by
Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion
of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a
little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and
fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty
and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the
story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot
development will just add fun to the whole.If the plot and the direction weren't amazing enough, the movie is as
beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to
the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene
comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This
is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible
job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some
of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to
be able to pass as them).All in all, "The Handmaiden" is proof that a movie can have a plot,
amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful
package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long,
it feels like a breeze.You will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great.
