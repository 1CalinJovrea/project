Modern Family meets Anthony Bourdain

In keeping with our ongoing food in media culture (top chef, iron chef,
survivor new guinea (cannibal chef)) we now have simply "Chef" the feel
good "indie" movie of the year. Indie as in some really rich guys got
together with some really famous, and quirky!, actors to make a movie.
Don't believe for a minute that product placement (tweet) would have
any place in an "indie" movie, or in independent internet reviews
either. (Twitter me at #sethlovestwitter). Tweet, Tweet.The story unfolds with some really great sounding New Orleans style
music, briefly raising my expectations that this would be based in New
Orleans, have a New Orleans food theme, or even feature some bayou
settings like that other indie movie I once saw about some black kid
who wanders around the bayou a lot. Some fancy chopping soon made me
realize we were being shown the kitchen of either a master chef or
possibly a ginzu knife commercial, but that could never happen in an
indie film. Nope, if the title wasn't a dead give away I soon learned
this must be the chef guy as he barks out orders to his cheerful
assistants step-ol√© and fetch-ye. Wow, this guy is really into dead
pigs as he lovingly dissects the porker accompanied by the every
encouraging Pancho and Cisco. Luckily before he can get a little too
into this awkward pig loving, the chef is yanked from his sanctum to go
pick up his kid from school. Now, before you run out to see this film
yourself, I should warn you that pork, bacon, ham, deep frying, donuts,
butter and more, all feature prominently in this drama. So all you
vegans, kosher or halal loving people be forewarned.Is it any wonder W.C. fields warned not to perform with children or
animals? The "little miss sunshine" of this feature is adorable Emjay
Anthony who does a fine job of making his father and pretty much
everyone else seem rather unlikable in contrast. We soon find that the
chef guy is a divorced dad who has the usual Hollywood tribulations of
trying to figure out whether to spoil his kid by taking him to
amusement parks, or maybe just New Orleans. But chef is also down on
his luck, we know this because his beemer is downright old but still
cool in a classic kind of way. His unlikely ex-wife is played by the
ever buxom Sofia Viagra who specializes in this kind of role a'la
modern family. They could have just brought in the kid from modern
family as well but he must be getting too old.Next we find out his boss doesn't want to let him do whatever he wants
in the kitchen. Hey hang on a second his boss is DUSTIN Hoffman, Dustin
freaking Hoffman! What is he doing running a restaurant? Maybe it's
because SCARLETT JOHANSON works there! It all makes sense now. At first
I couldn't tell it was Scarlett because her hair is all black, and she
had matching star tattoos on her shoulders which completely camouflaged
her appearance. Soon enough though Scarlett is up to her old tricks,
curled up on the hapless Chef's bed but never quite getting down to it.
I'm pretty sure this is the case, or maybe they just wanted to spare us
the vision of this poor schlub's hairy back and tattooed arms enmeshed
with our flawless Scarlett. Christ, it was bad enough when he tried to
kiss her.As if trying to choose whether to bang Sofia Viagra or Scarlett
Johanson wasn't enough of a trial, soon the Chef is laid out flat by a
bad restaurant review! First Dustin is bossing him around and now this!
Jeeze Dustin I can remember the day you were a rebel in an Italian
convertible, now look at what a square you turned into.Take this job and shove it, and before you know it we are off to Miami
to meet Robert Downey Junior. For some reason RDJ wants to give Chef a
food truck, only it's completely wrecked. Don't worry though if Tony
Stark can build an Iron Man suit from an Afghanistan cave you can bet
that with a little elbow grease, a few life lessons for Emjay, and we
are set to go all Thelma and Louise. This happens in less time that it
takes to install the hydraulic lift jumpers in a low rider, thanks to
our ever resourceful culinary sidekick Tonto-ye.They never do drive off a cliff, instead they just sell a lot of
grilled cheese and pork sandwiches which lets the Chef get back to his
roots and away from the daily grind of being paid exorbitant sums to to
sprinkle caviar over an egg and then serve hot chocolate lava cake for
dessert. Well after being mugged by a pack of south beach roller skating bikinis
and the mall cop, it's next stop New Orleans (finally) where the Chef
bonds with mini-me by introducing him to beignets. Never mind you could
induce the same effect on any 10 year old by taking him to the Crispy
Kreme in Riverside, do you want to imprint Riverside onto the child?
It's bad enough the kid is already developing some disturbing
voyeuristic tendencies involving his cell phone and internet videos.But don't worry the ever reliable Emjay is a lot more trustworthy with
a camera than say, Paris Hilton, and before you know it Chef has re-
conquered the food world, Sofia Viagra and captured our hearts in the
process. Lets just hope he has the good sense not to let that vixen
Scarlett work in his restaurant again.
