A great must-see family movie that will have you feeling good at the end of the movie.

I took my grand children, and we all really enjoyed 11 year old
Quvenzhane Wallis as Annie. We talked about the movie all the way home.
The entire cast was great! I was skeptical at first, but I was really
surprised, and truly enjoyed the movie. This multi-racial version is
every bit as good as the 1982 version. I enjoyed how Jamie Foxx as Will
Stacks easily fit into his role as a least-likely mayoral candidate,
and made it believable. Cameron Diaz took total control of her role as
the foster care mother, Hannigan that. Bobby Cannavale as Stacks
campaign manager, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, as Stack's drive, David
Zayas as Lou, and the rest of the amazing supporting cast really owned
their roles. This is a must-see family movie with a great twist in the
ending.
