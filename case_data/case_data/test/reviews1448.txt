Better than expected

To start the animation in the film is a upgrade compared to the TV
show. The plot is interesting, the Mane 6 must go on a mission to save
Equestria from the Storm king and his minions. The movie has got
awesome catchy songs as well as great voice acting. Taye Diggs and
Michael Pina provide a comic relief along side funny pony Pinkie Pie.
Leiv Schreiber and Uzo Aduba provided solid voice acting and great
supporting story lines. Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth and Zoe Saldana
all shine in their roles to make this movie better. Princess Twilight,
Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Apple Jack and Fluttershy all shine
perfectly on the big screen making this movie a wonderful adventure for
all ages.
