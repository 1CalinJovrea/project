Soft...

Byzantium is the softer side to the Vampire craze that has taken hold
of the film world. Instead of going for the tragic tween romantic side
of it, or the blood-thirsty war that is the other side of the genre it
wanders somewhere in between. The film starts off a little slow paced, with both of its characters
proving to be nothing special. Saorise Ronan's character (Eleanor)
tells her woeful tale of how she came to be and Gemma Arterton's
character (Clara) is seemingly living a life of fun. But the story
unravels and you learn just how hard their lives were/are. Clara's
story is harsh and pitiful, but nothing special and she acknowledges
that, just moving forward with life, whereas Eleanor is haunted by her
story and yearns to be free of it.The movie's pace increases when you learn of the 'brotherhood' and when
Clara finally fills in the holes of the story that Eleanor is so
obsessed with telling. If the characters don't interest you at this
point then the movie is and will be uninteresting. It will come across
as unoriginal and dull and you'll be fighting to keep your eyes open,
but if you can sympathize with either of the two then the story is
brave and redeeming. You will see the characters as they were meant to
be seen--as a mother and daughter trying to understand one another. The
two have different ways of handling how they take life. Clara sees her
vampire's thirst as a way to help or save those who are weak and prayed
upon by the strong and Eleanor uses her thirst as a means of release
and kills those only ready to die. Neither shy away from what they are
and that, as always, is refreshing.The movie comes across as a whisper and when you watch it you feel as
if you are being told a secret, and maybe you are. I think this movie
is a visceral gem in the vampire franchise and I give the flawed
masterpiece 6.6/10
