Hollywood has fallen

One of the worst I have seen in a while - only didn't walk out because
the 35-year old boy with me seemed to enjoy it (:-). Jingoistic,
racist, ultra-violent, simplistic crap - young male white Ã¼ber-hero
single-handedly saves the American president, yawn... It probably doesn't help that the last film I saw was the wonderful
French "The Intouchables"...However, I do love the "Bourne" trilogy,
"Mercury rising", "Argo" and various other action movies. I just find
it offensive that a gazillion dollars are being wasted on this trash
which could be used to produce something clever, witty, entertaining
but not moronic. Afterthought: Do you really need the money that badly, Morgan? (et al)
