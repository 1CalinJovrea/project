Not so nice

But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss
Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black,
which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and
situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you
are in the right place.Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or
outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not:
Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of
movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the
same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get
something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for
sure
