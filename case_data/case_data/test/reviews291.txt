Brains, braaaaiiiiiins, and tons of fun

It is a truth universally acknowledged that no one really expected
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies to be much good. Silly, campy fun,
assuredly, but no more than an amusing trifle to mindlessly while away
the passing moments. Well, anyone even fleetingly familiar with the
works of Ms. Austen would know that to judge a book by its cover is
exceedingly naughty, while anyone with passing knowledge of the zombie
film would know that a surprising amount are replete with brains in
more ways than one. Thus, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies haughtily
thrusts its chin in the direction of naysayers, by boldly delivering
all the silliness its title proclaims - only with the distinctly Mr.
Darcy-like twist of bringing some of the best of its composite parts
rather than what first impressions might suggest.For a film seemingly more akin to Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, from
the director of two consecutive pieces of Zac Efron fluff,P&P&Z from
its opening moments onward, for a film so intentionally campy and
stupid, is surprisingly sharp and on-point. Rather than pumping the
contrast between its two warring influences strictly for laughs,
writer/director Burr Steers is astute enough to realize the laughs need
not be forced, but come far more unreservedly by committing to the
premise as sincerely as possible. If anything, the film's biggest gag
is being more satisfying as an Austen adaptation than zombie flick, as
there's nitpicking to be had with the film's P3-13 violence (although
Steers gets as gleefully gory as he can within ratings parameters), and
running/talking zombies alike. Still, the twinkling aristocratic wit of
Austenian England and the weary gallows humour of an apocalyptic action
flick blend surprisingly well into one another, and Steers' adaptation
of Seth Grahame-Smith's loving riff taps into the meat of the story,
allowing the slog of a zombie war to tease out and accentuate the key
elements of Austen's satire and characterizations alike (and let's face
it: social faux-pas are just so much more satisfying when underscored
with cathartic flip-kicks and decapitations). The novel's most beloved
moments (including a slick lampooning of the infamous 'Mr. Darcy white
shirt' scene) and key lines are often paired with plucky physical
sparring, amidst perfectly timed bloodbaths just when proceedings start
to stray more into Pride and Prejudice than Zombies.But Steers doesn't stop there, germinating some surprisingly
interesting subtext - subtle aristocratic class distinctions are
determined by whether citizens receive their anti-zombie martial arts
training in Japan or China, while a sliding scale of zombie sentience
allows for a realm of gentrified xenophobia relatively untapped in the
genre. It's a bit of a shame that such a genuinely excellent setup
slides into somewhat of a disappointingly mundane finish, replete with
muddy, abandoned 'Horsemen of the Apocalypse' mythology, and several
subplots jumbling together in a messy and unsatisfying resolution. To
see the dual climaxes of the novel's swooniness and the make-or-break
mass showdown of the zombie war verge on face-planting rather than
soaring is a bummer indeed. Still, Steers maintains such a confidently
jaunty touch throughout, letting the ball dances lilt and the fight
scenes crackle (including at least two unexpected, thunderously loud
head shots which serve as riotous punchlines), that the film is almost
never less than fabulously vibrant and more fun than it has any right
to be.Faced with retooling one of the most iconic protagonists in literary
history, Lily James' Lizzie Bennett is commendably feisty and badass
enough to firmly sate fans of either genre. Though Austen-diehards
might fault her controversial slight teariness (you try having to
constantly fend off the undead amidst the claustrophobic constraints of
polite society and not feeling a little weepy sometimes), James' steely
but playful charisma makes her an ideal, genre-straddling lead.
Similarly (though his 70-year-old rasp takes some acclimatizing to),
Sam Riley's mournful eyes and steadfast chin lend innate depth to the
enigmatically brooding Mr. Darcy, and the commanding Riley swelters and
sword fights like the best of them. Jack Huston perfectly blends the
debonair affability and sinister unsavoury attributes of Mr. Wickham
with a passionately invested energy, while Bella Heathcote and Douglas
Booth are each adorably earnest as the tale's 'other' star-crossed
lovers, and Charles Dance and Sally Phillips are deliciously slyly
witty and boorishly superficial as Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. Still, the
film may as well have been rebranded "The Matt Smith Show," as the
former Doctor is nothing short of perennially hysterical as the prissy
Mr. Collins, his every utterance, every facial expression, every
snobbishly prancing step a scene-stealing, belly-laugh-erupting
delight, in one of the most consistently pristine comedic performances
seen in years.Taking the p*ss out of historical romance and lending substance to
axe-in-face escapism, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies blends the
pleasures of its twain influences to a surprisingly satisfying degree.
It's easily the most charming rom-zom-com since Shaun of the Dead
(though, to be fair, the competition leaves something to be desired...)
while a deceptively hearty Austen revamp to boot, and hugely enjoyable
for audiences endeared to one, the other, or both. In fact, with such
good fortune at hand, we're really only in want of one thing: bring on
Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters, please.-7.5/10
