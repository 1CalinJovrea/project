Sweet but shallow

This is a sweet movie. It's very very sweet. In fact, it's so sweet
that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don't
get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it,
heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.And I'm confused. Is this a political movie? I don't know anything
about Mr Gibson's political views, but if this is it - I'm not buying.Is it a religious movie? If so, what is the message? That it's OK to go
to war in the name of God?.I'm confused. So...what am I missing. Well, some nuances for starters!
We have this clean-cut handsome James-Dean guy and his gorgeous
sweetheart girlfriend (this is where the movie is sooo white and
happy), and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very
very black. And the Japs are evil. End of story. Is it that simple?
Hmm...don't think so.This is a hard movie to rate. I give it 1/10 colorful nuances but a
whooping 10/10 syrup bottles! And watch out - you might slip on the
syrup floor on your way out from the theatre.
