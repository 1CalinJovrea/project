The movie is "meh" out of 10

Casting is bad and acting is horrible! Come to think of it, why is
Travis Fimmel always acting as a thrift store version of Johnny Depp,
even in Vikings? Characters are flat and uninteresting. Everything is
happening way too fast! Things that would otherwise need ages to
happen, happen in just one or two sentences. Didn't bond with any of
the characters, as the matter of fact, got annoyed by most of them.
Clich√©s and tropes all around the movie, and i mean that in a bad way.Been playing Warcraft since my early childhood, than started WoW and i
really loved the entire universe and story, to some extent... And i got
this movie?Truth to be told, I would recommend watching it, but only for the
visuals and overall spectacle, but the movie in general is not good at
all... the real value of the movie will be visible once the hype river
runs dry...PS When i left the cinema, i felt a bit angry. Tomorrow morning i
forgot what i watched...
