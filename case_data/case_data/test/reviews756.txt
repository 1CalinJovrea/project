Best horror film I have seen in a while

This film was fantastic. I was creeped out the entire time, right from
the introduction of the mirror. There has always been something
slightly disconcerting about staring into a mirror at night, half
expecting someone to jump out from over your shoulder. This film
captured the essence of this perfectly. There was not a lot of action,
not much blood or violence, but just enough to scare the audience. Just
when you think that you have the mirror figured out, something else
comes around to make you think otherwise. It makes you wonder if the
characters are just crazy, that none of the film is actually real. You
will never know exactly what is going on. That is what made it such a
well done horror film, backed up by great acting performances from both
adults and children. If you enjoy horror films as I do, go to see this
film, you will not be disappointed!
