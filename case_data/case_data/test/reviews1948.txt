I liked it, but I can see why others didn't

Fantastic Four is not your average superhero movie by today's
standards. It's dark, low-key, and unexpected. I almost passed on
watching this, since everyone seemed to have hated it. I'm glad I gave
it a shot anyway.I'd like to borrow a quote from another reviewer here that expresses
quite accurately why this movie didn't do well (even though the review
was intended to be negative):"Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's
market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might
have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be
entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I
don't see audiences taking to this, at all."That about sums it up. Superhero audiences were expecting something
similar to recent superhero offerings, and they didn't get it. For
myself, being generally not terribly impressed with most recent
superhero movies, I had a somewhat different reaction. There have been
a couple standouts, like Batman Begins and Iron Man, but on the whole
most seem like forgettable, disposable eye candy. If taken as a standalone flick, independent of any expectation, this is
a decent movie. It's for the most part well-paced, well-acted, the
effects are convincing without being overdone, and it's even
well-written, for the most part. What it is not, is "big". And people were expecting big, of course.
Rather than its characters shown becoming celebrities with the world
watching, the press eating them up, and displaying spectacles for the
public that destroy city property, these kids spin a rather "small"
tale that occurs primarily in secret.I give this a seven out of ten, but threw in an extra star to offset
(just a little bit) the unfair slap this movie got due to viewer tastes
being, I feel, ruined by bloated Hollywood treatment of recent
superhero adaptations.
