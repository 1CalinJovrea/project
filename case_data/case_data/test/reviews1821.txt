Made with infinite class

I've only read a handful of Stephen King novels, but 'Gerald's Game'
just so happens to be one of them. I liked the novel without overly
loving it. It had a memorable ending, but the story was a little bland
for my liking. I've heard people say it's one of their favourite King
novels and also heard people say it's one of their least favourite, so
it's clearly quite a polarising novel. I was excited when I heard it
was going to be made into a movie though. I almost always enjoy King
movie adaptions and was very interesting to see how they went about the
ending I spoke of earlier. It is very rare that I enjoy a movie more
than the book version (almost to the point that I can't think of a
single example before now), but this is almost certainly a case of
that.When you think of a movie where the plot involves a woman tied to a bed
for almost the entire run time, you would think they would scraping the
barrel to reach 90 minutes. Instead they comfortable cruise to 103
minutes and it never really feels that stretched out.All the classic traits of King's work are featured. The well, the
eclipse etc. Even the vibe just inexplicably feels like it's directly
from his work. Director Mike Flanagan has once again done a fantastic
job. He really is becoming a sure sign of a quality film.The whole cast was admittedly excellent, but it would have to be said
that Carla Gugino carried the film. I wasn't too sure with her casting
whether she was right for the role, but she proved me wrong to have any
doubts. It would not have been an easy role, you're effectively being
asked to carry the film on your shoulders, but she nailed it.I'm really glad this turned out so well. It's a smart,
thought-provoking and moving story of survival that actually works
better in film form than it did in book form. It's a great time to be a
King fan right now, that's for sure.
