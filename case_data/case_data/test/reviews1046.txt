"For the people who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they'll like"

Okay, I have to say that as a fairly grounded and realistic 54-year-
old, I'm not all that into romantic movies, but my 14-year-old daughter
wanted to see it. Nice eye candy in the actors, the houses and
interiors are beautiful, but I found the movie pretty predictable
throughout. Plus there were a lot of holes (ar, ar, no pun intended) so
I kept wondering things like, shouldn't he have closed the window after
he broke into the garage when it was raining? and if this is Louisiana,
where are all the water bugs? (Not to mention, where are all the
African-American people?)On the other hand, my daughter was a sobbing mess when it was over, so
it worked for her. Choose accordingly.
