007 reporting for duty

It has been a long ride for the Bond series, since the creation of the
character there have been 15 novels by Ian Fleming, plenty of spin-off
novels, comics, cartoons and video games and the film series is now 50
years old. There have been an extraordinary 23 official films, but few
as extraordinary as Skyfall.After a mission goes wrong in Istanbul, MI6 loses a hard drive
containing a list of all NATO agents within terrorist cells, and James
Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed Killed in Action. M's (Judi Dench)
competence is questioned and the Chairman of the Intelligence and
Security Committee, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) plans to replace
her. Making matters worse, a cyber-terrorist targets MI6 and M
personally, getting a hold of the list and causing an explosion within
MI6's headquarters. An older, more damaged Bond then returns to duty to
serve Queen and Country, having to prove he is in shape before going on
the search to find the terrorist.Skyfall is a long-awaited film thanks to MGM's financial woes, but it
delivers. Skyfall takes a darker approach as we've seen with the past
couple films and it's very character driven, yet Sam Mendes and the
screenwriters still provide a massive injection of fun. Like most Bond
films, Skyfall starts with an incredible chase sequence in Istanbul and
continues strongly from then on, including a very stylish silhouette
fight in Shanghai. The action scenes sequences were pristinely shot and
practical effects were at the forefront.A challenge for the Bond series has always been real-world relevance.
The series has faced down all challenges, from the end of the Cold War
to the War on Terror. Skyfall tackles the changing nature of espionage.
MI6 is no longer the shadowy organisation that the British government
denied existed; it has to face the realities of the 24-hour media age
we live in and the democratic accountability that incurs.The nature of the threats have changed, Bond faces a cyber-terrorist
and along with the new Q, both could cause more damage than Bond can.
In the real world, we have seen what Anonymous is capable of and seen
how the Stuxnet worm affected the Iranian nuclear program. But there is
always a need for people in the field to investigate. As M says, she is
scared of this new world because many of the West's enemies are now
faceless and nationless, and this element can work in the series'
favour. Versatility has always been a Bond hallmark, which is why it is
so enduring.Skyfall also goes full circle for Bond, as the filmmakers reintroduce
popular characters, gadgets and humour. In Casino Royale, Bond is a
young man who is bold, arrogant and reckless but can get the job done;
in Skyfall, Craig is playing an older Bond who is both physically and
emotionally vulnerable.The idea of an older Bond was briefly touched on in the unofficial film
Never Say Never Again, but that was more to accommodate a 52-year-old
Sean Connery being in the role. In Skyfall there is actual thematic
reasons behind it. Craig gives another excellent performance, cementing
his reputation as both a great actor and a great Bond, and the script
treats him more as a character than an archetype. Along with M's
character arch, the film tackles a theme of facing the past so it can
be cleansed.The casting of Javier Bardem was a coup for the series and we as Bond
fans are rewarded with a great villain. Bardem makes out Raoul Silva to
be a man with seemingly camp mannerisms, but the master planner has a
very sinister delivery. He has a complex, tragic background but he is
not like other Bond villains looking for control, world domination,
money or even self-preservation: he simply wants revenge.Skyfall is a great milestone to celebrate Bond's 50th birthday on film,
and the Easter eggs for fans aren't overbearing, but rather nice
touches. The last anniversary Bond film, Die Another Day, was a
disaster and regarded as one of the worst Bond films. It felt like it
had to keep referencing the previous films. Skyfall features a few
major references to previous Bond films: Bond getting injured (The
World is Not Enough), Bond faking his death (You Only Live Twice), the
gun that can only work with Bond's palm print (Licence to Kill) and a
similar villain to the one in Goldeneye. But these are references you
would want to find, not being forced upon you.Skyfall felt very much like end of one chapter and the start of a new
one. Mendes and the writers were able to reintroduce many tropes of the
Bond series and still give them a modern and believable twist. For a
film that has a 143-minute running time (the second longest Bond film),
Skyfall never felt like it dragged and it was an exciting, entertaining
film.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com
