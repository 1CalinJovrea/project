Know what you're getting into!

To start, just so you know who's actually writing the review. Young
fellow here, didn't watch any 'classics' horror movies but I do enjoy
horror movies in general as long as they are not just gore type of
movies. I'd say my favorite horror movies are The Ring and The
Conjuring.So, past that to The Witch. I'd start by saying the movie was not what the trailer lead me to
believe. This is not as much about scary moments or jump scare and more
about a family coping with a lost child, and the movie trying to build
suspense and just make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Because of this,
I can see why some people will see it as really really slow with not
much happening.Some PLUSES for me: - Anya Taylor-Joy (the older daughter) is amazing
in this movie and I also think Ralph Ineson (the father) did a good
job. - the score is really really good, there are periods of intense
silence and periods of creepy music at just the right times to build
tension - the cinematography with nice wide shots combined with the
score works really well in most momentsFor the MINUSES: - I felt like the other child's acting was pretty bad
and over the top and just took me out of the movie in most scenes where
they are the focus (thankfully there were not THAT many) - a bit too
slow of a pacing during the first half even for my tasteSo, just like I said in the title, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. If
you go and expect your typical horror movie with jump scares and a
hidden 'baddie' slowly revealing itself along the movie in scary
scenes, THIS IS NOT IT. This is mostly a family drama that tries to
build suspense and make the viewer feel uneasy.On a side note, I caught this on a premiere showing with a theatre half
full and the occasional comments, coughs and even laughter from some
'individuals' took me out of some moments. If you do want to watch this
in the cinemas, I would recommend waiting and going way past premieres
and on a awkward day / time so you have the cinema close to empty. Or,
if you have a sweet setup at home with a good sound system, I would
just watch it at home.
