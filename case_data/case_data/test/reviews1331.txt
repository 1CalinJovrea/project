Jake Gyllenhaal delivers, but patriotism made me cringe

No, this will not be a popular review. No' I'm not from the US. Yes,
these two are related.I love Jake Gyllenhaal and he delivers in this Jeff Bauman inspired
'beating terrorism' story. The majority of reviews I've read use words
as 'inspirational', 'capturing hearts', 'symbol', 'heroic' etc. And
that's what bothers me about this movie. And it's what scares me too.Because, what happens in this movie is real right? I mean, this is what
actually happens in the US. There is a devastating attack on US soil.
To cope with it, people turn to patriotism. Don't get me wrong, this is
not a Michael Bay American Flag Waiving Patriot Fest. But singling out
a survivor, having him waiving a flag at a sports game, having him
pitch, people cheering, people crying, and to top it all of having Mr.
All American telling him that he 'beat terrorism'...it's just a little
too much. But again, this movie is showing real things. This movie is not
(really) over the top, not exaggerated. Waiving flags, singing Star
Spangled Banner before sports games, people meaning from the bottom of
their hearts that 'terrorism did not win'. Let's say, it is the
American Way, right?So my question is, why make this movie? To confirm US citizens that
this is actually how things work in the US? They know that right? I
mean, they sing along, they stand proud, they will not let terrorism
win! Or to make people from other countries cringe to US patriotism? OK, so Jake Gyllenhaal was great and he absolutely delivers. However,
this 'the US being the greatest country on earth and let's all cry
while singing the Star Spangled Banner' theme does not really have the
same impact outside of the US. But hey, why care about the rest of the
world when you are raised to care only about what happens inside your
own borders?
