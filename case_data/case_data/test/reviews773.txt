Overrated,over-hyped and overall predictable propaganda.

Stupidity took this movie down while the premise still had some allure
as being somewhat of a modern-day "animal farm"but sadly that wasn't
the case here.It is certainly not a classic because it's build to much in to today's
standards and contains the same elements as a lot of today's movies
like feminism,racism and sexism.Other factors that are connected to theses elements are not so much
highlighted like religion or social structures within this society. It
wants to preach diversity but gives a one-sided view to the story and
gives all kinds of awkward messages doing so.All the focus was on the bunny and the rest of the characters seem to
tag a long to make sure everyone is better in the end by meeting her
because she is such an inspiration.It reminded me a little of the
'Rey"character in" the forge awakens"but than to a lesser extent.A
"close to Mary Sue" character basically.I wanted more entertainment out this and also a story that served all
the people and not the few "hot topics"that are only important for a
couple of years.I think that with the passing of time the movie will
loose momentumand that it is not the timeless piece that people said it was.The Shakira song was terrible and did not fit the movie at all and the
animation was "acceptable".I had a few laughs but not nearly as many as
i get from watching a 20 minute episode of Southpark.I was disappointed by it but by looking at the raving reviews realized
I pretty much stand alone in this.It's not bad.....just blatant PC.Nice bunny,but no bugs!Fox this!
