Ouch My Heart

Not everybody has heard the true story this movie is based on. I went
into this movie only based on what I saw in the trailer. Since it's
nonfiction, I knew it wouldn't be your typical cookie-cutter type
narrative, but I still expected it, and was blown away by the tragic
events, and the extraordinary way it was presented on screen.This is the story of a special group of trained firefighters in dealing
specifically with forest/brush fires. Their primary goal is to save as
much land and lives as possible, as well as homes, from massive fires.
These men train for years and when they meet certain requirements, are
given qualifications to be labeled as "Hotshots," which seems to be the
equivalent of an actuary obtaining their Fellowship, or a boy scout
achieving his Eagle Scout, or a junior varsity becoming varsity (or a
varsity obtaining their Letter). Hotshots also literally fight fire
with fire, opposed to regular firefighters who fight fire with water.
This is based on an actual crew, their lives and relationships with
each other and their families, along with the work they bear, the
hardships they endure, and the fires they face. The most efficient aspects of the film are the acting, storytelling,
and cinematography. The movie focuses more on their lives and
relationships than the actual firefighting, but it does contain a fair
amount of action. Beautiful Arizona scenery surrounds the key players
and their fellow crew members as they battle an
only-slightly-predictable threat. Only cons I have are ones I had to nit-pick. The film in an effort to
reach out to a wider audience, should have toned down the profanity,
which is heavy even for a modern PG-13 movie. A few of the relationship
dramas/arguments seemed contrived, and while they did a great job
explaining the countermeasures they take to battle the fires, there
still is some confusion to their methods, and it would have been nice
to know some of the other members of crew better. Phenomenal film, however, and was a tremendous memorial to these men
and women.This isn't just a story about specific men and women in history who
made sacrifices to protect one state, this is about all emergency
responders. Just like how most stories about the military focus on
certain groups and individuals, but remains a tribute to ALL who make a
living from defending other people's lives and liberties. God bless our emergency responders, as well as our military, police,
city firefighters, paramedics, so forth.
