Three capable leads competing with a ridiculous script and horrendous plot.

Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan are very capable actors.
They've proved it time and time again, and That Awkward Moment is held
afloat because of the chemistry between these three actors. Their
bromance is electric. I would watch an Entourage-style show between the
three of them and their antics, it's that believable. Unfortunately,
the material they have to work with here is artificial and stupid.
There are some lines in this movie that no one would ever say. And I
know that's usually the case with romantic comedies, but this movie
takes it a step further and totally demeans women every chance it gets,
and I'm not one to point out misogyny in movies, but it just gets
stupid after a while. "Let's all make a pact to not get into a
relationship! Let's keep having sex with random girls and never fall in
love! High-five!" It's such a dumb premise, and it's like the script
keeps wanting you to hate these characters until they "redeem"
themselves by the end but again, it's so artificial that you don't buy
a second of it.It's certainly watchable due to the three leads, but ultimately you're
left wishing the movie was good enough to accommodate for the acting
talent. There are a couple chuckle-worthy moments, and some clever
banter between the three guys, but most of the comedy falls flat and
the romance is absolutely insane from beginning to end. You don't
believe these relationships for a second. The dialogue for the most
part is asinine. It turns the characters into caricatures at times
because of how fake it is. No one in their right mind would say these
things, and no woman in their right mind would react positively to
these things. It's so forced from beginning to end.That Awkward Moment isn't a bad movie. It would've been terrible if
they cast average actors, but thankfully the stellar cast keeps the
movie watchable and mildly entertaining until the end. As a romcom it's
insane, but then again, most of them are so you should know what you're
getting into with That Awkward Moment.
