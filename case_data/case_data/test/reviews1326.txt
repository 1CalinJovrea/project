Surely destined to enjoy cult status in later life

The Limehouse Golem, adapted from the novel by Peter Ackroyd, has
lingered in development hell for years, being passed between various
directors and actors (Alan Rickman pulled out at the last minute due to
his failing health), before finally getting the green light in the
hands of rookie filmmaker Juan Carlos Medina and screenwriter Jane
Goldman. Boasting a terrific cast, a blood-drenched, smog- filled
atmosphere, and a murder mystery that is as grisly as it is engaging,
the film has sadly struggled to find an audience. With a measly number
of ratings just shy of 4,000 on IMDb, its failure is truly unfortunate.
The Limehouse Golem is, at its heart, a Sherlock Holmes-esque mystery
set in a pre-Jack the Ripper London, complete with a frustrated
detective, a handful of red herrings, a small band of colourful
suspects. But dig a little deeper, and there's an interesting feminist
work at play.Beginning, as charismatic music hall performer Dan Leno (Douglas Booth)
announces, at the end, Medina introduces to this eternally grey world
with the death-by-poison of wannabe playwright John Cree (Sam Reid).
His wife Lizzie (Olivia Cooke) is distraught, but her conniving maid
Aveline (Maria Valverde) - whose role in the story becomes clearer
through flashbacks - drops the hint to police that Lizzie is the one to
make his nightcaps, and insisted on doing so the night the husband she
wasn't very fond of died. The beginning, at we come to learn, is more
like the middle, as this opening scene not only sets in motion Lizzie's
story (she is arrested and faces the noose is found guilty), but may
also hold the key to the identity of a brutal killer who has terrified
the community of Limehouse with a series of nasty slayings - The
Limehouse Golem.We learn of the Golem's activities through John Kildare (Bill Nighy), a
disliked Scotland Yard investigator brought in as a scapegoat when
previous investigations have led to dead ends. Upright and
quietly-spoken, Kildare is known as "not the marrying type," and has
therefore found himself dumped in menial department ushered away in
some dark corner, despite his obvious skills in the field. To help
navigate the filthy slums, he procures the help of highly competent
copper George Flood (Daniel Mays). Yet Kildare's hunt for the killer is
made even more desperate by the ticking-clock that is Lizzie's trial,
and saving her from the gallows becomes as equally important as
preventing another murder victim. Man's urge to rescue a 'woman in
need' is a prime focus of Medina's film, and Lizzie seems to find one
at every turn. A victim of childhood abuse, she is also doted over by
Cree, a nice guy on the face of it, but one driven by the need to sweep
a girl away from nothing and into his handsome, middle-class arms.Kildare quickly learns that Lizzie doesn't need to be, or even want to
be, saved. Nighy may have received top billing, but this is very much
Cooke's film. She has the most screen time, and handles Lizzie's
development from a strong-willed working-class girl, into a star of the
music hall, and eventually into a possible murderer, astonishingly
well. As Leno, Booth plays the role like a big-toothed and less
annoying version of Russell Brand, and shows remarkable restraint and
skill in avoiding stumbling into caricature. But much praise must also
be lavished on Medina and Goldman, who both manage to juggle the
thrills and intrigue of a Victorian whodunit with a character piece
that reveals far more layers than you would expect. When it does delve
deeper into the mystery, Medina relishes the squalor, employing
different characters to monologue the killer's diary as Kildare lines
up the suspects, and delivering some surprisingly gory moments. Surely
a film destined to enjoy cult success later in life, The Limehouse
Golem is a truly unexpected delight.
