Better than the Twilight Films

This is based on a book written by Stephenie Meyer -if her name sounds
familiar , she wrote the 'Twilight' books . The story takes place after
an alien invasion has occurred . The aliens are called 'Souls' and they
take over a human's body-kind of like in 'The Invasion of the Body
Snatchers' . Most of the planet has been taken over but there are a few
survivors left in hiding . Saoirse is taken over at the beginning of
the story but she puts up a fight- when she is talking out loud , it's
the alien and when it's just the voice in her head it's Saoirse . Diane
plays a Seeker-kind of like a policeman for the aliens- that is after
Saoirse . William plays Saoirse's uncle . Max and Jake play the love
interest for Saoirse. Max likes the human part and Jake goes for the
alien side . I can see this becoming a new franchise for Stephenie .
It's rated "PG-13" for sexuality-no nudity- and violence and has a
running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes . I liked it and would buy it on
DVD .
