700-odd years ago, Kaulder (Vin Diesel) leads a party in pursuit of the
Witch Queen, bent on retribution for the deaths of his wife and
daughter. He is the only survivor. We next find him in present-day
Manhattan, cursed with immortality by the Witch Queen, as witch-hunting
enforcer for an organisation called Axe And Cross where he aided and
abetted by a chap called the Dolan. The current and 36th Dolan (Michael
Caine) is on the point of retiring when he suddenly dies. With the
assistance of the 37th Dolan (Elijah Wood) Kaulder starts to chase down
some aspects of the death which don't make sense.It was a good idea to take a supernatural movie and put a CSI emphasis
on it. It isn't entirely successful here but, mostly, this is a decent
romp. Vin Diesel manages to bring together his hardman and his soft
side, and makes a protagonist who is fun to identify. Michael Caine
plays Alfred again in a "where's my pay cheque?" part, which gets the
performance it deserves. Rose Leslie  very pretty, and I'd never heard
of her having never watched Downton Abbey or Game Of Thrones  does
what she can with a part which is chunky in terms of screen time and
skeletal in terms of character development.This isn't a terribly good film, but I quite enjoyed it simply because
it's the sort of not terribly good film which I quite enjoy. I suspect
it won't be the franchise-starter it looks as if it hoped it would be,
