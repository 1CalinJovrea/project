The Tazmanian Devil's story

No spoilers here. I went to a screening last night in Los Angeles for
'Bleed for This'.It's an excellent movie that delivers solid performances from the
supporting cast. Oscar nominations abound. Aaron Eckhart comes through with a dead-on take of Kevin Rooney (all
the way down to the walk) and should be a shoo-in for an Oscar
nomination. Miles Teller shows a depth beyond his years in his portrayal of the
Pazmanian Devil. Highly recommend. Gary Randall Craveonline.com
