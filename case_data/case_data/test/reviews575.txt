What comes at night???

The dog comes at night, a hungry man looking for shelter comes at
night, boredom to the bone comes at night, some chickens and two goats
come at night. Easily one of the most laughable d-movies of the
universe. Save your money and just buy something tasty to eat and enjoy
instead.
