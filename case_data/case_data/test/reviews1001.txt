A new level of sinister

By the time it's over you realize this is more blood curdling and
wicked than any horror tale. But it sneaks up on you. It's like
"Savages", "Blow" and "Traffic" all rolled into one that reaches out
and punches you in the throat with the scope and depth of the cold
blooded darkness it portrays. It disarms you from the beginning with
the extensive normality in it's engaging dialogue, it's interesting
characters and even humor, especially one scene involving a Ferrari.
But even knowing this I doubt anyone would be prepared for where it
takes them, unless they come from this world. Written by Cormac
McCarthy, it's very similar in tone to his best known work, "No Country
for Old Men".I know some will disagree (well, many already have with the lukewarm
ratings and disappointing box office it's getting--the R ratings crowd
apparently opting for MTV's "Bad Grandpa", sigh), but I think this is
Ridley Scott's best since "Gladiator". The cast is superb, especially
Diaz and Bardem; and I gotta plug Natalie Dormer whose character has a
small part but makes a tremendous gesture that sets her above the
otherwise maleficent current to the story. I'm definitely going to have
to watch this again.It's probably over-the-top irony, but think Glen Frey's "Smuggler's
Blues" when the credits roll.(Edit:) I'm bumping it up from 9 to a 10/10...a masterpiece. There's a
couple of possibilities, but I doubt anything's going to surpass it
this year.
