Paper-thin and pandering

Ugh. I'm not opposed to films that have an offbeat sense of humour, but
stylistically this did very little for me. The distractingly showy
direction is just one of the facets through which Me and Earl and the
Dying Girl expresses its inflated self-importance. In reality, it is
absolutely unremarkable and significantly less intelligent than it
assumes itself to be.I'm not sure how much of the overwhelming praise for this film
originates from the gimmick of referencing classic cinema. This is
likely recognition-humour in its most irritating manifestation.
Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon invites the audience to engage in a circle
jerk of ego-stroking  a showcase of how well-read and cineliterate we
all are (All the while never choosing a film not already archived by
Criterion).*It doesn't help that the main character is just as self-obsessed and
detestable as the film itself. 'I know you're really bracing for this
sweet girl, that you probably like a lot, to die', he says in the
terribly self-aware narration, yet the film does so little to endear us
to Rachel. This is an odd choice, considering any emotional punch
depends upon this attachment. The titular Earl, too, is entirely
one-dimensional. The secondary characters appear to exist only in the
presence of the protagonist. Rather than give these characters any
depth, we instead get to watch Greg be entitled for an hour and 45
minutes.The end product provokes little other than indifference. I don't care
about the cut- outs masquerading as characters, and I really don't care
about Greg and his problems. Even dealing with such a heavy topic, the
film is so wrapped in cliché and so smugly post-modern at the expense
of any sense of realistic grounding that any gravity evaporates  kudos
to Gomez-Rejon on this one, it's genuinely an achievement to provoke so
little sympathy for a character with cancer.*Gomez-Rejon, to Martin Scorsese: "You turned me onto film history as a
kid. This was a way to continue that tradition, by talking about movies
that a younger generation could go out and find, and not necessarily
the popular ones." Ugh.
