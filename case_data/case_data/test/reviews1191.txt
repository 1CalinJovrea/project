This Movie Represents All That Is Currently Wrong With Hollywood

There is not a single performance that can be faulted in The Judge. The cast is strong, talented and everyone gives their best. Everything
else from photography, sets, locations, costumes and direction is top
notch.The thing that is horribly wrong with this movie - and with so many
movies that have come out of Hollywood in the last two decades - is the
writing. It's uninspired confused, dull and clichéd.The device of 'wayward family member returning to family home to face
dysfunctional family demons at wedding, funeral, whatever' was stale
when Shakespeare was a lad, but it keeps getting dusted off, tarted up
with a stellar cast and a hip soundtrack and dragged out to waft past
yet another cinema audience. (August Osage County, anyone?) This film
also manages to blend in some sub-standard court drama, a confusing
side-line into incest (WTF?) and the inevitable resolution with hugs,
meaningful looks and a dead body. My only suggestion for this movie is turn it into a movie-buff drinking
game. Cliché Bingo. You'll be squiffy before you lay eyes on the old
hometown girlfriend who is still mysteriously single despite being
gorgeous.
