Well worth watching

I have never been a big Matthew McConaughey fan. I did like him in "A
time to Kill" and "The Lincoln Lawyer" but little else. Well, I now
have three films that I can say he did a good job in.In reading some of the reviews, I see that a lot of viewers found the
film to be slow and boring. Well, if you are looking for a typical
action/adventure movie packed with chase scenes, narrow escapes, lots
of blood and a lot of explosions, this is not the movie for you. If you
prefer to watch a movie that has an actual storyline and good character
development, you will enjoy this. A lot of people have compared it to
Huck Finn and I could somewhat agree. It put me in mind of a couple of
my other favorite movies, "Stand by Me" and "The Sandlot". AS I said,
not for the mind numbed action/adventure addicted movie goers, but for
those who appreciate a good script it is a must see.
