Leaves You Wanting More...

I was looking at director Shawn Levy's filmography- "Reel Steel", the
"Night at the Museum" films, etc... - and this movie doesn't quite fit
in-?? No matter. I just watched this film off HBO GO over the weekend,
and it's a winner! It's one of those family dramedies, not unlike
"Terms of Endearment"- that kinda sucks you in, and by the end, you
don't want it to end. Jason Bateman is the head of the ensemble, including (as his siblings-
Tina Fey, Corey Stoll, as well as future "Star Wars: The Force Awakens"
star, Adam Driver), with their mother a best-selling psychologist
played by Jane Fonda. And is it me, or YOWL!- does she look good at age
70 or whatever she is now-?? LOL Well anyway, Bateman's character finds
out his wife is cheating with his boss (Dax Shepard), and the next day
finds out his dad has passed away, and the whole clan unites at mom
Fonda's house- leading to ensuing chaos, including a sh*t-yielding
nephew! LOLBateman is great in exactly this kinda role- one of the straight man
set among a sea of insanity. He's just a great reactionary comedic
actor, as well as does some of his best serio-dramatic work yet in this
film. Timothy Olyphant also stars as the next door neighbor who once
had a little fling with Fey's character, who is re-thinking her own
marriage. And the delectable Connie Britton also co-stars as the older
woman shrink in a fling with Driver's character.
