This is what passes for a great movie nowadays?

It's hard to believe that the same talented director who made the
influential cult action classic The Road Warrior had anything to do
with this disaster.Road Warrior was raw, gritty, violent and uncompromising, and this
movie is the exact opposite. It's like Road Warrior for kids who need
constant action in their movies.This is the movie. The good guys get into a fight with the bad guys,
outrun them, they break down in their vehicle and fix it. Rinse and
repeat. The second half of the movie is the first half again just done
faster.The Road Warrior may have been a simple premise but it made you feel
something, even with it's opening narration before any action was even
shown. And the supporting characters were given just enough time for
each of them to be likable or relatable.In this movie there is absolutely nothing and no one to care about.
We're supposed to care about the characters because... well we should.
George Miller just wants us to, and in one of the most cringe worthy
moments Charlize Theron's character breaks down while dramatic music
plays to try desperately to make us care.Tom Hardy is pathetic as Max. One of the dullest leading men I've seen
in a long time. There's not one single moment throughout the entire
movie where he comes anywhere near reaching the same level of charisma
Mel Gibson did in the role. Gibson made more of an impression just
eating a tin of dog food. I'm still confused as to what accent Hardy
was even trying to do.I was amazed that Max has now become a cartoon character as well.
Gibson's Max was a semi-realistic tough guy who hurt, bled, and nearly
died several times. Now he survives car crashes and tornadoes with
ease? In the previous movies, fuel and guns and bullets were rare. Not
anymore. It doesn't even seem Post-Apocalyptic. There's no sense of
desperation anymore and everything is too glossy looking. And the main
villain's super model looking wives with their perfect skin are about
as convincing as apocalyptic survivors as Hardy's Australian accent is.
They're so boring and one-dimensional, George Miller could have
combined them all into one character and you wouldn't miss anyone.Some of the green screen is very obvious and fake looking, and the CGI
sandstorm is laughably bad. It wouldn't look out of place in a Pixar
movie. In the previous movies, there was occasionally a sped up frame
rate that gave a nice homage to the silent era. Now,Miller has gone
full Looney Toons and sped up the majority of the action, making many
of the real stunts redundant. They're too fast to fully enjoy. There's no tension, no real struggle, or any real dirt and grit that
Road Warrior had. Everything George Miller got right with that
masterpiece he gets completely wrong here.
