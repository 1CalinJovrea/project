Bring on the sequels!

'Dredd' is an efficient and entertaining action movie, with lots of
memorable moments, kills and one-liners. I really hope that everyone goes out to see the movie, because how
often do we really get an extremely violent, faithful, intelligent
science fiction movie in cinemas nowadays. I also want them to make
more sequels. There is so much potential for sequels, as this movie has
set up the character and the scenario, and we can really get into the
more epic storytelling. The story in 'Dredd' is very confined, 85% of
the film takes place in one of the huge tower blocks, and I kinda
wanted to see more of the city and more of Dredd's world. But for what
it is, 'Dredd' is a very good movie. There are also lots of nice
character moments in between all the action, and some truly
breathtaking slow-motion sequences, that almost makes the extra price
of the 3D worthwhile.Dredd is such a great character. He is a challenging anti-hero and an
uncompromising bad-ass. And don't worry, the film does not glamorise
violence, or justify Mega City One's judicial system. People often
compare Dredd to 'Dirty Harry', but I would argue that Dredd is a more
heroic character, because he would never break the rules, like Dirty
Harry does. He isn't a hero because he executes bad guys, but because
he is incorruptible, and will always fight for what he believes is
right, despite the danger of doing it. If it is right or not, the movie
leaves to the audience.Its such an enjoyable movie that deserves success. Now go watch
'Dredd'. Creep!!
