Genuinely Honest and Heartfelt

For me it's rare that a movie will keep me thinking about it for days
on end. I saw the movie last Saturday night... It's almost Friday and
I'm still thinking about it. Personally, that's a sign that something
inside me was triggered emotionally and left me wondering why and
wanting more. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley were absolutely excellent in their
roles of personifying real life tribulations that high school teens go
through that not many people realize. Every emotion was raw and honest
and really resonated with you throughout the film. Sutter (Teller) is a
troubled high school senior who ponders the demise of his parent's
relationship while proudly living "in the now." He falls in love with a
quiet and sweet girl named Aimee (Woodley) who he at first denies his
feelings for but comes to realize his true emotions for her and for his
situation with his parents that carries you all the way to the end of
the movie. Holy crap, I know I'm not making sense but you MUST watch
this film.
