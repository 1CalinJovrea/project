Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender excel in Justin Kurzel's thrillingly savage interpretation of the Scottish Play.

As the shortest, sharpest and most stormily violent of William
Shakespeare's tragedies, "Macbeth" may be the most readily cinematic:
The swirling mists of the Highlands, tough to fabricate in a theater,
practically rise off the printed page. So it's odd that, while "Romeo
and Juliet" and "Hamlet" get dusted off at least once a generation by
filmmakers, the Scottish Play hasn't enjoyed significant bigscreen
treatment since Roman Polanski's admirable if tortured 1971 version.
The wait for another may be even longer after Justin Kurzel's scarcely
improvable new adaptation: Fearsomely visceral and impeccably
performed, it's a brisk, bracing update, even as it remains exquisitely
in period. Though the Bard's words are handled with care by an ideal
ensemble, fronted by Michael Fassbender and a boldly cast Marion
Cotillard, it's the Australian helmer's fervid sensory storytelling
that makes this a Shakespeare pic for the ages Â— albeit one surely too
savage for the classroom.
