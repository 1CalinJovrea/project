Brilliant, but not for everyone

Atom Egoyan dives into loss, cynicism, pedophilia, fear, love, loyalty,
conspiracy, and technology. Anyone who's remotely dealt with the kind
of situation involved will immediately recognize the ambiguity and
confusion and immediacy of the past in the present that accompanies
this particular trauma. The narrative shifts are telling an emotional
story.The acting is spot on. Because it doesn't fit normal expectations of
narrative, and because the characters are not typical characters, first
level viewers may find it a challenge - or, may find it informing their
appreciation of film. The more you abide with it, the more you
appreciate it. It is not a procedural, though there are police; it is
not a thriller, though there is some action; it is not a mystery,
though it is mysterious. It is a rant against a world and system that
enable very bad things, and a compassionate look at the people caught
in it. It's Egoyan at his best. Worth watching and thinking on
afterward.
