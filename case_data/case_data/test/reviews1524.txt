What was the point of it all?

I left half-way through. I didn't storm out, but after 1.25 hours I'd
had enough. What I saw was well-done, but I kept asking myself "What
was the point of all this?" The film was hugely supportive of
missionising, but was the Jesuit missionising in 17C Japan a good
thing? The Japanese government had a policy of keeping out all
foreigners, including missionaries, but they had good reasons for doing
this. As had been seen in the Americas, and was being seen in China,
missionaries came hand-in-hand with commercial interests, backed up by
the military. It usually didn't end well for the local people, who were
usually colonised and often enslaved.Yes, the methods used by the Japanese government were cruel, but were
no crueller than what Christians were doing to each other at the time.
The Thirty Years War between Catholics and Protestants was an ongoing
bloodbath.The missionaries were excellent marketers, skilled in the double-whammy
approach - first sell 'em Sin, then sell 'em Salvation, the
missionaries being the indispensable middle-men. So thousands of
Japanese died because they swallowed the missionaries' self-serving
mumbo-jumbo.I had hoped that the film would be more nuanced, exploring the rights
and wrongs of missionising. Instead Scorcese chooses to do a propaganda
piece - glorifying brave, noble missionaries against the cruel Japanese
government.Not a great film.
