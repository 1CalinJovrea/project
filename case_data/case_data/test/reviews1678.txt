I created this account for the sole purpose of reviewing this piece of junk

Coming in to this movie, I had heard bad things from people who had 

seen it but great things from critics. After leaving, the only good 

thing about it was the acting. This movie definitely was different and 

unique, but there's a difference from being different and making art 

and being different and making a piece of crap. The fact that this 

movie was nominated for best picture above a piece of art, such as 

Interstellar, is appalling. I do applaud the director for taking a risk 

and trying to make an unconventional movie, but he needed to first 

develop a plot in order to make a good movie. I strongly discourage 

anyone from wasting their time and money seeing this. If you want to 

watch a movie that is different and considered art, watch any 

Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, or Quentin Tarantino movie, not 

this pathetic excuse for entertainment. And to critics, please learn 

the difference between unconventional artistic movies and this bloody 

rubbish.
