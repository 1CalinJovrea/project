American Blindness, absolutely shocking.

This is the story of 4 miserable Somalian, lured into piracy by mob
bosses, greed and poverty. With their 10 feet primitive vessel they
assault a 150 meters long container ship that they conquer easily
because they carry guns.. And then you need two hours of an event-less
movie to see the US navy and the hundreds of officers, sailors and
SEALS proceed calmly to the site and wait for the moment where they
will be able to shoot down the three hostage keepers. The shocking
aspect is more in the votes given by both the public AND the critics.
The movie, based on the real story is too real to present any interest.
Too clear cut characters: the smart pirate, the kid pirate, the dumb
pirate, the crazy one. And the pure, effective, benevolent US cavalry,
or navy, whatever. Tom Hanks does its best to seem really shocked when
showered with the blood of his dead keepers. This movie and the
appreciation it has been given will be seen outside of the US as a
disgrace ...
