Battle Royale with cheese

In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies,
it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the
limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger
simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of
teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the
well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as
the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like
a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a
futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes
and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold,
but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved
of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit,
freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie
built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both
literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is
slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion
on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet
inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your
horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a
top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy,
shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your
films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle
Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an
oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the
death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on
this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the "greater good" and fun of a
bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is
a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger
Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose
totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of
the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to
offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in
a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a
sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A
punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power;
The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts
her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister
in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism
and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden
Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant
lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to
win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make
it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of
profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up
cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and
violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of
hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles,
scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone;
turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept
for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and
darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some
heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.
