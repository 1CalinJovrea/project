Completely boring movie without any background motives

I am absolutely surprised how so many reviewers seem to like this
movie, and also I cannot explain the high rating.Let me tell you, that I am a huge fan of good suspense thrillers, and
that I like slow paced movies - so this movie should fit all my
expectations, right?Unfortunately, no.Most of the actors, including Dario fu**ing Nahaaris, played their
roles either bored or overacted - there was literally no real person in
this movie, only bad stereotypes. Everything about this dinner was
super off (death videos? Murder confessions, anyone?), and yet no one
besides the male lead gets suspicious. The movie was predictable like hell, and I bored myself through the
movie in the hope, there would be some twist in the end - but no. It
just follows the red line that is laid open from the beginning and does
nothing at all to surprise the viewer or to at least hold the tension
(okay, admitted, there was none, so there was nothing to hold).Why the, what do we call them - cultists? did what they did, never gets
explained. Guess we just have to accept that random murder is this cult
thing, right? What they hoped to achieve, why they want to be "with
them", never gets explained, we just have to swallow that they are
crazy.So, no, this was not a good thriller, and it was not a horror movie.
Every single "Columbo" episode held more tension and storytelling than
this mess of a movie.The ending was super ridiculous, no joking here, it was like the
ultimate facepalm.So, I am happy for everyone who had a nice movie experience while
watching this movie, but I am none of them, and I cannot recommend this
movie at all.I give three stars for the okay soundtrack, the good lighting setup and
the...ah, I reduce it to 2 stars, I just can't find any more good stuff
to say about this movie.
