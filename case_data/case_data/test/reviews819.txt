Mediocre chick-flick.

This movie was essentially like a mediocre version of a Nicholas Sparks
book-to-film movie. The acting was great but the execution just wasn't
there. Rachel McAdams' character seemed pretty stupid and, given that
it's a true story, it just makes it seem even more dumb. There have got
to be 1000 such stories with "smarter" people involved or better
endings. The fact that this movie was based on one with a moronic
character and a mediocre ending shows just how masochist viewers are.
The movie is slow, not emotional enough given the subject matter, and
just in general not all that good. The only emotional part of the movie
was the scene with Paige (McAdams' character) interacting with her mom
near the end of the movie. For a film about a girl who loses her memory
and therefore the memory of the love of her life, this movie was pretty
blah. The movie wasn't terrible but it definitely doesn't reach the
elite chick-flick level.
