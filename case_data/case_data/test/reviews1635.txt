Flatliners: Will Bore You to Death!

Less than 12 hours later and I've pretty much forgotten about this
remake of a 1990's sci-fi, though this was trying to be more like
horror. Five unconvincing medical students carry out a deadly experiment on
each-other, they use some obsolete hospital equipment to briefly stop
each-others hearts to experience 'life after death' with some sinister
dreamscapes and then revive themselves after 2 minutes. Apparently
dying and resuscitation gives you superhuman intelligence and a need to
party. I'm surprised none of them became latex wearing superheroes. The plot was so poor, I couldn't help laughing where it was trying to
be most scary. Besides some fairly good special effects and smoking hot
Nina Dobrev, this film is not interesting, not exciting, not thrilling,
and wasn't scary at all. Not worth seeing.
