worst movie I have ever seen

Oh, where do I start. Firstly, the plot progresses Wayyy to fast in the
beginning. The main character claims to be a."verneian" has obviously
never read a book write by Verne. Anyone who has read "the mysterious
island" can tell that the kid gets almost all his information wrong.
They do a good job of explaining why there was a island there after it
had sunk in the end on the novel, but why did they have to include
atlantas? if it exists The mythical city would be located in the
Atlantic ocean and not the south pacific. I rated it 1 out of 10
because I laughed at one or two of the jokes that were exchanged
between the rock and Michael Caine. They could have easily, easily made
the movie follow the book more closely, Captain Nemo sailed the world
until all of his.crew had died so how did his dead crew bury him? This
is a terrible movie. I fell asleep for 15 minutes in the middle of it.
The jokes were not funny, the acting was meh and the CGI was terrible.
This movie might be good to waste a night, when it comes out on
netflix...
