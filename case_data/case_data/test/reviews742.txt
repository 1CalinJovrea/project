Competent, above average indie SciFi...Not a waste of time but...

The roombla.com review for this film hit it on the head - it's an
ambitious, at times visually interesting effort that is like an
occasionally tasty ghoulash of tried and true SciFi tropes and themes.
Not always a bad thing as a superb film like Serenity proves, but here,
despite good performances and fairly capable writing, is somehow not
quite enough to lift this effort to "great" status.The technicals are all competently done with some generally interesting
visuals. The acting is non-cringeworthy and played straight. Worth a
view for fans of the genre. I will also say that I would indeed be
interested to watch other efforts from the creative team behind this
one.A solid 6...check it out if you enjoy this stuff.
