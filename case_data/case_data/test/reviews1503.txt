A Nice summer comedy with lots of jokes

I had a really great time watching this movie and I am quite glad I
chose it over the Pirates of the Caribbean. There are lots of nice
jokes and contrary to my initial thoughts, there are very few nude
scenes. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Effron are both great leads and
they inarguably take part in all the funny scenes of the movie. I have to admit that I was quite cautious before going to see the movie
due to all the negative reviews and I finally came to a conclusion
about all the people who believe that every movie should be reviewed as
a potential Oscar nominee! Not all movies have to be "serious" and
dramatic. I know most of the reviewers out there were expecting to see
something like "The Pianist" when they bought tickets for "Baywatch"
and that is the reason why this movie let them down. My advice is to
watch movies that make you have a nice time (Baywatch is one of them
alongside Piranha 3D, American Pie). Not all movies are filmed in order
to become Oscar Nominees! Many of them are made with the goal of making
the viewers have a great time! Please take that into account the next
time you are criticizing a movie!
