A tennis movie that's not really about tennis

The hardest thing about making one of these historical biopics is that
everyone already knows exactly what happened. As I watched it with my
mom, she would intermittently remind me that she did, in fact, watch
the match happen when she was about 7 years old, and I'm sure many of
the older folks in the theater remember it much more vividly. I just
want to know, was the match in the film exciting for them at all?I mean, we all knew what was gonna happen, but I feel like having
actually watched the match while it was really happening with no actual
idea of who was gonna win is just way more exciting and could never
compare to the film. That's why I'm glad the movie wasn't really about
the match. It was more about Billie and Bobby. No one walked into this
movie wondering who is gonna win the match. They went to see it to find
out about the people who were playing it.One of them, as it turns out, was having a steamy lesbian affair with
their hairdresser, and the others' marriage was being torn apart by a
gambling addiction. The way the movie showcases the two players' secret
lives is done well, but not amazingly, especially with Bobby Riggs. He
has approximately 2 scenes with him and his wife, and it doesn't sell
their relationship well. It sells it so poorly in fact, that at one
point Rigg's wife actually has to remind him why she loves him in the
first place. We get hints that she is mad at him with a classic
clothes-out-the-window scene, but Elizabeth Shue plays Pricilla so
unaffectedly that it really seems like she could care less, even when
confessing her love for him. Their whole dynamic feels a bit forced and
unsubstantial. Rigg's addiction problem is pretty hilarious to watch
though, especially when he whips out a deck of cards at his gambler's
anonymous meeting, proclaiming that they're not here because they're
gamblers, they're here because they're bad gamblersBillie Jean and Marilyn's story is much more interesting. After one of
the more intimate, beautifully shot and well-acted haircuts I've seen
in a long time, Billie starts to feel a certain kinda way towards her
hairdresser Marilyn, leading to a steamy romance. Is cheating on your
husband a good thing? No. Is discovering your sexual preferences
important? Yes. Basically, I'm torn. They have great on screen
chemistry and I want to root for them, but cheating is bad, I guess.
The movie doesn't really make clear what it wants you to think about
Billie's affair, especially when Billie's husband Larry finds out about
it (within his first 10 minutes on screen) and still is supportive of
her up to the match.My one big gripe, though, is the fact that the final act of the movie
is literally a tennis match. It's a great tennis match don't get me
wrong, but if I wanted to watch Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs, I
could have looked the match up on Youtube. Now obviously, they could
not have just excluded the match from the film, but they fail to add
ANY context to it that watching it on Youtube couldn't already provide.
All we see is the two of them facing off, with frequent cuts to random
characters reacting. It all just feels pointless. A good sports movie
should take you behind the scenes to what you can't see with the
telecast. I suppose that's an inherent problem with tennis movies. What
you see is, for the most part, what you get. Luckily, the move doesn't
dwell on the match itself for too long.After King emerges victorious in the face-off, Alan Cumming's Ted, the
gay best friend, delivers a VERY not subtle moral to the story.
Something along the lines of "one day we'll be able to be who we want
to be and love who we want to love." So is this movie about women? Is
it about lesbians? Is it about cheating? I don't know. It's kind of
about all of those and also kind of about none of those. It's really
just about a person who, with the whole world against her, overcame
adversity and proved that she was stronger than anyone thought. So,
it's a sports movie. A sports movie that just so happens to involve a
lesbian affair. It's kind of a strange film if you think about it.
Strange, but still pretty good. I recommend it if you're a fan of
tennis, or feminism.
