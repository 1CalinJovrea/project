Okay. So we broke down and watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out
of the Shadows (2016), we didn't have high hopes in the beginning as
the trailer and of course the previous film; but we did give it a shot. Now before I begin this, I want to point out that I know it takes a ton
of work and a lot of people working to manage this type of films;
especially all of the cgi involved as most of this film is in green
screen with a ton of outsourcing to do all of the art to save funds;
and it shows in the film. Let's beginWe didn't go to the theaters to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out
of the Shadows (2016), for two reasons the first being we were way too
busy, and the second it wouldn't have held our attention as upon
watching it that was proved true. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of
the Shadows (2016) is not a bad film, it's fair; they just got
completely sidetracked trying to piece the real actor scenes in with
the created animated work that the glitches show so much it is hard to
watch. If I were around the age of 10, this film may have been more
enjoyable as it did have that cartoon vibe to it, and of course the
Turtle scenes was more like watching the intro videos and cinematic
within a video game.As for the acting, well Megan Fox was put in the Jennifer's Body look
again to help keep the eyes on the screen as they spent a lot of time
putting her in outfits to keep that going on. Her acting was the same
as in every film; so much that you could tell if it were transformers,
Jennifer's Body, etc; but she did do well with what was going on. As
for the rest of the acting, it was so-so; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
Out of the Shadows (2016) looks as if all the money went into the art
department, Megan Fox; and what was left went into putting the pieces
together to make a film.The story itself, well.. Truthfully they did follow the basic Ninja
stories and there isn't quite much that could be done so of course it
was up to part; other than the many spots that the story just skips a
beat throwing in stuff that didn't belong or well you'll see if you
watch it.For the hard work that went into the art department we give this film 3
stars
