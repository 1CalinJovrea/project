Wow...that was horrible!

Horrible on so many levels: - Story - Script - Acting - EditingOutside of these minor items and the idiotic leaps of logic in almost
every scene, this is a pretty boring movie. Good gosh...It must be a
lot of work to make a movie this awful. If you decide to go, you'll
only get about 5 minutes in before you realize how pitiful this thing
is. If you miss the 5 minute awful point, don't worry, you'll have
face-palming reminders of how crappy this movie is every ten or so
minutes thereafter. I usually find something redeeming in the worst of films to rate them a
4, 5, or 6. Not in this pigeon poo floater....
