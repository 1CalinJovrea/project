Don't watch, just read the books

I loved the Vampire Books so I was really looking forward to this movie
but it was one big disappointment. The script was pretty chaotic, if you haven't read the books yet you
won't understand a thing. I know the books pretty well and even I was
confused about which direction the movie was supposed to be heading.The worst part for me was the acting. When you make a movie based on a
book, the least you expect is the actors match the book characters by a
bit. And Zoey Deutch is not a good Rose to me. Worst of all, her acting
was really poor, she completely fell flat and it was almost painful to
watch. The rest of the cast wasn't much better I'm afraid.I can only say in conclusion, I recommend you not to watch this but to
go read a book instead.
