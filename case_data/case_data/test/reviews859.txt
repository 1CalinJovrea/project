Great place to hide a key.....

Elissa and her mother move into a rented accommodation, which is
surprisingly cheap due to the fact that a little girl murdered her
parents and ran away at the titular location.They learn that the son, Ryan, still lives there alone and plans to
renovate the house and sell it.All the townsfolk despise Ryan for no good reason and Elissa strikes a
friendship with Ryan despite her Mothers doubts.But is Ryan all that nice, and whats in his basement? Obviously
released to make money thanks to Lawrences fame garnered from The
Hunger Games, I wasn't looking forward to this in the slightest, but I
was surprised.I hadn't seen any trailers for the film, and purposely knew nothing
about it.For the most part of the film, it kept me uneasy, with an acute sense
of dread throughout the film. For once I was thinking 'where could this
go?' And then halfway through the second act, it clicks, but this is
thanks to the film makers just being lazy.It's not a horror film, and although there are a lot of jump scares,
it's all down to over use of orchestral music, and the film homaging
other classic movies (there is one scene at the end that reminded me of
Silence of the Lambs, but it was effective).The main cast are great, but support is just your awful typecast frat
boys and geeks who add nothing to the film.Lawrence proves that winters bone was no one trick pony, she really
excels with the material, and although it goes into Pacific
Heights/Fear/YUnlawful Entry/Single White Female mode during the
finale, she manages to make the film a little bit better than it should
be.There is a little twist at the end, but you half expected it.My advice is try not to read anything about this film, because if I
had, I wouldn't have had enjoyed it half as much as I did knowing
nothing about it.
