Prison Broken

A "Plan B" was talked about in the movie, but the producers failed to
come up with one when Escape Plan was released.Like the Grindhouse revival, Stallone has been trying to revive the
1980/1990s Action Heroes and with some success. Unfortunately here and
while not a complete dud, he failed. Heck, had this been released in
1990, we would've said "eh," and now I look more forward to the
Terminator sequel!Master escape planist Ray has hacked his way out of the most secured
prisons around, but he met his match during his latest "outing."
Without the aid from the outside and with the friendship with said
Terminator, he might be able get out of this fine mess.Most of the films Stallone wants to bring back to the next gen have
similar and thin plots, but the comedy and homage make them special.
Sadly, no humor is found here, nor much homage. Just a bunch of set up,
more talking and the less admirable clichés are overly used.Also, the movie "stars" 50 cent, which I wouldn't have recognized had I
not recently saw him in Last Vegas. Mercifully for that movie, he was
in it for about 50 seconds (or less.) In Escape Plan, he much more
screen time and not only are those frames worth less than 2 quarters,
but I sincerely hope I don't see him in any more movies.The rest of the secondary cast, Amy Ryan, Faran Tahir, Sam Neill and
definitely Jim Caviezel were all so plain, lifeless and cardboard and
without the fun irony/homage to the clichéd movies of decades past.
None of them had fun here, nor did we.While not a waste, it wasn't worth the almost two hour running time
just to get the two titans (Stallone/Schwarzenegger) together. It did
have its moments, but not enough to avoid all together and just wait
patiently for Expendables 3.* * * Final thoughts: 50 Centshut that mouth. I know you're in shock
you're allowed to be in so many movies, but act like an actor, close
your trap and take some classes before your next attempt.
