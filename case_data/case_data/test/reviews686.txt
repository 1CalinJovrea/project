Awful rubbish

Saw Wonder Woman yesterday... quite frankly it's actually really bad.
Story line all over shop, character development, all over the shop,
main Charakter Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 16
year old imbecile, she's a goddess for crying out loud, the logic for
not telling her who she really is, screwed up and all over the shop.
The way she kills Ares in the end, could have been achieved by telling
her who she really was from the get go and a full 2hrs earlier,
granted, it would have been a short movie but better. I'm not even
getting into the feminism part of it. In Greek mythology Amazons were mainly concerned with war and were
rather brutal. To be expected if they were the supposed children of
Harmonia and Ares. Yet in the movie they are portrait as peace loving,
just, fair, superior beings to all mankind. But also especially
superior to men who are essential for procreation and useless
otherwise, really?!It wouldn't have hurt if "Wonder Woman" would have hit the gym before
filming commenced. But I guess if your main character believes that
love is the ultimate answer to all of mankind problems, there's no need
for that either. The rainbows one can vomit, lightning actually in this
case, with all that fuzzy love feeling are blinding your opponents into
oblivion, which she kinda did... there you go... The women training her
in the movie looked fitter and in better shape than Gal Gadot despite
being twice her age, at least in the movie. All this seemed like a bad
parody of Thor and captain America, without the humour, without a plot,
and atrociously bad acting from an otherwise good cast. So all this really is, a quick money maker with main selling point:
"Female Lead" I am all for women kicking ass, in movies as a well as real life, here
however, to me, it's all to artificial and contrived. For example, in iron man one can believe the change Stark is going
through, for one, out of necessity,shrapnel in his chest, for the other
he decided to use his wealth for the good because he actually sees what
his weapons are causing. Captain America, he's full of idealistic "Americaness" alright but is
cool, most important the character does not come across as naive. WW
did not need to be so clueless. As far as the plot goes she's naive
because she was sheltered from the world, fine, but yet she had access
to literature about how Humans procreate but not about how the world
outside her realm operates? And the character seemed to struggle almost
seems to resist to accept the reality she finds herself in. Whereas
good old captain America, after 70 years of sleep, just keeps kicking
ass. Her character development seems awkwardly written. To me, the biggest
disservice to the movie. Overall the movie also felt sadly
discombobulated. And then there is the WWI one setting... no one is
expecting historic accuracy here, however, to try to glorify or find
good in something that was so absolute and inherently not good. More
specific to bring in the gas, as was used in WWI on a massive scale for
the first time in modern warfare on top WWI having been a downright
horror show in recent human history, dunno mate, it's bound to fail in
a movie like that.Marvel also incorporated WWII in Capo America, but didn't even try to
bring in the concentration camps for example, it would have opened a
can of worms the audience wouldn't have bought and it's not what
captain America was about. Also the narrative flow is way better with
Marvel I find.
