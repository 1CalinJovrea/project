This is, by far, the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Ever. A list of
reasons follows, and they are small compared to the number of flaws in
the movie itself.#1: Prologue roll-up and Williams' iconic Star Wars theme missing.#2: Director ignored fact that at the time this story takes place, all
Imperial Shuttles were of uniform design.#3: U-Wing Fighter never existed BBY.#4: AT-ST's are not used for urban street patrol. You either know why
or you don't.#5: General Tarkin would not need to usurp control over his own
project.#6: Imperial defector Crix Madine was responsible for delivering the
original Death Star plans to the Rebellion.#7: Darth Vader cheesy one-liner. 'Nuff said.#8: Where is Wedge Antilles, the true leader of rogue One?Add to this hamstrung and cheaply orchestrated fan-service, lack of
respect for the original product, and an arrogant director obsessed
with recreating the universe in his image, and I hope you can see why I
rated this movie as the worst Star Wars movie ever.
