Aren't Movies Supposed To Be At Least a Bit Entertaining?

If I were rating cinematography I'd give this a 10. Every single shot
is perfect. If I were rating costume, again a 10--amazing detail and
authenticity. Score? Gorgeous. Acting? Superb. So, why the terrible
rating? Well, I feel as if I've been run over by a speeding car then
pushed through a meat grinder. Seriously? Women and little girls being
whipped, raped, put in scold's bridles, forced into prostitution...
Every single person in this film comes to a horrible end. Stabbed,
burnt, gutted, hung, shot, drowned, throats cut, tongues cut out, stun
guns to the head, self-mutilation... The whole premise was utterly
ridiculous. The main character is supposed to be some kind of strong
heroine, standing up to all this brutality? Other than putting on a
pair of trousers and a man's shirt towards the end, I saw no sign
whatsoever she was standing up to anything. She was the archetypal
victim and by her terrible, terrible decisions, she turned her daughter
into a victim as well. What a horrible, bleak, unrewarding film. If you
like watching the human condition at its lowest whilst flogging
yourself and wearing a hair shirt, you might enjoy this film.
