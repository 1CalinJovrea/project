Overdrive: (very) stupid but enjoyable.

Scenery is great (Southern France seashore in Autumn), Opening scene is
catching (none can deny it), Ana de Armas, Clint Eastwood's son
together with other nice guys and beautiful girls help keep interested,
script and direction are good (very professional), dialogue is
entertainingÂ… in other words this title is an 87 enjoyable minutes.Personally I'm not fond of cars and I don't think the 'Fast and
Furious' franchise was so clearly better. Surely it ain't more clever.
So, if you like action movies and you want to watch something light,
relaxing and entertaining, my suggestion is to feel free to enjoy
without listening to needlessly scandalized reviews.
