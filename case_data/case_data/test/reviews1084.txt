True to formula

I'd never seen an episode of Ninjago and had no idea what to expect,
but this installment in the LEGO movie franchise had a killer trailer.
Even with a fatuous Taylor Swift song attached, it was entertaining,
mostly because it was about an orphaned superhero dealing with his jerk
dad. It was genuinely funny, which is good, because I'm pretty sure
I've seen that trailer in the theater four times this year. And it's that bitter father-son relationship that makes this movie.
Dave Franco nails the exasperated kid, and Justin Theroux does the same
for his tone-deaf supervillain dad. I'd go so far as to say Theroux is
right up there with Will Arnett's Batman, which is no mean feat. When
you throw in the eye candy and creativity of past LEGO movies, this is
a lot of fun. 7/10
