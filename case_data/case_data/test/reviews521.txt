Truly terrible movie.

I wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK,
before anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the
acting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say
that in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid
moments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she
is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood,
telling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood
of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI
agents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc
etc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and
they go home together. Then I walk out, maybe 10-15 minutes before what
I understand was a awful ending.How can IMDb give such a high rating?????
