Funny, surprisingly emotional, and inspiring too.

'BATTLE OF THE SEXES': Five Stars (Out of Five) A sports biopic based on the highly publicized 1973 tennis match
between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. It stars Emma Stone as King
and Steve Carell as Riggs; with Andrea Riseborough, Austin Stowell,
Elisabeth Shue, Sarah Silverman, Bill Pullman, Natalie Morales and Alan
Cumming in supporting roles. The movie was directed by Jonathan Dayton
and Valerie Faris, the duo also helmed 2006's 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE'
(also costarring Carell), and it was written by Simon Beaufoy (who also
wrote 1997's 'THE FULL MONTY'). The film has received mostly positive
reviews from critics, but it's a disappointment at the Box Office so
far. I loved it! In 1973 Billie Jean King, and other professional women tennis players,
are sick of getting paid peanuts compared to the male pros. So they
start their own women's tournament, and find sponsoring through a
cigarette company. Bobby Riggs (Carell) is a retired ex-champion tennis
player, who also thinks he should be paid more money for a game than
he's currently being offered, and he sees a chance to make a lot of
money by challenging Billie Jean King to a match. King knows it's all a
publicity stunt for Riggs, so she's reluctant to accept his challenge,
but then she feels obligated to defend all of women tennis players, by
participating in the match.The movie is funny, surprisingly emotional, and inspiring too. Both
Stone and Carell are fantastic in the lead roles, and I really like how
the filmmakers didn't make Bobby Riggs the 'bad guy' of the movie. He
was obviously doing it just to get back in the game, and make some
money in the process, and he's actually a really sympathetic character
in it. So is Stone, as King, and she makes a great badass heroine in
the movie too. There are some classic intense dialogue scenes as well,
and some intimate emotional ones too. It's an all around really well
made, and effective movie. I really liked 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' too,
it was my favorite film of 2006, and I think this is another great
addition to Dayton and Faris's resume.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
