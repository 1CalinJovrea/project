A Zombie Movie for Kids? Well, Maybe....

Nine times out of ten, debating a film's appropriateness for children 

is utterly pointless. But in the case of "ParaNorman," a 3D stop-motion 

animated film about ghosts, zombies, and a witch's curse, I cannot help 

but wonder what age group the filmmakers had in mind. With its morbid 

imagery, its broad and occasionally twisted sense of humor, and its 

handling of dark issues such as bullying, death, and the execution of 

suspected witches, I'm forced to conclude that it may not be 

appropriate for anyone under the age of twelve. You, of course, know 

your children much better than I do. All I'm asking is that you keep 

what I'm saying in mind as you buy tickets Â– especially if you decide 

to shell out the extra cash for a 3D presentation. I should also note 

that this is the first PG-rated animated film I know of to include a 

gay joke.



If you don't have any children and frankly couldn't care less about the 

issue of how young is too young, you may find that "ParaNorman" is 

wonderful-looking, appropriately scary, and a great deal of fun. For 

someone like me, it represents a purer kind of horror movie, in which 

the purpose is to frighten and entertain without resorting to tacky 

marketing gimmicks like sex, nudity, and relentless gore. It's also not 

limited to craft, although that certainly does play a major role; a 

real story is being told, and it actually sends a message. I grant you 

that it's not a particularly original message, but it's good to hear 

nonetheless. Specific scenes are lovingly styled after schlocky B- 

movies, while others feature clever insider references. Any dedicated 

horror fan will be the first to tell you that the ringtone on the title 

character's cell phone is John Carpenter's "Halloween Theme."



Taking place in the New England town of Blithe Hollow, where a 

notorious history of witch trials are now used to attract tourists, we 

meet eleven-year-old Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee), a 

zombie movie fanatic cursed with the ability to speak with the dead. 

He's surrounded by ghosts, all of which are only visible to him. 

Because he always appears to be talking to himself, he's an outcast in 

his community. At home, he's berated by his shallow teenage sister 

(voiced by Anna Kendrick), patronized by his liberal mother (voiced by 

Leslie Mann), and completely misunderstood by his overly stern father 

(voiced by Jeff Garlin), who clearly doesn't believe in ghosts. He has 

had it up to here with Norman making requests for his grandmother, who 

has already died. This is true, but her spirit still lives in the 

house, and she and Norman have regular conversations. Despite being 

dead, the grandmother (voiced by Elaine Stritch) made a promise that 

she would always watch over Norman, which is why she hasn't crossed to 

the other side.



At school, Norman is already an easy target for a bully named Alvin 

(voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a brute and an idiot. Things only 

get worse when he begins having visions, which invade his reality like 

rips in the fabric of time. His only friend is Neil (voiced by Tucker 

Albrizzi), an innocent and portly boy who takes his daily bullying in 

stride and thinks Norman's ability is the coolest thing ever. One day, 

they're both approached by the other black sheep of Norman's family: 

His uncle Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman), a hulking bum who 

lives holed up in a dilapidated house in the woods. He soon drops dead, 

although his spirit visits Norman in the boys' restroom and explains 

that his visions are related to a curse put on Blithe Hollow by a witch 

centuries earlier. This curse will take effect as soon as the sun goes 

down; the only way it can be stopped is if passages from an old book 

are read aloud at the witch's gravesite. Norman's sixth sense makes him 

the only person qualified to do this.



Inevitably, something goes wrong, and in due time, seven corpses are 

awakened from their cemetery slumber. As they lumber around town as 

groaning, rotted zombies, Norman, Neil, and Alvin team up with Norman's 

sister and the object of her affection, Neil's teenage brother Mitch 

(voiced by Casey Affleck), a dimwitted jock. Blithe Hollow's hall of 

records is the scene of the finale, where an angry mob gathers on the 

steps with pitchforks and torches. The zombies, meanwhile, are inside 

and slowly closing in on Norman, who's close to figuring out the 

meaning behind the witch's curse. What it really comes down to is 

intolerance, ignorance, and the inability to listen to one another in 

times of fear and confusion. True enough, these themes are far from 

original, but they certainly add depth and even some sweetness to an 

otherwise superficial tale of the macabre.



For the most part, the film is in the spirit of fun, walking the fine 

line between more mature thrills and family entertainment. There are 

select scenes, however, that push the limits of where a PG-rated movie 

can and should be allowed to go. The most glaring example is when 

Norman must pry a book from the lifeless hands of his uncle 

Prenderghast; as he struggles to free the book, the body is flung 

around like a ragdoll, and eventually, it falls on top of Norman, 

causing a huge length of tongue to roll out of the head and slap Norman 

in the face. Had this been a live action film, this scene would have 

been disgusting and perhaps even offensive. I believe that many kids 

will greatly enjoy "ParaNorman," but I also believe that some of them 

will find it frightening. Exercise caution when taking them to the 

movies this weekend.
