Not for the remotely intelligent...

This may contain spoilers if you consider description of a few scenes
from the movie as such, so continue reading at your peril...I must say I am lucky that I didn't have to pay to see this movie. For
starters I hate shaky camera work as it induces headaches and adds
nothing to make the movie more watchable or more authentic/credible,
and cops making a documentary with a camera while on duty, come on lets
get real here!!. It is laughable to see a cop with a camera in his one
hand and his gun in the other going after hardened criminals with
sub-machine guns, who coincidently hate cops to their guts. What's even
more laughable is when a woman cop is in stress and calls for help
through the police radio, and our heroes get in there the first thing
they see is a male officer sitting on the sidewalk with a knife fully
embedded into his right eye (and certainly all the way to his brain),
giving directions to them as nothing really serious happened to him,
and his remarks about his own situation while he is transported to the
ambulance is something to be heard to be believed (talk about bad
acting). Then there is the scene were our two sidekicks were showered
by machine gun bullets by not one but - get this - 4 different
criminals without taking a serious hit. Then the gangsters almost
having a party after they kill (or think that they did) our heroes,
taking it slowly with their SMG on their shoulders moving around like
cowboys with no hurry to leave the crime scene and then get shot by
incoming police officers like flies without even being able to return a
shot.....Shot in documentary style... says IMDb.. I love documentaries for their
true to life aspect, but this movie ain't one of them. In fact I really
don't know what this movie is about, IMO it is just a waste of your
hard earned money, unless of course hearing F**K before and after every
other word is your kind of entertainment... for me it simply is two
pollux + two hallux down.
