Maybe The Best Movie of 2016

First of all this movie is one of the best mystery movies I have ever
seen. It explores everything from sexuality, love, hate, and so much
more. It does not shy away from anything that most movies wouldn't even
go near. Maybe i am just not used to South Korean movies, but by the
few I have watched, I just love them all. I can understand if you got scared away from it, either the very
graphic sex scenes, or the also very graphic torture scenes, but if you
can bear it through then you will most likely love this movie. But even
with all the disturbing sexuality and torture, this movie still manages
to be beautiful, even beyond description. So I hope I haven't scared
you away, because this is a modern masterpiece, and I think everyone
who has an adult mindset should watch this amazing movie.I have never really seen something like The Handmaiden before, so for
me it was a completely new but incredible experience. Chan-Wook Park is
amazing as director, the only other movie I have seen with him is
Oldboy, but that is also one of my all time favorite movies. The acting
is amazing, very pleasantly surprising since not knowing the actors.
The story is in my mind the best thing about the movie, and the way it
is put together is just amazing. But you definitely have to pay
attention every moment since, everything can change at any time.This is the kind of movie where you are not sure who to take sides
with, or there even are any sides, at the end you most likely wont be
sure of anything, until you have thought about it a 100 times. I am not
writing a resume, since with movies like these it is without a doubt
best not to know anything. So all I can say is, this is one of the best
movies I have seen in a long time, and I recommend to everyone. Just know it is not a movie you should watch with your kids. But it is
definitely a movie you should watch, but be prepared for being
disturbed. I hope you found this review helpful and I hope that you
will love the movie as much as I do. 10/10
