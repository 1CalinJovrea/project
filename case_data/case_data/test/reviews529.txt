Shane Black doing what he excels at the most and doing it at the very
best: "The Nice Guys" is funny, smart, action packed, violent,
irreverent, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time without
ever having tonal shift problems, it molds so many elements into one
cohesive package that will give you a blast at the cinema and won't
alienate you even with the sudden appearance of a giant talking bug in
a car.What has to be addressed immediately is the fact that if there was ever
a prize for best on-screen chemistry for 2016 the race is already over,
Crowe and Gosling light up the frame with an overwhelming energy, this
is something we haven't seen in quite some time. Their job might be
overlooked and discounted by some, but this is nothing short of genius,
the way in which these two actors bring to life this story is
illuminating, their timing, their banter, their personal dynamic, it is
all in the brilliant script, but what the two of them do is elevate it
to levels that I think not even Shane Black could have ever imagined. I
mean they just had to look at each other for me to curl up laughing
stupid. They don't have a false beat. And when you try to look back and
think of who was better as soon as you point to one, you feel like
you've made the wrong choice. Crowe's stoicism is played to perfection
and when he boils up it pays off incredibly. Then there's Gosling who
is recently on a roll; he was a highlight of "The Big Short" and showed
comedic chops I didn't know he had, then comes this film and if there
was ever any doubt of his comedic timing believe me is dead. The way he
moves is enough to make you marvel and laugh at what he's doing, he has
multiple moments of physical comedy that had me rolling on the floor,
not to mention his witty, smart-ass dialogue that he nails.And we aren't even halfway done with the cast yet, everybody in this
film not only is cast perfectly, but kills it. Kim Basinger's casting
as a callback to "L.A. Confidential" is a great choice, but then
getting into the more important characters: Matt Bomer is terrifying as
the cold blooded killer and it is so important to be so if you want to
give the audience catharsis when the final showdown happens. It is
great to see Keith David again on screen in this kind of supporting
character role that he always, unequivocally shines in, he is truly one
of the bests in my opinion, there isn't wrong he can do. Finally
Angourie Rice is a revelation, she steels the movie from Crowe and
Gosling so well it feels like this movie is about the three of them
together.Now, all of these actors get the chance to do such amazingly inspired
work thanks to Shane Black. His screenplay presents us to a group of
characters that are brilliantly well written and developed and tied
into a plot that is absorbing and crazy. I don't know if this film is
better written or directed because the two crafts combine seamlessly in
this picture. There are so many moving elements and Black keeps up with
all of them without ever leaving the audience behind or making them
loose interest. moreover the way the setting is used is breathtaking
and I mean that literally. He makes these characters move through Los
Angeles and between a million easter eggs that I'm sure I missed half
of, the locations give the film a whole other level of fascination, it
has one of the best party scenes in recent memory. The greatness lies
in the fact that story and setting feed each other and couldn't be
taken apart, bringing to life a visual feast for the eyes that is
grounded in story and character.And there's still much to talk about: soundtrack, action and fight
scenes, pace, cinematography, sound, all of these elements deserve a
paragraph on their own. The excellence of filmaking in display here is
in my opinion really remarkable. Does it have faults? Or course: it can
occasionally digress into 70s visual extravaganza just for the sake of
it, the plot is thrilling and all, yet come to really think of it,
unfortunately, it comes apart slightly too easily, but these are all
details that have to be addressed, yet they did not take away from the
overall experience which is one of the funniest and most thrilling
rides of the year that I cannot wait to check out again in the theater
with a bunch of friend.
