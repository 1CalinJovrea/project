Worst Horror Movie

This movie doesn't deserve more than 1 star...it was more like comedy
movie rather than horror movie...watched movie because of some good
reviews but don't know what they were smoking when they were writing
reviews..over acting by Joey King....can't guess how many times I
wished to slap her during whole movie....If you want to send your time
watching this s**t then you are most welcome...
