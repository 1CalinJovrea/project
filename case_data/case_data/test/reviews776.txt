More Chucky more fun

After Don Mancini brought back the Child's Play franchise with Curse of
Chucky with a more serious tone Cult of Chucky finally here to terror
the horror cinema with more questions than answers.This movie feels
very different than the rest of the franchise and i like it.It more
stylish but also more slower when it come to the kills.The acting is
very good in my opinion when we know more about Nica and the return of
the original survivor Andy Barclay.There many beautiful shot and
interesting conversation with each mental illness patient cause the
movie took place in a asylum.Chucky still snappy and crazy as ever now
with his new spell that can create multiple copy of himself so the
future of this franchise is pretty exciting.Don't pirate the movie go
to see it or buy it when it release on Blu-ray
