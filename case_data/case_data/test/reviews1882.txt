It all depends on your attitude

You can take this movie from two different sides.As somebody who is very much interested in history and geography and
has studied both for many years, this movie is obviously full of
mistakes and wrong stereotypes. It is almost as inaccurate as the
"Spartacus" series. And this is never an original movie. We have all
watched movies with very similar story lines about the evil Romans who
want to control everything, the poor gladiators who stand up against
them and the forbidden love between a rich young woman and a foreign
slave. I can understand why many people are rating this film down. If
you really want to watch a sophisticated movie about that time, go for
the classic "Ben- Hur".What I think is strange is that all these stereotypes were highly
predictable from the trailers only. I am asking myself why people even
went to watch this movie if they were going to hate it for the reasons
mentioned above. Some people just want to bash a movie and seem to have
a very sad life if they waste their time watching movie they dislike so
much.I went to watch the movie for something different. I wanted to watch a
colourful movie with impressive sets and costumes and stunning 3D
effects of an exploding volcano. I was eager to watch a fast pace flick
with a lot of fighting scenes, some tension here and there and maybe a
few love scenes with beautiful actresses. And I exactly got that. In addition to this, the acting was just good enough and included a few
interesting characters. I really liked Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and
Jessica Lucas in this film even though they played stereotypical
characters and could have had more screening time. If you are going to
watch this movie for Carrie-Anne Moss or Kiefer Sutherland, please do
not. They have been much better in other movies in the past.In the end, it all depends on you. If you want to watch an original and
profound movie and learn something about the Roman Empire, just forget
it. If you want to watch a effect ridden action adventure, you are
going to like this. It is not the movie of the year but I surely had a
great time watching it.
