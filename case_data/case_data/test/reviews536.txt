High hopes but it left me cold

In brief, this movie to ENDURE, not ENJOY.It is just WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. TOO. LONG. Three hours of
relentless torture, persecution, despair, poverty, brutality, murder,
betrayal, and then more of the same, was just too much, and Scorsese
really should have made a 60 minute documentary rather than a movie.
Yes, there are moments of lightness (two, we counted), and a brief
sequence of hope and purposes where one of the padres felt like he was
making a difference to the bleak poverty of the lives of Japanese
villagers. Other than that, this movie is one inevitable, ghastly, slow
slide to apostasy. On occasions, Mr Scorsese, I want my movies to give
hope, humour, courage and good things, and your movie gave none of
those.I had high hopes for this: Neeson, Garfield and Scorsese made it an
attractive proposition. However, an hour into the movie and I was ready
to leave. The plot was muddy and laborious, and Scorsese insisted on
showing us short imagistic fragments that led nowhere.Two last gripes. Firstly, the idea that medieval rural Japanese
villagers would be able to speak English (or Portuguese as the
narrative language) is ridiculous. Secondly, why oh why did Scorsese
make us sit through the credits before the house lights came on? A few
more minutes of tedium? Whatever you wanted, it didn't work.It gets 2/10 for the cinematography and nothing else.Unless you are a fan of medieval Japanese torture and murder
techniques, don't both watching this. Some movies stay with you for
days, weeks, months, a lifetime. This one you will want to forget asap
and move quickly to something more edifying.
