One great big silly, fun cliché

There's nothing worse than a film that's completely clichéd in every
way. Or at least I thought so until I watched 'Hercules.' It's
absolutely everything you've seen a thousand times before, therefore
it's a mystery as to why I enjoyed it as much as I did.From what I hear it's hardly based on fact (and when I say 'fact' I
mean the Greek legend of Zeus and Mount Olympus etc). Instead, it's
based on a comic book which, in turn, is based on the classic tale of
Zeus' half human-half god son, Hercules, and his adventures. Seeing as
I've completely forgotten everything I learned about Ancient Greece at
school and I've never read the comic books, I can't comment on how well
it ties into whatever source material it's based on. However, I can
tell you that  if you're in the right frame of mind  it is quite good
fun.Dwayne 'The sometimes Rock' Johnson plays our titular character and he
plays him with as much charm as you'd expect from our muscle-bound
leading man. Many have criticised him as an 'actor,' but then he
doesn't need to do an awful lot of soul-searching to find inspiration
to smash every baddie he encounters in the face. He does the job. He's
cool. He's likable. And he wipes the floor with monster he meets.And Dwayne's not alone in his quest. Unusually, we get to see quite a
lot of his mates, namely the band of warriors who follows him wherever
he goes, generally picking off anyone who's still alive after Herc has
beaten an entire army to a pulp. Yes, his homies are all walking
clichés, but they're also fun enough to root for and it's simply nice
to see that, despite being 'part immortal' on his father's side, even
Herc needs a chum or two to get things done.Do you really need to know what they do? There's a baddie doing bad
things. Herc and co have to stop him. Don't bother wasting any more
time on plot intricacies than that.The film runs for an hour and a half and, if I'm honest, it actually
feels a bit rushed. If they'd added an extra 20-30 minutes of character
development, they really could have made something quite epic (as
opposed to a fun little B-movie). Perhaps the worst thing about it is
the computer-generated effects. And they're worse at the beginning.
Seriously, there are some scenes near the start that looked like they
were created by a media student for his homework assignment (they do
get better. A bit).If you want to know what sort of mind frame I was in when I watched
this, I'll tell you. I was home from work with a cold. I didn't feel
100% and was wrapped up under a blanket as I watched Hercules and his
posse kicking ass. I didn't want a deep and meaningful, heart-wrenching
drama or anything I had to think about. I just wanted a fun little
action movie to rest my brain to. And I got one. If you find yourself
in a similar state, this is the kind of movie that should nurse you
back to full health.
