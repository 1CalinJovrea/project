Tough watch

Sometimes your hunch can be completely off. Doesn't matter if you're a
good cop otherwise. And this is just one of the sub-stories that are
woven into the story. A story that is very close to reality, which
makes this tough to watch. Ryan Reynolds is our driving force as his
character (and his wife) cannot forget and forgive what happened to
them. Who's fault is it though? Can it be on persons fault at all? The
time-line hopping tries to keep the suspense up, which doesn't always
succeed though.The performances are great and you always can relate to the people
involved. It might get a bit too much towards the end (not sure
everyone will like how this goes on towards the finale), but it's
generally a decent thriller and a "good" watch
