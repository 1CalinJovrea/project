*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as
it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome
cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene
and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people
behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they
succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price,
because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's
this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never
really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the
background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also
really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels
like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd
were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the
first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one
of these movies that are always fun to watch.
