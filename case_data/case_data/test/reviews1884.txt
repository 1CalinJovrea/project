Full of Action Sequel

After escaping from the Maze, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Newt (Thomas
Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario),
Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores) are welcomed by
Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) in a protected facility. They meet other
survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of
teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe
areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the
teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that
the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive
and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated
neither alive nor dead. Further, his group will be the next to be
guinea pigs. Thomas and Aris succeed in escaping with the other Gladers
from the facility and they decide to search the resistance group The
Right Arm that is hidden at the mountains. Along their journey, they
find the post-apocalyptic world completely destroyed; they meet the
Cranks, zombies infected by the Flare virus; they have the loss of a
friend; they face storm in the desert and a dangerous group of
survivors; and they are betrayed by a friend. Now Thomas and his
friends want revenge against the WCKD and Thomas promises to kill Ava
Paige. "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials" is a full of action sequel of "Maze
Runner'. The story has a predictable plot point disclosing that one
character is a traitor. There is no explanation why the teenagers
needed to stay in the Glade and why the WCKD wanted them submitted to
the situations against the Grievers of the previous movie. Maybe the
explanation will be given on the next film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Maze Runner: Prova de Fogo" ("Maze Runner: Really
Tough Test").
