In Mexico "sicario" means hit-man

visceral drug trade thriller pulls no punches in its grim depiction of
the cross-border traffic between Mexico and the States.This time french-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who gave the
viewers a kidnap drama suspense hit international movie "prisoners".
Now coming back to screen with a action crime flick.Emily Blunt takes the role of Kate Macer, an FBI field agent plunged in
the powerful world of a drugs cartel as well as she trying to make her
way to get a better rank for herself. She delineates perfectly the
emotional conflicts of a woman working with violence and corruption on
a daily basis.*picks from trailer* The opening sequence in which rows of rotting
corpses are found in a home in Arizona belonging to the cartel sets the
tone for the helter skelter ride to follow in which Villeneuve sustains
the knife-edge tension without a blip.Nobody is who they seem to be, least of all Josh Brolin who suggests
that he may be a defence contractor although Kate and her partner
(Daniel Kaluuya) believes he may be from the CIA.Also emerging from the shadows is Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro, an
enigmatic figure who is the sicario of the title - in other words a
hit-man whom you never where he is going to turn up next or on whose
side he will be.Although the violence is wince-inducing it is never gratuitous in the
context of this particular world, where human beings are completely
dispensable.it's basically a great action thriller movie. A must see
