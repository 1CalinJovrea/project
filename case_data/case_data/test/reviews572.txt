Beautiful animation, predictable storyline

A friend and I went with the kids to watch Moana last night. I loved
seeing Polynesian islands in animation again. The scenery is
beautiful--much more of it, and more vivid compared to Lilo and Stitch.
The storyline was typical Disney, of course. I feel like I've seen this
movie a dozen times before. I would add that I am getting tired of
seeing male characters portrayed as cowardly, ignorant, and/or
irresponsible. This movie succeeds in that aspect, which is
disappointing. Having sons, it would be nice to see a movie where a
young man is the hero. Instead, we seem to find thattoo many of
Disney's children's movies feature a heroine with weak male characters
around her. Other than the above-mentioned observation and the
glorifying of pagan belief systems, it was an entertaining and
uplifting movie.
