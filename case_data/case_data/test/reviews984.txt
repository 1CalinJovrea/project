Not as bad as I thought, yet still...

Before I even get started: Yes, I have played the games. I actually did
play all WC-games, starting in the mid 90s, and have been playing WOW
on and off ever since 2005. So, with that said, I was a bit worried about the movie when I saw the
trailers, as a lot of the stuff looked very artificial and even cheap.
Don't get me wrong, the CGI is pretty damn good, and you can see how
much motion capture etc. has advanced. However, it falls apart for me whenever one of the really good-looking
orcs (as in: great CGI) are in the same scene as humans. Once that
happens, it starts to look very artificial. Actually, the riding-wolves
the orcs use look artificial in EVERY scenery, regardless of who else
is in the frame. It's not their size, it's that they look really bad. Also, some of the makeup looked pretty bad too. When I first saw the
elves, I was rather amused, even though we only got a quick look at
them, as their ears looked totally cheesy and artificial, especially
the color. It looked like bad cos-play ears. Well, of course, it's hard to pull it off, so let's get to the other
parts: - The acting. I didn't enjoy the acting. There was almost no
vibe at all between the actors. Some overacting happened (Wide-open
stare of Lothar, who totally looks on the edge all the time. Yes, he
tragically lost his son, but it was tiring). - The plot/setting. Yes, they have a lot of story to set up, as they
apparently really want to make sequels. However, what was the goal
here? Was this supposed to get new fans for the franchise, introduce
people who have never played the games to the world of Azeroth? Why
then have such a convoluted plot and such a huge cast, with so many
things (Medivh being possessed etc) being unexplained. I can't even
imagine how confusing some of this must have been for people who don't
know any WC-story.Was this supposed to be fan-service? Why then change so many things,
have so many inconsistencies? I don't doubt that some of the changes to
the lore might have been an attempt to create a better story. However,
if you want to satisfy fans... they do NOTICE when you change things
too much. Why is Dalaran flying? This didn't happen until much later.
Why does Stormwind look like it did after it was rebuilt after the orcs
actually razed it?So much of it seemed forced... the Murloc-sound might make some people
smile, but it was like "OK, let's just throw everything in there, all
these innuendos and clues! Oh, and let's plaster the Kirin Tor icon
EVERYWHERE"- The dialogue was... ridiculous- The love-scene/love-story. Gee, yeah, The Hobbit showed me that it
apparently is totally and absolutely impossible to make a movie without
a love-story thrown in. Regardless of what happens, someone has to fall
in love with someone, no matter how forced or silly it looks. So the
little love-story here feels much too forced, develops much too quickly
(well, at least that part is over quickly) and just is not needed. It's
like they went through the checklist and went "OK, love-story, done!"- The music... what happened? I did actually listen to the score by
itself as well, because it does not stand out at all in the movie, I
hardly noticed there was music there, it was that bland... and not only
does it sound rushed, with way too many repetitions, it also sounds
like a sample-library-MIDI-score from about the late 90s. I have heard
B-movies with a better-sounding and better-produced score. - The armor. Yeah, I know, WOW is well_known for ridiculous armor, its
like a big inside jokes. Gigantic shoulderpieces etc. However, that's
not the point here. The armor here looks ridiculous, like plastic with
a tiny bit of gloss on it. It looks cheap. I heard some guys from WETA
were involved here and I imagine that going like this: "Hey guys, so
you make a fantasy movie? So OK, here is how you make armor, this is
how you make it look a bit worn-in, here is to make it look like
something smithed by hand and having been used" Reply: "Oh cool. Yeah.
We don't have the time/patience/workforce/money for this, so let's make
some casts, pour plastic into those, done". I was almost reminded of
the props in movies like Flash Gordon seeing some of the plate armor in
here.- The movie takes itself much too seriously. We all know that WC and
WOW always had some silliness to it, that's part of it. And the
slapstick-like little bits with Lothar and Khadgar were not like that.
The only FUN scene was the hyper-aggressive gryphon in the end, when
that went to work on the orcs in the background while Lothar again was
over-acting in the foreground. - I didn't care at all about what happened to these people. Everything
was so rushed, so crammed, so it was hard to feel anything when someone
died. I know that the "this movie has no warmth/no heart" is criticized as
something critics use when they have nothing else bad to say or
whatever. However, I have played these games and still love them, I
have spent so much time in Azeroth, have read and experienced these
stories. And to me, this movie feels dull, bland, cold, overstuffed,
badly paced, badly written, badly scored, rushed and undecided whom it
wants to be for. It's not quite as bad as I thought when I saw the
trailers, but a 4/10 isn't exactly awesome, and it gets those points
because you can tell they actually tried to do well...but IMO failed.
