The Impressive True Story of a Family Man and Notorious Cold Blood Killer

In 1964, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) dates Deborah Pellicotti
(Winona Ryder) and kills a man that made an offensive comment about her
during a game of pool. The violent Kuklinski works dubbing porn films
but he tells to Deborah that he dubs Disney cartoons. Soon they get
married and have two daughters. When his boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta)
closes the laboratory where Kuklinski works, he is invited to work as
contract hit man after a test killing a homeless man. Along the years
he works for Roy but he falls in disgrace when he let a teenager hooker
that witnessed a killing freely go since he does not kill children.
Kuklinski begins to work independently as a free-lancer irritating Roy
that threatens his family and him. In 1986, Kuklinski is arrested by
the police after committing more than one hundred murders. "The Iceman" is a film with the impressive true story of a family man
and notorious cold blood killer. It is impressive how a man could be a
good father and husband and also a contract killer and hide this secret
from his family for twenty-two years. The great cast is another plus in
this great film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Homem de Gelo" ("The Iceman")
