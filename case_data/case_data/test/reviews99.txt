One of the most fun horror movies ever!

I saw this at a festival and LOVED it!! My wife thought she guessed the
twist early on and for a second I thought she was right but we were
both surprised. It's a pretty dark film but still manages to be lots of fun. Reminded
me of seeing the Scream movies the way the audience was getting so into
it. Definitely a movie to see with an audience if you get the chance!!
