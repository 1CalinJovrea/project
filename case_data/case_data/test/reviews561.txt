How to make an entire book fandom hate you

I am so unbelievably unhappy with this movie! The writer of the script
has completely dissed the original most exciting plot from the books to
some stupid ridiculous mainstream apocalyptic story.None of this happens in the book. None of it makes sense. It's called
"The Scorch Trials" as in trials from wickd. Not some stupid escape
adventure! I was so excited for this movie and I'm going to be honest,
I left the cinema fuming with anger. If you're going to create a movie
based on a book, actually go by the book plot. Don't make you're own
and expect everyone to be happy with it. I'm sure the writer of the
movies just ticked off an entire fandom.
