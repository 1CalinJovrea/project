Even better than I'd hoped

Let me start by saying this: I am the ideal demographic for this movie.
I am in my early/mid 30s, I grew up with videos games starting with the
ColecoVision 30 years ago, which is, in the movie, when Wreck-It Ralph
was released. I still play games. I have a four-year-old son who plays
games. He knows who Pac-Man, Zangief and Sonic are, and you can bet
that on top of that I know who Sheng Long, Tapper, Q*Bert and Burger
Time are.That's what makes me nervous about blanketly recommending this movie to
everyone...not just that I'm obviously going to catch more references,
in-jokes and cameos than the average movie goer, but that I'm going to
recognize the archetypes they're playing off of and the mechanics
they're referencing as the stories progresses.It feels a bit like Mallrats, in that I'm so ideally in the target
demographic for the movie's release that I'm not sure I can accurately
gauge how it will be received by people outside of that demographic.That said, I don't think you need to be a video game fan to enjoy this
movie. It's a very well crafted movie with characters that are more
Pixar than Disney. I was concerned that this was a "Disney" movie as I
haven't seen a 3D CG "Disney" movie that can hold a candle to the Pixar
and Dreamworks hits that I'm a huge fan of. And yet, for me, this movie
was better than recent Pixar movies and better than Dreamworks movies,
with characters and a story that felt worthy of of the Pixar name.I even greatly enjoyed the animated short at the beginning. Again,
something I would expect more from a Pixar film than a Disney film. The
whole theater experience for this film was a delight, all the way
through to the very, very brief bonus scene at the end of a credits,
which is something you really, really need to be a gaming nerd to get.
(Gamers who have seen The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters will
definitely get it.) I went into this film with high hopes and
expectations, and I was blown away. My wife, who is not a gamer at all,
enjoyed the film, and when my four-year-old son was asked by her what
his favorite part was, he replied, "Um... Every part! I liked the whole
movie!" That he was able to talk to her and I in great detail about the
plot and characters while I was able to appreciate the whole film to
the level I did as an adult speaks volumes to me about how well this
story was told.If you played in arcades in the 1980s, if the games Q*Bert, Burgertime,
Pac-Man, Street Fighter II and Sonic all mean something to you: You're
enough of a gamer to appreciate all the references. If you have a
youngster who's played video games, they're enough of a gamer to get
the movie. And even if you aren't, while you may not relate to the
subject matter the way I did, you're still in for an enjoyable story,
with great characters, masterfully told.Highly recommended, and a 10 out of 10 for me, as I expect this will be
on both my son's and my short list of favorite movies for years to
come.
