No desolations here!

Even though I formally thought "An Unexpected Journey" was a bit
chipped off by quality from the original "Lord of the Rings" trilogy,
due to its certain lack of seriousness the former Jackson Middle-Earth
films had, I wasn't really disappointed by it. It was a different, more
softer storyline, and under it had to have a different directorial
approach. Going to see the second one, I had my worries if it's going
to be on a dose less of action and excitement and more centered on the
characters, which I always kind of felt myself, was a mistake for a
purely adventure film, a road that many movies have taken on in
sequels. Fortunately, it was nothing of a sort. "Desolation" gives a
stronger adventure and enjoyment than the original Hobbit movie. Faster
pace, beautiful sets, lovely score, costumes and most impressive CGI
than ever before, with the comeback of one of the most beloved
character of the original series, Legolas, will surely win over the
audiences both fans of Tolkien's book and not, over the globe again
this Christmas season. If anything, I'll definitely go catch it again.
Thumbs up!
