Hardcore! Keanu Reeves is relentless

"John Wick: Chapter 2" is first true great action movie of the year.
Bigger and better. It takes everything you enjoyed about the previous
film to a whole other level of excitement. For lack of a better word,
it's f***ing hardcore. There's something beautiful about the scope, the
choreography and the thrill of this film's violence, you just can't get
enough of it. And Keanu Reeves is relentless.In this sequel, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is forced back out of
retirement by a former associate plotting to seize control of a shadowy
international assassins' guild. As you fans of the first film would
know that there's a mythology, a secret underworld created for this and
so the sequel reveals the wide reach of its extent. It goes global.
Reeves is bound by a marker, a debt he made in the past, so he travels
to Rome to pay it but in doing so squares off against some of the
world's deadliest killers.I think one of the things that makes "John Wick: Chapter 2" effective
is that many of the creative talents return, and screenwriter Derek
Kolstad doesn't rehash the first film, which is usually a mistake done
by many sequels out there. They take John Wick to international stage
this time around but this film is not about 'hey look we're setting him
somewhere else,' it's still character-based, it's about this assassin
who struggles between living by his code and wanting to leave this
whole once and for all.And this is every action fan's wet-dream, to tell you the truth because
you have a character who basically can use anything, whatever he gets
his hands on, to kill. So what you see is once again a mix of martial
art and gunplay or gun-fu, and on top of that, you also get to see him
use a car as weapon, for example. No shortage of surprises in "John
Wick: Chapter 2." The fight choreographies are some of the most complex
I've seen on the big screen, definitely the most badass since "The
Raid," kudos to the stunt coordinators and also to the actors
themselves who are committed to making those sequences look and feel
like the perfect bloody dance.In "John Wick: Chapter 2" the mythology expands and becomes
multi-layered, this whole secret society of assassins is irresistible,
luxurious, sexy, and lethal. It's so cool that pretty much anybody, any
character, on the streets can be a potential assassin, you just never
know who might launch at John Wick at any time. With John Wick, Keanu
Reeves has found his latest iconic character, in addition to Neo, and
Keanu delivers him like it's nobody business, tactical and precise.
"John Wick: Chapter 2" is how action sequels should be made.
