Does not live up to the critics reviews

I have never bothered to post a review before for any film. But I feel
that I must to point out the nonsense of film reviewers these days. I
see the critics post as must see, film of the year, et, etc. This was
billed as a film with fantastic sound. I found the continuous droning
noise whose pitch increased during the film to what I hoped would be a
fantastic climax, but I the drone included what sounded like whale
noises and more boring droning noises with occasional sounds of gun
fire. I was bored after 15 minutes, the ridiculous story of the kid in
the fishing boat, the original bit about the spitfire pilots and the
nonsense of the soldiers taking cover in the boat.....absolute shallow
lazy boring rubbish filming. If they added a decent music score it may
have kept me interested. This film does not show it as it was its just
absolute cap and does not come across as a powerful film at all. A
waste of money.
