oh so badly made...

I was looking forward to this movie since they made the first xxx
movie, and was hoping it was better than the "state of the Union"
sequel. Sadly this movie was way worse than either of the first two. It
had bad one liners, it had really bad acting. The director was clueless
how to make a movie. even the gun fight scenes were miserably crappy. I
am actually shocked that Diesel would have made this movie, unless he
was given a huge sum of money. Ice Cube was not any better and didn't
really add much to the movie, but he also made plenty of really bad
movies. I wish I can unseen the movie and not have bought before it was
released it...
