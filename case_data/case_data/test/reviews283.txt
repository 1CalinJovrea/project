Wonderful, Lovely Film - Family Fun

"Home Again" is a simple, fun, lovely film for the whole family. No
fowl language, no guns, no nudity, no space creatures, it's just fun.I found the plot to be believable and realistic. The acting was first
rate...the whole cast did a fine job. First rate, all of them,
especially the two young girls.Reese Witherspoon is a class act, I just love her. Her movies always
have a special quality about them and "Home Again" shows this quality
from start to finish."Home Again" is the type of film that Hollywood was meant to
create...but evil has taken over Hollywood.Go see "Home Again", take the family and friends. It's a wonderful
film.
