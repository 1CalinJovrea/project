Wanted to like it

I wanted to love this movie, it had potential to be a great superhero
film but it was pretty God awful. The plot was confusing, the cgi was
bad, Doomsday appeared WAY TOO EARLY and Superman DIES in his second
appearance. And the casting was bad. I mean Jesse Einsberg as Lex
Luther? The good things about this was the acting, it was pretty well.
Wonder Woman was also AWESOME but overall this is a very poor movie.
Save your money for Captain America Civil War instead because it will
unfortunately be a lot better than this.Don't bother seeing this unless your a fan of DC because there is a lot
of eye candy and Easter eggs.
