Best supporting Actor  2012 - by a landslide.

I had the great fortune to be invited to attend the World Premiere at
the Berlin Film Festival earlier this evening of this wonderful film
-and opportunities like that don't come often. A Royal Affair is Oscar level material in many respects. The
screenplay, directing and photography are all superb but the
performance of Mikkel FÃ¸lsgaard as Christian VII of Denmark was
perfection. It is so difficult to act a madman acting as if he were
sane and I cannot believe any actor taking an Oscar this year could
have put up a better performance. Mikkel got the loudest cheer from the
audience and he thoroughly deserved it. The plot revolves around the machinations of power behind the throne of
a simpleton monarch. Christian may be King but he simply wants to play
like a child. He is married and fathers a son quite brutally but he
loves his dog more than his family. And so a German Doctor is called to
treat him. Christian befriends his physician and leaves more and more
power in the hands of this foreign commoner. And then the Doctor falls
in love with the Queen.... It's all true and I won't tell more than that. Just go and see it as
soon as you can. It puts Hollywood and Bollywood both straight into the
dust bin. Classic drama, brilliant script and a piece of thespian-ism
that puts Olivier to task. Just brilliant.
