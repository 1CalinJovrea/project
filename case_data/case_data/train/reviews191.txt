Terrible plot and message for kids

This is going to be my first review, I reopened my account just for
this. I must say that I am disgusted by the terrible message this movie
gives off for young insecure and impressionable people. I had a really
nice time with the movie for a while, but only because I could relate
heavily to the slightly pessimistic lone wolf troll called Branch. It
was such a nice breath of fresh air to see a character not being
"perfect" according to society's norms these days. Branch is a loner
who seems to be at his best when enjoying his own company, he is
organized and he has made an effort to stockpile resources for the
future years, while all the other trolls just partied and socialized
until it became their downfall. This movie is an introvert's nightmare.
It quickly becomes clear they wanted to portray that it is not okay for
branch to not want to party and socialize all the time, he is presented
as weird and none of the other trolls really want to interact with
Branch because he is not like them. I wanted to be sick, when I realized that Branch had to have a tragic
background story to be the cause of his "terrible and wrong"
personality. People are not all the same. There are optimists and
pessimists, extroverts and introverts, good days and bad days.
Portraying that the only right way to be, is to be outgoing, social,
physical and to party all day long, could easily make kids feel even
more pressure to be perfect according to society. Like there isn't
enough pressure from the rest of the entertainment industry on kids
already. Kids are already bombarded through music lyrics and videos and
through social media. This movie should have celebrated diversity and
realized that there are many ways to be happy and to enjoy life. Beside the message that diversity is wrong and that you all must be
mindless indoctrinated dancing candy floss puppets, the movie had an
extremely weak plot. The unhappy Bergen want to eat the trolls in order
to find happiness (very not so subtle metaphor for us that
antidepressants and other addictive substances are bad for you and wont
give you true happiness, as we know, dancing singing and socializing is
the only way for one to achieve that), trolls get snatched and brought
to Bergen town cause of their careless nature. Remaining trolls eat all
of Branch's stockpile of food in his secret bunker and do nothing.
Branch and Poppy go to Bergen town and rescue the kidnapped trolls and
of course implement their propaganda upon the inhabitants, freeing them
from their chains of despair through dancing. Oh, and Branch becomes
like all the other trolls Â– "One of us, one of us, one of us", *creepy
brainwashed stare*I would recommend The Lion King if you want to learn a thing or two
about life, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs if you enjoy movies
containing characters with different personalities (Doc, Grumpy, Happy,
Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey).2/10 for the visuals.
