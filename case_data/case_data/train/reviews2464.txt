This is a bogus movie, which causes so much harm!

I and many others have lost dear friends due to: auto-erotic
asphyxiation Movies like this piece of detritus only encourage others
to "flatline" .. It's not flat lining, it's suicide with bells and
whistles.The Producers, Directors, anyone involved with this movie, need to go
and take showers for a few years to wash off the taint of this
destructive film! Aside from the fact that this "documentary movie on
how to commit suicide" in a "cool" way, it's just another case of
Hollywood failing to be creative, and rolling out one more meme for
destruction of our youth! I can't begin to tell You how offensive this
movie is to those of Us who have lost family, and friends to Hollywood
flat-lining! Maybe in some other dimension, the makers of this film
will be held to a higher test which shows just how manipulative, and
money grabbing they are.If Laurence Mark, Michael Douglas, and Peter Safran have to talk to St.
Peter .. I don't think they will be staying long in heaven! These
producers have no idea how it feels to find a brother or sister, or
best friend - murdered because they tried to "Flatline" Giving this
movie one star is overly generous.Every other industry in America is regulated to not make products that
are harmful to children, why is Hollywood not included? Hollywood never
ceases to amaze Me as to the depths, they will go to, to turn a $!
