The Autopsy of Jane Doe

After the police discover a corpse in a shallow grave, they take it to
father-and-son coroners Austin and Tommy Tilden. During their invasive
examination, the duo comes into realization that they are dealing with
something supernatural.The Autopsy of Jane Doe - Was a visual treat to enjoy. I think if you
are a fan of well paced films you will enjoy this one. Although it's
being treated as a horror film - Which is not a problem unless you
generalize this as the overall genre for this movie - Its more of a
Suspense Thriller/Drama/Horror. This is not something I feel needs to
be clarified, but understood as the film envelops all three entities.Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox are excellent as father-and-son coroners
Austin and Tommy Tilden. One particular moment in the film allows the
actors to reflect and truly shine in their respected roles.André Øvredal (Trollhunter) directs this close quartered film with
limited room for our actors to breathe once the tension unfolds - He
makes great use of this tension by placing the camera in dark areas
allowing us to truly feel the weight of the actors.Screenwriters Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing craft a smart and well
paced story with a few false scares, and flat third act leaving us
yearning for more.Overall, this is a movie that deserves and requires your time :)
