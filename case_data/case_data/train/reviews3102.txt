The Host has Soul

The Host is a quiet, steady masterpiece. It had a lot of soul. Don't
get me wrong: it isn't a perfect movie, it had its cheese...BUT I was
amazed at how much I enjoyed it. The Host stayed true to the book. The
Host had the stunning Saoirse Ronan (who played in Hanna, The Way Back,
and Atonement) playing as Wanda/Wanderer, a Soul lost in emotional
turmoil in our world. It was directed by Gattaca's Andrew Niccol who
stayed true to Stephenie Meyer's visionary book. It made me question
whose side I was on: the humans or the Souls. You should see this
movie. While Saoirse Ronan is my favorite actress, William Hurt played
Jeb perfectly. This movie made me question my thoughts on love, joy,
and happiness.
