So boring I had to pinch myself to stay awake

I saw this in a very small, very hot screening room with as little room
for my legs as on plane. And filled with people. It was claustrophobic
as hell and I wanted to get out and looked at my watch 20 times when I
was not pinching myself to stay awake.This was sheer torture.A movie so boring that only women who find Bradley Cooper dreamy can
enjoy watching. Along with either their boyfriends that they forced to
watch it with them or their girlfriends.The movies running time of an hour and 41 minutes felt like 3 hours.And the lead is basically an a-hole and an arrogant douche bag that
it's impossible to care for.I recommend this to women and gay men and chefs. Every one else should
avoid this like the plague.
