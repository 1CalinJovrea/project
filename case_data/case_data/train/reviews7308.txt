An other good answer to "What is funny?"

This movie had a lot of very great actors and actresses who is so funny
I almost laughed my a*s off #SPOILERALERT I personally think the
funniest moment was in the wan when they listened to "waterfalls" and
Kenny ("Will Poutler") rap along with the music #SPOILEROVER. This
movie is defiantly one I can watch again and again. Take my advice and
watch it if you haven't already watched it. "Jennifer Aniston" showed
some really great and funny acting with the whole (maybe #SPOILERALERT)
striper thing (#SPOILEROVER) and the whole concept of the movie is just
plane genius the way it takes all these different kind off problems and
just stack them on top of each other is awesome. This movie is kind of
in that category that can't be said or written with words you know
(hopefully). I think that this movie is something you shouldn't live
without haven't seen (Hope i'm not being to dramatic) so see it. Have A
Good Time Watching This Movie Says Ida<3.
