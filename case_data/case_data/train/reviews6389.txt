A Pretentious Cliché

Now... forgive my hateful language but I am still recovering from the
ridiculous boredom and anger that I experienced last night. I should
start by saying that I spent the night trying to think of something
good about this movie. I failed.This was the most pretentious, most cliché film I have seen in a long
long time. This idea with telling different stories serving a single
purpose which would "form the big picture" is so overused. And it might
have worked with some other films but in this case it's just "oh c'mon,
seriously?!". The cast is awful. Don't get me wrong I usually like Tom
Hanks and I loved Ben Whishaw in The Perfume, but the acting in Cloud
Atlas is literally scandalous. Now about the movie itself. It is
crystal clear what they tried to achieve. It should have been some sort
of a revelation which would explain life itself. In reality it is
simple, shallow and ridiculous. It doesn't raise questions or make you
think. It doesn't even try to show you the answers. It just tells you
stuff with a dramatic slow preacher-like voice and wannabe interesting
accents. Honestly this parody of a movie felt as if you caught a sub-
sub-sub-cable 22h lame melodramatic TV show crew, you gave them a giant
budget and a camera (and Halle Berry for publicity) and they took the
opportunity to spill every single stupid, random and clichéd thought
into a three hour nightmare.
