I will never recommend this to ANYONE!

*Not meaning to offend anyone just sharing my honest opinion* Really?
are you kidding? I wasted my money on this! OK so they talked about
Peter Parkers parents disappearing about 20 minutes of the movie and
for that 20 minutes was a waste of time since it didn't even tell you
what happened to them! And WOW i cant believe how ridiculous the death of Peters uncle was!
the guy picked up the gun and the uncle just like runs into him or
something honestly i really don't know what happened there.The only halfway amusing part about it was the old man listening to his
music and seeing them fight behind him! Oh and Peter never found the
killer of his uncle(unless i missed that part!) and thats lame he never
did since that was the main reason he even made his suit and
everything! ****I REALLY HOPE HES NOT IN THE NEW AVENGERS*****
