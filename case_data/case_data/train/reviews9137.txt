IMDb rating is far too high in my opinion

My girlfriend & I bought this DVD to watch one evening & we both could
not get to grips with it, the story is too far-fetched & lacked any
aspect that could draw the viewer in, there are few "jumpy bits". The
only merit of this film is that the character "Mama" is a real person
where the only changes are that his hair is CGI. Upon seeing the film
on the shelf I turned to IMDb, as I usually do to see what the ratings
are, most modern horrors tend to score relatively low but this seemed
to have a respectable score which I think is ill-considered. Another
film where a potential good idea has been poorly executed, I would not
recommend this film to anybody, extremely annoyed that I paid Â£7 to own
this.
