Abhorrent Follow-Up

Jeff Wadlow's vile follow-up to Matthew Vaugn's enjoyable but
ultimately escapist comedy Kick-Ass is every failure that Vaughn
managed to avoid. While one could accuse Vaughn of sensationalizing
violence and ultimately abandoning his own satiric point, at least
Kick-Ass was anchored by strong performances, including a fantastic
turn by Nicolas Cage. No such luck here. Moretz is a capable actor but
she's given little to do. Her entrance into womanhood is presented with
the tact of a bad teen soap and her ultimate conquest over her bullies
is both tame and disgustingly underwhelming at the same time. Wadlow's
ear is deaf and his tone loud like that of a child banging a drum. It's
a retread that systematically destroys everything the original film had
going for it. From it's characters, to it's performances, to ultimately
the world itself. I don't know what the point of it all is. Poorly conceived
"superheroes" brutally beating people to bloody pulps is funny? If
we're going to have an empty film, could we at least have it well made? Or are we just along for a cheap, amoral ride?
