Monkey Poo

I've walked out of movies before, but never have I walked deeper and
deeper into total disdain for over 2 excruciating hours. Completely
convoluted and nearly nonsensical plot, wrapped in a farcical attempt
to be profound, while being utterly transparent in its attempt to copy
some iconic movies and characters (Ape-ocalypse, really?!). This total
monkey poo is actually what will wipe out our species by making us all
stupider with every passing minute we watch it. Life is too short, go
do something more worthwhile, like watching paint dry. That said, had
some moments of real emotion coupled with top-notch CGI. And, it
totally succeeds in making critics look like total morons.
