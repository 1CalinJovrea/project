Stop being pretentious and enjoy a decent film.

After seeing this film I was more than a little disgusted to see so
many negative reviews. The main problem with this film I find is in the
first 20-30 minutes, a common problem I spy in Luhrman films that
should by no means define an entire film. Giving away nothing the film
begins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hits
what I like to call "Baz's golden point", slows to absolute perfection.
That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads,
but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all its
glory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio gives
yet another glorious performance. If I'm going to be honest I think a
lot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the "classic" status
of the book, people want to act like the hours of school discussions
should make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of the
time. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974 & 2000
adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful, over the top, heart wrenching, and
thoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend.
