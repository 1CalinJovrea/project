Scary and enjoyable

I watched clown last night and it's haunted my thoughts all day! I just
came across the film by accident and when I seen it was an Eli Roth
movie I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed. I actually
think that I held my breath for over an hour, and when it finished - I
wasn't able to fall asleep. The story is about a dad who puts on an old
creepy clown outfit for his sons birthday party. He realizes after that
it won't come of, and tries desperately to cut into it (slashing his
own wrist). His wife tries to help and ends up ripping his red nose
right of his face. I think this is when I started to feel
uncomfortable. He starts to transform.. Into an evil clown. The effects
are great and I really like how the story started straight away - he
literally puts the outfit on during the first two minutes of the film
and things just keep getting darker. As the clown outfit becomes more
restricting and you find out it's actually turning him into a demon...
Who likes to eat children. At certain points in the movie his wife
tries to help and save him. There's also a great bit when he decides to
cut his own head off, but things don't go to plan. The character really
does become creepy and sinister. You don't normally see little people
getting so gruesomely murdered in a movie. It was very well done and I
really enjoyed it. I would recommend this great horror slasher movie.
