Chucky Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!!!

I've been a fan of Chucky and the Child's Play series ever since I was
six years old, and I'm always ecstatic to see a new film in the
franchise. I was kinda disappointed with 'Curse of Chucky' a few years
ago, because it was such a slow burner, but it has grown on me since.
Now we have Cult, the 7th film in the series. I was not disappointed
with it. I truly enjoyed it. Very intriguing, great references to the
previous movies, lots of new twists and turns and a great open ending
to more Chucky films. This review may contain spoilers, but I'll try to
be careful! I'm so happy that Alex Vincent has returned to the series as Andy
Barclay, the original survivor of the Child's Play series. When I was a
kid, I had always wondered what became of him. I finally have my
answer! Fiona Dourif is back as Nica, the survivor of the last film.
This time, she is locked away in a mental institution. Since Chucky has
completion anxiety, he goes to the asylum and tries to finish the job. Four years have passed since the last film. Now, Chucky is back again
and dealing with the colorful inmates of the asylum like Carlos the
Orderly Dr. Foley, Nica's doctor who convinces her that she was the
murderer all along. Malcolm, the patient with multiple personalities.
Angela, an old lady who thinks she's a ghost and Madeleine, a disturbed
patient who thinks Chucky is her long lost baby. Andy Barclay rushes to the rescue and tries to kill Chucky once and for
all time. Will he be successful? Check the movie out. Out of all the
Chucky films, this is the most visually beautiful with great
cinematography. This'll be great to watch, now that it's October and
almost Halloween! I highly recommend CULT OF CHUCKY!!!
