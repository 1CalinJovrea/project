Got tricked by paid reviews

I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so
many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a
perfect movie, really!Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am
deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar
traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit
for me! I had really high expectations.For the entire movie I was feeling like: "the best part of the movie
should soon", but never came. I had hard time understanding what was
really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted
in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted
to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion,
galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep
space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years
away from us.SPOILERS AHEADMaybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they
crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never
understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what
were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was
there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot
in the movie, I failed. What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering
something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I
wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I
failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to
save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight,
totally no sense.Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did.
This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The
idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally
confusing, too much clich√©. Watch it but don't have high expectations
as me, you will be disappointed.
