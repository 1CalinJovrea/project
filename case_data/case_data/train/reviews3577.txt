Absolutely senseless

One of the most stupid, senseless and ridiculous movies I have ever
watched. I wonder only why would Charlize Theron play in something like
that? Money must have been very tempting for an Oscar-winning actress
to even think about that this could become a good movie with no story,
no developing characters, not even a story but just lots of money
thrown on some... well I must admit - good special effects. But not
worth even a dime to pay for a ticket to watch it, not talking even
about the waste of time.
