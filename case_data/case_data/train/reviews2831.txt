Emotional roller-coaster but in a really good way!

I loved this movie, and I will watch it again. This is my first review
ever, and I've been on IMDb for years reading people's reviews to
determine if I want to watch a movie or not. Does the movie have some
flaws, YES! But a movie that can make me laugh, cry, feel anxious, and
a whole lot of emotions I cannot explain is a win win for me. All the
characters are awesome, every single one of them. Wished the movie had
been 3 hours. Don't try to analyze this movie,go watch and just FEEL!
