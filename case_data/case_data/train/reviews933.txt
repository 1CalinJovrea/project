Watch It with Attention, Seek Explanation in Internet and Watch It Again

In Toronto, the college professor of Politics Adam Bell (Jake
Gyllenhaal) lives a routine life with his girlfriend Mary (Mélanie
Laurent). One day, he watches a rented DVD and sees an obscure
supporting actor very alike to him and Adam becomes obsessed find him
out. He discovers that his name is Anthony Claire and he is married
with Helen (Sarah Gadon), who is six-month pregnant. Adam meets Anthony
but soon he realizes that it was a mistake since his counterpart has
put his eyes on Mary. Soon their lives become entwined."Enemy" is not a good movie, but has an intriguing story by José
Saramago. For me, a good movie is able to present the story with
neither the need of reading the novel not researching explanation in
Internet. "Enemy" is a movie where the viewer needs to watch with
attention, seek explanation in Internet (for example,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9AWkqRwd1I provides a good explanation
of the movie) and watch it again. Therefore the screenwriter fails in
his script. Anyway it is intriguing and when you see it for the second
time, it is worthwhile. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Homem Duplicado" ("The Duplicated Man")
