Fantastic action but ...

So I saw Thor Ragnarok last night. I have given it 7/10 Pros: .Funnier than most marvel films .Amazing visuals .Thor being
amazing .Fantastic fight scenes .More hulk .threat seemed more real
(unlike civil war and homecoming)Cons: .Too many reminders of guardians of the galaxy like the music and
planet scenery .Too much forced humour which didn't need to be thereIt was very enjoyable overall But I miss marvel movies like winter soldier and ones going back before
the avengers as none relied on humour.
