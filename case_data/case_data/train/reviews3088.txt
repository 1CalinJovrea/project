mediocre mess of a movie, lazy and uninspired

i went into this movie expecting to at least enjoy something? i wanted
to like it. but more than anything it was just underwhelming and
mediocre. it was extremely boring, i laughed at maybe 5 jokes (none of
which were memorable). wouldn't recommend personally but if you like
movies with a script that was obviously written by 4 high rich dudes
completely out of touch with society, forced unfunny jokes reminiscent
of a 12 year old lets player on youtube, and uninspired visuals that
look like they went with the first draft, then this might be a good
movie for you.wouldn't recommend to anyone who enjoys good movies, would recommend to
anyone who is easily amused n thinks its funny when dudes are high and
kids cartoons say f)ck a lot
