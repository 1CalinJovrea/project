Creep, might just give you the creeps.

I have never seen a found footage film quite like Creep. It's a
combination of horror, drama, and comedy that is so tightly wound that
you never know what to expect from one moment to the next. The idea is
simple: Responding to a Craigslist ad that sought a videographer for a
one-day job, an unassuming man named Aaron (Patrick Brice) drives to
rural California to film a dying man's final video message to his wife
and as-of-yet unborn child. At least, that is why he believes he is
taking the job. The real reason he was hired, was for reasons unknown,
until the climatic ending of the film. There are multiple reasons why I
enjoyed this movie, but one stood out more than the others; and that
was the acting. Mark Duplass stars as the "creep" so to speak, and his
performance gives me the creeps. As for Patrick Brice, he played a very
convincing victim of the events that take place. Another thing this
movie does very well, it manages to maintain its mysterious and surreal
feel, but at the same time actually delivers laughs. It's not a comedy,
but has a black comedy feel to it. Running under 80 minutes, which is
clearly not a problem for the movie. Creep is a disturbing nightmare of
a film that takes twists that may feel familiar, but remains creative
and is a refreshing take on the found footage genre.
