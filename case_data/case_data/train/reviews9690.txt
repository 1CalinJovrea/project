Acting class

The weirdest thing about this movie is that so many people review it
favorably. What I saw was a bunch of actors trying to improvise a
movie, stringing together supermarket-magazine physics with time-warp
and doppelganger clich√©s, incessantly talking and cross-talking like
college students on a high, from time to time coming out with
embarrassingly unconvincing bursts of outrage. Never in the history of
film, drama, or fiction have characters in a crisis come up with so
many half-baked theories and plans at so dizzying a pace. Sex and
fisticuffs, as well as "just-normal-life" subplots, are injected with
an incoherence that the film's title must be referring to. Maybe the
explanation for the rave reviews is that there are actually two or more
of Incoherence, and the one I saw was the bad one.
