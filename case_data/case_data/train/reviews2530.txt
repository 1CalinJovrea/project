ago and where WrestleMania 34 will take place next year on 8th April
2018.Overall Girls Trip is a good really funny comedy film filled with lots
of funny moments, girls having fun and messing about, tongue and cheek
stuff, fall outs, arguments, friendship, togetherness, partying,
drinking, smoking, getting drunk, bad language, some rude, crude and
offensive stuff which I shouldn't mention on here in great detail just
in case I offend or upset anyone on here, some weird moments like
delusions, lying, cheating, backstabbing people, some OMG and LOL
moments, some close shaves, some oh no moments, catchy songs, music
concerts and famous singers singing on stage inside the Mercedes- Benz
Superdome Arena and many other things throughout the film.So I will give Girls Trip an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and
Girls Trip is worth seeing if you like funny comedy films like The
Hangover films, Bad Moms, Last Vegas, American Pie films amongst
others.So if you get the chance to see Girls Trip in the cinema then you
should go and see it sooner than later.
