Fantastic and Faithful Adaptation

I have seen reviews comparing the Giver (unfavorably) to other teen
dystopian movies like Divergent and Hunger Games. That's actually a
compliment, the Giver is not more of the same stuff, The critics
seemingly can't accept that people are smart enough to get the point of
Lois Lowry's book, and that people aren't smart enough to enjoy, much
less understand, a character study and a societal study. Mindless
action, needless violence, and transforming robots are all absent here.
I have a feeling though, that people are smarter than they think. The
book has been popular for at least 30 years, why would people balk at
the movie adaptation? The Giver is a project that has been in the back
of every movie maker's mind for years, now it's here. Go see it and
judge for yourself.
