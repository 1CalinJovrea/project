Beautiful Adaption Of One Of My Favorite Books

I read this book about four years ago, and I have to say, it has topped
my list of favorites ever since. When I first heard that they were
making this movie, I was overjoyed. And it it EVERYTHING that I had
hoped it would be. It made me laugh, cry, and emit all sorts of inhuman
noises as the love story played out. It was just... Beautiful. Chloe
did an amazing job of portraying Mia, and Adam was exactly how I
envisioned him. The casting was perfect and the acting was on point.
And the way that Cutler pieced it all together is so far beyond what I
was expecting. An amazing film on so many levels, I will definitely be
getting a DVD copy and adding it to my shelf. Good work, R. J. Cutler!
