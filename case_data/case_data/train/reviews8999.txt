Don't listen to the bad reviews!

I really feel like the people that rated this movie poorly either
didn't see the movie and just wanted to give it bad press, or had no
idea what the movie was about. The acting and effects of the movie were
beyond my expectations, and as far as the storyline, it was Pride and
Prejudice. I love the book and movie Pride and Prejudice, I also love
zombie movies so this movie was the perfect fit for me. That being
said, I feel that this movie would appeal to anyone who enjoys the
zombie genre. I had a lot of fun during this movie, I was pleased that
it didn't take itself seriously, yet I enjoyed the depth of the
characters. I equally laughed and jumped at the shocking moments
throughout this movie, and enjoyed every moment. I also must include
that I almost didn't see this movie, because of the bad reviews.
However, I am very glad that I didn't listen, because I feel like since
this is a beloved classic book with zombies people may be upset that
this movie was made in the first place. I am a huge Jane Austen fan, I
find it a refreshing fun take on the storyline.
