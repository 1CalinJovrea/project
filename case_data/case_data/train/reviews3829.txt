A Fitting Tribute

A "hotshot" is a firefighter whose specialty is working the front lines
of a forest fire. And the new motion picture "Only the Brave" is about
the Granite Mountain Hotshots, an elite crew of forest firefighters
from Prescott, Arizona who established a remarkable record of success
in their specialty but collided with fate and tragedy during Arizona's
Yarnell Hill Fire in June of 2013.Written by Ken Nolan and Eric Warren Singer and directed by Joseph
Kosinski, "Only the Brave" is one biographical picture which doesn't
gild the lily, or idealize the subject of the drama. The firefighters depicted in the movie are human, and have flaws and
weaknesses: Three of the leading characters are recovering substance
abusers, and some of the picture's best acting is screamed between
actors Josh Brolin and Jennifer Connelly, playing the Hotshots'
commanding officer and his spirited and independent wife.If you're unfamiliar with the story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots,
"Only the Brave" is a genuinely effective real-life adventure picture
which does justice to not only that famed battalion but also to
firefighters and emergency responders everywhere. And even if you already know the story, the picture works as a tribute
to the people who place themselves between us and danger, and the
families who support them.
