Skip it.

Guys, here's a tip if you want to see this movie. Instead of shilling
out actual money, just get 4 people you know with Skype accounts, get
in a group call, and then just scream for 2 hours straight. You know
have the entire plot, line of events, and premise of Unfriended. Just
another painful to watch, stupid found footage horror that decided to
go from a normal camera to the most boring and ugly way of showing it,
Skype chat, because why would you want the camera to be enjoyable? Skip
the movie, just go watch a PewDiePie video, it's the exact same amount
of obnoxious screaming, but you can also watch a video game instead of
focusing on the screaming idiot.
