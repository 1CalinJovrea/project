Environmental disaster? What environmental disaster!

This is a tribute movie about the 2010 BP oil disaster that focuses on
the events leading up to and including the terrible explosions that
created the oil spill.It shows the human side of the riggers, as they go about their daily
routines. Their thick Texan accents were hard to follow (for me at
least), and their dialogue definitely was designed to shows how tough
oil riggers really are. The BP corporate management staff on the rig
are all portrayed as 'idiots', who were continuously taking shortcuts
trying to moderate the project deadline (already overrunning by 43
days).The first half of the movie was a slow burn, building the characters,
which were very clich√©. The 'disaster' second half section plays out
more like a Michael Bay's noisy action movie, with loads of special
effects and the standard 'shaky' cam.After a while, I actually got a bit tired and bored of all the stuff
exploding, banging, and smoky scenery. This movie is more concerned
with the special effects, rather than the environmental fallout from
the disaster.
