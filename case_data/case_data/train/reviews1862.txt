10
Gold!

I don't have much to say about the movie as I think a 10 probably says
it all. Firstly I'll just say this about Matthew McConaughey...He is an
amazing actor..full stop. I would even go further to say, probably one
of the best actors of this generation. If this movie was put forward in
this year's Oscar's, portraying Gold prospector Kenny Wells, I have no
doubt Matthew would have won best actor, hands down! The movie itself
was fantastically shot with amazing props and costumes representing the
80's era perfectly. Something else that caught my ears was the amazing
soundtrack. Not the normal songs you would hear from an 80's era movie,
by a very alternative soundtrack. Artists like Iggy Pop, Joy Division
and The Pixies, just to name a few. The movie itself..watching it I had
this feeling of gunning for the underdog in the big world of stocks and
commodities, however the film never really delved deep into the impact
of what these companies have on the smaller communities, which is
obviously a deliberate path...definitely worth a watch and if you had
any doubt of McConaugheys acting...just watch this.
