Poor Neo...

There are already ...261 (!) reviews for this B (or maybe C?) movie
that came out only 2 months ago and that means something, i think.First of all this is a remake of the movie "Death Game (1977)" starring
Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp. The 2 women are serving as producers in
the 2015 version while Colleen Camp also stars in a minor role.This is Camp-y movie (pun intended!) with a lot of torture horror and a
couple (mild in my opinion) erotic scenes. The 2 main actresses Lorenza
Izzo and Ana de Armas look crazy enough but Keanu Reeves's performance
leave a lot to be desired. Maybe we have used to see him as a hero
(from the Matrix to John Wick) and we cannot accept to watch him being
lame and weak.There is obviously a moral here, but the question "who could resist" is
also strongly present.As a movie it's OK and you might have some fun watching it, but if you
can't stand movies where the "hero" does all the wrong moves maybe you
should avoid it. The direction of photography is bright and that's a
plus, but if you are a careful viewer you will find a lot of goofs
including numerous continuity errors which could ruin some of the fun.In the end you might want for the movie to last a couple of minutes
more to see the outcome or even the true motives of what just
happened...Overall: Not as bad as most of the other 261 reviews might want you to
believe. (Some of them compare Keanu Reeves's recent choices to those
of Nicolas Cage, so they might be driven by some hate). See it if you
want a light campy thriller for the evening.
