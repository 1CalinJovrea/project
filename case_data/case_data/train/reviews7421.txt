A Bad Movie for Moms

Five minutes into Bad Moms, I already knew that I had made the wrong
choice. I was hoping for a silly comedy staring some actresses I find
to be hilarious (Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn.) This was not the case, as
most of the jokes are raunchy, cringe-worthy mom jokes.The worst thing about this movie, which is obvious from the opening
monologue, is that it is corny. The story is corny. The characters are
corny. The jokes are corny. The only audience that might let them get
away with this cheese-fest, is mothers, because they will be able to
relate.This movie has its moments, but the majority of its laughs fall flat.
Particularly bad were a couple of different montages, specifically, one
of the girls drunk grocery shopping. Most disappointing is how unfunny
Kathryn Hahn is, it seems that every word that comes out her mouth has
to do with sex.This movie also fails to follow some of the basic rules of a
screenplay. The characters speak for the writer, not for themselves.
The main conflict doesn't even come up until half way through the
movie.The brightest spot of this movie is Kristen Bell's character Kiki, who
is a weird stay at home mom. She provides almost all of the enjoyment
you will get out of this film. JJ Watt and Martha Stewart also have
funny cameos.I would not recommend this movie unless you are a mother. If you are
anything but, avoid this train wreck at all costs.Game of Thrones SPOILERS BELOWThey also spoiled Jon Snow's death for the sake of a mediocre joke. Not
Cool.
