What a waste of time

The movie was not so bad itself. A simple plot about a hero ,framed,
wanted, trying to do the right thing and save the people he loves. BUT
this should not even be a movie coming up in theaters. It is a b-movie.
No plot, tiring, the same scenario repeated again and again. No real
action, nothing thrilling. NO reason to spend your money and time.
Watching any kind of TV series would be far more interesting. The plot
was simple and obvious. It is nice though to see Tom Cruise acting
again. But I had higher expectations and I was really disappointed. I
expected a real movie and all I got it was this 80's style action b
movie. So typical,so boring, I do not understand why people liked it.
