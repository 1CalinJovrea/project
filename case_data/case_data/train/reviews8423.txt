Don't bother

Don't waste your time and money, not worth it. Boring. Very few funny
short scenes. It shows the kinda one night stand girl.Daddario did show she can be funny (in several scenes, not all),
unfortunately in this movie her comedic talent (which I never seen
before-Baywatch remake?- That lousy movie does not count). Let's hope
she does not go the way Zac Efron is going, bad comedies. He also has
made bad choices lately.
