8
Why the hate ? Maybe from people with no knowledge of Asian movies ?

The 5.5 rate on IMDb is baffling, so i have to take some time and make
a review.I guess most people who criticize the film have, like, no knowledge of
the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA and old school Asian movies and, therefore, were
expecting a movie totally different and were shocked.This movie is a tribute to all the old school kung fu flicks that the
Wu-Tang watched as they built their albums, especially the 36 chambers.
This movie brings all the possible clich√©s you could find in those
films, all seen under the street culture angle.I give this movie, like, an 8 for being original and true to its
colors, a movie based on the passion & respect that RZA has for
1970-1980s kung fu flicks. Before watching, just listen to 36 chambers,
get some vibes on, chill out and enjoy the movie to its worth.
