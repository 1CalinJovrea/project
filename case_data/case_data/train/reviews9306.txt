Lawless...ruthless...relentless...rancorous and savage all at once.

John Hillcoat has a penchant for westerns, it's quite obvious from his
earlier ventures and with Lawless he shows how dedicated he is to the
genre. I am not sure whether this movie would qualify for a western or
not but the brutishness, savagery and rawness of the characters are
indeed offshoots of revisionist westerns. The crudeness of the movie and its character specially Tom Hardy is a
treat, he has put in a great performance. Tom hardy gives himself to
the role and he has done it time and again. Shia Labeof did have his
moments but with Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke it's hard for an actor of his
experience to shine. Another scrumptious treat was Guy Pierce, with his
eyebrows missing he was out right menacing. The acting of the leads
overshadows whatever holes might have been left.The execution of the movie was good, it was very easy to be carried
away making it just another violent and gore fest or another
gun-slinger movie with no substance but director stayed firm. The
characterization was given ample space to blossom and each character
did bring an essence of its own to the story, nothing was wasted. The
sound track and the visuals were other such valuables. To me Lawless gives a kind of freshness to the crime, gangster genre
executed in a western-esque style, nobody would count it among-st the
greatest gangster movies but this does leave a mark of its own.I'd give it a 8/10 and would strongly recommend.Addendum: If violence and barbarity are not your flavour, this movie
might offend you and if it's, then it does have the offbeat punctuation
with no holds barred.
