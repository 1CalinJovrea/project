Very infuriating film to watch and extremely cliché

I was looking forward to watching this film, but after the first 20
minutes or so, I found myself shouting at the screen because of the
ridiculousness of it all. After the break in, and initially being HEARD
by the blind guy, they spent half the time stood around like lemons and
sneaking around. I must have counted 8 opportunity's for them to grab
something and knock the guyout, but did they, no. They proceeded to sneak around while be stalked
by this guy who couldn't see. It took them until the last 15 minutes to
actually find the brains to actually grab a weapon and hit him with it.
It was so comically unrealistic that it ruined the rest of the film for
me, because it actually got better half way through once they got
caught. If you don't like unrealistic and cliché films I would
recommend avoiding this one.
