Spits in the face of Hollywood

This film is a prime example of how well researched material can take
the smallest of budgets, minimal dialogue and a complete lack of
soundtrack and turn this into a masterpiece.The viewer is given no background story and none of the characters are
fleshed out. There is next to no information on anyone in the film
apart from the main character, and even with him, there is very little
information given. But that is the point. The strength of the film lies
not in the story but the idea of what one does to survive when life
goes back to basics. The viewer's attention is drawn to the intensity
of the situation, the survival skills that are actual knowledge one
needs to survive in the wild. The cold and barren undertone of the film
should have been the reason for its failure. Instead, it serves to
emphasise the stark and bleak situation that all the characters are
faced with. The script does not pull any punches and a strong stomach
is needed for some scenes. And if you get the gist of the film so far,
then you will already know whether there is a happy ending or not...
