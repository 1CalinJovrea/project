2
Worse than bad--it's boring

Rare does a sequel live up to the original film. And Magic Mike XXL is
no exception to the rule. You've to hand it to MM2: on the fluidity of
race in America, and in the American South, so goes the story line. Are
we in post racial America? No, we ain't,the more especially in the
light of Charleston, SC. The narrative is stale, hackneyed, and
downright dull. Even the dancing looks tired. Channing Tatum's talent
is wasted. The film is full of psycho babble and hail thee good fellow
and gal. And what's more the dancing is hardly 'erotic'. If you're
looking for eye candy, don't waste your money on a ticket to this film.
MM2 might make money. Still, MM3 isn't in the wings. And that's a
blessing.
