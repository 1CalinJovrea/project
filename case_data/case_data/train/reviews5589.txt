Where is the Valor?

Where is the valor listed in the title?There is plenty of action. But try watching it a bit more carefully.
They repeatedly shoot unarmed people!!They charge into people's (we are meant to assume they are all
terrorists but there are women and children throughout the village)
homes, without identifying themselves, and when those people try to
defend their homes they are shot without explanation. People running
away from a gunfight are shot in the back!They raid a private yacht, again, not identifying themselves, and
killing random unarmed crew members as they go. The acting is weak, even for non-actors. But then they aren't given
much to work with in terms of a script.If you just want to watch a few very real action scenes, and to come
away with an increased level of disgust at the way the US throws it's
military weight around without any reference to the articles of war,
then you will love this!!PS IMDb has tried to correct my review because they know how to
correctly spell valour. I have retained the poor spelling despite the
correction.
