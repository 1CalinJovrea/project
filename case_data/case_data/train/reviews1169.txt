This movie sucks.

This was a terrible movie and I cannot I believe i wasted 94 minutes of
my life watching it. The acting was terrible and all you see is boobs
and naked butt. There is no plot and no reason to watch it. If you want
to waste time you could do it doing anything but watching this stupid
movie. I thought that since this movie had a lot of well known actors
like James Franco, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and Vanessa Hudgens
that it would have some sort of quality but I was wrong. After
completing this movie I sat in silence for 10 minutes wondering that it
was that I just watched. It just kept dragging and dragging for no
reason. There is no way to write a summary to this movie because the
movie has no substance. I cannot believe this movie even came out in
theaters, it is one of those movies that should have gone straight to
DVD. Looks like a horny teenage boy wrote out his fantasy and turned it
into a movie.
