Worst movie out of the trilogy!!!!!!BORING!!!!

Movie was so boring I wanted to walk out of the movie cinema. Usual
lets bring bad guy back, find some other bad guys, destroy the world
with mind numbing blah. No twists. No nothing. Predictable trash. The
first hour was the concept of "Hi" "Hello" and we are bringing the band
back together.Jean Grey(Stark) was miscast. Why was she in this movie? The acting was
poor. And of course Ms. Jennifer Lawrence giving me a Hunger games weak
speech at the end. Jennifer Lawrence is not even that talented of an
actress but Hollywood is trying so hard with her. She hardly does
anything in this movie and just says, "fight" over and over. Raven
didn't even do anything."Magneto, you're not bad, you're good" from Prof. X. I'm thinking,
"Yes, I have the point". I wish Magneto woulda zapped a coin threw my
head at this point. The final scene had him floating for a half hour
wondering if he should fight. WTF He did nothing. Or and the fantastic
four combine their powers to defeat this stargate joke. I do not recommend. Anyone that said they liked it doesn't know
anything about quality. I did like the other two xmen before this.
Mostly, "Days of future Past". This is as disappointing as "Indiana
Jones and the Crystal Skull". If you do decide to see this movie, I
already feel sorry for you. Just give me your 10$ and I just saved
almost 3 hours of your life. It was bad...
