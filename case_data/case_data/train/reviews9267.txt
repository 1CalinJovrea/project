one man show a.k.a Nikolaj "the man"

i don't think i can really express how good this film is in words, but
ill do my best...Its about more than just a man screwed by life, it about loyalty and
family, and where you will ever go to protect those you love.I must say, this one is on my top 3 of the year. Brutal and deep film
that touches you.
