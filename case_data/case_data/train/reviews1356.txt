Great Flick with Intrigue, Morals, and Science Fiction... !!

This movie was a fun story to see unfold. It held a lot of clues at the
beginning that all were unraveled by the end of the movie. There were
funny scenes, thrilling scenes, and heart breaking scenes all rolled
into one movie. I thought the action scenes were great, and the fight
scenes were excellent, as well.The story line had twists and turns, and I was so surprised to see one
of the characters actually start off as a 'nice' guy end up being a
'bad' guy as the movie progressed. And then to see how that character
was used throughout the movie was very interesting. My thoughts are this movie had a lot going for it that the critics
didn't give the movie credit for. The story kept moving, and the end
results were truly self/less. Go have fun and see this movie, you'll be
happy you did!
