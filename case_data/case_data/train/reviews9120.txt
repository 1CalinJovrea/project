Wished it Would End

Here's the thing about expectations. I loved Hot Fuzz and have watched
it five or six times with different people, enjoying it anew through
their reactions. The dream team are back together with some stellar
additions and the entire plot premise is based around that staple of
adolescence, the pub crawl. The trailer is fabulous and even gives a
nod to the collapsing fence gag but done by Pegg this time... What
could go wrong?Quite a lot actually.Pegg plays a character who is so unremittingly obnoxious that by the
time the moment of redemption heaves its rotting carcass over the hill
you really don't give a damn. He spends the first thirty minutes with
his mirthless grin, his back slapping enthusiasm and his voice turned
up to eleven and I was overwhelmed by the feeling that, in real life,
someone would have punched him by now.The other characters are a pretty dull and predictable bunch too and
frankly by the time the perilous bits kicked in I really didn't care
who lived or died.
