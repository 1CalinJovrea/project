Have These Guys from Hollywood ever Read the Novel?

When I was a teenager, Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables" was the most
impressive tale of injustice that I have ever read, with the
heartbreaking story of Jean Valjean, a man arrested for stealing a
piece of bread and haunted by the persistent and merciless Inspector
Javert. Then I saw at least two great versions of this novel in the cinema, the
1935 with Fredric March and Charles Laughton, and the 1998 with Liam
Neeson and Geoffrey Rush in the roles of Valjean and Javert.I had the highest expectations with this musical, awarded with several
wins and nominations. Unfortunately this version does not develop the
character Jean Valjean and shows him after many years in forced labor
as a thief, omitting the whole beginning of the injustice in the story.
It is impossible to feel sympathy and pain for his suffering.There is more emphasis to the story of Fantine in the beginning and
Anne Hathaway is excellent. However, Russell Crowe singing is
unbearable; Hugh Jackman singing is boring and the songs are terrible
and I stop watching the DVD of this pretentious version with 45 minutes
running time. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): "Os Miseráveis" ("The Miserables")
