Made for teens TV Movie would best describe this

Although lacking any real sustained exciting action parts, this would
probably appeal to under 16 year old's.I really have a problem with the voting, as according to it's current
evaluation by over 48 thousand viewers it is 7.5 which essentially
means that it should be better these movies which were rated less than
7.5: Man of Steel (2013); Captain America: The First Avenger (2011);
X-Men; X-Men 2; X-Men 3; X-Men Wolverine; Iron Man 2; Iron Man 3;
Oblivion; Superman Returns (2006); Independence Day (1996);
Transformers (2007); and Stargate.This movie is just awful; no substance, and worst of all it's set up to
allow for the making of a sequel.The only good thing about a sequel is that they won't have to do too
much to make the sequel better than this.
