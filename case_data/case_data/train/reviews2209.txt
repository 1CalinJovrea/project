Chick Flick for Men

My husband accompanied me, but warned me that he would not stay if it
didn't interest him after 15 minutes. He stayed, and gave me the
summary, CHICK FLICK FOR MEN.It's a fantasy because it deals with living in the present and the past
at the same time. It's a romance because it's about young love, and
love expressed between two people who have been married for a very long
time and still feel that spark that brought them together. It's a
family film about siblings loving one another so much that one of them
might just jeopardize his future to save his sister's life. It's a
cautionary tale for those who practice habits that could sicken them or
get them killed. It's about life, and truly living one's life even when
faced with the prospect of death. The acting is solid, and Rachel McAdams is lovely and inspiring. The
rest of the actors are amazing as well, and you want to believe that it
is all real. But the story itself can be so unbelievable. Just go with
it. It's like a really high calorie dessert that tastes so good you
don't care if you gain five pounds. I enjoyed ABOUT TIME immensely, and
I could watch it again and again.
