One of the worst films I've seen in the past year

I would give it 0 out of 10 if I could. Not only is the trope of
killing a sex worker for a comedy movie completely tired out,
disgusting, and dehumanizing, but this movie does nothing new. Same
boring old comedy tropes, and relies entirely too much on slapstick
comedy and penis/racism/sex jokes. I would avoid seeing this unless for
some reason you enjoy these things.
