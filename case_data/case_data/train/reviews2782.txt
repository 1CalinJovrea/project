Definitely underrated

This is a smart movie and I really loved every second of it, I should
admit that first 15 minutes of the movie is slow and you should
wait...you will see how it gets you!! Trust me and watch this movie
with all your sole, you have to listen and understand what is
happening. This movie has beautiful scenes and amazing music, OMG the
music just melts in you and you lives in there. Finally Saoirse Ronan
just killed it, specially the way she tells the story, you are
connected to the movie soon and enjoy watching it, I remember her play
in "the lovely bones" she is more mature now and always she's been
consistent and so talented actress. This is one of my favorite movies
ever. 8/10
