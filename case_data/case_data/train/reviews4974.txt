Disappointed

There are so many disappointments with this film, I don't know where to
begin. So I'll start hereÂ…first, the tag-line that, "you can't turn
back time, but you can wind it up again" is not mentioned at all by any
character in this film. As it turns out, Lightning can't wind it up
again. **SPOILER ALERT** In fact, he is too old to finish the race and
needs a young girl car to do it for him. Did Disney not learn anything
from The Simpsons?? You don't have to age animated characters. From the
previews, I was led to believe that Lightning would wreck, overcome his
impediments to win the race and show us all that we can do anything we
put our minds to. Instead, Disney, was so busy being PC by making a
girl win that they actually WERE being ageist. When you pay to see
Lightning win, and he doesn't cross that finish line, you have failed
as writers. I will now move on to the poor characterization of Cruz.
From the color chosen for her, her dialogue, her lack of humor or
connection-she was flat. Doesn't Disney have ENOUGH female heroes-heroines?? Did they have to
retire one of the very FEW males-Lightning?? This was a colossally
stupid decision.I guess Disney did not consult any child psychologists-or anyone with
children-to find out that boys like cars more than girls. They have
effectively ended their franchise. I feel the fizzle out coming. So
much for the next generation of Lightning McQueen fans-I doubt many
girls are going to be asking for race tracks with Cruz for Christmas.
