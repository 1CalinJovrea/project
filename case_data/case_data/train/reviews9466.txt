Loved it!

Not sure why so many feel the need to bash this version of the movie
just because they think they're the top 'original' Annie movie fan of
all time. Who cares if they made a new version...it's not even close to
being the same as the original. I absolutely loved the original Annie,
and I can say that I love this one just as much. It's SO much fun, and
all of the actors/actresses are wonderful at acting and singing. I feel
that the changes that were made were done so to reflect the times we
live in...certain sayings from the original wouldn't be related to as
easily. Nothing wrong with liking both...they're just movies, so I
don't think you'll hurt the original Annie's feelings if you decide to
like this one just as much or more!!
