lackluster spy caper

Chris Pine ("Star Trek") is the latest actor to portray the late Tom
Clancy's signature hero, Jack Ryan, an honor that has gone to Alec
Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck in previous movie incarnations.In the latest, "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit," which is an original story
designed to reboot the series, our hero is an ex-marine turned
undercover financial analyst for the CIA who discovers that the
dastardly Russians are plotting to crash the dollar while
simultaneously launching a terrorist attack on American soil.To no one's real surprise, perhaps, the skilled hand of the original
author is sorely lacking in the Adam Kozad/David Koepp screenplay,
which seems intent on resurrecting the old Cold War thriller genre in a
post-Cold War world. For the most part dull and claustrophobic, "Shadow
Recruit" suffers from a lack of credibility from the get-go. We're
somehow supposed to believe that Ryan, who was severely injured in
Afghanistan and who has been basically a desk jockey ever since,
suddenly blossoms into a full-blown James Bond bad ass able to do just
about everything short of leaping tall buildings in a single bound the
moment he's confronted with some real danger. Even more outrageous is
his girlfriend (Keira Knightely), a nurse who not five minutes after
she learns her boyfriend of three years is a secret agent is
smooth-talking a dangerous bad guy (Kenneth Branaugh with a full
Russian accent) in a way that would put Mata Hari to shame in the femme
fatale department.If Hollywood is truly serious about sustaining this legacy franchise
without Mr. Clancy himself being around to keep feeding them fresh
material, they're going to have to do a whole lot better than this.
