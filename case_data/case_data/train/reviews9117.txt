The best movie I have seen this year so far

This is best movie I have seen this year so far. There I said it. I go
see about 30-40 movies per year on average and this is the best one in
2014. Now that that is out of the way, here is why.The movie is so solid through out, the acting is stellar and it builds
tension to a very satisfying ending. This was also written by Dennis
Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island) so you know it
has to be good right? Right.It reminds me a little of "A History of Violence" in that it builds the
tension very nicely and you know that some where down the line violence
is going to happen, but when, how and why?I am really sad that James Gandolfini is no longer with us, he is such
a presence in the film. Tom Hardy is the best actor I can think of in
today's era, I just buy into anything he is selling, he simmers here.After a summer of mindless action flicks, go see something with some
meat, great performances and a great screenplay. This is a very good
drama, well worth your $12.00.
