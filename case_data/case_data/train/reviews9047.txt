So so good.

Loved it Loved it. Loved it. Beautiful, funny, smart, silly, sad,
fantastical. I will probably see this movie at least a dozen more times
in my lifetime. Can't wait.Why is there a minimum of 10 lines required to make a review? Weird.
Anyway...Ralph Fiennes is wonderful. Could end up being a signature role for him
and one that is remembered for some time - although I keep forgetting
his character's name. That's a problem.All the usual players show up and their all good to fantastic. Willem
Defoe is especially fun. Adrian Brody might be the weakest featured
player in the movie. He just doesn't quite seem to match up with the
rest of what's going on. Same with Ed Norton, although he's less of a
sore thumb. But they aren't problematic for the whole movie. Just very
very minor distractions - for me, anyway.I just loved it. So much!
