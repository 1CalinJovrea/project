This Thanksgiving, I'm grateful for Carol

Others have already mentioned the film's beauty, elegance, attention to
period detail, acting etc. All amazing. As a gay man "of a certain age"
I felt deep gratitude for the gift given by the artists who created
this film. The direction is so subtle and effective, using the all the
tools of film making to communicate information, meaning, and emotion.Like Brokeback Mountain, this film turns clich√© on its head and
transcends the particulars of the protagonists' lives by illuminating
more universal themes. It is a period/genre film that acts to balance
well established tropes of its genre, a powerful corrective to SO MANY
previous films that repeated the same old false, stereotypical, and
often tragic images of gay lives. Beyond merely telling some real
truth, Carol has so much to say about strength, resilience, and the
possibility of finding joy in difficult circumstances. As such, it was
deeply satisfying to this viewer.
