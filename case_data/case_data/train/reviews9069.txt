Stick to the cartoon!

I must say, Disney seems to be putting out live action movies of their
successful cartoons just for the sake of putting out live action
movies! I guess corporate thinking is the initial buzz will make it
money on the first weekend! This is the worst of the live actions, the
acting is boring, the story mundane, I do not care about the characters
at all, it seems it's just made to show how cool Disney can use special
effects! If you like the story, stick to the original cartoon!
