Great movie. Reviewers are way off with this.

This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp.
However, some people might consider this a fault, as Elysium was a
little off the mark. What is great about the movie is its style. They
really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of
the musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a
bloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in
this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty
of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course,
Chappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and
robotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I
haven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time. Add to
that the oddness of the characters influencing the development of
Chappie, this movie is gangster. Still, 9/10, super great movie.
