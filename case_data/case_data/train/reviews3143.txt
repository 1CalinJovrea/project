Surprisingly Great movie!!

RUSH is such an enthralling movie!! Amazing direction by Ron Howard,
strong performances by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (he exactly
sounded like Niki Lauda). Hanz Zimmer is the man for scoring this
movie. The movie is not about the sport, it's about the hateful and
envious relationship between two rivals the whole world knows about. I
did not expect this movie to surprise me so much as it did, the drama
was invigorating and exciting at the same time. It was such an honor to
meet Niki Lauda who flew himself specially from Monza, Italy for the
premier at TIFF. Such an amazing night.The movie is based on the rivalry of Britain's McLaren F1 driver James
Hunt and Austrian driver Niki Lauda who represented Ferrari at the
time. Great men!
