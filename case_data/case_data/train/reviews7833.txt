How awful this was

When Cars the original came out I was seven years old I followed the
"trilogy" to where I am now 18 and let me tell you something... this
was not how I wanted lightning to end his career I mean Jesus was this
movie awful. I would rather have watched the big bang theory on repeat
for the rest of my life.
