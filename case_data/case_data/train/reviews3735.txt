Great Suspense early on and a Solid Climax

The Invitation will certainly go down as a hidden gem in the
thriller/horror genre in the coming months. It was recently released on
VOD with damn near no publicity so hopefully word-of-mouth will save
this movie. So far it is a critical hit (over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes)
and was a hit at the numerous film festivals it premiered at months
ago.LMG plays a damaged man who has been through a lot in his life and is
still grieving for his past mistakes. He and a few others get invited
to a mysterious dinner party where things go from normal to strange
very, very quickly. But the interesting thing is only one character
(LMG) seems to see the strangeness while everyone else is laughing it
up and enjoying the night. It's interesting because he isn't afraid to
speak his mind about how he feels the night is going and what he finds
'strange'. But the sad part is, he's seen as a damaged soul so his
outbursts are immediately dismissed. It's the subtle clues he notices
(something as basic as a drinking game or a bottle of expensive wine)
that make The Invitation suspenseful. Tiny clues that leave you
guessing that something larger is at play, which may or may not be the
case. To say anything more would be potentially spoiling the movie, and with
most movies, it's the ending that makes or breaks a movie and this one
is no different. The ending is well worth the wait, so if you are a fan
of suspenseful movies, this is one of the years must see thrillers.
