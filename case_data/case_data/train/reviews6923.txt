You shoulda stuck to slo-mo, Paul.

Alice (Milla Jovovich) emerges from the ruins of Washington DC and is
contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson), who tells her of an
antidote to the T-Virus that is located under Raccoon City. Alice has
only 48 hours to find and release the antidote before the rest of
humanity is wiped out by the Umbrella Corporation, whose plan is to
repopulate the earth with the rich and the powerful, who are stored in
cryogenic suspension in The Hive.I've always been a staunch supporter of the Resident Evil films,
finding them to be fun slices of slick action-packed horror, but that
support ends with The Final Chapter. Once again directed by Paul W.S.
Anderson, this supposed last instalment is an absolute mess, any
potential for enjoyment hindered by an extremely slight plot, even by
RE standards, and some of the worst direction and editing I have ever
experienced.As far as content goes, the film is business as usual, with big
monsters, hordes of zombies, evil corporate types running the show, and
Milla being bad-ass, but with the camera shaking all over the place and
the majority of shots lasting for a fraction of a second, the action is
virtually impossible to follow, making the film more likely to result
in a headache than a thrill rush. And as if the wobbly cam/ADHD
approach wasn't bad enough, much of film takes place in poorly lit
locations, making it even harder to keep track of what is happening.Despite being called The Final Chapter, the end of the film inevitably
leaves things open for further adventures for Alice. If Anderson does
intend to make more Resident Evil films, let us hope that he doesn't
continue in the same style.
