A darker tale of a similar story.

I was not expecting much from this movie to be fairly honest. I went in
without watching any trailers or even reading the synopsis. I just saw
a few screenshots of the movie and dove in head first. I was then
unexpectedly impressed and entertained as I was taken on this journey
of a test of a childhood friendship. I highly recommend it if you are
into drama movies, but be aware there are some horror elements in play
throughout the movie which takes this drama to another level. *WARNING SPOILERS* If you do not want to be spoiled on the movie
especially the ending stop reading after the break.-----------------------------------------------------------------The movie feels like a darker take of Bridge to Terabithia set around
Halloween night. We have two friends who when children played an
adventure game of fantasy and horror. Where they would try and scare
each other with tales after crossing a bridge on their trek home only
they grow up and separate. they happen to find each other on Halloween
night to play one last time. I very much liked this terabithia-esque game where they tell tales to
scare each other. And although the ending was somewhat obvious it was
very entertaining getting to it. They told the story well enough for me
to forget my prediction and enjoy the story as it was, but when the
ending came I was still left the way the writer intended me to feel.
