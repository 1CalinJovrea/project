Really bad DO NOT WASTE MONEY!!!

This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. Very unrealistic, and
just really unusual. The walrus the serial killer creates towards the
end looks very unrealistic and also some of the situations in the movie
are very unrealistic such as when Wallace is calling his girlfriend
saying that he needs help. Wouldn't you think he would be calling 911
before anyone else? Also at the end of the movie Wallace is put into a
zoo.. I don't think that he would live through any of that and even if
he did, why would they put a human being who was turned into a walrus
into a zoo? I don't know how this was ever put into theaters. I'm
warning you, do not waste your money or time on this.
