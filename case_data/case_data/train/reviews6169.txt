nowhere to go

A film with no plot,no good actor characters,bad casting and a silence
in every aspect of it. It is sad that the director who is responsible
for masterpieces, has reached a so low level of directing such a
nonsense movie. Actors are bad chosen and their acting is below
acceptable level, specially for the protagonist, who is not convincing
us that he is a so idealistic and dynamic priest. The plot of the story
is an ongoing suffering for the audience.There is nothing coming out
from the story. Religious films are not the strong part of Martin
Scorcese and he should have thought it twice, before make us spent
money and time for this film. 3 out of 10 and there is room to go
further down in the future..
