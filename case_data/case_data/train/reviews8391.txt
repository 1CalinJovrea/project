A lackluster superhero flick

This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk
and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little
suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring
their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project
called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's
backdrop.The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of
its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to "save
the world" - something we've heard before.We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the
movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax.
This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America:
Civil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the
entertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster
story.Grade D
