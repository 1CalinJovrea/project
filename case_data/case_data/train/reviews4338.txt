Modern Hollywood WW II, not the real one.

I recently saw the new movie "Fury" with Brad Pitt, and keep reading
how "realistic" it is supposed to be. Here is my take on this movie
(SPOILERS): Brad Pitt plays a psychotic tank platoon sergeant who kills
an unarmed, clearly surrendering POW to teach a new tank crew member
"how to kill". No officers or senior NCOs make any effort to stop him.
His company commander next gives him an important mission for his tank
platoon. On this mission, thru poor crew discipline, poor road march
discipline, and very bad tank tactics ends up getting his entire
platoon wiped out. If you look closely, this movie is just a very
cynical version of "Saving Private Ryan" with some "Cross of Iron"
thrown in. It reminds me of those "Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos"
comic books of the 60's, and the end is very similar to the "Ghost
Tank" story lines in that comic book. In fact, I suspect strongly that
this scrip started out as a film script version of that comic book. The
vast majority of the real members of the 2nd Armored Division were not
psychopaths, and by April 1945 they had very good discipline and
knowledge of tank tactics. Despite the hype, this is another case of
Hollywood WW II, not the real one. Brad Pitt's character needs to be
given a Section 8.
