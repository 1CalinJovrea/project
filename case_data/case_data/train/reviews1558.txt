Man-hating, depressing, and awful

Should movie be titled "Drunk Girl on the Train".This movie is so man-hating only the most fanatic SJW could love it.It is so depressing you might need meds afterwards. The characters are
profoundly unsympathetic and miserable to watch.Drunk Girl's plot is so full of holes it is laughably unbelievable. The
movie can't seem to decide if it is in NY or the UK which only adds to
the confusion. Rachel, the supposed hero of this movie is an alcoholic
stalker who downs hard liquor all day while stalking people from her
old neighborhood (her fav is stalking the neighborhood from the train).
She calls her ex-husband's home constantly at all hours... but none of
her victims seem to ever think to change their phone number or even
block the calls? Rachel drops in uninvited to her ex's home from time
to time and kidnaps a child from her ex's new marriage which the police
are aware of this but Rachel is somehow still walking around a free
woman? On top of that no one seems to even think about getting a
restraining order against Rachel??? Her ex is a psychopathic murderer
but somehow lets all this behavior slide? And then the ex-husband
murders a neighbor nympho girl (a girl who abhors the thought of having
kids) because the nympho girl is pregnant and wants to keep the baby
(who truly could have been anyone's)? I wish I could un-watch it.
