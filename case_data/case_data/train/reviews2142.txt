I Was "Hustled" by the Hype!

I am absolutely astounded by all of the fantastic reviews this movie
has gotten by the critics and users on this site. Did we not watch the
same movie? I was so bored about an hour into this show that I almost
fell asleep watching it. This movie was at least 30 minutes too long
and so over acted it was ridiculous. It looks to me like the only
reason this movie had all of the big name stars in it (Jennifer
Lawrence, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Robert De Niro, etc.) was to
insure a big box office draw because they could have done this film
just as easily with mostly unknowns and saved themselves about 30-35
million dollars. The critics made such a big deal about Christian Bale's physical
transformation but as far as I'm concerned... WHY??? What was the point
of him gaining 40 pounds for this role? It did not add one single thing
to the plot of this movie. He could have done the exact same
performance in his natural state and it would not have made any
difference to the movie or his character. Usually I love Jennifer Lawrence in anything. She is so talented and
beautiful, but her character portrayal was way too over the top and
clich√© as a self absorbed, loud-mouthed New Jersey housewife. You might
as well have been watching an episode of The Real Housewives of New
Jersey or watching Snooki on Jersey Shore. Then there is Robert De Niro playing (shocker) a mobster! Talk about
type casting, I'm surprised they didn't just include Joe Pesci and
Michelle Pfeifer as his sidekicks.I understand that this movie is up for some Academy Awards. They should
not award this movie or any of the actors awards for this. I would not
recommend this movie to anyone unless they have about 2 hours and $10
to just throw away. When I saw the teaser for this movie I said to
myself, "I can't wait to see that". After seeing it, I said to myself
"I want my money back".
