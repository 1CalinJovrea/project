Not as good as I expected, but good.

This movie was better than those with Toby Maguire, I mean, The Amazing
Spiderman attach more to the original story of the comic book like
Gwen's death, it happens like that in the original comic book. But
there are things that I didn't like. If I made the movie I will make it
the most similar to the comic, even in those tiny things like the suit,
or how the cast would look. But comparing this saga with the first one,
this is the best version. I really like the effects of the battle with
Electro and the make up of the Green Goblin. When Gwen dies is very
sad, It's very sad because you are able to get in the skin of Peter in
that moment, more if you have a girlfriend or you're in love or
something. I recommend this to everyone, but kids with 4 years old
should not see it because it has violence that should have saw kids
with 6 years old or more. I hope that the part 3 will get better.
