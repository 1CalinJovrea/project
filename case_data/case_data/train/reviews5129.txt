Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds as themselves

This movie has absolutely nothing new or special to offer. The
"acting", action, humor, you've seen it all before. What makes it
watchable is the chemistry between Jackson and Reynolds, the obvious
fun they're having, and the speed of this movie which never gets slow.You don't have to do it for the story, because every bit of story or
"so called character development" is just a tool to pass the time to
the next action scene. You don't have to do it for the acting.
Everything is so over the top, and the horrible dutch accents don't
help either. Only Gary Oldman shows some skill here, but he's lost in
the mess.You do it for the fun. We went to the cinema and had to choose between
coffee or beer. Luckily, we chose beer. Jackson and Reynolds aren't the
best actors, with Reynolds being a one-trick pony. But the fun they're
having on screen is contagious, so you might just have a good time.
Take the beer, though.
