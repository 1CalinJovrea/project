THE ICEMAN, Incredible Biography and Crime Movie

Such a good acting and storyline, personally this is ma favorite crime
movie of 2012-13. I can't understand why this movie has a very low
rating here at IMDb. I think it's the most underrated movie of 2013,
anyways people know their choices. Some people who have read the book,
says that the book is better than the movie but I haven't red the book
so, I don't know about the book, but the movie is definitely worth
watching. Chris Evans was very very good at this movie, I didn't expect
him to do such a good acting at a movie like this. The main role
Michael Shannon was good to. What I loved about this movie is the music
too. But overall was complete awesome.
