Hollow Hypothesis

Our subject, Stephen Hawking, was on the verge of discovering THE
THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but the director obviously didn't realize before
a montage sequence shows two people getting married, and then their
babies growing into toddlers before our very eyes, we should know the
characters just a bit.The romantic setup at Cambridge University, bathed in an opulent
nostalgic glow of academia, does look wonderful. And yet the meeting of
Stephen and his first wife Jean is so quick and easy, it's not one bit
interesting.As an actor and probably the next Oscar winner, Eddie Redmayne
transforms from a quirky, ambitious student into the tortured,
wheelchair-bound genius, but the performance shouldn't be compared to
Daniel Day Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT since this particular vehicle seems
more like an actor's workshop than a fleshed-out biopic with a genuine
character arc.It's as if the scriptwriter wanted Hawking's controversial philosophies
on Atheism, through the prism of discovering a powerful Black Hole, to
have a cinematic soundboard Â– with an intellectual date movie buried
within the stardust. Yet after tedious bouts of soap opera diatribes we
never really know the man behind the suffering and brilliance, and how
he managed to bridge his personal life with his breakthrough in
science, and beyond.Like an actual Black Hole, this particular THEORY has an intriguing
design with absolutely nothing inside.
