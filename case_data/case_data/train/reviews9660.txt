Different in all the wrong ways

It seems those who like this film didn't see the original first; while
the rest of us were cringing with comparison.The Good: Robert's scene when she finds Carolyn in the dumpster. I
stopped breathing it was so powerful. That's about it; The rest of
movie never lives up to that scene. It's small differences that make the American version not sit well.First, the detective is motivated by guilt for standing Carolyn up. The
Argentinean agent is not personally attached to the victim so his
motivations are more pure in seeking justice for justices sake rather
than atonement.Second, the original character Robert's is based on, had a very very
limited role which was a good thing considering the alternative is the
dead inside, passionless character Robert's ended up being.Third, I liked the justice served in the American version except that
earlier in the movie Jess say's "I hate the death penalty". People who
hate the death penalty and imprison a person for 13 years don't just
shoot their prisoners. Fourth, and most importantly, The original is a story of love that is
weighted down by murder, politics, class differences, etc... But the
very last line in the original is "close the door" which gives the
viewer resolution concerning the love story. The American version gives
us the the love story but never reconciles the relationship between the
DA and the detective. Oddly enough, the director went with an abrupt
ending and ran credits right after the climax which does not typically
sit well with American audiences. Love is stronger than all the
negative and the American version failed to demonstrate that which left
movie feeling unbalanced. I'm not a movie critic but as a consumer that is what I noticed off the
bat.
