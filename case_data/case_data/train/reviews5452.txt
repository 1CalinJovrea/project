As Expected

Ice Age: Continental Drift Â– CATCH IT (B+) What we can say about Ice
Age, love it or hate it you will go and watch these crazy fun animals
surviving the Ica Age. The first movie was excellent but after that we
all know what to expect from Ice Age franchise. And let's be honest so
far they have delivered their best. The story may not be that
refreshing or something extraordinary but they do manage to make us
laugh and involve in their adventures.The voices by Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Queen Latifah,
Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Peter
Dinklage, Wanda Sykes, Heather Morris, Drake and Nicki Minaj.In the end, I enjoyed Ice Age 4 but just like the previous installment
in the end it was little too loud but hey it's a kid's movie so I think
it OK.
