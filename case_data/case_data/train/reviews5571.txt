Schwarzeneggers, Stalones and  Sam Neils worst movie.

Don't really know why everybody is praising this movie like a
masterpiece. I saw it and regret that i bought a cinema ticket. The
acting and storyline is ridiculous bad. Stalone is imprisoned
because... yeah, why? He wrote a book and a prison got built including
his opinions for a perfect prison. He doesn't know anything about it
and than he got imprisoned there because somebody wanted him disappear?
What? Why? Schwarzenegger supports him with his prison break with his
worst acting ever and that guy who wrote the conversations for him
should feel guilty his whole life long. Yeah and then this Oppium drug
dealer. lol yeah, why should some drug dealer pay money to imprison him
there? A drive by would be much cheaper... oh wait, of course, they
needed a Muslim in this movie for Stalones escape plan. And then, last
and least: Neil. A drunken doctor haunted by guilt, who tries to redeem
himself with helping with the prison break. I was damn close to leave
the cinema, but i got still popcorn left and the tickets are too
expensive to waste them... tl;dr - worst movie i saw this year, Schwarzeneggers worst acting ever,
even worst plot, conversations written by an ape and everybody who
gives this film more then 4 stars saw another movie
