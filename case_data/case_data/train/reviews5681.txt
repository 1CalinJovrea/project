First time reviewing a film . There are some bits that the pace does
feel fast but the rest lives up to it's standards. the animation and
visuals are amazing and gives the feel of like watching classic Disney
films and the 2D works very well with the 3D. The songs are great as
well and the voice acting fits very well. Highly recommended film for
fans of the show and for family's and younger audience.
