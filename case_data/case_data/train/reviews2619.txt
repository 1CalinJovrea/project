Really unnerving

I didn't really know what to expect with this film as I hadn't read
many reviews, but gave it a go. It's starts off innocently enough, and
the plot is easy to follow. Then we meet Josef, who right away seems a
little off-kilter, but I couldn't put my finger on why until later. As
the plot moves on, I felt like I'd ventured into the dark side of
YouTube, when you're looking for something normal and you end up
stumbling upon all kinds of crazy stuff. The tension was very well paced and really effective, I found myself
shrinking further and further down the settee. The ending was also very
surprising, I was kind of expecting it but at the same time not really?
If that makes sense! A good watch.
