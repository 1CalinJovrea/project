Bradley Cooper Gives One Of The Best Performances Of His Career.

American sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since
Saving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war
film because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent
war films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I
thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly
dramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley
Cooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's
best movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were
handled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film
were the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but
it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the
main character. The story is mostly just learning about one character.
There really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan
of war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out.
