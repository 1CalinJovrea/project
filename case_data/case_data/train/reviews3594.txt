Need a safe haven from Julianne Hough

Technically a decent movie - However the worst possibly acting by
Julianne Hough - 101 on how to be a blonde bland plastic doll and get
everything wrong. Perhaps she needs some lessons from the little girl
who does a great job.The Jo ghost becomes an unexplained flop show at the end which lets the
viewer down again - I am wondering who writes such stories in 2013. Too
much sugary stuff thrown in at various places (you know you are going
to roll in sugar as soon as you listen to the number playing in the
beginning) A few tiny moments here and there in an otherwise small
beach town clich√© plastic concoction.
