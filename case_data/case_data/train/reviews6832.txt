It's alive?

The opening shot, blurry, a figure moving in slow motion, brought to my
mind a scene in the book of the monster seen going across the snow-
covered landscape from a distance, ... but that is about as close to
the book as the film gets, which is both good and bad. It's good
because it tells an original take on the story, but it's also bad
because it tells a mostly satirical story, told from Igor's
perspective, largely poking fun at the clich√©s in the various film
versions of Frankenstein, rather than a faithful adaptation of the
novel.James McAvoy hams it up as Victor Frankenstein, with a brilliant intro
("Might I know your name?" Igor asks him, Vic turns to look at Igor,
freeze frame, title appears) while the rest of the cast downplays it
nicely, Jessica Findlay is quite attractive, even in the unrevealing
Victorian-era clothing. The film is sightly more serious than its
comedic-looking trailer made it appear. Good sets and costumes, and
some quick witted, sharp dialogue, but the story never really comes
alive (pun totally intended)Curiously released at Thanksgiving 2015, it might have fared better
than its $600.000 opening if it had been released at Halloween.
Considering this was filmed in late 2013, it surely must have been
ready for Halloween 2015, or 2014 for that matter.
