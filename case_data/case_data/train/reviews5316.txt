The Old and the New

The Neanderthal family the Croods lives in a cave, protected by the
father Grug in accordance with the rules of survival that he has
learned. His teenage daughter Eep is rebel and questions why the family
lives in the dark. One night, Eep sees light and she finds the
Homosapiens Guy that can control fire and is intelligent and tells that
their world will end. When their cave collapses, Eep seeks out Guy to
follow him to the new world. But the stubborn Grug does not accept the
change of rules and wants to find another cave to protect his family."The Croods" is a funny animation with the eternal theme of acceptance
of what is new. Grug is a good caveman that based on the experience of
his former neighbors, believes that he can protect his family locking
them inside a cave. When he meets Guy with new ideas, there is a
hilarious friction and competition. But the conclusion is well resolved
and his family aggregates a new member and several pets. My vote is
seven.Title (Brazil): "Os Croods" ("The Croods")
