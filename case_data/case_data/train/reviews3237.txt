Fantastic movie from an almost died-out franchise

We've all seen our favorite movies churn out those forgettable and
often straight-to-video sequels; Death Race, Wrong Turn, Resident Evil.
(Really, not Resident Evil???). And with The Fast and the Furious
series, you were starting to see the decline after 2 and most
definitely 3. So for Justin Lin to bring back this series from the
dead, even to use the weird sequels as a part of the story in his new
trilogy, is incredibly impressive.As for Furious Six, I thought it was incredibly enjoyable. Few movies
are actually this fun to watch. The action felt very well paced, never
dragging on or repetitious in any way. The dialogue was humorous and
the story was very interesting to see played out.I feel like the only movie I could compare this to is Transformers 3.
Coming from a series that I felt like was convoluted and "missing the
point" of a fun action film, Transformers 3 and Furious Six alike
really meet what they were striving for. An incredibly fun film.This next part is mainly for people who have seen the movie already,
though not a spoiler.I've seen a few reviews that say that last action packed scene in the
film's climax was too much and could have been cut. I could not
disagree more. I feel like the filmmaker mislead everyone to think
everything was fine and dandy, all wrapped up, but I could not help but
feel that the action was over too abruptly, and I still needed to see
more. And then there is that last, incredibly epic action scene. The
filmmakers made me feel like I needed to see more, so that they could
deliver that last scene specifically for me. Great filmmaking, great
film. Very impressed.
