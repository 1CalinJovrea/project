What a waste of money...

What a waste of money.... and I do not only mean for the tickets. The
whole production must have been quite expensive. And I guess the
taxpayer pays for all scenes where the US Navy or Airforce shows up?
For what? The movie failed on all accounts and didn't even manage to
create tension or scare people. The audience even started laughing in
certain scenes. Uff I really don't know where to start: Satellite
phones that work inside steel vessels, EMP kills electronics including
satellite phones but only hours late they seem to be working again,
amputations that don't cause the victim to bleed to death, kids that
are totally cool after losing their families (high five!).... and i
could go on and on. By the way the sponsors of the movie must have been
Duct tape and Pepsi. The only creepy feeling i get is that movies like
this or "The Purge" play a certain role to prepare society for future
apocalyptic events. God bless America!
