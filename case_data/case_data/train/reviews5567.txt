One of the best action movie in recent times

Another masterpiece by legendary jackie chan, the plot is bit
predictable, but the way it's executed is way too good :) Please watch
it :) summary- Quan (Jackie Chan) is a humble London businessman whose
long-buried past erupts in a revenge-fuelled vendetta when his teenage
daughter dies in a senseless act of politically motivated terrorism.
His relentless search to find the terrorists leads to a cat-and-mouse
conflict with a British government official Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan),
whose own past may hold the clues to the identities of the elusive
killers.
