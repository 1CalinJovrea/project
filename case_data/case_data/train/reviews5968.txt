Original, Interesting, Romantic

The storyline is original and very well written. I thought it was
great. It's not about superheroes or an action movie or a thriller or a
blockbuster. So who would enjoy it? Geeks, smart people, romantics,
sci- fi lovers ... Regarding the latter, I'm sure the writer was not
thinking in terms of sci fi, but it meets my #1 criterion for great sci
fi, namely, it changes one aspect of ordinary reality, preferably the
here and now and not the distant future, and through that change gives
insight into that ordinary reality that we live in. Despite its' being
about impossible fiction, it seemed more real than most movies. A lot
of the best writing has a writer as the main character - so maybe it's
true that one should write about what one knows best. Of course, it's
about romance and objectification as well and that's well done as well.
