This Movie Will Make You Sleep All Night and Day

His previous gangster movie "The Town" wasn't bad, so with experience
already making a gangster flick, and this time in the 30s, I was very
excited to watch Live by Night. Well, the only positive thing I can say
are the beautiful set pieces. Everything else totally stunk. Its
definitely no classic, and doesn't even come remotely close to The
Town.It seems like Ben is in love with himself, as he's in almost every
scene, mumbling his lines. He gives Steven Seagal a run for his money
for most soft spoken. Affleck is boring, the pace moves at the speed of
a turtle, all the other actors only gets a few scenes and none of them
are memorable. The love scenes lack passion and worst of all, the
violence lacks excitement. It has the most dullest shootouts of any
gangster movie I can recall. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.I don't know what happened with Ben, as he wrote, directed, produced,
and starred in it, but he didn't bring his A game, he brought his P
(pathetic) game instead.
