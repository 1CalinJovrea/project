ATTENTION, can somebody please claim the body of the pg-13 action movie, its dead, thank you.

What we have here is an almost contemptuous lack of respect for
property and human life. But, when that human life is vile, murderous,
plutonium pilfering dirtballs, then its time chop, break, snap, blast,
liquify, incinerate and decapitate (repeat).There's very little point in going into a great deal of explanation of
what makes this so worth a trip down to your local cinema. Suffice to
say Sylvester Stallone has once again saved action movies and put the
meat back on the bone. Here he is aided and abetted by messrs Schwarzenegger, Willis, Norris,
Van Damme, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Crews, Couture, who all dive into the
proceedings with an enthusiastic amount of esprit de corps, taking the
carnage to a hitherto undiscovered level. This is an action movie with both feet planted firmly in the 80's and
there nothing wrong with that one iota. The guys banter, crack jokes,
shoot and cause things to blow up, the bad guys are hissable, murderous
wretches to a man and are blown up.Everybody is clearly having a blast, so in translation, so do you, of
particular note, Jean Claude Van Damme provides a standout performance
as sneery and arrogant Jean Villain.If you like proper action movies i would be bewildered if you didn't
enjoy this. Sly, you did it again, you are without a shadow of doubt
"the man".If they can deliver Eastwood, Ford, Cage, Snipes, Russell, Biehn,
Weathers and T for the next one, then my money is already spent.
