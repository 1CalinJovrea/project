Exciting and Entertaining from start to finish

The true test of a fantastic movie is when you get immersed in it. When
the show grabs your attention at the onset and keeps you interested the
entire time. Your mind doesn't wander about anything else but whats
happening on the silver screen. And that is precisely what this movie
does. Loved the beginning with the fantasy action. Immediately
developed a dislike for the villain well played by Law. Charlie Hunnam
had the presence and moxie to carry the lead role for the first time.
Most characters were very well developed and the story line was tight.
Really enjoyed the soundtrack too. Entertainment at its finest.Don't let the critics on Rotten Tomatoes fool you. The critic score was
27%, but the audience gave it a 77 %. Sadly the critics only want to
give a movie a great rating when there's an oppressed group wronged,
and this movie is not that.Here's to hoping there's a King Arthur II - Knights of the Round Table
