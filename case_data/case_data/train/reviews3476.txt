Faith & Persistence

Based on a true story, Vinny Pazienza overcomes a terrible car accident
to return to the sport he truly loves, Boxing. I was a bit hesitant to
see this movie because of all the previous movies about fighters.
However the director quickly immerses you into Vinny's world and you
are immediately hooked. What I liked most about the movie was how all
the characters were so believable. The close family relationship, the
mother's ritual when all the relatives are glued to the tube, the
family dinners, ornaments etc. Everyone has a lot of soul and
individuality. Vinny's determination is all important, but he has the
affection and love from friends and family. Most of all he has his
coach, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. A man who is fighting is own demons
of being a has been, wanting a winner, but also knowing that a coach
must do what is best for those under his charge, regardless of what is
best for him or others.
