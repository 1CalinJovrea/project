Awfully disappoiting

Let me put this straight, this season 2 totally sucks compared to the
season 1. The few magic scenes are disappointing. The first magic-show
scene is still attractive, but then nothing about magic happens till
the final show. In season 1, magic scenes run through the whole movie,
and all those magics work perfectly and reasonably. In season 2, it's
more like a action movie with many street fights. The new characters
are plain unnecessary. Let's say, the appearance of Lula aims at the
gender balance. Right, it's important. None of us wants to see a movie
without a beautiful face. So, what's the point of the two Chinese
characters, that grandma and grandson? I believe the plot goes fluently
even though the director cuts out all their scenes. Those trivial
characters just distract the audiences' attention from the Horse Men
and make the plot dragging and embarrassing. Combined with the lack of
magic and additional characters, the plot becomes so distractive that
some of the logic mistakes become so confusing. Like, the Horse Men
have nothing in Macau, no money, no magic tools, no identity. They are
under the supervision and can't leave the city. However, after they
save their leader, they are free to go. They suddenly travel to London
and have enough time and everything to prepare their final show. By
then, they are still required by the FBI and chased by the villains.
