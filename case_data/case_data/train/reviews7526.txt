Very disappointed

First of all I read the book before watching the film. This seems to be
significant on how the reviews are made.Like a few others have mentioned on here, the ending is such a
disappointment. The book has brilliant twists but the movie is classic
simple happy ending. Times are changing and I think people are getting
tired of clich√© happy endings. Imagine leaving the cinema if the movie
ended as the book did. The thought provoking debate that would ensue
between watchers would be great. The love story between Langdon and Sinskey isn't needed.I found Vayentha's acting poor. I couldn't buy into Sienna's role.Poor
acting? Maybe.I thought people should have died at the end of LOTR and that was over
10 years ago. Too many happy endings for my liking. This movie has
betrayed the book to its detriment.Not a happy camper at all.
