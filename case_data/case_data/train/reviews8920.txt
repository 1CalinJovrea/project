know we would have pulled the chute early on. I had little tolerance
for Sandleresque scenes prior and now I can't even look at the guy (ok
that might be a little strong). Notice I am not talking about the movie
even after I checked the spoiler box. I lost any desire to waste my
time doing so. Seriously, if you have a sink in the house half clogged
with nasty blacken old waste rejoice in getting it cleaned out. That
free-flowing water situation is about the polar opposite of sitting
though this disaster.
