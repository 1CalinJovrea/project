Actually worse than Taken 2.

You'd have to be an idiot to trust the opinion of someone who can't
review a movie without waffling for 20 minutes. Listen to me; you won't
be sorry. This is not a good movie. Taken was pretty good; Taken
2...not so much. This one is just bad; It's just an old guy running
around, shooting at stuff. None of the clever stuff from the other 2
movies is here. Nothing that made Taken good is in here. Nothing that
made Taken 2 at least recognizable as a Taken movie is here. If you ignore me and watch it anyway, I will look for you, I will find
you...you know the rest. Actually, if you'd sat through this movie,
you'd probably welcome the sweet relief. I meant to end this review
right after "This movie is bad", but IMDb apparently likes people to
waffle, and there is a 10 line minimum.
