Great film

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as one of Bostonians. This movie does
not have over-the-top action sequences or over-acting. It just tells
story as it happened and I really liked that. Yes, there are some
non-existing characters and elements, but I think those make movie
progression little smoother.I highly recommend this movie.
