A great movie!

I think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching
and who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example
if you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of
horror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you
are looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an
amazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not
expecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting
good quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely
interested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its
delivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who
didn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or
Terminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll
not enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem
of the consumer not the product. So the bottom line is, if you are
looking for a beautiful soft inspirational Sci-Fi with an amazing
direction that you can watch with your kids and teenagers and
re-energize the dreamer in you, go for it! :)
