It's not about the historical Dracula, it's about a new story

For all who says that this movie is bad because it doesn't follow the
Dracula story we all know from the past I say, it's not suppose to.
When I sit down to watch a movie there's one thing that matter in the
end: Did I or Did I not enjoy the movie? And this movie was definitely
enjoyable and fun. Manny reviewers say that this is a bad movie because it doesn't follow
the historical time-line and details of the characters in it.
Ultimately I really don't care, it's a fiction movie, not a documentary
about the history of... I even read, in a 3/10 star review, a reviewer that says the movie is
bad because of historical falsies. That reviewer wrote in his comment :
"The film might captivate some audiences who are looking for a fun
time, but there is nothing memorable or legendary about it." isn't that
all a movie should be about? Having a fun time is what I came for... Dracula Untold isn't related in any aspect to the old Dracula story. It
is a story of its' own and a very good one to. I think that the
directors and the script writers did an excellent job writing a
different side to the Dracula story. So, for those who care about the chronicles of Dracula and close their
mind to a different story don't watch this movie. But, if you're
looking for a fun fiction story this is a fantastic movie. I gave it 8/10 stars because it could have been better.Overall this movie is seriously underrated. *Sorry for bad English. May contain grammar mistakes.*
