The Crucifixion (2017)

Sebastian Billmann... Is it because the true church of Christ is not
the Catholic?! Beautiful horror movie..I love this genre and I do not
agree with Sebastian in relation and he says that it is a Catholic
indoctrination film there are other films of the genre with other
religions in other countries I think he should revise his concepts even
because no one singles religion because of movie gets my opinion was
worth !!!
