Horrible Movie!!!

Absolutely horrible movie. Don't waste your money or your time. The mom
had multiple opportunities to ram the car with her kid in it, trapping
the car, in relatively safe areas, and did not. Then she didn't run
over the kidnappers when she had the opportunity? She actually let one
in her car??!!!! Wtf? And she CAN'T drive. Who the hell drives with
their arms fully extended and elbows locked? Then her conversations
with herself are just ludicrous. She's constantly changing her clothes
while driving. Gives her wallet, with her address, credit cards, and
cash to the kidnappers, so I guess she won't need gas money and wants
them to know where she lives. If this is modeled after an actual event,
the mother is an absolute idiot and custody should go to the father,
because he can't be any dumber. Just totally painful to watch. I left
the theatre.
