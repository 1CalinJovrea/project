The single most overrated piece of celluloid of the 21st century, hands down.

*Spoilers*Just when Comic book films were truly starting to enjoy a time of true
artistic relevance and seemed to be on the verge of officially casting
off the shackles of stereotypes and bias that have plagued the genre
for decades, along comes a film to firmly entrench it in every single
hackneyed clich√© and trope that have been the deservedly derided by the
educated community.The Avengers is, by far, the most uninspired CBM story I've seen from
the CBM genre to date, disguised by draping a cheap, easily exploitable
crossover gimmick over it, not so dissimilar to the various other
poorly conceived amalgamations that have been presented to us over the
years in various mediums (Cartoon All Stars, AVP, Freddy v Jason, and,
most recently, Dawn of Justice).Poorly executed, nonsensical characterization ("i'm Always Angry",
basically the 2012 version of "Your mother's name is Martha too?"),
forced interactions and stock 'argument' dialogue (We're not a team,
we're a time bomb.", subtle.), and a total lack of dramatic heft give a
very light (story-wise, not tone), one-note, TV episodic feeling to
what should have been a complex, multi- layered epic.Overall, a conglomeration of "fanboy" moments vainly stitched together
to attempt some sort of narrative.
