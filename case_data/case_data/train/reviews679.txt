Three One Everything

When a film comes out and you know next to nothing about it with a
director you don't know and a cast of mostly unknowns and it blows you
away like it did me. Then I know I'm confronted by something unique. In
fact it was director/writer Martin Donovan who wrote about Moonlight,
urging all his actors to run and see it. Thank you sir. The faces of
those three young men who are just one did something to my brain and to
my heart. The best group of actors I've seen in one single film in a
long, long time. The big surprise is that we knew it all along. It's
all about love and what it means to be a man. Thank you Barry Jenkisns
A revolutionary film made of truth and beauty.
