Lucky there's a family guy who isn't ashamed of being a GUY

If you can believe it, we loved it. Don't care what the critics say,
obviously. But you know why they hate it. Stubbornly suburban, vaguely
sexist, more like sketch comedy lacking a finely crafted story arc, and
definitely an unashamedly traditionalist pro-family view of "boys need
dads and girls need moms." So that's Sandler's POV. You can go to the
art house to see witty, urbane and progressive films (and we do) or to
the multiplex to see the endless parade of horror, action, YA and/or
comic book dumb dumb fare. (and we don't) But I'm still glad there's
room in this world for Adam Sandler movies. Because they're funny and
human.
