Wow - movie of the year.  A must see!

The last time I felt like this after seeing a movie was when I saw
"Inception" on opening night. I realized I was seeming something that
was different, creative, and classic.Cloud Atlas is an amazing piece of film. Even the harshest of critics
cannot say that this film is not ambitious. But I think that 99% of the
people that see this film will appreciate it. I'm NOT one who tends to
like films that are overly "artistic" (I hated "Tree of Life", for
example). But while the overall message of the film is hard to put into
words, it is easy to understand. The film is very watchable, and the
nearly 3 hour length seems to fly by. The stories are sharply written,
and for those who are afraid of getting "lost" while viewing, no
worries ... you'll enjoy seeing clues that link the stories, but even
if you miss the clues you still will see a story that is well explained
and easier to consume than an experimental art film.I am absolutely shocked that the reviews from the "experts" have not
been more favorable, and the lack of box office sales is a crime.
Please go see this movie - if you can see one film this year, this is
the one!
