I don't normally write film reviews, but I felt the need to write about
this film. Story is a essential element for any film to be an
entertaining product. That is why this film fails to be an entertaining
product except for those who find low quality violence entertaining. I
will not discuss the details of the story, but it audience is
effectively robbed of any sense of resolution. Along with that, the
character development follows a "cookie cutter" guideline for
characters in a horror film. All of the performances in the film were
quality enough to make the characters interesting, but the story is
written in a manner similar to painting a canvas using a plank of wood
as a brush. The performances were fine, the sound design was admirable,
and the cinematography was decent. Regardless, if the story is poorly
written, it brings the entirety of the film down. The only thought
achieved from watching this film is "Why did I watch this?"
