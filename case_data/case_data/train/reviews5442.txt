Great action but a weak storyline (Spoiler Alert!)

I have always loved action movies, especially those which involve fast
cars, explosions, preposterous plans and daring execution. Fast and the
Furious Franchise gave me everything and more!! Vin Diesel is awesome
for his role as Dom. For me the movie was great in all respects except
one.A NATO General, from within a secure NATO Base, gives away (or easily
lets a gang of robbers drive away with) an absolutely critical piece of
electronic hardware, which can potentially defeat an entire nation,
just because one member of the lead character's family has been
kidnapped is ridiculous. Juvenile. Unacceptable Story. Period.
