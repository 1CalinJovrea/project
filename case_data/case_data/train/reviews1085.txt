Nonsensical and Psychotic

Seven Psychopaths is a film that requires an acquired taste. If you
like films in the vein of Quentin Tarrantino, or loved Psychopaths'
director, Martin McDonagh's previous film, In Bruges, then you'll love
this film, and if you don't, you're left scratching your head for the
entirety of this film at all of the senseless violence and pointless
obscenities.In the film, Sam Rockwell, Colin Farrell, and Christopher Walken,
kidnap a gangster's Shih Tzu, and this leads to all of the crazy,
bizarre antics of the entire film. That's all you need to know about
Seven Psychopaths. It's psychotic and the character's psychosis make
very little sense in a realistic fashion. It's over-the-top, and
glorifies itself for being as such. However, whenever you have the
likes of Rockwell, Walken, and Woody Harrelson, sharing the screen
together, there will be laughs, even if they're laughs entirely in
darkly comedic circumstances. Seven Psychopaths is just for a small niche audience, and I've just
accepted that I am not one of that audience. I can see how someone
would love this nonsensical film, I'm just not a fan.I give Seven Psychopaths a 5 out of 10!
