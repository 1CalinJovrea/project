Good story, Doesn't reflect historical facts

I really enjoyed watching the movie, however left the cinema
disappointed! Fantastic story, great Alan Turing - pioneer of computer
science. BUT - German military texts enciphered on the Enigma machine
were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December
1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish
cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski,
working for Polish military intelligence. Alan devised a number of
techniques for breaking German ciphers, including improvements to the
pre-war Polish bombe method. Shame Polish Intelligence was omitted in
the movie.
