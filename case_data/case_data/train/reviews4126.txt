FUBAR of the Legal SYSTEM

WTF? there's no abuse, no claim of abuse and a little girl has a
paternal grandmother and biological father and an Uncle that has raised
her since birth...and their solution was to make her go live in foster
care...WTF kind of crap legal BS is that...this crap would not happen
anywhere in real life and the movie was good all the way up to the
totally unbelievable "compromise;" the lazy writers might as well have
had space aliens come down in the middle of the movie and whisk the
little girl away like Star Lord--would have been more believable
!!!!!!!! This movie was trash after the foster care BS.
