I felt that the film was mediocre

Personally I felt this film was mediocre. It could've been a good film
but what got me the most was the pacing. The whole meeting/breaking up
with boyfriend happened within such a short space of time and even them
getting together was in such a short space of time. I also found the
characters exasperating and unrealistic. Usually I feel that Britt
Robertson is a good actress but in this I feel she was appalling and so
was Dylan O'Brien. The likeliness that a girl like Aubrey would ever
end up with Ronnie. Victoria Justice annoyed me and the way that the
teenagers talked about parties and how you'd just waltz into a party
was so so so unrealistic. Who actually just drives around looking for
parties to go to? It doesn't happen. The script was weak and just not
relate-able. The scene near the end where she says to her parents: 'I
met a boy' was especially irritating as no one actually does that.The
way in which the two main leads interacted was infuriating and overall
I would not recommend this film. It was clich√©. However, the one
redeeming feature was the soundtrack. It was easy listening and suited
the scenes. Also, I quite liked Craig Robertson's character who
introduced a comedic element.
