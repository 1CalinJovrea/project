The Drop

I felt compelled to write this review because I was fortunate enough to
see this movie at an advance screening, and because I do not think the
movie will be around long.The reason I think it will not be around long is because this movie is
for adults. It is character driven with a well written storyline. It
does not have anything that would appeal to most movie goers....no car
chases, moronic humor, or gratuitous sex. The Drop starts slow, but you
have to pay attention to what goes on in the movie, and what the
characters both do and say. It picks up speed and intensity, and is
well worth your time.The storyline is a very interesting underworld crime caper, but it is
very nuanced, with excellent acting by all the leads. I was only
familiar with the late James Gandolfini, and he does not disappoint,
and the other actors, although unknown to me were also outstanding.
