Character driven with a tad of razzle dazzle

After reading a few 'critic' reviews I felt inspired to write a review
of my own. People going into this movie shouldn't be expecting something similar
to the King Arthur films they're accustomed to. Guy Ritchie took the
King Arthur character that everyone knows and turned him into someone
like-able. This is the definitive King Arthur movie for a couple of
reasons.The story isn't dense and boring. It focuses on a concise narrative
which doesn't spoon feed history or plot details to a viewer. The story
is happening through the characters, as it should in any good movie. Camera movement is fresh and provokes adrenaline. It's hard to look
away. Something to consider. this is the first movie in a planned MCU like
universe. Not a standalone movie.Bottom line - Go see this movie for yourself, if you're someone who
loves looking at reviews. You can safely disregard them in this case.
