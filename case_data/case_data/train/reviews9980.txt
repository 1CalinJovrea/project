I was smiling almost all the way through

Expectations: surpassed - and they were pretty damn high to begin with.Excitement: met - after watching the teasers, the clips, and after
Captain America the Winter soldier I was crossing my fingers Marvel
were on a roll.Face: still trying to recover - you know when you go to the cinema to
see a comedy ( a film designed to make you laugh ) and you feel like an
idiot for paying for the ticket as you were forcing most of the
laughter in the company of your friends? This is a film that it's
genuinely easy to laugh about: The humour is so subtle because the characters are so subtle - they're
not too animated, they're not too stereotypical and they are NOT what
we've come to expect from traditional superheroes and THAT'S WHY THIS
FILM WORKS SO WELL! Regardless if you're a Marvel fan or simply a fan
of movies in general this is an experience you will welcome as it's new
and refreshing to a sci-fi genre which really needed something new and
refreshing and with great performances, stunning visuals and a barrel
of laughs mixed with the right amount of action this was a real treat
to watch.Thank you Marvel Studios.
