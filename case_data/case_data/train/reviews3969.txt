The Female, Australian "High Plains Drifter"

Ordinarily, I'd never consider seeing a movie titled "The Dressmaker."
However, that was today's mystery movie for the monthly Camera Cinema
Club in San Jose. If you'd told me that Kate Winslet could play the
Clint Eastwood role in "High Plains Drifter" and that the movie would
be reset to nowhere, Australia in 1951, I'd have said that would be an
unlikely formula for a hit movie. I'm here to tell you that this is an
exceptional and unusual movie with links to many outstanding films of
the past, yet unique unto itself. Winslet has never been better in my
opinion in this strong role and she's supported by a great cast with
knockout performances especially by Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. This
movie is filled with quirky characters sure to tickle your interest and
funny bone. Yet it's not an all-out comedy. There's a serious amount of
serious and a fair amount of tragedy. If you like your movies cut from
a different cloth, "The Dressmaker" belongs on your must-see list.
