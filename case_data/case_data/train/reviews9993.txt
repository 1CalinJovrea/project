Same old horror movie

The main character is deaf, so it seems that they wrote this in to the
film to make it different - but it doesn't. You have to know someone
that is actually deaf/mute to realize that this story-line is by no way
believable in the least.I won't put any spoilers, but every other chiller, thriller, horror
film has made it into this film. Seems even viral video things have
made it into this film. The scene setup, camera angles, lighting,
ridiculous sound effects, everything has been done a million times in
other movies.You have to ask why bad films/scripts keep getting the funding when
there are so many good writers here in Southern California looking for
that backing yet have a hard time getting it.
