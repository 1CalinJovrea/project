Excellent movie

At the center and the heart of this movie, is a powerhouse performance
from Frank Grillo as the Wheelman of the title. He carries most of the
film on his own shoulders, with early interactions through phone
conversations as the conflict increases and the tension rises. As the
story progresses and the plot thickens, he peels back the layers and we
get to see what makes this character tick, what matters to him and why
he has gotten himself into this mess. His performance alone was the
main hook for me and held me from the opening to the final frames.You often read the term visceral when it comes to describing some
modern movies, but few, if any have been so successful in creating a
tense, tight atmosphere where you actually feel like you are in the
middle of the story and right there in that car with the hero. This
works in part because of some bold and brave camera placements and
cinematography, which helps to show the story and events from the
driver's perspective. But also due to a tight, well written script
which builds and builds to the climax and at its heart is a story about
a man risking it all for his fractured family.This was a movie I was waiting to be released and am delighted it lived
up to all of its potential. I enjoyed watching it as a piece of
entertainment but on next viewing I will be studying it as a student of
film. Studying the excellent performances from all involved and the
tight, well written script but also how well it manages to be a full on
contained (a single location within multiple locations) experience. This is the first film out of the gate (and very strong start) from
Warparty, which is Frank Grillo and Joe Carnahan's new
partnership/production company and I've read hints of potential
sequels. I hope we get to see more of this character as this film is a
very successful throwback to when movies where more about character,
story and heart and not just about scale.
