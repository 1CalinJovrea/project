A delicious dinner of a movie with the perfect dessert of betrayal and suspense

What a delicious surprise of a movie for this early in the year. As has
been the case before, a few films of greatness end up playing just
after the first of the year. I saw this movie with expecting a clich√©d
crime drama. What I saw was one of the most inventive and riotous
versions of suspense in years. Despite signs that this genre is dead
and buried (no pun intended)here is a very modern film that updates the
themes and tones of film noir without a pause or hitch of any kind. And
as usual in great movies of this type, the setting is a character as
strong as any of the actors. New York City has never looked this
depressing and cold. But what really works here is a cast so perfect,
that you can hardly remember their names. Each actor fits so perfectly
in the tapestry of the plot, that the film has a naturalism so real it
is surreal. There is a an incredible attention to detail that is what
you would expect from a Broadway play or a painting by Dali. One
suggestion-DO NOT go by yourself. Having a fellow traveler to discuss
this is very required. And I say this as someone who goes to the movies
alone often.
