I feel utterly duped

I guess if you're a Coppola they'll let you make any crap movie you
want. Literally nothing happens in this movie but you were reeled in by
a trailer that leads you to believe there will be vengeance of some
sort from these women. Wonder why. Could it be because he literally
shouts "what have you done to me you vengeful bitches!" This is the
second movie this year I've seen with a misleading trailer. The first
being It comes at night which was a very poor title because literally
nothing came at night but nighttime. This movie too has an exceptional
cast with a storyline that falls flat as a pancake. Here goes the
summary: guy shows up wounded, women take him in until he heals, girls
are all smitten, guy fools around with girl, girl he told he loves
catches them and pushes him down stairs, guy breaks leg so they
amputate it, guy wakes up and gets angry, women can't live with angry
man, women poison him with bad mushrooms. The end. This was boring from
start to finish so much so no music at all plays during the film so
every scene feels dull and lifeless. I love how people say slow burn.
That's like when you say big but you really mean fat. I went in for a
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned movie and got Pride and
prejudice. Hated it.
