Meh.....Okay I guess

I'm not sure why this film seems to be getting fantastic reviews. I
mean it was a good enough action flick but it didn't blow my mind. In
fact it was a case of the same old stuff just done better. Brilliant to
watch but not refreshing at the same time. The story was lacking in
depth and character development and just felt like a filler for another
sequel.I don't want to be all doom and gloom about it because Kate really did
kick some ass and looked good doing it too so as far as action and eye
candy goes its great. But any fan of the series knows that the
Underworld saga isn't stupid. They always paid attention to script and
story and that was lacking here unfortunately.I'm sure if you go and see it you wont be disappointed but just leave
your brains at the door and watch the action commence.
