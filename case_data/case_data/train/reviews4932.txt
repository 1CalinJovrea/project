5 perfect movies, and then this...

I've been a fan of the Child's Play franchise more or less since birth,
and why people are praising this installment baffles me. People keep
saying it went "back to its roots". How? First off it completely
bastardized the sociopath serial killer we've all grown to love as
being a obsessive home-wrecker with an admiration for ..flowers.
Watching this movie completely takes away from the previous films - if
you chose to consider it (I won't). Also this is the first movie in the
franchise to show any on screen nudity (that wasn't a doll) - how is
that "back to its roots"? Honestly, I think it's safe to guess that
anybody praising this film hasn't watched a Chucky movie in a good
decade, or care that much, but as a life long fan, this was sickening.
The scene after the credits is proof enough that Mancini just wanted to
give the fans what they've been asking for. Unfortunately fans don't
write good movies, and this is proof. I am a true fan pleading, PLEASE
GO BACK TO YOUR ROOTS (making fun unique movies). I'm sorry, but Curse
Of Chucky is a pointless installment in the franchise and I am glad
that it was straight to DVD because hopefully that will make it that
much more forgettable.
