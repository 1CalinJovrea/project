A different and good interpretation of Mary Shelley's novel

Despise the bad reviews from some viewers on IMDb I did enjoy Victor
Frankenstein. There's been a lot of movies based on Mary Shelley's
novel, some bad ones and some good ones, and I thought this version
belongs to the good ones. It's a different approach but entertaining to
watch. Daniel Radcliffe proves that he can act something else then
Harry Potter. His collaboration with Victor Frankenstein played by
James McAvoy works perfectly well in this dark picture. There are
plenty enough moments of disgusting creatures and scenes to make the
more sensation seekers happy. Why some people rate it so low remains a
mystery to me. There are thousands of worse movies then this. I truly
enjoyed it and I'm sure a lot of people will do also.
