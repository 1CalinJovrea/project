Halloween Review #23

Happy Death Day is the new horror film directed by Christopher
Landon,who directed Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones as well as
Scouts Guide To Zombie Apocalypse,two movies that got very poor
reviews,that I really enjoyed,Scouts Guide is a hilarious one of the
best comedy's ever as well as The Marked Ones being my third favorite
in the PA series after three and one. When I heard about Happy Death
Day coming to my cinema,I wasn't really excited in fact,even my sister
who barely watches any movies didn't want to go see this,and she liked
Ouija..ya,really. But,when I heard all the good reviews,I decided to
watch it for you guys..and myself,just in case I really liked it. So
when I watched the first half of the film,I was definitely hooked and
then..Happy Death Day,somehow,became one of my favorite horror films
ever! Look,I know Happy Death Day is nor original due to Groundhog Day
and Before I Fall,but the way they did it was brilliant. The film has
no dry lines and no bad writing,I can't find anything wrong with the
film,it had like a million endings and I was excited to see what would
happen next. The acting in the film was also very good from some teens.
Christopher Landon is a great director in horror to me,and I hope he
keeps directing great films like these first three,although,some may
disagree,which I can understand. Happy Death Day though..wow!
