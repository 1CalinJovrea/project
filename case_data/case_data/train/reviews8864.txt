It has good things/ but the Oscar???

6.9/10, I did not like it, the first hour I think it is pretty good, as
we show the complexes and problems of Chiron as a child and as a
teenager, is one of the successes of this film, this is thanks to Barry
Jenkins that I think this first hour is very well written and the
direction of Barry Jenkins is brilliant. He takes us by the hand and
tells us an interesting story,accompanied with great music and very
beautiful cinematography. Mahershala Ali , the music and the
cinematography are the best of the movie.After the first hour , the film falls and it turns boring, the story
does not advance any more and it seems that the movie is about
anything, we can not explore more our main character, there is not much
rank on what we see about Chiron.
