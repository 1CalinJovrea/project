Hodgeman to the rescue...lucky girl ..!!

Just when rom-coms got all boring and oh-so-predictable and we decided
to write them off of our Sunday evenings, Jon Kasdan presented this
cute,funny movie- the first time. Thank you!Beautiful (literally) characters,witty dialogues,good background score
and decent acting make this a great option for the rom-com genre fans.
The movie did not leave me feeling all mushy and longing for
romance...but it was definitely a feel good ride..it actually lifted my
spirits :)Try not to miss it.You will like it,if not love..but it's hard to
dislike such a "from the heart" love story. Do watch it..it's not a
waste of time..pure entertainment.
