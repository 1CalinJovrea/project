Great FX, but lacks in storyline

I liked District 9 and Elysium, so I was really looking forward to
Chappie, especially for the special effects that I'd seen in those
previous films. I felt like Chappie needed to be at least another hour
longer to convey the director's message properly. There are way too
many holes in the story to lead to such a thought-provoking ending.
I'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects, but the
story was not extensive enough. One - there's no explanation as to why
"Ninja" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars; two
- one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to
expect they're loving foster parents; and three - why would
transferring one's "consciousness" to another being also carry their
voice and accent over? I expect a movie to suspend my beliefs for a
couple of hours, but a story that flows well makes for $ better spent.
