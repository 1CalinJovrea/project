10
Absolute brilliance, it was utter Filth & I loved it.

I had such high hopes for this movie after seeing some of the most
intriguing trailers I've ever seen. I was not disappointed what so
ever.I liked this title so much I would actually fit it into my top 10 of
all time.Without spoiling much for anyone, it really is filth. The movie
definitely earns its 18 rating because at times, it is quite literally
hardcore pornography.Bruce is one of the most complex characters I've ever seen in a movie.
It took a while to decipher exactly what was going wrong with him, but
it because clear by the end.I want to make it clear to people going into this movie what they
should expect. Expect a lot of violence, a lot of swearing, pornography
& masturbation, depression and mental illness. It's a movie for those
who don't get offended very easily. In summary, this movie will make you laugh, it'll make you cringe &
it'll make you happy. The overall feeling at the end though, is that
you're watching a man lose his mind, & you see his depression take over
his body in many different ways.I'm giving it 10/10 because I thought everything about it was so
perfectly done. It achieved exactly what it set out to do, it achieved
utter filth.
