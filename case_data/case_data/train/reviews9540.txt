It's not always about the fittest, but about the strongest - in mind
more than in body. And this movie with very little dialog if you made a
statistic, as in lines per minute, will not be every ones deal. It just
is too quiet and too slow, especially when it sets up the life of our
protagonist. Of course there will be inciting incidents and how our
main man will react to them.It's tough to say he's likable, but he's pragmatic. And it's also tough
to really put yourself into his shoes. because living alone for a very
long time makes you see things - differently. And it's really about the
way we live in our own world. Even when surrounded by others, we can
only tell what we are feeling, not what others think. It's dirty and it
never backs out on anything, which you'll either love or hate about it
