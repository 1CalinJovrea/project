Incredibly Moving

As I looked up the movie description I was skeptical of how the movie
would play out. Upon watching the film in its entirety; this film is
spectacular, intriguing, beautiful and moving spiritually. I highly
recommend this film. The points touched on in the film lead to such
wonder, such possibility. Questions I have asked myself, feelings, and
the atom connections. There are clearly so many unanswered questions
and as humans we've barely scratched the surface. It may take many more
years to truly reveal the origins or maybe the origins are never truly
meant to be understood. Regardless, this film will leave you in
wonderment and bewildered.
