"F**k" is a great way to describe this one

Wow, I just left the movie theater and I am shocked about the amount of
bad reviews this movie had. I am a kind of huge fan of Tommy Lee Jones
and Robert De Niro so perhaps my opinion about this movie is a bit
influenced by that. Despite that, I must confess I truly enjoyed this
movie. It was funny and it was very interesting to see how the family
get used to an all new identity every time they had to move in. The
plot is basically about a family, the Mazonis, that was relocated to
Normandy under the witness protection program. So they had basically to
try fitting in soon to avoid being caught by the mafia members who were
trying to kill them. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro were really
great playing their characters and despite not being an excellent
movie, "The Family" is enjoyable and is another great addition to Luc
Besson's career.
