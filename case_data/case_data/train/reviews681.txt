So So film that was So disappointing

Well done the marketing department for creating a buzz around this
film. The first comments I read in the newspapers said this was an
uplifting life affirming experience. So how come my husband and I left
the cinema feeling thoroughly depressed with the ending. The film was
slow, boring and didn't have much to say. The opening sequence looked
promising but turned out to be an unconnected piece of entertainment
that wasn't repeated in the movie. It was left to Stone and Gosling to
stumble along with short bits of dancing and very shaky vocals. Didn't
detect any magical reaction from the audience who shuffled out in
silence. Don't believe the hype this is a just OK film probably a 5.4
rating would be nearer the truth.
