Mark Walberg is Great in Intense Contraband

Contraband is a well-made action film with strong acting, good
directing, and great cinematography that draws you into New Orleans,
Panama, and their freight ship. Mark Walberg plays a man pulled back
into his smuggling past to right the wrongs of his naive brother-in-law
and protect his family.Mark Walberg is excellent as the lead character. He is strong in the
action scenes on his smuggling trip to Panama , and he is just as good
in dramatic scenes calling his wife to help her back home. He is a
strong protagonist who is likable and draws a lot of empathy as he
tries to fight the bad guys and save his family.Walberg is supported by a strong cast. Giovannis Ribisi does well as a
dirty, corrupt smuggler who terrorizes his family, Ben Foster is
excellent as Walberg's recovering addict and alcoholic ex-smuggling
parter who struggles to do the right thing. And, Kate Beckinsale is
great as Walberg's wife, who also must fight to protect her family.The director does a great job of building intensity throughout the
film. He brings the audience into the smuggling trade in a realistic
and believable manner. And, the director effectively engages the
audience in the drama and action at three locations simultaneously as
the film builds to its resolution back in New Orleans.Overall, the film is a strong action film. If you dismiss the standard
plot and some lapses of reality, you'll enjoy the intense action,
strong acting, and great scenery. Catch Contraband in the theaters to
enjoy it on the big screen.Just be careful about smuggling your own candy into the theater.
