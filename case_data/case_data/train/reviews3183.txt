An everyday story of collaboration and betrayal

I was nearly put off going to see this after reading a few sneering
reviews, which in retrospect appear to have been more an attempt by the
critic to show off about their having read the novel than having
actually anything to do with what's on screen.Yes, the narration is a little heavy handed at times but ultimately
necessary and the incongruous "When it comes to war you really find out
what people are really like" early on felt like it was being trowelled
out so we didn't miss it. Sure, it's not perfect but these are minor
niggles not major flaws.Thankfully, it isn't a boy invades village; girl falls in love; boy
isn't as beastly as first thought kind of story. Life's more
complicated than that. Where the film excels is that what you think of
a character changes as the film progresses. There is no good German.
There is no black and white collaboration. There are just people
confronted with circumstances and how they react to them.Michelle Williams brilliantly underplays her role which counteracts the
clumsiness of the script in places, Matthias Schoenaerts is superb as
the sensitive and conflicted man of war and the supporting cast
excellent.It's a little gem.
