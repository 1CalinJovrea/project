8
Kept me at the edge of my seat

Although I'm not a hardcore fan of this franchise, I did watch all of
its titles and frankly speaking this installment kept me at the edge of
my seat for a good two hours of actions, except maybe for the somewhat
lengthy and awkward but fortunately rare conversational scenes. I like
the breath-taking and adrenaline rush of the 'unusual' car-chase
scenes, which have already been revealed in the trailer, involving F1
cars, a tank and even a plane. As for the speed rush, you'll just have
to watch it yourself. I also enjoyed the little bit of reminisce in
classic scenes here and there, as well as some humorous scenes
involving mostly Tyrese. Got to give it to him for the laughs.I don't mind the fact that there's more of Dwayne Johnson but I'm
actually quite disappointed with Paul Walker's underplayed role. Vin
Diesel could also use a bit more facial and non-verbal expressions. Overall I find it as one of the best installment of the franchise, and
definitely a good watch if you're a typical action flick fan. 8 from me
as it certainly tops my action movies list of the year, but pretty
straight-forward and not quite yet to reach a 'legendary' status that
movies like The Matrix and Rambo enjoys.Oh and special credits to the production team for the bridge scene and
the teaser for the next installment (remember to stay seated when the
credit starts to roll!)
