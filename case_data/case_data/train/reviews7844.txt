Save your money

For those who liked the play save your money and go see the play. This
film was a poor adaptation with maddening unsympathetic characters. The
extreme efforts and great acting of individuals could not make up for
the horrible script, pedophilia and rape undertones, and horrible moral
guidance. The songs are all sung in the near same tone and were poorly
integrated with the action. This is the first film in 30 years I've
wanted to throw my drink at, yell boo, and leave. I gutted out the last
of the film to give an honest review. The film was so horrible it
motivated me to open an account and review it. The premise was
interesting and brought me in. The cast kept me sitting, hoping it got
better. I can't get that time back. A very poor film for children,
annoying and maddening for adults. With plot holes and inexplicable
insertions. The cast tried their hardest and individually acted well
but the film direction, production, script, and song lyrics made for a
horrible product. The visuals were the only redeeming value. And not to
spoil but the moral lessons are questionable at best.
