Excellent 90 Minute Thriller

Before going to see this movie I had read some really bad reviews.
After seeing it, I can't understand why. I thought the movie was an
enjoyable thriller. I thought Amanda Seyfried did great in her role.
This was again in contrast to some of the reviews I had read. As far as
I am concerned, if you want an excellent thriller that will provide 90
minutes or so of escapism, "Gone" will more than fill the bill. The
single scene that 'annoyed' me a bit was a product placement for
Aquafina water. A large bottle of Aquafina was on a nightstand in a
bedroom. It seemed so out of place that it was an obvious paid
placement.
