If You've Read the Book, You'll Hate It

The original material the film is based on, "The Snowman" by Jo Nesbo,
is a gripping thriller brilliantly composed with complex characters.
However, this film adaption lacks everything. Frankly, there is very
little left of the original story. The scriptwriters not only tampered
with the plot, but altered characters as well. It is an entirely
different story that is badly constructed with gaping holes in the
plot. Without having read the book, I'd imagine it would be slightly better
with decent performances from the actors. Shame that had such an awful
script to work with.
