The Messmaker

While the plot and storytelling probably flowed and entertained while
reading the book, it doesn't while watching this movie. It tried, but what you'll spend 2 hours watching is a strange,
surrealistic, and downright goofy tale told in a very clunky, forced
manner: A dressmaker, armed with her Singer sewing machine, returns to
the town she's from in order to use her "dressmaking skills" (?) to get
"revenge" (??) against everyone for having wrongly banished her from
the town for a childhood crime she could not remember and did not
commit. (???)The central mother/daughter and protagonist/love-interest relationships
are just as wooden, clunky, and forced. You can see this movie straining to be stylistically quirky (was
Winslet the right choice?) and darkly comedic (a diluted "Edward
Scissorhands"), but in the end the screenplay, casting, editing, and
directorial choices completely failed it.
