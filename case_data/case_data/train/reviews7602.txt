Don't let critics reviews put you off.

Don't let the critics who can't seem to get past comparing Chappie with
other sci-fi titles put you off of going to see this film. This story is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a
thought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what
it is like to bring life into the modern world.I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I
enjoyed Chappie much, much more.There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but
have been nailed on the head by the director. The effect once again
visually striking and a very well paced and intricate development of
characters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh
and not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will
have you believe.I would also say I enjoyed this film much, much more than the likes of
robo-cop.
