So much going for it - but painfully slow

This is a dystopian movie about a young woman left out in a lawless
desert with some real choice characters. This film starts off very brutally but calms down considerably after
the first few scenes.The characters, acting, production and filming are really good. The
story is adequate for needs. The scenery and leading lady are
absolutely gorgeous.So why the low score? The pace of this film is cripplingly slow. There
are tedious scenes that should be time lapsed but are run in real time,
there is lots of staring and grimacing in silence. You really can go
and make yourself a sandwich during this and be safe in the knowledge
that you are unlikely to miss anything.A lot of potential, I really wanted to like this, but it is just so
slow I was fighting to stay awake.
