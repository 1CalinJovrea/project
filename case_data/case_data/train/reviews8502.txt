Genuinely terrible summer blockbuster, done with neither humour nor finesse.

It seems to be a current literary fad of the moment to take an old
classic and reinvent it with a deliciously twisted element of modern
horror. Recent bestsellers include Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,
Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters and Android Karenina. Apparently
no-one has yet thought of 'Robinson Gruesome' or 'Uncle Tom's Cabin in
the Woods', but it's surely just a matter of time. Pride and Prejudice
and Zombies is from the pen of Seth Grahame-Smith Â– his other notable
mash-up of classic literature, history and horror fiction is the
fabulously titled Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Word is that the
book is pretty good but sadly the film version of it is a huge
disappointment (that's HUGE with block capitals, just in case you're
not getting the message). It opts for style over content; unfortunately
the style is a horrible mish-mash of absurd CGI mayhem, dumb dialogue
and plotting-by-numbers. It's almost as if Smith's technique for
adapting the screenplay was to link a set of post-it notes together
with bits of string, each one containing an idea for a spectacular set
piece. What no-one seems to have told him is that set pieces are only
truly exciting and enjoyable if you build them around a story and
characters worth caring for. There's nothing of that sort here.Young Abraham Lincoln watches his mother die from an illness which
baffles the doctors called upon to save her. He keeps to himself the
fact that he witnessed a local plantation owner named Jack Barts
(Marton Csokas) attacking her in the night, apparently feasting on her
blood. Years later, a grown up Abe (Benjamin Walker) decides to take
vengeance by killing Barts. He shoots him late one night on the
dockside, only to find that he simply gets up uninjured and transforms
before his eyes into a demonic monster. Abe is rescued from certain
death by the arrival of Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), a charismatic
stranger who seems to know more than he should about the strange
goings-on in the neighbourhood. Sturgess tells Abe that the country is
awash with vampires and teaches him how to fight against them. Armed
with an axe and ready to get stuck into his new line of work, Abe moves
to the town of Springfield, Illinois; where he soon slays his first
vampire. It isn't long before his vampire hunting antics catch the
attention of undead master Adam (Rufus Sewell), a millennia-old monster
who runs a plantation in the Deep South and has an army of vampires at
his beck and call.Almost nothing about Timur Bekmambetov's film works. What kills it more
than anything is the fact that the plot is handled with a misplaced
sense of seriousness. Sometimes a movie cries out for a lightness of
touch, a tongue-in-cheek approach if you like, and this one needs it
more than most. However, instead of embracing the silliness of
everything that's going on and using it to its advantage, the film is
played in deadly earnest. The performances are terrible, but this is
hardly surprising given some of the awful dialogue the actors are
required to deliver. Visually the whole thing is rather ugly too, with
a saturated tone which is presumably meant to evoke times gone by, but
only succeeds in offending the eye.Two stars then for the intriguing title and for presenting a fairly
original concept, but in terms of final execution this movie is a train
wreck of considerable magnitude. It looks likely that Abraham Lincoln:
Vampire Hunter will be remembered as the worst blockbuster of 2012's
summer season.
