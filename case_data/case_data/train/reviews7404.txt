Nobody should ever see this movie

Wow. I just returned from viewing the great Gatsby. This movie was by
far one of the absolute worst, confusing, and boring movies I have ever
seen. The fact that Toby McGuire was the lead speaking voice was
embarrassing and humiliating to anyone who considers themselves a fan
of this motion picture. This movie had no substance or direction. The
amount of CGI used in this movie to display New York City and driving
scenes was the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. I wouldn't
even give Daisy a 4 on looks, and Leonardo Dicaprio is willing to get
killed for her? No way. She was beat. And the music at the parties
resembled party rock anthem by LMFAO. Dreadful movie. If you or your loved ones had to suffer through this completely
disgraceful piece of garbage some may call a motion picture, may god
have mercy on your, or their souls, and I would advise anyone who has
not seen this movie to never consider purchasing a ticket.
