High production values but awful movie in my opinion - contains spoiler

Military movies should always be dead-on accurate when it comes to all
the little details and this was another "this is what most Americans
think is how the military acts" as opposed to the reality. I know they
have consultants - so they do this on purpose I am forced to conclude.
The Hollywood explosion where Megan and the dog go flying through the
air, literally flying through the air, just made my eyes roll. That
kind of force blows off limbs and is instant death. Also, it was
apparent to me that there was no chemistry or "bonding" between Megan
and that beautiful dog, but there was chemistry with the handler who
was always obviously just off camera. I found the acting of most of the
cast, except Kate Mara, to be very wooden and painful to watch. I admit
I did not finish the movie - too frustrated and annoyed with how
ridiculously bad it was. Hey, great cinematography and sound though -
thumbs up on that!
