A wonderfully hypnotic and philosophical film exploring the enormity of life

The exploration of the enormity of life when a recently deceased ghost
returns to his house to try and reconnect with his wife. Made on a shoe
string and in secret, it is a hypnotic observation of life and time
after we die and it achieves to visually convey the psychological
weight of certain death and that life will continue once we're gone.
The people sitting next to me left the cinema about 20 minutes in
because it is indeed a very slow moving film and I can understand why
they left but that's the point of the film. Life is not a highlights
reel, and this film achieves to show its enormity through legacy, love
and loss. It is philosophical, psychological and extremely poetic. A
wonderfully strange film.
