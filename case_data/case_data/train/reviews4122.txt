I did not see art ,I saw some porno in this  bad movie.

Hello everybody.This is my first comment on this site.I was very
anxious to see Nymphomaniac movie by Lars Von Trier,but after I saw it
I became very disappointed with this film for these reasons reasons:The
movie does not have art,but it has some porno sex (woman gives a blow
job a train and a man giving a blow job to a woman). Also it was a bad
movie because it is not interesting at all.I found it boring with
monotonous dialogue between Joe and Seligman who are the main
characters.The movie offers sex and some porno,but never satisfies
movie viewers.We don't know why a nymphomaniac woman is a sex slave who
practices sex and masturbation for pleasure only and we see the
opposite that she becomes addicted to sex and nudity and seems clearly
in this movie she is not enjoying sex.To me Lars Von Trier should
really convince us to see a movie and must work hard to make a good
plot and not just provide us with porno to make us horny.
