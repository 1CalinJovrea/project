10
A truly great film

A 10? Really? Yeah, I know... It seems high but the more I think about
the film the more I appreciate it more. To be honest, I saw it on the
8th of April, then the very next day, today...I saw it again in an IMAX
theater at noon that uses a 4K laser for 3D images on an 8-story high
screen. Only the 8th in the world actually for such a laser system and
the only in New England. Don't get me started on the amazing sound. So
let me tell you, I realized I loved this film. A fan of the original
series and anime myself, I have come to appreciate the process that
they went to try and tell the story in a live version. In fact, much of
the mid-90's original anime movie story-line is presented here. While
the film might not be perfect, I felt when I left the movie, that I
enjoyed it tremendously and that I felt my money was well spent. A good
investment in time and money...and certainly something to talk about
over dinner.What else could you ask for? :)J. Duran
