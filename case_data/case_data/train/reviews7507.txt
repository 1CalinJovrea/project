I will keep this simple...

As promised, I will keep this simple. If you are a dog lover, don't
mind shedding a tear (I'm a 38 year old male former enforcement
officer, it got me) you will enjoy this movie. Simples.It has been broken into three parts, first is a build up of character
for Leavey, second is the relationship between Leavey and Rex in Iraq,
third is the "fight". Some people are saying the third part was a bit
of a let down, but, personally, i was happy with it. I did not realise
I had been watching the film for its run time thinking it still must
have a while to go at the credits. Always a good sign.
