I started to watch the movie with great expectation but i realized
after 5 minutes that i expected too much from a low budget thriller. I
almost fall while watching the half of the movie.Some issue i found very silly.....- We can only see emotion from the terrorist side only... Not a single
moment we see emotion from English side.- When terrorist stormed the embassy and took hostages there was a cop
and terrorist didn't even searched him... Funny huh? He possessed the
gun till the end!! wow!- SAS actions were totally horrible and they didn't even looked like
regular army. Looked more like some mercenaries.- Some scene not even closely related to the main incident.- Actors fake accent was totally horrible and unforgivable. The BBC
journalist's accent was most horrible part. Most actors did not had the
British accent and they did not even try I wish i could give it a 0 star.
