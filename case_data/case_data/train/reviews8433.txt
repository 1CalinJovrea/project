Terrible, gruesome and wish I could unsee it.

It started out funny like the previews showed with only a little
graphic violence. I'll give it that. Then it started getting extremely
graphic. Mass murders, heads exploding, our whole family of 5 adults
were so disturbed we couldn't even talk all the way home. We all wish
we could unsee it. I felt it was a terrible movie even with the few
chuckles we got in the earlier parts. This movie taught me a lesson, I
will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every
review I can get my hands on, this isn't the first time I have been
blind sighted by gore, and disturbing content. If you see this movie, I
beg you not to take your kids, even if they are adults. I wish I could
go back and NOT have gone to this one. Frankly, I am disappointed that
movie makers feel Americans have sunk so low as to find this
entertaining.
