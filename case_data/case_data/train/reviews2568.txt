Apes on horses! Apes with guns!

This film is not just the best film of the summer, it's probably so far
the best movie of the year! These are the exact reasons why this film is great: 1.Amazing visual effects 2.Great storyline3.Awesome action (Apes on horses, apes with shotguns) 4.Great acting 5.Andy Serkis is probably the best motion capture actor ever. Overall the movie was just spectacular. My advice: don't expect
anything when you go into this film. It is without a doubt the best
entry in the planet of the apes franchise. Another thing about the
special effects in the film, in Rise of the Planet of The Apes although
that film had great special effects, there were some parts that you
could tell were CGI while in Dawn, you couldn't tell if it was motion
capture or CGI puppets. You literally feel like you are looking at
apes. Anyways, the story is great, it had some awesome action, this
film didn't disappoint me at all. So I will say that Dawn of The Planet of the Apes gets: 10/10 stars
