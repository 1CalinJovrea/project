Barely Tolerable

This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I only went to the
release because some parts were filmed in Detroit. The first hour was
plot driven and tolerable to watch. Wahlberg is always fun to watch and
the main chick is cute but the last 1.5 hours is straight action and no
plot and I wanted to walk out before I had a seizure.Special effects were visually pleasing, but would have been better if I
cared what was going on. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater. I tried
so hard to be interested in this flick but I found myself looking at my
watch obsessively for the last hour.On the lighter side, the idea behind the plot was interesting and
though provoking but poorly executed on screen.I have never written a review before, but this movie was so utterly
disappointing that I felt obligated to warn humanity. We are truly
living in the age of extinction when we allow a piece of garbage like
this to pass as a major motion picture release in the 21st century.
