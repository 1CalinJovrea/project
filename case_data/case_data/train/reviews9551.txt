Thank goodness there was a dog in the movie!

This movie could have been a very good movie if the director wasn't
trying to make a social statement with the film and if the lead actors
had some actual chemistry between them.** SPOILER ALERT ** Kate Winslet and Idris Elba could not have cared
less about each other and it showed....man did it show. Kate Winslet is
usually a good actress, but she was really straining during the love
scenes. (Yes they DO it, Hollywood is obsessed with having white women
drool over black guys). The love scenes were so unbelievable that the
director didn't even show the final one in the film, it went straight
to credits.It is a shame that Hollywood is obsessed with the white woman, black
guy narrative, this movie could have been so good without that
narrative being shoved down the viewers throats the whole film.Plus, the plot had the actors "concerned" about dying on the mountain
numerous times but I NEVER had a belief that they were going to die. It
was just not believable and a waste of drama.Which brings me to "drama". There were many scenes that were supposed
to be dramatic....and they too did not work.Which brings me to the end of the film. Watching these 2-actors pretend
to be in love was so painful....they simply could not pull it off. Not
good.I gave the film 4-stars, because of the beautiful scenery and the
wonderful Labrador Retriever. The dog was the best part of the whole
movie.
