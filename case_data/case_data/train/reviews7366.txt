It wasn't that bad

So I've read a lot of people dissing the movie, and I don't find it
that bad. Maybe the book was better. Boy, doesn't that happen enough?
The cinematography is good, the effects are good, the clich√©s are
there. But if I leave it at that, you'd think "why did this guy give it 8/10"?
Well, because I was entertained, I was left wondering, it could've been
better like 99.9% of all movies ever made, but it also could've been a
LOT WORSE.I studied - majored - in Cinematography, and I can appreciate the hard
work that goes into a movie. Even if it's a bad movie. I stand and
leave theaters when it goes bad, and I wouldn't have done it here. See the movie, draw your own conclusions (about the ladder: do you
think the grievers wouldn't climb up?), and it looks like a book
reading is in order.
