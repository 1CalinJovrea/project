I don't get it...

This is a fantastic movie. I do not understand why so many people are
rating this film 1/10. I, personally, didn't want the film to end.This film is not a "disgrace" it is not "laughable" and it is most
certainly not "propaganda". Get over yourselves.IT'S A MOVIE. And a very good one at that.Rather than list all the qualities which this film has, I'm going to
explain to you what happened at the end of the film.When a movie comes to an end and the credits start rolling, everyone
typically gets up and leaves right? Well NOBODY did. And there were at
least fifty people watching this film in the cinema with my friends and
I. Everyone remained seated until the closing shot on the casket with
the many, many badges pounded into it. Only then did people slowly
begin to rise, yet nobody uttered a word. The theatre was SILENT. And
there were annoying pre-teen girls present and even they were
speechless.The acting is stellar, the film tells an enthralling story, and this
film is downright shocking. It perfectly demonstrates the effect war
has on people. I don't care if the real Chris Kyle was a brutal human being: this is a
movie. You judge a movie based on the quality of the story, not upon
the person or story that it is based upon. If you want to see an action-packed, phenomenal and moving film this
year, then go watch American Sniper.
