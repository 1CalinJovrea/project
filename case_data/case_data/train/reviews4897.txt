Overrated Mess

The investment broker Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is married with
Julia (Heather Lind) and works at his father-in-law's firm in New York
City. One day, Julia is driving her car with Davis and another car
crashes and kills Julia. In the hospital, Davis purchases a chocolate
bar in a vendor machine but the candy is stuck in the machine. Davis
writes a strange letter to the owner of the piece of equipment
reporting the malfunction and the costumer service representative Karen
Moreno (Naomi Watts) contacts him. Meanwhile he becomes unstable and
obsessed with a weird behavior at work and his father-in-law Phil
Eastwood (Chris Cooper) asks him to take some days off. Davis befriends
the pothead Karen and her gay teenage son Chris (Judah Lewis) while he
tries to erase his former life and build a new one."Demolition" is an overrated film with a messy story and great cast.
The attitude of Davis Mitchell grieving the loss of his wife is
awkward. His friendship with Karen is terrible and quite inexplicable
even for a seriously disturbed man. His decision to literally demolish
his loveless married life destroying everything is ridiculous. But the
worst is when he learns that he was a cuckold and begins to honor
Julia. Summarizing, an awful story. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Demolição" ("Demolition")
