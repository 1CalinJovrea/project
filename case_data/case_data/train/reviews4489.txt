seriously if Elijah wasn't in the first one

shock and awe. its like every movie I see this actress in, the one from
year one and killer Joe...I get allsad. and these other reviews,
seriously...they are crappy. this movie is awesome. a lot like the
first one. the first one rotating around a strip club and a detective
named Bruce Willis. yay. I did like it. I like sin city part one. I
like sin city part two. I prefereed not seeing josh brolin be bored and
boring, but he did fine, he made the right decision ..be bored,
bullshi# cun* (bit)ch making problems... Joseph made me feel like
whatever was going on with Nancy while playing his poker game...nothing
good was gonna happen... the brief interaction with detectives and a
powers boothe that looked all healthy was amazing.... oh boy....I don't
even see how the Hooker nation from part one wasn't omitted when it
seems like they took Precedence once again in this one.
