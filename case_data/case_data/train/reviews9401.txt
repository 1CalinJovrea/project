Convoluted movie, don't waste your time

This movie is god awful I felt like scratching my eyes out after
watching this movie its as if someone tried to make a pearl harbour
remake and duct tape bits and pieces of film together to make a
believable work of art. I would not even call this art its a
catastrophe of cinematography this is amateur work. All the Japanese
actors speak engrish (some might be Chinese)and put Neo as the hero of
the movie.It feels a mess, they tried to adapt a real life 47 ronin story, make
it into a romantic tragedy and turn it into mythological. It would be
fine if they stuck to history or make it a movie on its own. Might as
well change the ending if most of the movie is made up.I wouldn't even recommend it even for a b grade movie it should be
scrapped. The dialogue is god awful, plot, acting, directing, cg etc
everything is bad I cant even think of any good points the action is
meh only brief nothing great. With or without Keanu Reeves this movie
would still be bad.
