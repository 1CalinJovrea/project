I made an IMDb profile just to rate this movie 10/10

I don't have much to say because I'm completely stunned after watching
this movie. This movie is unbelievable. It's one of the best films I've
ever seen. I just finished watching it about an hour ago, and I'm still
reeling. Reader: I don't know what you want from your films. But this movie is
one of the most charming, transporting, amazing movies I've ever seen.
I cannot recommend more.
