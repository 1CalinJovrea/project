I liked it!!

A straight forward Action MovieI don't understand the low rating.. Honestly..A postmodern bulk action movie, with a rather cold (cool) edge. With a
lot of stock actors (redshirts), tons of bullets, car chases and a
straightforward story.. Would make a great TV Show. Good entertainment
with agreeable acting. Rupert Friend is a believable fighting machine..
All in all a straightforward, no frill action with no higher
aspiration.. I did enjoy this compact gem.. Therefor I give it a solid 8/10.
