One of a kind experience.

Easily the best film I have seen this year. Great performance by all
the actors, fantastic plot with a lot of deep meaning and a very
atmospheric soundtrack. It's a very unique film. It reminds me of Basic
Instinct but without the sex and drugs. It looks like a 90s masterpiece
brought from back in time, a solid prove that Tom Ford is a great
director.True love comes once in a lifetime, and we rarely get a second chance.
This film is about revenge and personal progress in life, Its about how
the decisions of the past can haunt our lives in the future and how the
pain we cause to others always comes back to us. This movie sends a
strong message to the people who easily give up on other people and
never give them a fair chance to shine.I can't understand why some people rated this movie 1/10, just the
performance of the actors and the soundtrack of the film should be
enough to give it a solid 5.
