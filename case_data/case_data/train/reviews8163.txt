Rated the same as "Robot Chicken" (7.8)

My title says it all. Even with releasing nude photos of herself and
playing it up as a 'hack' Emma Watson fails to deliver in this
predictable, clich√©, gyno-centric feminist's wet dream of a reboot.
You'd think Hollywood would stop trying to dictate what the audience
finds entertaining, but it seems nobody in Hollywood wants to make any
money anymore. Maybe the film / television industry is going the way of
the music industry. Maybe it should, the 'talent' has been full of
themselves for far too long now.
