I was hugely disappointed by this film after all the hype.First niggle was seeing Jane Hawking played by a model actress. That
made her attraction to the awkward and frankly not very charming young
version of Stephen Hawking difficult to believe.A major problem throughout was over use of soft focus, it made the
whole thing feel very unreal.It hardly touched on Stephen's work at all. All it seemed to say was he
got praise for one idea and then got praise for another idea that
contradicted his first. Hardly portraying the work of a genius, which
Stephen undoubtedly is.So OK it's supposed to be a love story then. What love story? I felt no
real chemistry between the two leads at all.Then there is the chocolate box representation of middle England and
the stereotypical characters in it, again all in soft blinking focus.As for Eddie Redmayne's performance it was OK but I did not find it at
all engaging. It was a good physical impression of Stephen Hawking but
where was the passion, where was the angst? Sadly missing for me.One final niggle, there is a scene towards the end where Stephen is
supposed to be conversing with Jane and it is absolutely clear that
there is no way he could be creating the text on his computer in the
speed required to produce the conversation we see.I watched it with my wife on Valentine's day eve and she was equally
unimpressed. How this film can be considered for any Oscars is a total mystery to
me. Whiplash is so so so so much better.
