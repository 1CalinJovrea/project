Easily the single best film of 2016

This film is absolutely amazing on so many levels. And i totally agree
with those who said that BrimStone is the best film of 2016. It
accomplishes that with ease even.And lets say for a moment even if this film would not nonchalantly
offend alt-right and religiously delusional hypocrites a like, purely
from a cinematic standpoint BrimStone is a stunning piece of work.I found that the characters, the story, the dialogue, the camera and
lighting was so well crafted that the the sum of it all quickly pulled
me in. BrimStone has that mesmerizing quality that lets you forget
everything else around you while watching. The main villain was the
most detestable character in a very long time. No spoilers here, but
wow... The classical music is absolutely beautiful and fits the theme,
emotions and story extremely well. Somewhere i read that this film was
5 years in the making. And it shows every well crafted moment.We watch films for emotional connections. And this film does connect so
masterfully. And if you are unable to accomplish such, or find it hard
to follow a simple story, there are still plenty of explosions and
leather clad superheroes to brighten your day in other recent
productions. Don't watch the trailer. Ignore the insecure alt-right internet crap
storm. And jump straight into this film without any spoilers. That way
BrimStone is the most enjoyable experience. BrimStone is a
classic,essential drama, in every sense of the word. Don't miss it!
