Another junk-movie

After the good box-office performance of "Ted", this sequel was already
predictable. It is especially recommended to those who liked the first
film and especially advised against all people whose good sense and
good taste prevented them from properly enjoying it. The film brings
nothing new, just continuing the story of the obscene and rude teddy
bear that shone in the initial film. Unfortunately, the manners and
behavior of the creature have in no way improved, continuing to be the
perfect mirror of a generation of teenagers with no prospects of life,
no education, no manners and obsessed with everything that has to do
with sex, alcohol or induce hallucinogenic states. The film is supposed
to be a comedy but, viewed from this perspective, it takes on tragic
and deeply unhappy contours. But I'm not surprised. I was not expecting
Seth MacFarlane, a man who likes to make movies and serials with
offensive and provocative humor, had suddenly turned into an Amish or
something like that. But I remain in doubt whether the art of cinema
needed another junk-film for its vast collection. In any case, the film
has an advantage (the only one): as a social critic, it allows us all
to think whether we want to be equal or better than that bear, and
allows me (and others like me) to write texts like this.
