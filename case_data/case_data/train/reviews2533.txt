This is not an above 7 movie,worst Patrick Steward movie ever!

All the characters in this movie are awful. The"heroes" are a trash
metal band and they're portrayed like a bunch of losers. They all have
zero character development and you just don't care for there faith.The villains are a group of neo Nazis and of course they are "bad". All
of this is way to obvious and convenient and never goes deep enough to
give it some weight. Patrick Stewart's performance falls flat in the
meaninglessness that is this movie.There are some effects that were nice(a few) but they always lacked the
impact it usually has in better movies. A lot of the "tense" scenes are
in the dark and I really could not make out what was happening in some
of those scenes. In the end it's just bad storytelling and a movie that
doesn't make a whole lot of sense.I am somewhat surprised there is a broad audience that seem to like
this movie and that it even won some prices.It made me think of the movie "urge" with Pierce Brosnan as a lead "bad
guy"and a fistful of unknown younger actors.Both movies had a similar set up but I did not like either of 'm so I
can not recommend them.Everybody who likes this...enjoy!
