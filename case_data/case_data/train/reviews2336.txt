Waiting for another Jack Reacher movie

I loved this movie. The movie is to the expectations (and much more) we
have for Tom Cruise, as he had already set the bar by Mission
Impossible series. He doesn't disappoint us, besides take us to the
another level. The character Jack Reacher is awesome, fantastic, it's huge. It can't
be covered in just a movie. So, there should be a series of Jack
Reacher movies, at least bless us with an another one. At lots of points, Jack Reacher reminded me of Holmes. I'm a Tom
Cruise' as well as Holmes' fan, so when both come in one packet, it's a
treat. The methodological reasoning & deduction to the impossible shown
behind the crime is very good. The character's military background, no
baggage rule, no need of a pen, distance from women add grooming to the
character. When the movie is over, that's the time I hoped it just should go on
and on and on. I'm not quenched with just one episode of jack reacher.
That doesn't mean movie is incomplete. The movie is complete in itself.
But, the thirst grows as it come to an end. Rosamund pike also does
justice to the role. I as well like to see her in another episode. Well, it is a top acted all in all a very good film. Just watch it &
feel the thirst..
