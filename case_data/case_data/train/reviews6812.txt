Only action scenes are good

Captain America is only a stupid cowboy in this movie. Why does he not
sign the regulation papers? He isn't a god like Thor or Superman. Who
is Captain America to be above the Law? Superman or a American cowboy?
Why did he not tell Iron Man what his best friend have done with
H.Stark and his mother? Does he know how to talk with his friends like
Tony? I think not. He only knows how to fight... like a perfect
soldier...And what about the conflict? And the consequences? Will we see them? Or
Captain is already a friend for Tony? He has given a cheap cellphone to
Tony... so... the conflict doesn't matter...Only the action scenes are good...
