Fun and addicting

I've watched the guest in the past day or so 3 times its the definition
of fun, I did see it in the cinemas back in September but had mixed
feelings, but here's the thing i couldn't stop thinking about it it got
me thinking and talking that is a good thing. And I got it early on blu
ray so ha that's how I watched it in the past few days. Dan Stevens is incredible in this he pulls of a creepy and scary
performance while being a handsome man he pulls this role off so well I
can't think of anyone else In this role. This film is a dark comedy which some people writing these reviews fail
to understand, that's what makes me laugh almost as much as the actual
film, how can you take a film about a guy who can take about 3 stab
wounds to the chest seriously is beyond me. And plus watch the
interviews with Wingard and Stevens it's intentional. Sheila Kelly is dreadful and is the weakest part about the movie
besides her everyone else is pretty good. I can watch the guest 6 more times today it's that fun. Watch it but
know it's an intentional Dark comedy.
