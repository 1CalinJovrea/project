Aliens meets Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day

Edge of Tomorrow is a science fiction film starring Tom Cruise and
Emily Blunt. It had a very clever plot and well-paced action scenes.
What intrigued me about it was that it is based on a Japanese graphic
novel (or manga) called "All You Need Is Kill".The story is about an army officer named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who
gets caught up in fighting a war against an elite alien race along side
Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). Shortly after dying
the first time he is dropped into combat, he discovers that he is stuck
in a time loop which repeats the same scenario over and over. Realising
they can use this to their advantage, Cage and Vrataski hone their
battle skills each time the loop occurs and hatch a plan to kill the
aliens and win the war.This concept was very cleverly executed. It was like Aliens meets
Starship Troopers meets Groundhog Day. When the movie wanted to be
funny with jokes about deja vu, it was hilarious. Even Tom Cruise, whom
I normally despise, was very good in this movie, not taking himself too
seriously and Emily Blunt was enjoyable as well.I rate it 8/10.
