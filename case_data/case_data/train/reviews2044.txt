Most predictable movie ever-  I cannot believe Andreea Negoita liked it.

As I said, the movie was extremely predictable. I knew what was going
to happen before it did and I honestly felt like I was watching it for
the 3rd time! There were no twists, no suspense, no surprises. I could
not believe that there would be so many clich√©s and unrealistic scenes.
Instead of an "action/adventure film" I saw a boring love story. I
can't imagine how unbearable it must have been for those who read the
book..*SPOILER* The following scenes are examples of why the plot was so
obvious and boring: We knew that Tris would not go into the same faction as her family, we
knew which one she'd choose, we knew that she'd fall in love with Four,
we knew that she wouldn't get kicked out of training, we knew that Four
would find out that she was a Divergent but wouldn't tell anybody
etc... Moreover, the scene where Tris and Four fight is so unrealistic
and again, the fact that he started fighting on her side was way too
PREDICTABLE. *END OF SPOILER*To me, Divergent looked like a bad version of the Hunger Games and I am
really surprised that so many people liked it. Unless you are a teenage
girl who finds Theo James hot and unless you have never read any books
or watched any other movies in your life, I see no reason why you would
want to waste 2 and a half hours of your life watching Divergent.
