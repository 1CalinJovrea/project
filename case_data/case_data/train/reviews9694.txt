Most Hilarious Movie I've Seen

I came to see Bella Thorne, and she was stunning!I liked the older black people a lot. They were so funny, in a way the
most I've laughed in my life. I held it in at 1st. I caught so many
funny moments, and they made sense. I read a lot of black literature in
high school. I read Uncle Tom's Cabin in one night and was the only one
to get an A and was the only one a grade ahead. I've lived in the New
Orleans area and studied there for awhile. I know what the blacks see
and go thru, in a way. I appreciate their contribution to jazz music,
which characterizes the culture and many benefits from it, as I am a
music student.It was so much fun laughing at this, and there were old black ladies in
the theater! It was such a memorable experience.
