A fun suburanite/spies mashup

This film was a lot of fun! A suburban couple dedicated to their kids,
careers and cul-de-sac neighborhood have their orderly lives upended by
new neighbors who seem a bit larger than life and turn out to be just
that. The film has fun with the characters (whose personalities drive a
lot of the humor), their reactions to their changing situations, with
everyone trying to keep their priorities straight. The conventions of
spy movies are entertainingly employed and spoofed. Overall, a good mix
of humor and action, and also has a sense of respect for all the
characters.Being in a similar stage of life and circumstances to the main
characters (minus the car chases, explosions and such) likely added to
the enjoyment.
