Indeed it's a hardcore action fiesta.

Saw this on a rented DVD. I was very reluctant to watch this as I
cannot stand quick-cut, hand -held camera shot movies. M not a big fan
of pov movies nor m a fan of games n all. My son made me play GTA n i
kinda enjoyed that. So it was he who persuaded me to watch this flick.
It was not bad. The story was lame, acting was nada. The best thing
bout this flick is the top notch brutal/violent action sequences. At
times it made me turn my head not coz of gore but coz of its shaky cam.
The editing is very good. All credit shud go for the direction n
stunts. Ilya Naishuller shud b given more action projects to direct.
This movie has a very good parkour sequence. Action fans n gamers will
not be disappointed at all. I wish that this movie was made in a normal
mode with the same kinda stunts, parkour, action gore. The gun fight
sequences were top notch. Gamers and action junkies will love this
mind-boggling action fiesta.
