Stupid version of a great movie

Wow! How the heck is this movie rated in the 8's? Are there that many
tasteless people out there?? This movie has no character, no heart,
nothing captivating about the superhero. No lead up to him becoming
superman and way way way overboard on action, to where you simply
become immune to it. I'll be honest I actually fell asleep for a little
bit and trust me I missed nothing! Christopher reeve is rolling in his
grave right now and I'm sure gene Hackman and the other great actors of
the original are disappointed as well. Superman returns was better than
this and that movie was a 4 or 5 at best. Don't waste your money on
this movie just because they say it's a blockbuster!
