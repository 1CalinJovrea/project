Just about watchable 6/10

The girl on the train (2016) - Having heard good things about the book
I watched this fully expecting a real gripping thriller, but i was
wrong. It is very slow and boring for the first part of the movie and
takes awhile to get into something worth watching.. Its a good story
with an exciting plot but just didn't work for me. Nevertheless it was
watchable and enjoyable in parts but failed to excite me like a
thriller/mystery should.
