A Good Time

Goosebumps is a fun, family friendly movie. It captures the nostalgia
from back when I was a kid, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie
throughout.The essential storyline is, monsters are released from R.L. Stine's
manuscripts and cause mayhem through the town. We follow as the main
leads attempt to put an end to the madness.The actors do a decent job throughout, and Jack Black really excels as
R.L. Stine. Aside from him, the main cast is made up of relative
unknowns, however they do an adequate job.The special effects are very well done, and the monsters look real.Overall, I don't feel this movie is going to win any awards, but if you
just want to have a good time at the movies, then go check it out.
