What a great memories you brought back to me by this

I usually don't write reviews here, but this movie brought me back a
feeling that I didn't think I would have it again. It was a great
experience that made me decide to write a review about this movie.Like any other child I used to watch animation. It comes to this part
of your life when either you ignore animation and watch it only because
you're with a child, or you keep watching it and ignore what some other
people say that it's "cartoons". I used to laugh, smile, dream and even
cry watching animation. I got busy in the last couple of years with
school and work that I didn't watch animation for a couple of years.
The couple of times I watched animation after that, it was not
comparable of course to the moments I had when I was a child. You would
think these feelings and moments are gone forever.I came across "The Croods" trailer online and just by watching the
trailer I had the thought that this might be a good movie. I went with
a friend to watch it and that was a big surprise, beyond my
imagination.I laughed almost half of the movie. I had these great moments that I
thought I'll not get it ever again. I just melted inside that movie. I
should not call it a movie anymore, its a great experience. The effort
of designing each character is right there clear in every frame. The
dialogue is awesome, so natural and funny. The main concept is great
and made me think about a lot of ideas I had and still having in my
mind on a daily basis. I just had a wonderful experience that I thought
for some reason I will never get again. This is my first time to write
a review at least about an animation, but this movie brought back a lot
of moments I had and that is what moved to write this. To all the team
and people behind this masterpiece, thank you.
