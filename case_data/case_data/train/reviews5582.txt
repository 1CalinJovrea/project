Hugely enjoyable.

Maybe I'm easily pleased ( compared to some reviews ) but, I found this
film hugely entertaining! Corollaries with this and 'Bruce Almighty'
are, in my opinion, misplaced. It's much funnier.I confess, I am a major Simon Pegg fan and he doesn't disappoint! The
anthropomorphism of the dog, 'Dennis' is a superb 'observation' by the
writer. Biscuits, sex and someone at the door, are priceless.It's fast moving and never dull! The aliens, voiced by some of the
Monty Python team, are really good, especially the choice of names when
they start speaking in English.I was slightly disappointed that 'Neil' never recognised that
'Catherine' liked him for who he was, there were plenty of clues!I laughed a lot and will definitely see it again.
