A Big Winner!

'The Big Sick' is pure cinematic bliss. This Heartwarming True-Story is
told in a Unadultrated, Simple & Emotionally Empowering way, that
leaves you wanting for more. 'The Big Sick' is based on the real courtship of Kumail Nanjiani and
his now-wife, Emily Gordon. Kumail's traditional Pakistani Muslim
family is unhappy with his relationship with Emily, a White American.
When Emily is waylaid by a mysterious illness, Kumail must take charge
of the crisis with her parents, Beth and Terry, whom he barely knows.'The Big Sick' is an overwhelming experience, that left me with a big
smile on my face. Its beautiful love-story, with the backdrop of two
diverse families, from two extreme ends of the world. Kumail Nanjiani
and Emily V. Gordon re-tell their heartwarming, albeit intense journey,
with pure skill. The two successfully capture their real life
experiences & nurture into a terrific cinematic experience. The Writing
is top-notch & offers a realistic take on different religions, without
ever taking sides. Such Writing deserves an Oscar Nomination. Michael
Showalter's Direction is simplistic, yet wonderful. Cinematography &
Editing are effectively done. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Performance-Wise: Kumail Nanjiani is wonderfully restrained, delivering
a performance driven by pure feeling. Zoe Kazan as Emily, is
extraordinary. Although she gets limited screen time in comparison to
the others, the actress leaves a solid mark. Ray Romano & Holly Hunter,
as Emily's parents, are flawless. What Performers! Anupam Kher as
Kumail's Father & Adeel Akhtar's as Kumail's brother, are excellent. Bo
Burnham & Kurt Braunohler shine as Kumail's fellow stand-up mates.
Others lend support.On the whole, 'The Big Sick' is an Unmissable Gem. Two Big Thumbs Up!
