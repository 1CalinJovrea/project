Munchkin Magik

I wanted to see this film at TIFF this year, but it was all sold out. I
am glad it opened recently in Toronto. I was quite moved by the acting
and the situations that are depicted. The children are amazing, they
live in their own little world that has its own order and meaning.
While the adults cope with all their problems and societal conflicts,
the kids explore the world that they find themselves in, and try to
make the best of it. Bobby as the motel manager, is a tough bloke, but
totally fair in his dealings with his clients. Just his facial
expressions are enough to give you a massive subtext to the various
encounters that arise.We have a magical world in Florida's Disney Land, where peoples
fantasies come true. But just kiddy-corner to this, real life with real
people is taking place, not all of it pretty. Children need someone to
take care of them, but most of all to see them and love them. This can
happen in all sorts of environments, not all of them clinically correct
by societal standards. The film is a wonderful mirror.
