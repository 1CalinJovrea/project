Movie was funny

I don't know what movie the others that have written a review watched. My husband and I thought this movie was FUNNY! If you are truly a busy
mom that over extends herself, you so would appreciate this movie! I
could relate to just about everything in Amy's life as a busy mom.
Husband just siting on the couch doing nothing, the feeling of being
judged for not participating in PTA or volunteering for school
fundraisers and rushing my kids out of the car because I'm running late
to a meeting. Eating in the car is something I have to do all the time,
because we're always in a rush.I gave this movie 7 stars because it did get a little too raunchy and
over the top. It started off funny, but kind of got ridiculous, from
being a great mom to a horrible party mom. I can understand the
occasional breakdown, but where were the kids the whole time? AND the
uncircumcised P, that was just weird too. I think that should have been
a scene that was cut and added to the end while credits were rolling!This was a comedy and comedies are usually over exaggerated and some do
turn weird. But if you relate to the material that's really what makes
a comedy so funny! I would watch it again!
