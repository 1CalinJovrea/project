Exceptional Lead Performance

A completely focused Performance highlights this somewhat familiar Tale
of a Woman who has been severely traumatized by...that is the question.
Is it all in her head, is she delusional, did something really happen
to her or is she completely "Gone"?This is played out throughout this competent Thriller as She believes
that the source of her pain and suffering is back and has abducted her
Sister. This unleashes Her barely pent up Rage and propels Her on an
unstoppable quest to evoke Revenge and rescue Her Sis.This is a bit above a routine exercise in Serial Killer Clich√©s as it
focuses on a truly riveting and believable Amanda Seyfried as the
troubled Heroine. Truth is that she is damaged and not really in
complete control of her affliction and this lends a certain edginess to
the Film as you never really know what She is going to do next, or what
Lie She will fabricate, it seems at will, in a moments notice.Worth a look for Fans of this type of thing and those who like strong
Females willing to go the distance even if it means facing your most
frightening fears.
