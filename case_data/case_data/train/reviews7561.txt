As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect

As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect. Kind of like a hybrid
of Enter the Void, Nymphomaniac, The Lobster and Weekend. You can feel
the love that has gone into this film.The sex is both beautiful and ugly. It's not porn, more like an
aestheticized version of somebody's personal sex tape, but one designed
to provoke contemplation more than any other response. To feel any more
real it would need to be in the style of a documentary, which would
have the effect of distancing you from the characters. I didn't feel
like I was experiencing the story directly (as I do with good suspense
movies), but I did want things to work out well for the characters. If
you judge a movie by how much the pacing and suspense immerses you, you
won't enjoy Love. If you can be immersed into a movie's atmosphere and
want something to feed your imagination, then you will get a lot from
it.A lot of reviews and comments on IMDb seem to say it is not a thought
provoking movie, or that it is pretentious, yet the poster was moved to
write about their thoughts on it, so it certainly isn't empty. I found
talking about it can result in the conversation going to some very
interesting places.It has earned a place in the history of cinema, and is hopefully a step
away from the feelings of shame people feel about sex, a step towards
greater freedom in art, culture and cinema.
