Mind swapping thrills n' chills FUN!

This IMDb synopsis is accurate and a good starting point: Billionaire
Damian Hale has terminal cancer. He turns to a radical medical
procedure called "shedding," in which his consciousness is transferred
to a healthy body. After the procedure, Damian, now called Edward,
starts a new life in New Orleans but is plagued by disturbing images.
When he delves into Edward's mysterious origin, he learns that some
will kill to keep it secret.My buddy and I, both long time film buffs of multi-genres yearn for
decent sci-fi thrillers that are well written and directed, leave us
guessing here and there via plot twists and turns, includes necessary
action, murder and mayhem and a credible Mr. Evil. This film delivers
116 minutes of story, acting, production value and pure cinema sci-fi
thrilling FUN.We were both thumbs-up entertained by one of Ryan Reynolds best efforts
plus a fine supporting cast including Mr. Evil (Albright). Our usual
post film discussion of plot holes was minimal given the original, well
crafted screenplay. That is not to say we did not suspend belief as is
the case with many of our best action/Sci-Fi films. A major section of
the film, with some of its best action sequences, reminded me of my
favorite scenes in Bourne Legacy. With all the above said there was yet room for disturbed, romantic
relationships and one cute kid spitting out all her needed lines. Production value gives us some fun shots of New Orleans, area mansions
and a finale 'home' in a spectacular locale.There have been so many mind invasion/transfer films that our
expectations for something original with thrills, excitement and pathos
were low. We left the theater smiling for the simple reason that we
were both thoroughly entertained.
