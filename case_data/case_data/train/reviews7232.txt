A Hill of Beans

Les Crap ! When movies make fun of "Hollywood Movies" within the
movie-THIS is that movie. Handsome star driven drivel that is over
stylized in look and dialogue. While the impeccably dressed Brad Pitt
takes on those lousy (and also quite well dressed) Nazis briefly in
Casablanca to remind the audience who the bad guys were in WW Two, most
of the film centers around the trite and jejune dilemma of "true love"
between the handsome soldier and his mademoiselle. "Allies' turns
"Casablanca" on its tete, by truly making two people's Hill of Beans
much more profound than the side show of the world going crazy when
true Evil almost destroyed civilization. The movie reminds me a little
of the English Patient" without Any of the "good stuff" and all of the
"love conquers all" self involvement. Plus Ralph Fiennes can act
circles around Brad. That the acting is uninteresting is not
surprising, but generally Robert Zemackis's directing is far better
than this trivial effort. Usually in his box of Chocolat you know what
you're going to get- not this le petit mort. Judah Shapiro
