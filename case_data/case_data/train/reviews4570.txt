Exceeded my expectations

This movie really exceeded my expectation.For me it is already the
second best comic book movie,right after Logan.When I ve watched the both of the trailers,I ve thought Thor 3 has the
best trailer in this genre so far.Trailers really met with my
expectations.You are gonna see epic showdowns just like the way you imagined.Glad they didn't go on serious,boring mode like they did in Thor
2.Cause that movie bored me to death just like man of steel did.Lastly,I just wanna say that Taika Watiti is pretty damn good director
who can make both good stories/plots and brilliant
jokes/references(just like deadpool's humor).Thanks again for all the joy you gave me Marvel.
