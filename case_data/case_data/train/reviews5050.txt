Very disappointing movie

This is the first review of a movie I've ever written and I wouldn't
usually do this, but felt the need to advise people to steer clear of
this movie. It was truly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in
my life. I had high hopes for the movie before seeing it, especially
since I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves in many of his other movies. However I
found the movie to be utterly bizarre and ridiculous and struggled to
sit through the whole movie and resist the urge to leave. The acting
was really over the top at times and so painful to watch. The plot did
have potential and could have been so much better but unfortunately it
did not work at all in this movie. Many of the scenes are extremely
creepy and perverted, and not what I would expect to see in any movie.
I found parts of this movie very difficult to understand and follow, so
that I eventually lost interest completely. The ending was one of the
biggest disappointments and left me with feelings of relief that it was
finally over and feeling like I'd just wasted the last 90 minutes of my
life. Avoid this movie at all costs!!
