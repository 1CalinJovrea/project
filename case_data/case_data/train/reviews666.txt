Very Very Weak

I have to think that the reason for the almost all star cast is because
they are doing favors for the director/producer. This movie had so much
potential, but the acting (by everyone) was forced and so much more
could have been done with the plot. The potential here was wasted. Just
like her other movie (the Paris one) this movie just dragged on and on
- to get to the very weak action at the ending.Don't go.
