Little plots make Little movies...

This is a supposedly "inspirational" kind-of movie based on the life of
Joy Mangano a business woman and inventor of home products.As I'm reading this is far from the actual life of Mangano (who, unlike
the Joy in the movie, she went to University and has a degree in
business administration). It is more like a blend of the stories of
other housewives turned to businesswomen (if you can believe that) and
contains lots of fictional elements for dramatic purposes.Nevertheless the plot is weak. So is the script. There isn't any actual
moral here (like "Try and you will succeed"), and the narration of her
grandmother dilutes any of that "moral" with too much "it is your
destiny" crap.Soooo, the movie is an empty shell (or should I say Sell, pun intended)
but is it fun to watch? No. Not really.The characters (including Robert De Niro's who plays her father,
Elisabeth RÃ¶hm's who plays her half-sister, Virginia Madsen's who plays
her mother and Isabella Rossellini's who plays her father's girlfriend
and serves as the initial investor) are heavily unsympathetic.The direction is blunt, the pace uneven (I wont spoil you but the
resolution of all problems comes in just a few seconds near the end),
the situations unbelievable (like going to the...bathroom and unveil a
conspiracy by pure luck) etc.Overall: A blunt movie with weak script and plot. The unsympathetic
characters also make this unbearable. Not fun to watch and no true
moral in this fictitious sequence of events.
