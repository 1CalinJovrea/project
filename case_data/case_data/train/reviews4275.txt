How Fast-Food Was Invented

"The Founder" (2016) Many of us know the story of how Ray Kroc acquired
McDonalds, but this film really delves into how the McDonalds brothers
re- engineered the restaurant industry and invented "fast food". These
guys were geniuses. Their vision and persistence was extraordinary.
Unfortunately, Richard and Maurice simply didn't have the business
savvy to turn a revolutionary food service location into a national
enterprise. Enter Ray Kroc, who was highly motivated and had the guts
to go "all in", mortgaging his home to develop McDonalds into the
state-of-the art international franchise it became.Highly entertaining, "The Founder" is a well written, small budget
release, rated PG-13 for language. Appropriate for teens, "The Founder"
is a good family night-at-the-movies venue. Nothing too offensive; your
average 10-year-old has probably already incorporated into his
peer-jargon!The cast is great. Michael Keaton as Kroc shines; I've always
considered him as one of my favorites. Under-rated and so versatile,
Keaton makes you believe in Kroc's vision and aspirations. Laura Dern
plays Kroc's lonely and gloomy wife, Ethel. Nick Offerman and John
Carroll Lynch really steal the show with their portrayal as the
McDonald's brothers. Two very fine character actors at the top of their
game! Patrick Wilson has a minor role as Rollie Smith, a restaurateur,
who funds a franchise for his wife. She turns out to be totally
committed to the fast food game and ends up being Ray Kroc's love
interest. Linda Cardellini is beautiful and alluring as Joan Smith.
Watch for Kate Kneeland as Kroc's efficient and vibrant secretary, June
Martino.Currently available on DVD and Blue ray, "The Founder" is well worth
seeking out. Set in the 1950's, it was very cool to see what mid-
America was all about. Cute car hops on roller skates, Hudson
automobiles, men in hats, ties and suits, women in sun dresses and boys
with crew-cuts.
