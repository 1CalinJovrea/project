A hack job! And more fog please.

I'm no Shakespeare expert. I really love Roman Polanski's Macbeth which
was a cinematic master piece, IMO. This latest attempt has failed so
miserably. It felt like a hack job done by a bunch of amateurs. The
screenplay was unbelievably AWFUL! The characters were flat as a runway
and without distinction from one another. Most of the cast looked
totally out of place. The wide shots were great but the close-ups were
really dim and gloomy looking, in a pretentious way, which worked
negatively towards building tension, demonstrate emotion and
electrifying the audience.There were no tension, no emotion and no one
was electrified. I feel bad for these ppl that had to work so hard off
a POS screenplay. You could tell that the director was way over his
head. What's up with Fassbender mumbled his way through out and his
eyeliners? Lol. It really felt like a TV-movie with all the pretentious
special effect. The witches looked like some feminists with facial
scars. There was no story-telling! Just bad monologues done by
overrated actors. Honestly, it felt like an episode from those Vikings
shows. When will these over-confident hacks realize they don't have it
and stop wasting everyone's time. Smh.
