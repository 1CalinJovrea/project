Oh my gosh, is this dull

For a video review of 'Frankenweenie'(C)2012, try the link below!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj6iWsFu3AUAh yes, the Clay-Mation remake of a much better, charming, early work
of Tim Burton... That should have stayed that way. For those of you who
love and enjoy the original 1984 film, this is not that film. This is a
cash-in, plain and simple. If Burton was really trying with this one,
either he's really gone mad or it's a lie since Disney fingerprints are
all over it. OK, so the premise: Boy loves dog, boy loses dog, boy
revives dog... and then an hour of drag, drag, drag. How could you make
a story so freaking boring! Victor is boring, his parents are boring,
the classmates are boring, and what the @#%$ is with the cat-poop
omen!? Why am I watching this!?! Oh, and not to mention every single
reference to Ed Wood, and monster movies, and horror literature. It
brow-beats you over the head again and again, like it's trying to
remind you that Tim Burton likes Ed Wood, monster movies, and horror
literature: NO KIDDING!? Also, the animation in the classic Burton
style is... unnecessary. A ploy to bring in the 'Nightmare Before
Christmas' in hopes that a glimpse of something nostalgic comes back to
life. Honestly, 'Paranorman' looks like art compared to this movie. In
fact, go watch that movie. It doesn't treat you like an idiot and
actually has a target audience.
