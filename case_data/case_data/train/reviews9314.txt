To say this is predictable would be an understatement, but same thing
goes for many action movies as far as predictability goes. Actually the
fact that two people belong together is so painfully obvious you do

lot of things go wrong ... who'd have thought? Putting a scene from
"now" at the beginning just to backtrack was a neat idea though.Still some things happen, that might not be as expected. But such is
life and the overall impression still says the same. The main
actors/characters do their best to keep the tension high and the story

doing. An overall good romantic comedy, fun to watch as a couple
