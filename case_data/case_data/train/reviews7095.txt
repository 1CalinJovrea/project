Family fun

Keep in mind, this is a movie intended for kids!!! If you find singing
in movies annoying, this isn't for you, but kids love it for the most
part. I know mine did and I even liked it. Perfect for family night, if
you are old school like I am. It is a refreshing tale of semi unique
features that teaches courage, kindness and that its okay to be you.
Very family friendly, cute and sparkly!
