Yay!!!

Unlike all other slasher franchises from the 70s and 80s that have
rebooted "for a new generation," this one keeps moving forward and
manages to stay utterly creative. The Chucky movies are one big,
continuing story since 1988. Don Mancini has had a hand in every one of
them. He wrote parts 1-4 and then, for parts 5-7, he took over as
director as well. His latest, Cult of Chucky, adds something completely
new and unexpected to the saga but does not forget the past. Heck,
there's even a reference to Kent Military Academy (the location for
part 3). I really enjoyed this movie! Brad Dourif returns again as the
voice of Chucky and has some fun dialog to spout. His daughter reprises
the role of "Nica" and continues to impress. The memorable music is by
Joseph Loduca who got his start with The Evil Dead in 1981. Cult of
Chucky is fresh but faithful to the franchise.
