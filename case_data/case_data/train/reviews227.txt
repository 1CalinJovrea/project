Pretty Average Stuff

I don't see what the hype is all about. The story is average and done
many many times before. Nothing really likable or inspiring about the
characters or the story. The acting is nothing notable. Just very
standard stuff. Let me cap it in one sentence. Down and out mother
thinks up an invention, brings it to market, and becomes rich after
some travails that, in reality, is all fought and done with lawyers in
the end. That's it. If you watched "The Pursuit of Happiness" the Will
Smith movie, you've pretty much seen this one.And just an off note, these type of movies are ridiculous. For every
success story like this one, there are thousands of others who've tried
and failed. People who risked the financial well beings of their
children and family on an improbable venture because they think
themselves special, even though they never done the hard work of
getting an education or training. But they still think themselves
special. You never hear about them, the losers, the irresponsible ones
who ruined the lives of their families. You only hear about the one in
a million, like lottery winners. For a society, this isn't healthy when
even the dumbest dingbat thinks himself above everyone else, and
they're going to be millionaires. I guess that's why people vote
Republicans.
