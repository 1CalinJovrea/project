Passengers was fantastic!

Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the
movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they
absolutely love. Going to see a movie at the theater is like $30 now
for just 2 people & that's without visiting concessions. I don't know
about everybody else but if I'm going to spend a few days worth of
grocery money for a 2 hour movie experience I'm really hoping not to be
bored to tears or looking at the time wondering how much longer it'll
be until a movie is over. Passengers just ends up on my very long list,
lately, of movies critics tried to bring down that were waves better
than the ones they are directing people to see. This movie is visually
stunning & the story telling is not only thought provoking but
innovative while doing so! It was great to see a story like this one
told in a way that didn't spend most of its time trying to dialogue
it's way into Oscar nominations. If you are going to venture out to see
a movie for the Holidays go see this one!
