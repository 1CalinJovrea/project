Simple, Painful, Outstandingly Beautiful

Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I
have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be
dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film.
Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about
something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter
and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes,
we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness
individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven
together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an
unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose
finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often
don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet
outstandingly beautiful. It's also important to remember that just because you don't understand
something, that doesn't mean it is unimportant or invalid. Just because
you can't relate to the entire story doesn't mean pieces of it can't
teach you something about life. Just because the narrative is one that
isn't widely told, doesn't mean it should be disregarded. If you don't
understand this film or find it a waste, look deep inside yourself and
ask why. 10/10 would recommend.
