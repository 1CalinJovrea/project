Flying scenes are BS

I am a commercial pilot by profession. This crash scene is based very
loosely on an Alaska Airways plane that crashed in 2000. Don't get your
hopes up: your relatives could not have survived this catastrophic
equipment failure if they'd had Whip, fueled by 3 lines of cocaine, at
the helm. The elevator jammed "full nose down" causing a descent rate
of over 13,000 fpm, not 4000 fpm as stated in the movie, (which is a
normal rate of descent for a jet). Other pilots flying by relayed to
air traffic control that they saw this plane inverted, and in a steep
nose down dive.Let's say for the sake of the argument that the pilots had managed to
slow the plane down with spoilers, gear, and flaps, like Whip did, and
then flipped it on its back:Realistically, the plane would have slowed from 13,000 fpm to 12,000
fpm and when flipped on its back the stress would have ripped off the
tail.Assuming somehow that the pilots flipping the plane upside down had
managed to level it off, the instant they turned it rightside up, the
plane would have nosed down and crashed. This lovely controlled glide
onto a field would never have happened. Oh, and also, when a plane goes
on its back THE ENGINES DO NOT CATCH ON FIRE. The engines actually
flame out due to fuel starvation due to the fuel inlets being at the
bottom of the fuel tanks.After the crash scene, there are two hours of Whip being drunk while
Nicole appears to have no problem remaining sober. There are also
random people popping up praising Jesus.
