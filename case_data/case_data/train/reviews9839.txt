Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours

This movie made me want to leave after one hour, and kill myself after
2 hours. I am a huge Bourne fan I was very exited for Matt Damons
return to the Bourne franchise. Also there was fresh face of Alicia
Vikander and not so fresh face of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel as
the bad guy so what can go wrong? Well it turns out if you have a
horrible script, plot that only a person who wears helmet indoors can
consider exiting you are left with the biggest disappointment in the
cinema this year.Spoiler alert everybody! Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours, sometimes he
remembers things sometimes he doesn't - the end.So to conclude : Do not see this movie! I had to watch the trilogy the
next morning just to get over the disappointment of the new Jason
Bourne.
