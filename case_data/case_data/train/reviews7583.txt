Highly Entertaining - Climax after climax, not a single minute is wasted.

If I have not watched the trailer, I will give it a score of 10 for its
entertainment value but having seen the trailer, a little is lost. I
don't remember having watched any movie that is so damn engaging, so
easy to follow, and so exciting right from the first few minutes all
the way to the end. All the exciting moments end with a climax that's
fit for a movie. The few minutes during each break for audience to
catch their breath is not boring or wasted, perfectly used for
characters development. I don't understand why someone commented the
last 30 minutes is not as good. I find each climax better in the next.
If they make a sequel to show some happenings elsewhere with the same
plot and concept, I will still watch it.
