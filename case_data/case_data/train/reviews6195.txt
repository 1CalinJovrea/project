Are the rest of these people on crack?

This movie was such a piece of crap. Seth McFarlane should stick to
what he knows best - cartoons, and leave the real movies to the big
people. It was the same rehash of his series Family Guy with a horrible
plot about this teddy bear growing up with his owner from childhood and
gets... kidnapped? Kidnapped really?? And do we need yet another fat
joke, or handicapped joke? If you answered yes, then you deserve to
watch this film and lower your I.Q. another 20 points. Honestly, the
only real treat was watching Mila Kunis, (and that's some damn fine
acting by the way) they must have paid her a fortune to act in this
crap. That goes for Mark Wahlberg too If you were expecting some
magical, detailed plot where the jokes are actually funny and not
recycled from a familiar series, then sorry to say look elsewhere.
