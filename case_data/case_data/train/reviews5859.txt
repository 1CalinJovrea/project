Refreshing Spider-Man

Considering this is the sixth Spider-Man film since the start of the
noughties. It is really positive the fact Marvel was able to
successfully bring in so many fresh ideas. It is also worth noting how
many good jokes they were able to get into the film that had not been
covered in the previous five. Obviously, one thing that was an
advantage to this film is it went into an already established cinematic
universe when the others didn't have that advantage. Tom Holland
portrayal was witty and linked all the other characters really well. It
was also nice to see Gwenyth Paltrow make a cameo as Pepper Potts. Nice
to see the appearances of two new villains on the big screen but at
this point, I would be curious to see the green goblin return. So
overall I would definitely recommend this movie.
