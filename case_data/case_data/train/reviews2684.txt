Entertaining and amusing

26 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - The
Secret Life of Pets. Max is the spoiled only dog belonging to Katie.
His whole world revolves round her and when she brings Duke home from
the pound, Max is more than a little miffed. Duke and Max fall out but
are forced to help each other when they get lost and into many scrapes
during the course of their day. This film, although not side
splittingly funny was very amusing and the film makers are so very
clever in creating a personality for each and every one of the animals
in this film. I think we secretly all hope our pets have fun lives when
we leave them home alone, and this film very cleverly moulds each pet
to its owner and each house to fit it's pet. Applause must be given to
the animators, the details which have been created in the cityscape is
incredible, take time to look behind the animals for the skylines, the
water, ever the sewers have so much crammed in to them I think you
would need to see the film several time to take it all in, it's a long
way from ink and paint!!!!
