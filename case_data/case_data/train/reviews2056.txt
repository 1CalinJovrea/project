Completely disappointing

This movie started out with a seemingly good concept: two beautiful
young girls seduce a successful, happily married man and then begin a
psychotic, cat-and-mouse game with him. But there are so many points in
the movie where we are rooting for Evan, hoping he'll be able to escape
and exact revenge on these girls, who it seems have done this multiple
times before to other men in their sick thrill.....but the movie ends
in a very empty, heart-breaking way, making it a total waste of an hour
and a half. It reminds me a lot of Funny Games, which also left viewers
discouraged and dissatisfied with a horrible ending. WHY Keanu Reeves
would put a black mark on his film career with this piece of garbage is
beyond me.
