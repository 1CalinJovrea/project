Same old same old boring yawn.

Boring, predictable and not much to see. Penn, comes across as an old
guy who would be very unlikely to pull off 1/2 of the movies plot. Very
disappointed. If you nothing else to do and feel like throwing your
money away, you might consider seeing it. Just another rehashed shoot
um up bang bang special effects looser. How many times are they going
to take the same plot, add different names and characters and call it a
new movie? The same plot has been done to death. No creativity here
folks, move on to something else. The cast ties their best, but there
isn't much to work with here. I would have preferred to stay home and
get some rest.
