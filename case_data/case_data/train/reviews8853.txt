The Best movie I've seen all year.

I will keep the review simple. Although some of the financial jargon
went over my head, i would say Adam McKay is a genius, to make a movie
about the financial crisis this much entertaining, funny and touching
that's a feat only few filmmakers can pull off, and a lot of that has
to do with the tremendous cast of this movie. The Big Short has a large
ensemble cast but focuses on four major players who benefited in
various ways from betting against the American economy. Steve Carell
gives one of the best performance of his career, Christian bale
portrays the awkward lonely genius with ease. Ryan gosling is slick
over the top and funny in this movie he also makes the whole thing much
more interesting. Brad Pitt is kind of a good guy and the moral center.
This is a must see, and needs multiple viewings to truly appreciate.
