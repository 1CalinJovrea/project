What to Expect: Lay the Favorite

Why You Might Like It: There are plenty of notable faces (Bruce Willis,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Vince Vaughn, Joshua Jackson) in the movie that
might attract some viewers to give it a shot. The truth is Rebecca Hall
does a real nice job in the lead role playing a naive and ditzy
stripper turned bookie, while the supporting cast are just okay for the
most part. It is based on a true story, so the plot is decent enough to
keep most viewers entertained. An okay watch for a slow afternoon or
evening.Why You Might Not Like It: Again, the acting for the most part is
average and not anything special although the cast would suggest
otherwise. The movie is noticeably low budget in a number of spots,
which might be a bit of turn off for some. Unfortunately, this movie is
likely confusing for those who don't gamble and a joke for those who
are more familiar with gambling. With some better research into the
gambling side of things and a bigger budget, this could have been a
little bit better film.Acting/Casting: 6* Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 5*Plot/Characters: 5* Entertainment Value: 6* Total - 6+5+5+6 = 22/4 = 5.5*
