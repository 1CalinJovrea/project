Seems the audience is Expendable

When the first Expendables was announced, it was supposed to be a
throwback to the early years of action cinema - gratuitous violence,
one liners and major carnage. The first two films lived up to this. The
third is just awful.Instead of spending more time with the aging heroes we've come to love,
we get stuck with a bunch of whiny youngsters who don't do anything and
aren't very interesting. I seriously doubt the so called "broader"
audience this film is aimed at are gonna care about it. And the people
who were interested in the series are going to be bitterly
disappointed. Nice one, Sly!!!Some of the new additions to the cast aren't that bad: Banderas,
Snipes, Ford, Grammar, but Gibson completely owns the film - which dies
whenever he is not around.How's the action? Instead of being focused and over-the-top like the
other two films, we get bland MTV style kills, thanks mainly to the new
PG-13 rating. Who thought giving the film this lame rating was a good
idea? Hey, lets take a series that is aimed at adults, starring aging
action heroes who only the older audience will remember, and turn it
into a dumb teen movie where the target audience WILL NOT CARE who they
are or what they have done. Surely one of the worst business decisions
in recent memory.Newcomer director Patrick Hughes has not done anything with this film,
but its really hard to tell if that was intentional or if the PG-13
hack job done to the film has made it bland.Overall, this film is just a waste. Too soft for its hardcore fans, and
not "hip" enough for its intended young audience. No one will be happy.
Sure, it might puts bums on seats for the first week, but it will
quickly disappear after that...and with good cause."What mean Expendable?" "It's like when you're invited to a party and
don't show up and nobody really cares".I suspect theater owners are gonna know the meaning of this come August
15.
