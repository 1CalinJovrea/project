Great expectations led to an unexpected disappointment

When I went to see this movie I kept thinking about how great was the
cartoon movie with all its extravagant and funny characters: Balu, the
elephants, even evil characters like Kaa (the snake) were fun to watch.
How could I even forget a minor character like the vultures, and their
jokes on Shere Khan? Their humor was great in contrast with the tiger's
ego. I thought I would revive all those memories watching this movie. I
was wrong.This movie is lacking of various things. First, a good plot. Second,
good characters with relevant appearances. Third, humour (nonexistent
if we ignore Balu) and a good atmosphere for songs (is this supposed to
be a musical?). And fifth but not least, WHAT IS KING KONG DOING IN
KING LOUI'S TEMPLE?? What they have done to that poor monkey is
unbearable.MY SUMMARY(SPOILERS):King Loui doesn't dance. Shere Kahn doesn't bother to chase Mogli
through the jungle. Why would him anyway? He already knows the plot.
Kaa's appearance in the movie is what in Spanish we call "postureo". He
appears once. He narrates Mowgli's origins to the spectator (how plot
convenient...). He tries to eat the kid with no success and fades away
to live happily ever after. The rest can be summarized in: f*ck logic.
I have been walking for two days to get to the human village, and now I
can just run away for 10 minutes with a torch in hand to get just where
the movie started. Hi, my name is Mowgly and I like to burn down
jungles in my free time (appaluse). AH AND THE VULTURES DON'T EVEN
SPEAK IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, SAME AS THE ELEPHANTS which are considered
gods among the other animals (wtf) and magically appear in the last
scene to save the day.Please re watch the old movie instead of wasting your money in this
thing. Why Loui?... Why?...
