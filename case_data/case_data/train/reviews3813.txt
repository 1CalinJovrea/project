Unsure why these people had a movie made for them

***SPOILERS, ENTIRE STORY TOLD IN ONE PARAGRAGH*** Unsure why these
people had a movie made for them, seriously.These are just everyday people....and they got a movie made about them.
Also something tells me, that Beth at that time was a little more wild
then portrayed in the film.This movie is about Beth (Rebecca Hall), period. Then she meets Dink,
Bruce Willis. Dink introduces her to gambling, in Vegas. Dink has a
wife (Catherine Z-J.), who doesn't really seem to have a true bonding
with Dink. But who cares, its Vegas...so I sensed from the film. Things
don't work out with Beth and Dink (gambling not relationship). Beth
meets nerdy guy Jeremy. Then Beth goes back to Dink again (for gambling
not relationship). Things don't work out again. She moves to NYC with
Jeremy. She meets Rosie (Vince Vaughn). She starts the gambling again.
a lil twist in the story and Bammmm, movies over....thats simple. I
just told you the whole entire story. literally.These are just everyday people, like you and I, and they had a movie
made of themselves and somehow got Willis, Zeta-Jones and Vaughn to act
in this super slow movie. It is not an awful movie! thats not my point.
my point is, why was this movie even made? someone....did some major
ahheemm 'under the table' work to get this movie made...hence, my hint
at the beginning of this review that says, "also something tells me
that beth was little more wild...." and so, if you got time to waste
and want a little feel of Vegas, watch this. if you miss this movie, no
big deal. There is no message in this movie. There is no core point.
There is no reason to even make this movie.....why not a movie of
Optimus Prime's life?, how about Bruce Lee?...how about me!? that dude
writing this...you! the dude or dudette reading this!.....why Beth!??
nothing happens in this movie! again, not bad just why!
