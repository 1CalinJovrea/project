More fun than the last five Star Wars films

What if the Star Wars prequels had been handed over to a better
director? What if The Force Awakens and Rogue One had aimed at being
original and fun science fantasy films rather than just playing on
people's nostalgia?This is what I found myself seeing as I was watching Valerian. A film
that made Space Opera's fun and exciting again.I was surprised by the two leads. The trailers made it feel like we'd
be seeing a rehash of the two main leads from Ender's Game but I was
surprised at how fun and spunky (and flawed) the two characters were to
watch. The romance was not there and it did not need to be there
because this film is not a romance nor centered around a romance. This film is Luc Besson taking what people loved about the Fifth
Element and stretching it to the entire movie. And yes, it is true, it is visually the prettiest movie since Avatar.
The kids I took with me to see this film had their eyes on the screen
the whole time, no bathroom break, no water break, just a visually
mesmerizing film that never tired its audience.My recommendation is to go see it on the bring screen to experience the
marvel of it. It's a shame it is not available in IMAX.
