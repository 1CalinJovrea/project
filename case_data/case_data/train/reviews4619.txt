I think it's seven

Not too bad & not too good ,that's what can I say for this movie. This
movie has a nice story line,and I think I just like the visual effect.
I don't like Sad Ending, actually it's not Sad Ending it just not Happy
Ending. I think people like this movie because this is a sequel, so the
people like this movie because they like the previously movie. And
maybe the people or "The Watchers" like this movie because they curious
about the new character. And what I want to know is, where is The
Electro? well he just defeated from the battle with Spider Man and
after that he's gone. So... yeah this film is Not too Bad and Not too
Good.
