Disappointed and irritated

I recommend any and all who have respect for a writers work and/or have
ever read the maze runner series, don't watch the second movie. It was
a good movie but it should not have been released under the title
scorch trials as it had no relevance what's so ever to the second book
or the trials themselves, which is literally the title. I am very
disappointed/Very much irritated. The only resemblance to the book was
the character names. This also felt like a very sore excuse for a
zombie movie instead of having the proper and well thought out story
line that manipulated the characters like originally intended. Overall,
I say again the movie would be fine on its own with no relation
whatsoever with the series but because it is in fact based off of a
book series I am very disappointed to see they threw the whole series
aside and made up their own story. Very disappointed, I cannot say that
enough times.
