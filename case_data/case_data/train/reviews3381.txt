Please: DO NOT support the decline of a once great film studio

Mix Brother Bear with almost any princess film and this is what you
get. The characters (surprisingly for Pixar) were poorly developed;
this is especially true for the mother, where I was expecting some kind
of back story, or at least a more believable development of the
mother-daughter relationship. But no, apparently you're best buddies
again and the mother will just change her mind on everything she
believed previously, through a single fish-catching montage. ...Really?
And don't get me started on 'the bad guy'. This 'evil bear' appears in
only two scenes - one in which they escape from him, and one in which
he returns and then gets squashed by a rock. In fact, the story would
have been almost identical had the 'bad guy' been cut out of the script
entirely.Perhaps you could blame the complete underdevelopment of the plot and
characters on the relatively short runtime (100 minutes, minus the
equally disappointing 'short' at the beginning). But that wouldn't make
sense, as Toy Story 3, a brilliant film, had the same running time.I suspect that they are cutting back their effort on all fronts
(writing, production time) bar animation, knowing full well that people
will pay for their films regardless, so 'why bother?'.Following the equally mediocre Cars 2 with this, it's clear that Pixar
really needs to step up their game.So please, do not support the decline of a once great film studio.
