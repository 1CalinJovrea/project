Magnificent

I lost count of the times I gasped or whispered 'wow' to myself.Story-driven and character-driven right to the bitter end, but it also
has many amazing action sequences.Remarkably, all of the characters are well-served. Old favourites get
moments to shine, and new kids on the block are put in the spotlight as
well. One in particular basically steals the film.Weighty and serious, thought-provoking and intelligent, but also joyful
and funny in almost every scene.Rapid-pace storytelling. Blink and you miss the next story development.Great, great performances from Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan,
Daniel Br√ºhl and Chris Evans.10/10
