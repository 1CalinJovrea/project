A touching comedy

The lower ratings on this film are too harsh. This is actually a sweet
comedy where two individuals who initially repel each other grow to
like each other. The added touches are the children in this film, who
are not only hilarious but also bring out the parental qualities in
Drew and Sandler's characters. The holiday setting in this movie is also fantastic and adds a bit more
quality to the film. The backing singers who appeared every now and
then made me chuckle. The various activities that you find on a 5 star
holiday are all here, which really makes you want to visit this resort.Overall it was really enjoyable to watch, I would highly recommend it
