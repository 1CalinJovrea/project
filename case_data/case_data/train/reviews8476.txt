Was I watching the same movie as everyone else???

I really cannot believe the reviews I am reading about this film, how
funny it is, an instant classics etc... Let me first begin by saying I
am a huge Sacha b Cohen fan, I love his stuff, Ali G, Borat & Bruno.
All hysterically funny, some what very unnerving to watch at times, but
that a massive part of the appeal... They were below the belt humor,
especially Bruno, that you really hadn't seen before and didn't know
how to react to it, which made it hysterical.The dictator was non of that. It had brief funny bits in, that were
really obvious as well, throughout the film. I was so disappointed as
the trailer looked funny and being an avid fan could not wait for the
release. But like i say, it wasn't, it was just obvious lets make quick
money Hollywood nonsense that so many films seem to be these days.I actually started to think, "is it me, am I getting too old for this
sort of stuff?". I'm 48 and went to see the film with my 20 year old
sons who also thought the film was rubbish!!What is it with so many films these days that they seem to of lost all
sense of character? I love a film, I love a good comedy, but I haven't
seen anything decent in a long time because there always seems to be
something missing or lacking from the the films these days. Has all the
writers run out of ideas, or has everything just been done to death
now?Get your act together Sacha, you know your better than this Hollywood
bulls**t, don't let those idiots ruin what and who you are!!That's the truth right there pal, despite all the hype I bet you agree
with my comments!!
