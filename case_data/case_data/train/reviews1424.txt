Funny, sweet, inventive and wonderfully acted

A wonderfully funny fable of the adventures of world's greatest hotel
concierge (a brilliant, inventive and hilarious performance by Ralph
Fiennes) and the friendship he strikes up with the hotel's new lobby
boy (a strong debut by newcomer Tony Revolori). The story goes in many unexpected directions, every one entertaining
and eccentric, and the cast is full of first rate highly comic
performances by F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff
Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward
Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson,
Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. While not Anderson's most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I
don't think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed
out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is
some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted
art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with
such panache. Even my friends who don't enjoy Anderson's work in
general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the
movie year so far.
