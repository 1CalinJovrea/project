Learning to hold your nerve

'Nerve' is one of those films that quietly went under the radar at the
cinema, but seem to catch on via word of mouth.Truth is it's a decent film, inspired by a YA book. It also acts as a
vehicle for up and coming talents such as Emma Roberts and Dave Franco,
who both give good performances.Roberts in particular shines in every scene, and it is her character of
Vee who goes through the biggest journey throughout.The plot doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but it is an action packed
film, that proves entertaining.If you can stomach the fact that it's really just people doing lots of
irresponsible things then you'll enjoy the film. Parents thinking of
letting their teens watch it should be wary though.
