There's a reason that you never heard about this one

I'm a big fan of the Loved Ones, but this is just hot garbage.Filled with one clich√© after another that sound like they're out of a
Lifetime TV-movie, this film just piles on one generic trope after
another disguised as "Metal" which comes off more as "christian rock".
This is the type of film someone's square parents would make and call
it "edgy".Each and every piece of symbolism blatantly smacks the viewer over the
head like it's desperately seeking attention. "Hey......did you see how
the main character looks like Jesus?"........yes.....everyone saw it,
understood the obvious symbolism, and yawned.Not sure what the director had in mind here, but I would bet that his
next project is going to be on a much tighter budget. Perhaps he would
be better served with a focus on remakes........much like some bands
are better playing covers.
