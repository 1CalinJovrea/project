Who said the traditional Bond formula is dead?!!

I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of Kingsman: The
Secret Service. Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to
watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007
movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called "Eggsy"
who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation
who call themselves the "Kingsmen" to go through the deadliest "job
interview" to be the next Kingsman spy.That said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced
and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in
Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula
especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way.
Kingsman; The Secret Service reminded me how great the old 007 formula
was until it was changed until Daniel Craig's portrayal of the agent.
After watching this movie Daniel Craig better take notes because there
is a new agent on the block and that is "Eggsy'.That being said Kingsman: The Secret Service is the best movie of 2015
so far. Don't miss it!!!
