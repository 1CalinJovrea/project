Yep, it still seems impossible to make a video game adaptation...

Someday, there will be a day where video game adaptations hit their
golden era like comic book adaptations did but, until that happens, we
need to be patient. Sadly, until we see that day arrive, we have to
deal with stuff like "Need For Speed." It's easy to write off "Need For Speed" as a "Fast and the Furious"
wannabe but it really just felt like a lazy game adaptation to me more
than anything. The story is extremely ridiculous and the performances
are cheesy. Aaron Paul comes off very unlikable for most of the movie
and unconvincing as the super-cool, dangerously skilled racer. The
racers all look like they really need to use the bathroom or are
thinking of a really funny joke in their heads when they are racing and
the film severely lacks in the "speed" promise of the title. Races are
usually slow-moving and boring as they rely on racer's reactions and a
complete slowdown and stop of action with drifting, cornering, and
cutting people off.One thing I liked about "Need For Speed," though, was the inclusion of
Michael Keaton. He was fun, charismatic, and giving his all to the role
even though the rest of the cast appears to be cheesing it up. Sadly,
he's only in the film for very short periods of time.Overall, "Need For Speed" is just forgettable and was only slightly
relevant due to Paul's epic portrayal of Jesse Pinkman in "Breaking
Bad." Still, it could have been a lot worseÂ…Uwe Boll could have
directed it.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants,
ramblings, bad jokes, geek references, and more movie reviews (like a
more in-depth look at "Need For Speed" and other racing films that
really fulfill the promise of speed) you can visit my blog at

not enjoying this one, you don't have to visit my blog. I won't hold it
