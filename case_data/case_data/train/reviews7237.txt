A great Fantasy flick

I didn't have any expectations for this film,and it completely blew me
away!Visuals were stunning,acting really surprised me,action was
incredible.I really can't wait for the sequel cause the ending set it
up really well.Magic was also pretty damn cool.Orgrim was a ferocious
bad ass.It was a damn fine film,best of the 2016 dare i say.Bring on
more,and it finally broke the video game movie curse!Go see it,you
won't regret it!10 out of 10 for me!I think that it will have a good
reception from audiences and critics.Warcraft fans will love
it.Direction was amazing,one of the best motion capture for a film i've
seen,i really hope it does well in the box office and review department
cause it was really amazing!
