Very Believable

Well acted and very realistic story. I could see this actually
happening in real life. A bit hard to understand the Irish accent, but
not everything is made for an American audiences. The actors did a
great job, for unknowns (at least in America). The lead actor John
Connor, who was also the writer, knew so much about it, you would think
he lived this life. GO SEE IT!
