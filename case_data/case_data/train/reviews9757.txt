Creepy as hell

I was dying to see "Sinister." It looked like one off those great
psychological horror films that isn't so much interested in blood and
guts as it is freaking you out, and that's just what it is. Well, it is
Halloween after all.The Fact that Ethan Hawke was drawn to the movie was a good sign to
begin with, as he is great in most things he is in, and there's no
exception here. He plays a struggling writer who moves into the creepy
new house off the film too write about the messed up events that
happened there. Yes it could off been in danger off being your typical
haunted house movie, but it really isn't. Hawke makes for an
interesting main character and even the creepy house and creepy killer
off the movie are expanded to be something way more."Sinister" is bloody terrifying. So if your looking for one of those
sorts off genuinely scary movies (which don't come along that often)
look no further. Its creepy, will make you jump a mile high, and is
genuinely disturbing (in a good way) with an ending that'll stick with
you for days afterwards.
