Very bad movie

I must say that this was one of the worst movies I've see in this
particular "type" of movie. Was this supposed to be like the NFS game?
Because it have nothing to do with the game at all. Were are the street
races, secret garages, and all those "special" parts that you can get
when you win? Also, this movie have no special cars! It's all stock
cars, and a lot of BS. The argument is simply so bad, that I still
don't understand how a modified Mustang can be fast matched by one
normal truck. And the Detroit scene? I just can't believe how Director
actually think that could be a awesome movie sequence. Not to mention
the final pursuit..... I can believe that some an think that looks
good. A Lamborghini faster than a Bugatti Veyron or even a Koenigsegg,
it's just...... Do you people in America believe in that? So, my honest opinion about this? It's not worthy! I want my money
back!
