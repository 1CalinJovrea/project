Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!

I have been a fan of the Hit-man games for a long time, and this movie
is absolutely awful.The actor who played Agent 47 is terrible. The story is awful. The
character of Agent 47 was the complete opposite of the character in the
games.In the games, Agent 47 is methodical, stealthy and calculated. In this
movie, the character throws all of that out the window and turns the
movie into a typical shoot 'em up. So much terribleness. The first
Hit-man movie is much better.This movie is so bad that all comments on the Facebook page are
positive, only because all negative comments get quickly deleted. Some
people have even had the audacity to say that this movie stays true to
the games. Other than the title and Agent 47's suit, nothing. Terrible!
Save your money.
