A Film With A Mountain of Plot Holes

Whilst most of us are fortunate enough to have not experienced a plane
crashMany of us have been camping and general living out doors. So we know,
in a relatively short time, without washing amenities etc, you get a
bit grubby. So by the time Elba & Winslet are getting all amourous after 3 weeks
living in the wreckage it is truly remarkable how clean and hygienic
they were Another wonder was the amazing mountain views and Elba's perfectly
choiffered beard. Truly remarkable beard, always perfect in every
scene, it must be guaranteed plane crash proof Another, in a long list of recent films, illustrating how stunning
views and cinematography are not a substitute for a good script. Would I watch it again? Naa ! 5/10
