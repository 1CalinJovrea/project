Super film

It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me
long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of
paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in
riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene
to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt
the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their
portrayals.Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as
the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real
shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the
audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. Just brilliant.
