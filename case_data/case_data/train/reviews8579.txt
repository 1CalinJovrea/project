Heart felt beautiful film

As I listen to the ending song of this film I am touched with tears of
sadness and joy at the same time.This was a most unexpected film that I really did not want to watch
initially because of the subject matter. Some stories are just too
difficult for me to watch that deal with real life, although this was a
fictional story as far as I know.The acting by the excellent cast was outstanding especially Ms. Vanessa
Redgrave and Rooney Mara.The end was most unexpected and quite surprising. If this subject
matter is too difficult to watch just keep watching; I promise it will
be worth every minute.
