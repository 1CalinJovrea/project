Wow...

Saw this the other night at the NYFF. Wow. It's an incredible film, a
true cinematic achievement, possibly a classic and maybe will be the
first 3D movie to break through and win the Best Picture Oscar. Some of
the images were so beautiful that the audience gasped at many of them.
I felt transported and like I was seeing a movie for the very first
time. I haven't felt that sort of magic in a movie theater in a long,
long time.I read the book and liked it and the film may even improve upon it
which is kind of a miracle considering it's kids, animals and water
just about all the time. The spiritual themes are simple and deep and
raise more questions about faith and belief than answer anything. No
preaching going on here and there could be. Without giving anything
away, it's a wonderful story about storytelling and how telling our
stories can get us through the most horrible life experiences and to
help deal with the aftermath of them.It's an incredible film experience. Go see it!
