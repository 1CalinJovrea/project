9
Another Animated Hit From The Makers Of Coraline!

Focus Features has only had two animated films up to this point; the
beautifully crafted, but story-lacking 9, and of course the gorgeous
and creepy Coraline. Now, this studio's third animated film gives us
both a funny and creepy story about a town under siege by zombies and
an ancient witch's curse. It's one of the best movies of the late
summer, and should easily compete for at the Academy Awards for Best
Animated Film. The film in itself is split into two sections. The first shows Norman,
an out-of-place kid in a small New England town who has the ability to
talk to ghosts. Since he has no real friends, he doesn't mind the
undead. He's picked on at school for being different, and we see that
whenever another person, like the geek Neil, wants to be friends with
him, he tries to push them away. Norman's older sister, and Neil's
older brother are the stereotypical cheerleader and football jock, and
they torment Norman as well. And then we have the school bully; every
film seems to have them these days. The second part of the film sees Norman become an unlikely hero after a
witch's curse raises the dead back to life and all chaos breaks loose.
There are some creepy moments, but the characters are always cracking
off one-liners according to the situation, so it kept the film funny as
well as adrenaline pumping. The only thing I didn't like about the
story was the climax. It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it
felt sort of phoned in. Overall, the voice acting is great, the
animation is superb as always, and the 3D remarkably works well. I was
expecting a great movie, and I got it with this film. It may be a
little too scary for kids under the age of 10, but everyone else should
have a blast. I hope this film does well, and I can't wait to see what
Focus Feature's next big animated project will be. Final Verdict: 9/10
