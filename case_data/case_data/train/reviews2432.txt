Very disappointing

I'm a big fan but this movie was totally uninspired and lacks the charm
and anarchistic humor of its predecessors completely. The story is
confused, several plot lines (like Ramsbottom, Dr. Nefario) remain open
or are illogical and sketchy (like the Minions' jail episode). I just
hope that the crew will regain its old performance, and that the
Minions will be back - YELLOW, please!
