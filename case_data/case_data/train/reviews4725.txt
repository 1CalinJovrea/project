Just look a great book - impossible to put down!

Fantastic movie - exceptional acting, intricate plot, suspenseful
scenes throughout and an unbelievable twist at the end, which was
impossible to predict.Whilst some gun-tooting viewers may not appreciate the biased view
towards the need for greater gun control measures (a point so
intelligently made by drawing an analogy with car ownership), there can
be no doubting the quality of this piece of work from a cinematographic
perspective.The recurrent theme not of gun ownership issues but rather of aberrant
behaviour by self-serving politicians, if indeed not evident corruption
and nepotism, is a theme that will strike a strong cord in many Western
countries today, and lead us to question what democracy actually means
in a world where money plays the role of god.
