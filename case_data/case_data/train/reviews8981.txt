Excellent

Chilling soundtrack .I will remember the final simple song 3
performance by Sumi Jo as well as the excellent music by Marc Kojelec.
Marvellous photography. The landscapes of Switzerland and the use of
lights were amazing and the result magnificent. Great performances.
Michael Caine at his best. The script is refreshing and challenging
,full of quotes .It is not an easy movie.It needs effort to get into
its world. If you manage to do so, it captures you and moves your soul.
I loved it.Definitely one of the movies I will remember. A film full of pathos and
sweetness. I am already looking forward to another Sorrentino film.
