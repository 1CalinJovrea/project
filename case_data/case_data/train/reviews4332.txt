Rehabilitation of bombing victim

Well-made film though in my mind a bit overly-long, a bit too much
rehabilitation detail, and a bit too much on facial closeups.
Gyllenhaal a sure candidate for a best actor Oscar (and may go all the
way) and Maslany as best supporting actress. Best aspect is treating
the hero's hardship dealing with garish media sports events, though the
baseball game finds him more willing, after his meeting with the man
who saved his life. The victim/hero was a real nerd from a
dysfunctional family until his injury; after which he, following
lapses, becomes a serious human being, thanks also to meeting his live-
saving man.Audience knowing is based on true events adds to it,
although movie's happy ending lacked real life's denouement.
