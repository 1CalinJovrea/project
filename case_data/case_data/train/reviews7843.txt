meet the supermen!!! they never die

this movie is not worth watching, non of the American soldiers can be
killed, this is impossible, and we go back to the point were all the
non American soldiers cannot fight they just walk around the streets
shooting randomly waiting for a bullet to kill them, we all know this
isn't true, there are tough fighters everywhere, non of the actors nor
the actresses nows how to act, it's fiasco.the whole movie is about corrupting the image about Islam, there are no
terrorist in the world but muslims, this is what the movie is about,
non of the fights are real, what you see in the movie is totally
different from what you see in real fighting, if I had to give it from
1 to 10, I'd choose not to give anything at all.I still think the best war movie is "Saving Private Ryan", and this is
nothing compared to it.
