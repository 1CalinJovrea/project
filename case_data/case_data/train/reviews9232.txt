A Few good parts but the rest is really poor

The plot sounded really good, there were some good ideas here and
there.I enjoy some of the death Scene, ,As they were bit Final Destination
but not on the same level as those deaths.The acting was a mixed bag , some scenes felt good and others felt
forced.Also some of the script was very bad in places, didn't help either.Felt like half stuff was missing, seem a lot must of be cut.The ending was very predicable, I knew of the start, that was going to
happen and the last scenes was hilarious bad! , it was meant to be
shocking but it shocking, badly done, even made laugh out loud.
