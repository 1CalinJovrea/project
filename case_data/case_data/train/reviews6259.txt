A Terrible movie thats TERRIBLE!

Sandler's first sequel, is even lazier, dumber, and even less funny
then I could have imagined. It's worse than most comedy sequels, and
worse then most movies period. It's worse than Grown Ups, for heaven's
sake! There's no plot, none, zip, nada. Characters and gags are set up
without payoff much like in Jack and Jill. Almost every attempt at a
joke falls flat. Anyone who wants to make a comedy should watch Grown
Ups 2 as an example of one that does almost everything wrong and what
to and what not to do when directing and making a mainstream comedy.Almost every joke in this movie is pointless, absolutely pointless. The
movie's first joke: a deer wanders into Sandler's house where it pees
in Sandler's face. In a movie that had actual though: this would happen
not just because a deer peeing on a man is funny, but for some reason
that has a point, maybe to show that the family had moved out of the
city and into the country. There is no point, none and only the dumbest
of the audience will find this amusing.Grown Ups 2 is worse then the first and is a close 2nd as the worst
Sandler movie ever made, nothing in this movie had a point, there is no
plot, the whole movie and setup basically everything was lazy and Rob
Schneider may have actually made one of his best decisions ever by
skipping out on not only one of the worst sequels ever but one of the
worst comedies I've seen in a long, long time. 1 out of 10. Skip this
movie and go see Pacific Rim or read a book or go outside, Do
Anything!! Just Avoid this movie.
