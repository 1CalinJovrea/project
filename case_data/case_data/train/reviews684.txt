For the record...

In the interest of balance (and as a clue to the filmmaker's
intentions), it's worth noting that many friends and associates of the
real life Ron Woodruff have attested that he was not remotely
homophobic and worked happily alongside gays. Some even thought he was
gay, or at least bi. (Interviews with these people can easily be found
online). In choosing to depict Woodruff as a redneck homophobe Dallas
Buyers Club rather self-consciously opts for an unquestionably straight
hero, while almost entirely airbrushing gays out of the picture. It
also defames a real life hero who has nobody left to defend him. The
truth, of course, is that the Dallas Buyers Club, like many similar
ventures at the time, was largely run by gay activists. But they are
nowhere to be seen here. Instead, we have the titillating composite
figure of Rayon, the transvestite with a heart of (Oscar) gold. Again,
interesting that the filmmakers opted to replace all those real life
gays with a star turn for an actor in a dress. Many reviewers have been happy to describe this movie as sensitive or
daring or brave. In fact, it's just another piece of Hollywood
exploitation, as timid and untruthful in its way as Philadelphia, and
far more concerned with being a showcase for actors than with the truth
of the story it purports to be championing.
