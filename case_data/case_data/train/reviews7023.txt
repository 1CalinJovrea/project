Great example of tale for adults

Knowing it was a Guy Ritchie's film I had very high expectations.
However, there was one disturbing moment - a genre, which I thought (my
mistake) wasn't a good fit for his style and a well-known plot.In fact, even knowing what will be the ending (we all know the good old
story of King Arthur), I enjoyed the film from the beginning to the
very last phrase.A quick turn of events did not give me a chance to be bored. The camera
showed the history of the future king with a completely new
perspective. Dialogues were ridiculous even mentioning them after
watching the movie. Music that perfectly complements the story
depending on the course of events. Little details through the movie
constantly reminding you that you are watching a Guy Ritchie's work. One of the must-see films if you like action, combined with nice humor
and not an ordinary style of storytelling.
