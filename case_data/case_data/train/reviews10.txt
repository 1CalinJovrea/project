SImply a wonder and a part of my life now.

This movie deserves every possible star. I don't even know where to
begin on how amazing it is. I have been watching it a lot recently
since work wants me to be Jack from this film. Going to schools and
entertaining and reading to kids dressed as Jack frost? Pretty cool.
Well any way. This is a movie that needed to be made. There was no
severe violence, no cursing, no blood...except for Tooth fairy trying
to play with Sophie. This is the kind of kids movie that needed to be
made. More movies like this need to be made. The animation was a
marvel. The writing was fun. Humor was placed at the right times. The
characters where unique but you knew who they where and you where going
to remember them.
