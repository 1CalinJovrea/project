Total chick flick with a few laughs -about what I expected

I got out of this exactly what I was expecting going in so in that
respect I wasn't disappointed. This is an ensemble rom-com, filled with
familiar Hollywood faces (to distract from the lack of substance I
guess), like 'Valentines' Day or 'New Years Eve' except everybody has
baby on the brain here. Its a total chick flick with a few laughs, some
drama and I didn't have to think too hard.Based on a book (which they seem to have forgotten about) this follows
the lives of five loosely interconnected couples; a fitness guru
(Cameron Diaz), an infant advice author (Elizabeth Banks), a food truck
owner (Anna Kendrick) a photographer (Jennifer Lopez) and a trophy wife
(Brooklyn Decker) along with their partners who try to provide support
as they face the surprise demands of pregnancy.Anna Kendrick was very good and I also enjoyed the Elizabeth Banks
storyline. Dennis Quaid plays a competitive alpha dad.We also have a dads support group "Dudes" led by Chris Rock which is
meant to be funny but is mostly clich√© and just not, although I did
enjoy the (unnecessary) drop ins from a shirtless Joe Manganiello.
Wasn't there a short lived TV show with this same plot line? 2/18/15
