A powerful tale of friendship

It seems like ever since the success of girls trip back in 2011, it
seems like lots of other movies have tried to replicate the success of
that movie and failed. However what makes girls trip rather powerful is
its message of friendship and empowerment of women, I would say that
the film had lots of laugh particularly Tiffany haddish whose Dina
character is a lot like Melissa McCarthy character Megan but the film
also has a lot of heart.
