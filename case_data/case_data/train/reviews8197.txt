HER - a visually beautiful ode the technological age

Spike Jonze's latest feature 'Her', set in the not-too-distant future,
tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) who finds himself falling
in love with 'Samantha', an advanced operating system voiced by the
sultry Scarlett Johansson. It is clear to see why this film was chosen
by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2013: the visual
style and extensive use of pastel colours is a triumph in itself, and
the acting, editing, costumes and screenplay are all worthy of
recognition.I went to an awards screening of 'Her' and was pleased to find out that
the film was not at all what I was expecting. It has such a distinct
style, and Joaquin Phoenix carries the film with tremendous grace as
the complicated and sensitive protagonist. The film is mostly Phoenix
alone with Johansson's voice (reminiscent of Sandra Bullock in
'Gravity' or Robert Redford in 'All Is Lost' - two other 2013 films
mainly revolving around one solitary character), but the audience never
feels abandoned by the lack of other characters as we begin to forget
that 'Samantha' is just really just a computer.'Her' is a complex film with a much deeper meaning that lies beneath
the surface. A beautifully crafted motion picture, this quirky love
story is sure to resonate with you once you've seen it. It is an
extremely interesting (and realistic) look at the future - Jonze's
quaint and poignant film is a must-see! 9/10
