great idea, flawed execution

I'd like to say I just watched a masterpiece, hell even a great movie,
but unfortunaly there's just too many mistakes for me to say that, the
movie is barely good, the idea is amazing, but the execution is sloppy,
it's like that one great idea we all have but can't quite execute, we
have it all in our heads.now I'll go in SPOILERS.too many strange mistakes like: how did he get free from the dentist
chair when he had 2 men holding him, restrained and with a goddamn
drill to his teeth? if you ever did dental work without anesthesia you
know how it is: it's HELL. how could he formulate any kind of cohesive
thought in that situation? let alone escape?the movie's also not very logical, OK, people don't really feel like
living so that's why they stay there? or was it all mind control? if
they do employ mind control then how? characters also act plain creepy,
you know what I mean.I was expecting some kind of big reveal or twist and we do get it, the
problem is that it's obvious to the point where I asked "that's it?"
also the last scene is kinda nonsense, he smiles creeply like he's an
evil genius or something, I could articulate this review more but
that's how much I care now that its over, the movie could EASILY have
been 1 hour and 30 mins, instead sometimes it feels like a drag.would I recommend this movie? it's a mixed bag and it's not for
everyone, but if you have nothing better to do then go ahead.
