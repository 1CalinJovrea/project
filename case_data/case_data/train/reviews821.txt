What a piece of crap

Surprised by the unexpected success of the Pitch Perfect 2; I decided
to give a try to the first part. Not that I was planning to see the
second but out of curiosity. Let's clarify; I like music but know
nothing about the mechanic of it. An acquaintance; well versed in
opera, told me that you can get sounds with your mouth and throat than
no other instrument can; so the premise of an "a capella" movie must be
something interesting.Well; do not lose you time. There are a few know songs but it is hard
to believe the music was not instrumental. Choreographs OK; but not
better than GLEE which is free to watch. The story is so full of
clich√©s that the characters predict the outcome. The situations and
motivations are absurd; but the resolution are even worse It is really
not a surprise since characters are not properly defined; so their
behavior change according to the movie needs.Acting is terrible. Brittany Snow is able to cause empathy follow in a
second place by Skylar Astin; but the rest of the cast is awfully
forced or uninterested or boring(like Anna Kendrick ). The worse
surprise was Rebel Wilson; she is absolutely not funny.How poorly is this movie directed and scripted that John Michael
Higgins and Elizabeth Banks are there also (she is one of the producers
and future director of the second installment ) like in Greeks plays as
"narrators" basically informing us that performance is good or bad.Again; I know nothing about mechanic of music; but I am pretty sure
judges in this kind of competitions evaluate sound quality and
originality over modern songs.In brief; do not lose your time.In fact; the only the only moment trying to do something smart
