Funking Great

Saw it at a midnight premier last night (free Cornettos were given
out!) and myself and the rest of the audience were laughing throughout,
having a thoroughly enjoyable time. I thought it was great, definitely
on a par with Hot Fuzz, though - to me - not quite as good as Shaun of
the Dead, which is fair enough as it is one of my all-time favourites.
It is definitely a worthy close to the "trilogy" though, and it stands
up well against the other two.Amongst the highlights were seeing another former Bond actor, even if
it was in a small role, along with various other regulars from the past
films and Spaced - Tyres, Julia Deaking (Marsha), Bill Nighy's voice,
Mark Heap, et al.With a plot as ludicrous as this one the film relies on the strength of
it's leads to succeed, and they pull it off admirably. I liked that
there was a role reversal of Pegg and Frost's usual character dynamic,
with Frost especially noteworthy in his performance. The lads have
clearly come a long way over the years. Pegg is clearly having a whale
of a time, and carries us the audience along with him. Having such a
talented group of back-up actors in Marsan, Considine and Freeman helps
massively too.I feel they missed a trick by not using the line "You've got blue on
you", though.
