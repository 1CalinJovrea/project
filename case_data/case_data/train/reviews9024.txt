The first epic movie? Lives up to that subtitle.

So, pretty funny and pretty imaginative, I must say.The animation turned out to be really cool. I like how they went back
and forth form the 3D animation to the 2D animation. They even had some
sock puppetry. The blend shows the creativity of the child's mind,
greatly.Kevin Hart has the perfect voice for cartoons especially to play little
boys.He plays a kid named George who with his best friend Harold create a
comic book called Captain underpants, and when their principal
threatens to end their collaboration and with it the future of their
friendship by separating them due to all their pranking, so they
hypnotizing him into believing he's the character they created.It's a very wonderful exciting movie to watch. Very funny with great
animation.
