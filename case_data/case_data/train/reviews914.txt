Does not worth a dime

Awful plot, unrealistic as hell, 2 pointless hours of my life
disappeared.You know when you drive up the highway and see a sign says "all you can
eat in 5$" and you say to yourself, " it doesn't worth the toilet time
after..." well it'll still be a better investment then buying a ticket
to Baby Driver
