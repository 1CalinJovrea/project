really horrible

this is the really the worst movie i have seen this year.Let me make
this short .It is extremely boring .I wanted to get out of the theater
is mid way.plot is confusing.action and graphics are excellent,but
whats the point when there is no story.above average acting,repeatedly
irritating jokes,unnecessary music .music is good but it is added at
unnecessary places.the movie could have been wrapped up in 30 min but
it almost stretched for 3 hours.older actor was definitely a better
actor.you wont be able to sit throughout the film if you haven't
watched the other parts,but even if you have watched the other parts it
wont make much of a difference.Don't waste you time and money for this
movie.
