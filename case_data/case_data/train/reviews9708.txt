DO NOT let other reviewers sway you away from this movie..Average non-snob review follows.

I have never seen the original so I can't compare the two. I won't see
the original because if I wanted to read I would use a book. I really liked this movie. The story was great, the acting was very
good, it wasn't slow, and the action scenes were great. Josh Brolin did
a great job! I was really surprised at his physical transformation
throughout the movie. The story was awesome and the ending completely shook me. This was a
Sixth Sense type ending for me. Don't read the rest of these reviews and decide not to watch it. Snobs
will be snobs. A very very good movie in my average American opinion.
