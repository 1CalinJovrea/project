Rigged ratings on Internet

Gone are the days when you could trust the internet ratings on
rotten-tomatoes, IMDb.. hell even Wikipedia entry is so wrong about its
"reception and critical acclaim"..This is one of the worst movies ever. It's a shame.. IMDb ratings.
Movies like these will keep coming out and rigged ratings will keep
earning them money. Hollywood is losing it.. Do yourself a favor, and do not watch this garbage. The positive
reviews on this website are so clearly made up by the possible
stakeholders.. Maybe the producers nowadays are hiring marketing teams
whose jobs are to make multiple IDs and post as much positive reviews
and ratings on sites like these to fool the public.. and guess what it
sells.. some of the positive reviews are so clearly typed by the same
fingers.. it is a shame.
