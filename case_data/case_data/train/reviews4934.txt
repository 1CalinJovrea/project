A disturbing yet compelling performance

Jake Gyllenhaal brings the performance of his career to this disturbing
and compelling film that follows Lou Bloom in his quest to become the
best at his newfound job no matter what the consequences may be. This
film and Gyllenhaal's performance were so mesmerizing that i was
completely engaged in this movie for the full 2 hour runtime. Even in
the few instances when there was not much happening on screen, i was at
the edge of my seat at all times. The supporting cast from Rene Russo
to Riz Ahmed also put in strong performances that only added to the
overall quality of the film. Gyllenhaal really makes his character one
of the most memorable characters of the year, one that stands out from
all other films. When people mention Jake Gyllenhaal from now on, this
will be the movie i think of first. There is never a dull moment in
this very well directed and acted piece of art that i believe may even
land Gyllenhaal an Oscar nomination.
