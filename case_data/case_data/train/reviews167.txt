bad script, somewhat lacking design, not much originality

The beginning of the film was quite entertaining, especially the
resurrection scene. It was all quite promising till the point where the
kids decide to steal Victor's technology, disappointingly followed by
an impressive pile of clich√©s. Would this be an example of lazy
writing? The visual design was somewhat lacking too. The best elements
are the resurrection, the design of Sparky, Mr. Whiskas and his SHITTY
PROFECIES. BRUTON (sic!) of course could have done much better. One of
the problems is that Bruton tries to cater to kids of any age filming
material that clashes with any form of puritan upbringing. 6/10 because
it's a 3D film, otherwise its a strong 4/10.
