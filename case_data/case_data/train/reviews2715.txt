Finally something worth watching

As a matter of fact, I find it hard to watch movies lately. They all
seem so commonplace... But this one really kept me going.Although the ideas are not new, they are brilliantly brought by
excellent dialogues, directing and acting.A male's true role in a common family (wait till you are 50 with grown
children to understand) is also depicted here with an interesting
angle.I hate blowing my own horn, but even the plot got me surprised here and
there which is not very common.Not for youngsters, but don't miss it.
