Nostalgic film for the old and young

The first Monsters Inc. came out when i was just 7 years old and
immediately became one of my all time favourites from the day I saw it.
With extremely high expectations in mind and excitement especially for
Pixar's close attention to relevance (as I am actually at university
now myself) I went to see the new one as soon as it came out.The film is a prequel following closely to our much loved earlier
Characters, Mike and later Sully as they present to us their lives
prior to the first movie. As well as an adorable new cast of monsters
which are equally lovable as the old ones.To my delight, the film exceeded most if not all my earlier
expectations. The plot is well written, funny and most of all extremely
heart warming especially to long time fans like myself as well as those
younger viewers that might not have even seen the first one.The nostalgic element of the film is perhaps the most well written.
Every twist and turn reveals a huge or tiny explanation to the events
and habits of the characters that I previously saw in the first film.
Questions I never even asked myself, like why Randall's eyes are so
squinty or how Sully and Randall's rivalry originated. Although i absolutely loved the movie, perhaps its because I've waited
for 12 years but at some points it left me slightly unsatisfied and I'd
have loved for some parts to be explained more thoroughly. Regardless of my only criticism, the movie made me laugh, cried with
tears of joy, almost actually cried and was both heart warming and
action packed. What more could you ask for? I urge those fans of the
first film as well as anyone that just wants to have a good time at the
cinema to see it. It'll be well worth your time!
