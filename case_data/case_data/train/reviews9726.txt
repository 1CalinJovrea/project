Hardy is excellent, the rest is not so much

The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and
deceit. In Legend, that story isn't really taken to its full potential,
thanks to an unfortunately clunky structure despite brilliant
performances, good humour and violence.Let's start with the best part of this film, that is Tom Hardy's
performances as Ronnie and Reggie Kray. The amazing special effects
make the dual show possible, but within minutes of the start here, you
completely forget that these two characters are played by the same man.Hardy completely disappears into both men, with an unnerving but
humorous turn as the psychotic Ronnie, and a more understated but
powerful performance as Reggie, and that really deserves some praise.What's more is that this film does make use of the very violent nature
of the history very well. As bloody as it is foul-mouthed, this isn't a
pleasant film to watch, but the level of violence does leave an
impression with regards to the Krays' crimes, making it seem all the
more real, and all the more frightening.The big issue I have with this film, however, is that it's not an
exhilarating watch. Historically interesting it may be, but at over two
hours long, it's not something that will consistently entice you
throughout.There are side plots that aren't picked up on enough, some characters
don't get the development they really deserve based on the size of
their role, and the plot takes a really long time to get going.The disappointing thing is that Legend isn't a bad film in any way, nor
is it boring, but it gives you a sense of growing importance and
tension towards a hopefully climactic end, but it never comes as you
want it to.
