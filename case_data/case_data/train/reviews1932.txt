10
Truly a Work of Art

What do you do if your mom gives you 10$? Anybody? You go get a 20 pack
of Krispy Kreams! But honestly, this film turns movies like Avatar and
Creed upside down. This film shall sweep the Oscars, and I can't wait
for a sequel! This film made me cry tears of happiness P.S I do not actually think this was amazing, viewing it made me wish
EVERY SINGLE phone on the planet was destroyed. It was a poor excuse
for a movie. It really ticks me that someone in there RIGHT MIND would
cancel Popeye for this shite. Oh, and when I said in my "Work of art"
paragraph, this film made me cry tears of happiness, I meant
DEPRESSION! CRIPPLING DEPRESSION!
