Raw War.

Patriots Day, though a good movie, somehow felt like it would've been
better suited as a documentary, perhaps because it was shot like one,
because really a documentary can be made into a movie and vice versa.This film was good all around, nothing about it was defective really.
The acting and the directing was satisfactory. I find it quite
surprising actually that it didn't do well at the box office... Perhaps
it was too soon, and many saw it as exploitative?Also, how is it that the Dzhokhar's friends were/are arrested for
obstructing justice, yet Tamerlan's wife isn't? Whatever evidence they
have against the friends, it was explained in the movie that they had
even more against the wife, and maybe it was circumstantial, but, how
is it any different to the evidence the cops had on the friends? Unless
maybe they're trying to build a case stronger than just obstruction?Lastly, how do we approach the conundrum of the "media", being this
film, having a character who says that we're conditioned by the media
to believe that 9/11 was a terrorist attack, via the very media he says
is conditioning us? By accepting his media argument, we then can't
believe him, but by rejecting it, we're proving his theory right. I
mention this because Patriots Day is a bio, and there really still is a
huge question mark around the events of September 11th.Anyway, again, Patriots Day was a good movie, and I also wonder if that
friendly fire bit actually happened, because whoa; that was close.
7/10.
