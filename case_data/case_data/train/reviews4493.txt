Excellent slice of arty entertainment

What a superb movie! Went to the movies today with little expectations,
other than I would be seeing something 'classier' than the normal fare.
The movie started off nicely with Geoffrey Rush dominating the screen
with his larger than life character, not particularly to my liking.
However, as the story unfolded and the plot deepened the subtle changes
transforming him into an image of one his finer works of art, I found
myself mesmerised and transported into his world. The complexity of the
plot developed nicely and my suspensions were aroused reasonably early.
However, I didn't mind at all - for the journey was beautiful. The
acting, cinematography, music, script - and beautiful artwork and
scenery - certainly compensated for any flaws the movie had. Some may
say it was predictable and flawed in parts, but hey, enjoy the
experience and immerse yourself in fantasy - this is a movie after all.
I find myself still puzzling over some aspects of the plot - the real
Clair, what's going on there. I also would have thought that Lambert
would have had good reason to be complicit with the others. Gem of a
movie - I can't wait to see it again.
