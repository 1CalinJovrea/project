Well done, complex mystery

Well, I enjoyed this movie to the point I would watch it again to catch
some of the nuances you miss during first viewing. The story is a bit
complicated with several couples in overlapping relationships, but that
makes it interesting. The actors are all good with real responses to
the surprise events. Unveiling the main character's, Rachel, story in
drunken snippets adds to the tension. Some other reviewers complain
about plot points that don't make sense but, in some cases, it's
because the reviewer did not understand the plot and the
inter-relationships of the characters. Special credit to Emily Blunt
and Haley Bennet for portraying the angst in their personal situations.
