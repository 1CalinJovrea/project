Just plain bad

Those of you who haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and skip
it. If you gave this movie a high rating when it was out, I suggest you
try to watch it again. I'm betting that you will see what I saw -- a
really bad movie. In fact, it is so bad, I'm actually taking this time
out of my day to write this. I feel ripped off by it.The dialogue was so bad, the audience was laughing at it throughout the
movie. With the crap they had to work with, the actors didn't shine
either. Chris Pine came off stiff and unlike-able. He's still not my
favorite Kirk but he's been good prior. With nothing to work with in
terms of a script, the cast is just limp and uninteresting.The story itself is silly and implausible. Now, I know in science
fiction you have to suspend belief to some degree but this story just
stretched me way to far in terms of mad coincidences.I couldn't wait for this film to end. I'm a life-long Star Trek fan but
I'm bailing on this reboot series. "Beyond" was the worst Star Trek
movie I've ever seen.
