waste of time

Im just speechless as i saw that this movie got a rating as high as
6.2, i'm sure that most people who gave it a high rating saw only the
trailer at best.let me tell you a little about this movie without spoiling and pray god
that my English will be understandable, well what this movie is about
is that you wait for something to happen and you wait and you keep
waiting and.... it happens, but when it happens actually nothing
happens, to summarize it two weirdos make something to destroy it in
the end, exactly like a kid who makes a sand castle but in the end he
gets bored and destroy it.This movie is a waste of time.
