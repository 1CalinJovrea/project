Disappointing

I should have gone by the User Rating of this movie. Usually I try not
to watch anything that has a rating of less than a 7, but I have been
surprised on occasion. I watched Funny People that had a rating of 6.5
& I thought I might try this one too. But while Funny People actually
had a few laughs, this one left me bewildered. It's pretty juvenile
actually, more suited to an audience of 18 to 23 year olds at best.The track of the villain that runs in the background is a waste. Nor is
there any real point in the main characters being CIA agents, apart
from the surveillance. This movie could have been any other movie about
2 friends competing for the affections of a girl. It hackneyed, and
it's utterly, utterly predictable. The writers and the director could
have employed some creativity & vision to rescue such a banal premise,
but they didn't.I looked up the director after watching this. McG's work, apart from We
Are Marshall has been consistently impotent, as has the work of the two
writers.Very disappointing. It doesn't deserve the misleading 6.4 user rating
that it's has currently.This movie is a MUST AVOID.
