The truth hurts: Nymphomaniac is too awful to watch!.

Lars Von Trier is a famous controversial Danish Director.Actually I
have never ever heard of him before!.I was really interested to see
this movie as Lars Von Trier has been boasting of his works and regards
himself as a great director.His movie Nymphomaniac Volume I has let me
down.I felt sorry to see how a girl turned from innocence to c**k
addiction.Although the explicit sex scenes are hot,yet the movie is
generally too boring and a waste of time. The best part of this movie
is the brief acting of Uma Thurman. All my enthusiasm to see this movie
was completely lost as I watched this movie.I have realized that this
film or his producer and director (Lars Von Trier) is making fun of us.
I tried to find drama and suspense in it,but against all odds the movie
sounded more like a travesty.
