Creepfest

This movie is disturbing and disgusting but if you're watching it
that's the point. It had a lot of points that made me feel -- for lack
of a better word -- plain icky.Elijah Wood does a great job dialing up the creep factor -- he is
incredibly believable as an unadulterated psychopath. Maniac recently
got banned in some locales because of its content, so that alone says
that it does well in the horror genre.It's unsettling, creepy, gross. It does what it sets out to do pretty
well. The direction is good in this film as is the cinematography; for
a remake it was exceptional!
