So witty. What a ride!

I see the words "cult classic" in this movie's future. At the very
least, I'll be adding this to my collection of movies such as Kick Ass,
Pulp Fiction, Zombieland and Hot Fuzz that I love to watch over and
over. You know from the very first scene that this is not your typical
Hollywood junk. It was HYSTERICAL, albeit in a pretty sick and twisted
way - this is not for the faint of heart. The woman behind me must not
have seen the previews, because she got up and left. I'm going to have
to see it again this weekend just to catch some of the witty one-liners
that I couldn't hear over the roaring laughter. The audience even
applauded when it ended.The script is razor sharp, and you couldn't dream up a better cast to
bring it to life. I've always liked Sam Rockwell, but this was a
star-making turn for him (at least in my book). You've never seen a
movie quite like this. I see a new movie nearly every week, and I
rarely feel compelled to sit down and write a review. So take my
advice, do yourself a favor and go see it!
