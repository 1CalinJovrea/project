A mind-blowing movie that you must see if you like sci-fi and action movies (and even if you don't)

This movie is by far one of the best I've seen in 2017. I must admit
that I thought the story presented in the trailer was clich√©, but the
movie is mind blowing. I would catalogue it as an action movie, and I
usually don't like action movies, but this one in particular, has a
very well done story that keeps you immerse in the movie wanting to
know more. I read the bad reviews and for what I've seen is people that
just watch the superficial and didn't really understand the story and
what it wants to transmit, and that's the thing, I had never written a
review for a movie, but this one really deserves it, and because I want
people to give it a chance and not to avoid watching it because of the
bad reviews (that are from people that apparently misunderstood the
movie). So I really recommend it, It would keep you entertained and
amazed.
