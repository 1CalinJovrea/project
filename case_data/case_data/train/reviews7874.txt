Amazing!

Bong Joon-ho has brought us yet another masterpiece. Before viewing
Okja, I was a little concerned that it would be just a sappy feel good
family film about a kid that developed too much of an attachment to a
farm animal. Now, I'm simply amazed at how Bong manages to always give
us such emotionally and politically complicated films.If you understand his style and knack for subtle commentary, then you
will see this as another excellent film in the same vein as The Host.The obvious commentary is clear but not overwhelming and the subtle
bits are in true Bong style. I think many may misinterpret some of his
choices, particularly with Gyllenhaal's character and performance, but
if you grasp Bong's social and political stances then you'll appreciate
the choices.For anyone who is unaware, all of Bong's movies contain certain
elements. There are the overt elements that include humor (sometimes
within the least humorous of situations), suspense, emotional
connection, the folly of man and a lack of responsibility on the part
of a government or corporation. But these elements are supported by
subtle inclusions which are dotted throughout his movies like little
watermarks and always serve to say the things that should be said
without saying them.Besides these factors, and for those less inclined towards analytical
movie watching, there is always a great story and magnificent
cinematography. Okja is no exception.The only disappointing aspect of this movie is that it just came out,
I've already watched it and now I'll have to wait another 2-3 years for
another Bong movie to enjoy. I have seen The Host at least 10 times and
I could watch it again right now. I'm certain to see Okja at least two
more times with those with whom I enjoy seeing his movies and I don't
think it'll feel like a chore either. In my opinion, Bong is one of the
most consistent filmmakers to have ever made a movie and that streak
remains unbroken with Okja.
