Nothing Spectacular

I went into the movie among high hopes. My friends told me it was
fantastic and there were scenes that were "out-of-this-world". So
entering this movie (with a certain elevation) I had high expectations.
But it fell incredibly short.Overall, the acting. Monologue, boring, no worth while story, the hero
who just entered the arts of magic is now suddenly one of the best in
the business in a short amount of time, etc. etc. Now I understand that
it's a Marvel and Superhero movie, but that doesn't change the fact
that the script is entirely the SAME for every Marvel movie on the
characters are changed.This movie was (for lack of a better term) boring. There were only
three of those "out-of-this-world" scenes and those scenes were done
well (save for the first. Focusing on a violently shaking your head
side to side while flashy colors are beaming around you is lazy film
directing at best).The movie was not what it was hyped up to be by my friends, other
critics, and reviews. It is a generic action flick with terrible
attempts at comedy with the usual on-liner and unbelievable looks of
"How did you..." then to "I just did." and act all innocently.In short: This action/"comedy" movie is generic, bland, boring, with
few action scenes just to make sure you are distracted by the endless,
meaningless conversations. I expected more from this type of movie. 2/7P.S. This studio has become arrogant and lazy.
