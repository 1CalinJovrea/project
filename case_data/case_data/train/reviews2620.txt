Real film, real stunts, real actors and real fun

You know the plot; you also know who is in this movie so lets get to
it. Gore Verbinski has delivered a film that moves leisurely along
peppered with rousing action sequences, comedy, villainy and pathos. It
is solid entertainment. I would place this movie alongside Waterworld,
The Last Action Hero, and John Carter as unfairly panned films which
deserves to succeed in the cinema halls.It is too bad that there appears to be a hate on for this movie simply
because it seems that a lot of money was spent in its making. But look
at it this way, when you hire real stunt persons, construct and destroy
real trains and stage many stunts for real, it is not going to be
cheap. I would rather support this type of movie-making any day instead
of the tired CGI based effects laden yawners. Every penny of the budget
is on screen in a beautiful shot and staged movie. I found it to be an
enjoyable 159 minutes of entertainment.
