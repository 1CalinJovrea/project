Hop onto the nostalgia train

This review of T2: Trainspotting is spoiler free**** (4/5)"They may be twenty years older when trying to reconnect but they are
still none the wiser", was the quote from director Danny Boyle when
promoting T2: Trainspotting that may be so but they have still moments
of seriousness. They still have the emotion, the same taste or even the
same mindset as they try to remember their time from 20 years ago. When
Boyle announced that he was going to direct the very long-awaited
sequel to the original 1996 cult classic, based on Irvine Welsh's fifth
novel Porno there was a lot of controversy from fans of the first one;
how would they do it? Where will it go? Does it need a sequel? Can you
make a sequel after this long? Were the first few of their many
questions that they asked, but when the release was announced it soon
turned into one of the most anticipated British film sequels of all
time. But is it as good? The film opens with Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) living in Amsterdam,
dreaming of the past and all the good times he had with his friends,
Begbie, Sick Boy and Spud, all those times they shared jokes and even
had the odd bit of drugs. Then we transfer to Edinburgh, to Frank
Begbie (Robert Carlyle) currently spending time in prison. Through to
Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) an owner of one of the top bars in
Scotland, then we spend with Spud (Ewan Bremner) who is trying to get
back with his wife (Shirley Henderson) and kid, but also still goes
through the addiction to heroine he had all those years ago. The
arrival of Renton back at Edinburgh, they suddenly become happier but
they also question him to see what he has been up to "Hello Mark, so
what have you been up to for twenty years?" Sick Boy asks him towards
the start of the film, it's a question that feels as if it's never
going to be answered Â– seemingly hinting that we will never know what
he has been up to. He does start to answer, stating that he had a job,
a wife and a couple of kids but he is then interrupted by Boyle's
transitioning to another character. It's a slightly disjointed opening to the very long-awaited sequel and
it takes a while for the film to recover from it, but what happens
after that during the second act slightly makes up for it. With Renton
and Simon (a.k.a Sick Boy) trying to reconnect after years apart, it
takes a while granted but when they finally join they are up to their
previous shenanigans what essentially made the film's predecessor
manic, but it goes of that style and tries to go a little more serious
there are a couple of zingers from each of the characters, whereby
Trainspotting had an insane amount of hilarious moments it's sequel
veers away from it, it's as if these twenty have entirely changed these
people. However their friendship falls with the return of Begbie who
wants to reconnect with Sick Boy and Spud after spending years in
prison but with Renton he still remembers what he did to him all that
time ago, he wants revenge after being betrayed out of a lot of money,
meanwhile Spud comes up with a new hobby to right stories of their time
together, it's a way for him to come off the drugs and hopefully to get
back with his wife. This starts to affect him dearly when he remembers
one of his friends. It's a slightly blunt look back at the past as
there are only a few fresh but short flashbacks of each of them. There are times when T2: Trainspotting riffs on the same aspects as its
predecessor, especially one moment when Simon's partner Veronika
(Anjela Nedyalkova) wants to hear what Renton's mantra "Choose life"
means, he states the many things that she could choose, it's a moment
that is short but it brings back a slight feeling of nostalgia, yet
there are many moments through the entire film that do that, though
it's a blunt force of nostalgia that runs throughout there are many
times when we feel it. In the second act it is a bit muddled as it
tries to make up for the disjointed moments in the opening, the third
certainly makes up for it, this is when it becomes the sequel we've all
been waiting for. It becomes a little manic, there are many funny
moments, some sad moments and there are some moments within the third
act that bring back a lot of nostalgia, there is even a stunning shot
of the three friends, going back to their former lives. It's fair to
say the third act is the best part of the film that couldn't have come
more timely. Sure enough T2: Trainspotting isn't anywhere near as
manic, funny or as good as it's predecessor but there is still plenty
here to enjoy for Boyle's first directed sequel, that time that we all
waited is worth it as this film fills the twenty hole left from the
first movie.VERDICT: Boyle's first ever sequel isn't as good or as manic as it's
predecessor but there is still plenty here to enjoy, it's sometimes
funny, it's sad and best of all it's a nostalgic look back to the 1996
cult classic, one of the best movies of 2017 so far.
