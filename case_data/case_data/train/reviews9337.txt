That Was Terrible !

This movie got High Rating by critics, a lots of them put it as number
one in 2016 (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_jungle_book_2016) so
I expected nothing but perfect, Unfortunately it was disappointing. At first, the voices did not fit with the movement of the characters,
except Bill Mary as Baloo. The CGI was good, but it was too much , throughout the film It did not
felt that i am in the Jungle , it was like i am inside a computer game,
nothing naturally was there except the child. Then, we have the kid Neel Sethi who Was Terrible, no feelings, no a
spirit of Mowgli, the kid was lost between the computer graphics. And The story, I expected it more depth , something new , Unfortunately
there was no any addition at all, in fact it was more short version of
the story. I did not feel the spirit of Mowgli (fun and smart kid), I did not feel
the crazy jungle, no atmosphere of this beautiful story, just A LOTS of
Computer-generated imagery (CGI).
