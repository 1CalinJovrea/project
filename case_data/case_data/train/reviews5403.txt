Absolute Liberal Feminist Trash

You will want to hurt yourself if you watch this movie. It is so untrue
and suggests ridiculous things about the human race that separates us
instead of uniting. This actually made me lose some hope in all of us.
This movie had very little character development aside from describing
Billie Jean King in a strong liberal political view. The entire movie
suggests it is a true story, but it makes up many ridiculously
exaggerated events and quotes.
