Excellent movie

Amazing movie with excellent pace and perfect portrayals, with an
especially outstanding performance by Daniel Br√ºhl as Niki Lauda.
Watching it in German, I tended to forget the fact I see an actor and
not the original most of the film. Stunning!I also loved the racing scenes, filmed with excellent camera work and
cutting, something I have never seen before in a Hollywood feature like
this. I found the film very well balanced concerning personal scenes
and the racing sport. The film made you not sympathize too much with
one of the characters, at another point I found myself liking them
both. One of the major aspects for the film being so intriguing from my point
of view is, besides all the above mentioned points, that it does not
take itself too seriously. It has no universal or fundamental message
to convey and the film acknowledges exactly that. It's fun to watch,
exciting, appealing and sometimes disgusting at the same time!
