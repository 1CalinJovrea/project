Art Into Life

Great movies have the power to make you think and this movie had me
thinking for so long I couldn't sleep on the night I saw it. It is a
tremendous film with a deeply unsettling message and even now, 24 hours
after seeing it I am haunted by the end.It's a fairy story and nightmare rolled into one. It's not what happens
that's important it's how it happens. the story is great but the plot
is even better.Forget the bad reviews and make up your own mind. If you subscribe to
the notion that Life imitates Art or Art imitates Life go see it. You
won't be disappointed.
