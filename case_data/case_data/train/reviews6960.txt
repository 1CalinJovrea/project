Jeremy Saulnier Does it Again

Green Room is full of visceral thrills, gritty violence, and real
characters forced into situations where they have to do despicable
things. And to be quite honest, that's absolutely terrifying to watch
for 90 minutes.Jeremy Saulnier is back directing after his brilliant, Blue Ruin, which
unfortunately no one saw. His job on Green Room is just as impressive,
if not more. While the former is a much more personal story about one
man on a revenge mission, Green Room covers a band who is accidentally
thrust into a life or death situation at a skinhead bar after they come
across a horrible crime. Both are extremely disturbing takes on
violence, I found Green Room to have a few more thrills and ideas being
explored.Joining Saulnier is the late-great Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole (from Peaky
Blinders fame), Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner, and Patrick
Stewart. Stewart is as terrifying as I've ever seen him as he plays the
diabolical bar owner who takes matters into his own hands. It's
difficult to watch Charles Xavier do the things he does to innocent
band members, but with Saulnier's direction, it works.But I think the band's innocence may be what I found to be most
compelling about this story. They aren't a clean cut or crime free
group of young-adults, they have their own shortcomings as well. Of
course, they aren't as horrible as the skinheads who spend time at the
neo-nazi level of bad, but they aren't completely innocent either.
Saulnier paints them as inexperienced and terrified which gives the
action scenes more weight.It's not for everyone as the violence is more brutal than something you
would find in a Scorsese film, but it's one of the most impressive
thrillers of 2016 with creativity and grittiness that is up there with
the best of them.+Performances are grounded with realism+Saulnier's relentless direction+Shocking9.0/10
