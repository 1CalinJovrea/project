Definitely a new horror classic!

Let me start off with a little disclaimer: I am very picky with my
horror movies made after the year 1990. Although some are excellent, I
feel that they are few and far in between. I strongly believe that this
is one of those few movies, and I urge you to watch it - no review
necessary. GO NOW! This is one of those movies that isn't
"in-your-face" scary, and it doesn't have jump-scares galore either.
It's subtle, suspenseful, and downright creepy. There is a point in
this movie where some believe the director lost the audience, but I beg
to differ. This simple plot-twist was used to DRIVE the plot, not BE
the plot (like in some other big- budget movies I won't name). The only
little complaint I have about this film is the ending. I feel like they
didn't know HOW to necessarily "kill the monster" properly and wanted a
happier ending then most horror movies these days, but that only knocks
this one down by one star for me. Now, before I spoil anything for you,
I suggest you go and make up your own mind about this new horror
classic. This is definitely one I wish we could have had in theaters
this past Halloween, I'd buy two tickets!
