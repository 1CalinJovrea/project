fine survival movie

City boy David (Josh Wiggins) joins his estranged reclusive father Cal
(Matt Bomer) in remote Montana for some hunting. There are flashbacks
to a young Cal with his father Clyde (Bill Pullman) on a similar
hunting trip. David is forced to abandon his phone in the isolated
wilderness. An incident with a bear leaves them struggling in the
middle of nowhere.The incident is problematic. David's stupidity colors the movie in a
bad light. He can be clueless but he shouldn't be stupid. I was with
the boy up to that point. It's unnecessary to have David be so dumb.
Did he think that he's in a petting zoo? Otherwise, this is perfectly
good survival in the woods movie. The father and son relationship has a
good strained vibe although Matt Bomer is no classic woodsman. He's too
pretty and needs a bigger beard to cover that face up.
