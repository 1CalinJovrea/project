Waste of time and money

So I wasted a date night, on a Tuesday, on this movie. The commercials
made it look like it would be a scary, mind-tease. Instead I felt like
someone who sat through the most mind-dulling two hours. I not only
wasted $8.50 per ticket on this, but a short amount of time out of my
life, and away from my kids. The story line was all over the place. You
never really got the point. Did the guy go mad? Did the guy with no
face figure out how to live forever? How did they stick that huge ass
tube down the one guys throat and have the flesh eating eels go through
his system and him still survive. Was the girl really like 100 years
old. Did we need to see her father finger her? Were his bosses in on
this? How did we see someone that was dead living and vice versa? Why
were all the nurses and orderlies so odd, were they dead, or undead?
There is just too much that needed explaining. This movie is a waste of
time. Please, save your time and money for something better. I heard
Split was good!
