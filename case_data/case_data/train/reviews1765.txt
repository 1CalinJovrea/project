I don't know if there was another movie I ever saw that was so funny and so arousing at the same time

With Kate Upton vs. Alexandra Daddario, we can't loose!So Upton and Daddario play two best friends (Despite their personality
differences) who decide to go after the same man when a layover gets
them stuck in St. Louis.It was a good role reversal (Cause usually it's too dudes who would
treat another person like meat in this matter). It really did make the
comedy refreshing, and I did like what the overall lesson of the movie
turned out to be. It was an old plot line in need of this new
perspective, and William H Macy as the director really did just that.I've always had a thing for Alexandra Daddario since I saw her in those
Percy Jackson movies, but I have to say, Kate Upton won this battle.
The model turned actress was obviously hired to put the sex in this sex
comedy, or at least that's what they want you to think. Every scene she
was in had me rolling on the floor. I had some good laughs watching her
own the screen. Way better than her turn in the comedy,  The Other
Woman. Daddario was good for a few giggles (And one amazing sex scene
that was both steaming hot and absolutely hilarious), but nothing had
me Laughing out Loud like Upton. I'm not going to lie, I was surprised
and impressed by the talent.Too hot and too funny. I could watch this over and over again.http://cinemagardens.com
