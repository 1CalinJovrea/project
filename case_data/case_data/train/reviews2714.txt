I would be embarrassed if I were starring in this movie

I have to be honest- I walked into this movie with pretty low
expectations to begin with. It is only on a rare occasion anymore that
I actually buy a ticket for a movie with any hope that it might
actually provide entertainment, which is a shame. This movie, however,
just lowered the bar- by a LOT. Hands down one of the worst movies that
I've ever seen- and that's saying something. It is just a gaggle of
actors working on an acid-trip of a script. Every bit of comedy is
based on shock value, which wears thin on your patience very early on.
It's gross, lewd, and utterly lacking of any wit or connection with the
audience. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone- as I
nearly went up to the box office and demanded a refund. It isn't even
that I'm a prude or hate gross-out humor, I'm 18 for crying out loud- I
just have the ability to recognize when someone put actual effort and
thought into making a movie funny and when Hollywood is laughing AT US,
instead of vice versa. Miss this one. 1/10
