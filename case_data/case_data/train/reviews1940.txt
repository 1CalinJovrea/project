A Total Mess

Imagine an episode of something as nuanced, understated and gripping as
an episode of Homeland gradually turning into something as darkly
humorous and comic book-esque as an episode of Dexter. Throw in some
action set pieces and I think you would not be far away from what this
is.It starts out well. A mysterious man turns up at the house of his slain
comrade and offers touching words to his family, winning them into his
confidence one by one, though, in truth, their grief makes them easy
prey. It continues to build well when he sorts out the son's high
school tormentors in a way that will have you cheering. At this stage,
his cover story that he cares about the family is still plausible, but
he is clearly someone with the capacity for extreme violence. The
acting is uniformly excellent.However, in a bid to procure a large amount of firearms, he murders the
arms dealer he is buying them from. The body count then starts to build
implausibly quickly when the man who is standing in the way of the
father of the family's promotion is also found conveniently dead.The actors are excellent, as I say, but even they seem progressively
unconvinced by the story when some covert government unit turns up to
claim The Guest. Apparently he was part of some kind of experiment
which went wrong, but details on this are very sparse.The finale is camped up in the extreme and in the style more of an 80s
B Movie. Which would make sense if the first half was anything close to
that type of film, but instead you are just left scratching your head.There are good moments, the acting is great, but don't be suckered in
by the high ratings. This is not essential viewing. If you want a
popcorn flick on a Saturday night this is okay, I guess, but that's
all.
