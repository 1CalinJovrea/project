Bondurant Family Values

Lawless is the story of the three Bondurant brothers from Franklin
County, Virginia, Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, and the runt of the litter
Shia LaBoeuf. Before World War I the Bondurants made a good living
selling moonshine, but now Prohibition has arrived and there are new
problems on the horizon for those in that business.One of the most colossal pieces of stupidity that America ever indulged
in was Prohibition. We actually amended our constitution so that we
could regulate morals. A good lesson for those who think regulation of
one's personal behavior is a desired thing. What the Bondurants have to
deal with is law enforcement which is in the form of a corrupt District
Attorney Tim Tolin.An idea like Prohibition is sure to bring out the corruption in many
who see it as a way to take bribes. Tolin is one of those and he has a
special deputy in Guy Pearce ready to enforce the law and those who
don't bribe. That would be the Bondurants and we have the makings of an
old fashioned mountain feud brewing.LaBoeuf has a lot of trouble living up to the legend his brothers have
created. In fact his weakness is the cause of a lot of problems. But
when a young mountain kid Dane DeHaan is murdered by Pearce that gets a
war started.Both LaBoeuf and Pearce deliver some standout performances in Lawless.
This is based on a novelization of some real incidents by a descendant
of the Bondurant family. The recreation of Prohbition era rural
Virginia is well done. Definitely worth a look.
