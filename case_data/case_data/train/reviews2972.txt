Visually stunning Science fiction

The new film from the director Joseph Kosinski who directed 2010's Tron
Legacy, has two things going for it, his brilliant visual style and a
brilliant score this time provided by M83 rather than Daft Punk who
scored Tron Legacy. The film is rapturously beautiful, it was filmed
with 4K cameras which is definitely the way in which to see it as it
was stunning. The film stars Tom Cruise who can make anything watchable
(as he did with Knight and Day, barely) and he brings a familiar face
for somewhere completely foreign territory, as the world has been
devastated by a war for earth. He is joined by Morgan Freeman who does
not feature as much as the poster would have you believe, also Andrea
Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko. The best thing about the film is the
action which works very well and we have a Texan Melissa Leo at mission
control who is a figure of mystery and plays to some of the more
interesting parts of the film such as who creation and the feeling of
home, which Cruise does. The film has the tag-line "Earth is a memory
worth fighting for" and this film is definitely worth seeing on the
biggest screen with the best projector possible.
