Excellent

What a breath of fresh air... A brilliant film in every respect. I was
lucky enough to this movie at a special preview and I cant tell you how
great a film this is... At first you think its about racing cars, but
its not it really does give you an insight into the human condition...The rivalry between Hunt and Lauder is just played brilliantly... The
race sequences are superb, really taking you back to the 70s... The
heyday of this awesome sport. It shows the end of an era where the
gentlemen drivers begin to give way to professional sportsmen and the
end (in my opinion) of the excitement of the sport. It shows what a
pale reflection today's F1 is of this once great sport, and what great
characters we have lost...A real must see movie
