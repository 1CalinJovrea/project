Good popcorn chomping action movie

I'll start by saying that I am one of the readers of the Lee Child
Reacher novels who railed against the miscast Tom Cruise as Jack
Reacher. Though I think Cruise does a good job of portraying the loner
aspect of Reacher's personality, the magnitude of Reacher's Bad Ass
quotient is lost due to the 10 inches or so difference in size between
Cruise and the character described in the books. That said....I have to
say that I enjoyed this movie more than the firstThis is definitely a good "eat popcorn while watching the action"
movie. There were some plot holes.....but what action movie doesn't
have them. Readcer after helping in the arrest of a crooked Southern
Sheriff decides to head to Washington DC to meet the current Commanding
officer of the MP unit Reacher used to lead. Upon arriving in DC, he
discovers two things.....the new CO is under arrest for suspicion of
espionage and someone is claiming that he is the father of a teen aged
girl. The movie then follows Reacher and Major Turner (the new female
CO) as he breaks her out of jail to try to find out who is responsible
for the murder of two of her MPs and also to help unravel the story
behind his alleged "daughter'. There is plenty of action and a few good
quiet character moments between Reacher and the Major and Reacher and
the teen aged girl. For those of you who were fans of the TV show Leverage....Aldis Hodge
(Alec Hardison the Hacker) has a pivotal supporting role and he did
pretty good. If you come to watch this movie expecting deep social
meaning or superb dialogue...you will be disappointed. If you come to
forget the election and be entertained for two hours.....you will have
REACHED your goal (sorry...couldn't resist)
