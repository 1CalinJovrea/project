A Good Film Made Great by its Powerhouse Performances

Stronger is a very well told narrative, enhanced by rich performances
from Jake Gyllenhaal and Tatiana Maslany. Gyllenhaal has been one of my
favorite actors for years now. Every time he is in a movie, he turns in
an absolutely brilliant performance, and Stronger is no exception. From
the opening scene, I didn't see Gyllenhaal on screen; all I saw was
Jeff Bauman. He is a chameleon of an actor, and he transformed once
again for this film. His performance is rather subtle for most of the
movie, but he has certain scenes where he bursts with emotional
outbreaks, and it's truly commendable acting. Playing off of him was
Tatiana Maslany. I know she's a brilliant actor from her work on Orphan
Black, and I was happy to see her on the big screen. I don't think she
was as good as Gyllenhaal was, but one of her strengths in the film was
not stealing the spotlight. The story is about Gyllenhaal's character
first and foremost. She has a very important role, but she is not the
focus of the story. And Maslany knew that. She certainly had her scenes
where she showed what she could do, but all of her acting was in
service to keeping the focus on Gyllenhaal, making it a rather mature
performance.
