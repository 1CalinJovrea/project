A lazy milking of the cash cow.

I decided to go and see this film as I am a fan of the first film in
the franchise - the second was not enjoyable, but I had hoped the
conclusion would be a return to form. I was hugely disappointed by the
lazy script, cruel tasteless gags, and the predictability of the film.
I love comedies, I have a sense of humour, but I only laughed once or
twice. The cruel animal death 'jokes' killed the mood of the film. They
were cheap and quite shocking. I know these films are supposed to be
shocking, but it is not clever or witty to make jokes out of serious
issues like cockfighting - I didn't want to watch a rooster get slowly
smothered by an imbecilic Asian man. I wanted to enjoy a fun experience
like I did with the first Hangover film. Mr Chow is a hugely
irritating, monotonous character, whose only purpose seems to be to
hurl out nonsense at every opportunity. The Hangover Part III will ruin
the experience of the first film for you - if you want a film that is
original, and good fun - avoid this shameless grab for cash. I can
honestly say this was a chore to watch. 1/10
