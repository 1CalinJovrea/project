Unbelievably Bad

I can't believe I sat through this entire movie. I can't believe
Stephanie Meyer approves of it. I can't believe the acting is so
dreadful. I can't believe some people actually think this is an
all-right, let alone great, ending to the movie franchise. Admittedly,
I am inclined to be negatively critical of movies that are not faithful
to the original story or characters on which they are based -
especially if I liked the original. I was mildly tolerant of the 4
movies leading up to this one because I felt the important parts of the
story lines were there even though the actors didn't measure up to the
characters that had formed in my mind from reading the books. This
final movie, on the other hand, rushes through the story barely
touching on some parts I feel are important, in order to include a
culminating scene which is not part of the original story, and which
itself has to be absurdly unbelievable to any fan of the book series.
Two actors, Lautner and Sheen, do the best they can with the terrible
dialoge they were given, but not one other character utters a
believable syllable the entire time. I should have stayed home and
re-read the book, and would heartily advise others to do the same.
