Not so good.

When Moonlight ended, a woman a few rows back said,"Is that it?" That
was exactly what I was thinking. This movie received so many excellent
reviews from critics, and awards and nominations galore, that I assumed
it must be quite good. Unfortunately, I do not agree with these critics
or the various award giving entities in this case. I do not think it
should have ever been nominated for best picture or best director. I
give it a 4 out of ten. Moonlight is not entertaining, nor is it
interesting. I can only guess that they thought it was politically
correct to give a movie about a bullied,gay, black teen a good review
because of all the controversy surrounding the Academy Awards supposed
lack of ethnic diversity. I would nominate Denzel Washington's "Fences"
instead.
