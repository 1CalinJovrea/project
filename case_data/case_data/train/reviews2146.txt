Lacking chemistry, humour and grit, "Lawless" feels like nobody's heart was in it.

I really like The Proposition so this reteam of Hillcoat and writer
Nick Cave, who since he composed the greatest score in cinematic
history in The Assassination of Jesse James can do no wrong in my eyes,
was very promising, especially with a set piece and era that we haven't
seen in a long while. Unfortunately, Lawless is tedious through and
through. It's sequences go from bursts of heartless violence to
development-less talking. The problem is its atmosphere, which could
also be attributed to the choice of digital photography. It tries to be
gritty, with its music hinting back to one of my favourite western TV
shows, Deadwood, but the slick cinematography is just completely
lifeless. It just feels like nobody's heart was truly in it (besides
Guy Peace's menacing villain) with no chemistry between anyone. It was
a huge mistake to try and force some romance subplots in here. There's
nothing too bad about Lawless, besides its humourless and cold
approach, it's just disappointingly average given the talent. 6/10
