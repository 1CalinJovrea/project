True Art!

An absolutely magnificent work of art. I loved this film. If you are expecting a generic story arc with proper dialogue and love
story like most Hollywood films then yeah, you will be disappointed. If
you like Graphic Novels, Art House and B movies/Cult films you might
just love this film. All of the actors bring their A game. The costumes
and settings are perfect. I am so happy that I saw this movie, despite some of the cranky reviews
I had read. I really like it and think Miller and Rodriguez have made
an excellent film. And not sure if it was intentional but there are
some awesome moments that appear to be homage to other films, if you
are really paying attention.
