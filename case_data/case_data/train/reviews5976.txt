Jeepers Creepers 3, The Best Horror Film of 2017, so far!!!

The Best Jeepers Creepers film to date. Alright. I'm not going to spoil
nothing so go see the film October 4th again.. The film was a complete
homage to the first two Creepers films. Mostly, the first one. It was
way darker and had more kills than ever.. We even almost got close to
finding out the Creepers true origins that could be the secret to
killing him ( Hopefully, Not). All of the characters had a connection
to the Creeper that made it more interesting then the first one.The
acting in the film was decent. The film moved very fast and was an
excitement. And Gina Phillips cameo makes you really want to see
Jeepers Creepers 4. Just hopefully they bring Meg Foster back for Part
4 because she made the film for me, she was a riot and those eyes are
amazing! As a filmmaker of horror myself I condemn the history of
Salva. And have seen every film he has made and think he has more of a
vision then these crappy so-called filmmakers now. At lease it wasn't a
complete remake more like a Prequel/Sequel. I hope they make the fourth
film and keep it going until Part 12. If Nightmare on Elm Street and
Friday the 13th can have a hundred sequels and remakes they should do
it for the Jeepers Creepers franchise. Great Film.
