Deepthroating Silencers

I have seen a lot of movies in my life. I very rarely regret seeing
them. I wasted 94 minutes of my life watching spring breakers. This
movie did not have a plot. At first they were in college complaining
about being from a small town. All of a sudden they were in Florida
hanging out with some guy named alien, while he's deep throating gun
silencers. Selena Gomez goes home after like 30 minutes, and one girl
gets shot in the arm. Then, the two of the girls still hang out with
James Franco, and end up killing Gucci mane in the end. Anyone who gave
this movie a good review should has horrible taste in movies. How
anyone thought this movie was good eludes me. People were laughing in
the theater, and this wasn't supposed to be a comedy. See a good movie
instead, I wish I could have those 94 minutes of my life back. I
could've been bettering myself, running for president, or riding
unicorns, instead of watching Vanessa hudgens wear a pink ski mask and
shoot Gucci mane in the head
