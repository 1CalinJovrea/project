Entertaining film for the family  and nothing more

Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is the 'sequel' of Journey to the
Centre of Earth (starring Brendan Fraser). Actually, I really don't
know why they consider it a sequel because the story is completely
different  the only similarities are the author of the books in which
the films were based on (Jules Verne) and the character of Sean
Anderson that appears in both movies. I also found interesting that
many people didn't know it was related to the other movie.What we have here is a film that follows the same scheme of its
predecessor  a lot of CGI and 3D effects, amazing and colorful
scenarios, silly humor and nothing more. Journey 2 is a movie for all
ages - specially the kids - so don't expect violent sequences or sex
scenes with your favorite stars. The plot is traditional and there is obviously those parallel stories -
like the boy Sean(Josh Hutcherson) who falls in love with the charming
Khailani (Vanessa Hudgens) and his relationship with his mother's
boyfriend, Hank  played by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who shows us that
the 'tough guys' can also be funny, charismatic and do movies that they
don't have to kill a hundred people. So, are you thinking about taking your kids to the movies? Well, take
them to watch Journey 2: The Mysterious Island - they will be thrilled
by it.But, even if you don't have any kids, watch it. Who said that adults
have only to watch serious and artistic movies? Sometimes a little bit
of unpretentious fun is necessary in life - and this movie provides it
(at least for me it did).
