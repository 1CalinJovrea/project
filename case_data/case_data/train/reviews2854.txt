One of the worst sequels I've ever seen.

This film is a sequel to "Silent Hill" and, although the semi-open end
of the film allows to guess the sequel, I did not expect it to be any
better than the original. And I hit it. This movie is frankly worse
than the first one. It kept the impressive CGI that terrifyingly
frightened us in the first film, but is no longer able to make us jump
out of the chair. It simply lost that impact. It gets worse when the
story fails to obtain the indispensable credibility. It is simply
unbelievable and even goes against the first film. The poor script is
reinforced by a miserable and unhappy direction, both by Michael J.
Bassett. None of the actors in the movie lived up to expectations,
which only tells us how bad the director's performance was. This film
further proves that a good screenplay and a good director are essential
to the success of a movie, and that a good sequel should at least keep
part of the original film crew.
