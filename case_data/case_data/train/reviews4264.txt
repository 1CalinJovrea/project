worst movie!

Greater crap that I've never seen! How to be quoted by 7.8? Who Voted?
7.8 on IMDb and is rated 'The grate Beauty "and 8.3 "The Secret in
Their Eyes". Every 4-5 minutes can predict it will happen about 10
minutes. The same topic is the classic good girl bad boy but if they
want to be with a former boyfriend. The scene with the car in drive
power seemed a big mess and pulled hair. What could not stop two
minutes to power? Air monitoring phase is again silly, you can not fly
below 1,800 feet above populated areas, and that gave him guidance on
what street drive! Not worth writing on, the film deserves more than a
Razzie!
