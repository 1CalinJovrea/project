Excellent acting

I liked the movie but there are some gaps in the plot and the events
that doesn't make sense. it's such a coincidence that the doctor who
arrives in the hospital is surprisingly getting interested in one of
the patients and listens to her story. Later he discovers that this
woman is his mother. Acting and directing is excellent in the movie. Rooney Mara plays her
role very well like Vanessa Redgrave. I liked that the plot is twisted
and we don't know what actually happened till the end.Overall I liked the movie and it's worth to see for once.
