A Remake Unworthy of Association With The Original

I went into this film with the intention of keeping my mind clear and
open by judging this movie in and of itself instead of comparing it to
the original. That proved undoable. The main question I have is why did
they deem it necessary to remake this Korean film? Was it to bring it
to a wider American audience? If so they failed. Was it just to make a
few bucks? If so, they also failed miserably at that. I think the main
problem with this film was that it seemed to have no heart put into the
making of it. It looked cheaply made, the actors did not seem invested
in their roles and the severity of the circumstances seemed to have
little emotional effect on them. They slightly changed the plot in an
attempt to make it their own but it was nothing close to an
improvement. The action was awful especially the attempt at creating
the iconic hammer hallway fight scene. The big twist had little effect
on me since I already knew what was coming, but even then it lacked all
intensity. And talk about a terrible ending. About the only thing they
did well was Doucett's 20 years in confinement. Overall a horrible
disrespect to the original film. Not worth your time.
