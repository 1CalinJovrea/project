No magic here.

A good poster, and an effective trailer, make excellent marketing tools
for a truly awful movie.Anything good is in the trailer. The only scenes that are the slightest
bit interesting are on stage in the club. The rest of the time it's
actors spouting bad dialogue with little or nothing to do. Classic
lines like "Hey" and "Hey do you want to get something to eat?". They
walk and talk. They sit and talk. They drink and talk. They stare
toward the right or left or look at the ocean like it's supposed to
mean something.Some of the original music is interesting and fits. The film has a
golden tone appearance to the scenes outside of the club which becomes
distracting and adds nothing. There's a scene after the sorority fight scene that seems out of place
before the confrontation in the club. There is no reason to like the
thinly drawn characters, and even less reason to like the movie. It's
too long, often boring and feels like it is yet to be written. Steven
Soderbergh is tied for the most overrated director of this generation.Don't waste your time, money, or eyes on this one.
