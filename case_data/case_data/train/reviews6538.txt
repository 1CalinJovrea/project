And a mint for you.....

After a family tragedy, a boy named Jake follows a series of clues that
lead him to a mysterious orphanage on a remote Welsh island. There, he discovers a community of children with unusual abilities, and
learns he is destined to protect them......Burton has a distinct eye for his wonderfully steam punk/Gothic tastes
when it comes to making a film, so this should have been a match made
in heaven when this landed on his desk.But apart from the wonderfully odd characters that roam the world of
Burton, this falls flat, and sadly it fails miserably.Butterfield must think he has a curse on him because with Enders Game
and this, he's a franchise killer. It looks wonderful, but special
effects alone do not make a film, and why does O' Dowd have to have an
American accent? I haven't read the source material, but surely they
could have tweaked something somewhere.I was expecting something beyond the bizarre, harking back to the like
of Beetlejuice with a hint of Barker via Nightbreed, but instead I got
a mix of The Golden Compass and A Series Of Unfortunate Events: At
Blackpool Pleasure Beach.And because I'm so used to seeing Burton Regulars I couldn't help but
keep comparing Green to Bonham-Carter (even though she is wonderful),
and Depp in the Jackson role, because we all know by now, Burton brings
the best out in Depp.I will go back to it one day, I may change my opinion, but for now,
it's one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me.
