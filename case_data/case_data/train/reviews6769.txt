Cavemen to Hunter/Gatherers Now Makes Sense

I took my 3 yr old Grandson and he sat on the edge of his seat the
whole movie. We tried catching fire and flowers and once got hit in the
face by a bird. The 3d seems to be on a new level of excellence. I'm a
teacher and I totally now understand what scientists mean from cavemen
to hunterers/gatherers and I think it will help children see it too and
introduce them to tar pits, saber tooth tigers, earthquakes, and a lot
of science stuff. The story was great, the characters were realistic to
a family, and although sometimes the dad didn't get any respect, in the
end it was apparent his love for his family and theirs for him. I
highly recommend this to adults and children.
