Original Riveting. Sequel Ridiculous

The original "Now You See Me" was riveting; the sequel is ridiculous.
The original did a perfect job of blurring the line between magic as an
illusion and magic as supernatural. "2" in a futile attempt to top the
original, crosses the line into puerile preposterousness. "2" was in
fact so inane that I can't even summon the enthusiasm to write a review
panning it. I wasted over two hours watching this...I'm not wasting any
more time writing about it.
