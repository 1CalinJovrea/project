The Worst Movie Of 2013 (So Far)...

Without a doubt, "Grown Ups 2" is the worst movie I've seen this year.It's fascinatingly bad - the film starts and... just continues to be
starting. Every scene could be the beginning of the movie: there's no
movement, no action, no incident to propel the characters or start the
story. That, and there's absolutely no laughs. At one point, I thought the filmmakers were going for some kind of a
Robert Altman-style of picture, where the camera seems to be browsing
the scene, looking for interesting bits of human interaction. But no,
with Grown Ups 2, it was just craft laziness - stick someone in front
of the camera, make them say something to another character, make a
fart joke, on to the next bit. Story lines start, then stop in
virtually the same scene. It goes on like that for 90 minutes.
