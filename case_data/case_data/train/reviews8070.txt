Original cinema at it's best.

Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson caught my attention with their
excellent debut feature Resolution. Resolution was a film that played
heavily with the genre tropes yet I wouldn't necessarily call it a
horror movie. Spring is much like that. It's not a genre hybrid, it's a
movie that just forgets genres. It's unique. These filmmakers have a
vision and they're sticking with it. They want to show you something
new, something no one has ever put on screen. And it's beautiful. And
it's disgusting. This is why independent horror is a scene worthy following. This is why
I watch movies.
