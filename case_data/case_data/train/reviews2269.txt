Soooooooooo fake. Paints them as superheroes. Just, no.

I think that if you're going to make a movie like this then you need to
show all sides, the good and the bad. -Like Eazy and Dre's disrespectful, repugnant "black b*tches" comments
(No wonder Dre seemingly never had a problem with Eminem's infamous
"black b*tch" lyrics). -Like Dre's refusal to have anything to do with his black kids. You put
your white kids into private school while the black ones are stuck in
the ghetto. Doesn't the fakery just gnaw at you, Dre? As a black woman,
I have zero respect for you. -Like the abuses that women faced at the hands of Dre, that he only
apologized for when this hokey movie was about to come out. Aside from Ice Cube, a family man who doesn't deny his kids or
disrespect black women (at least not anymore), these are not the people
you want your kids to emulate. Watching this movie was painful because
even though I grew up to this music and used to have at least a modicum
of appreciation for it all, as an adult I see the damage that it's done
to an entire generation, and to watch these men painted as martyrs and
heroes and such literally turned my stomach. It's SO FAKE. You can see
through it even if you don't know anything about the real rappers. I'd
advise you all to do your research on these people. Dre especially does
not deserve respect or even a portion of your paycheck.So glad I waited until it played on HBO. I would never buy this junk.
