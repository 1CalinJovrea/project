What A Great Movie. Jack Black was Great.

Happy Halloween Guys. Today I'm going to review the "Goosebumps" movie
I saw yesterday. The Movie Stars Jack Black as R.L. Stine. The Movie is
about a boy named Zach and his mother move to Greendale, Maryland and
Zach and meets a girl named Hannah here father(Jack Black) tells him
that he can't ever see her again. Anyway He accidentally open the book
of the monsters of the books and now he needs to get them back. Anyway
the Real R.L Stine makes a cameo at the end of the movie as Hallway
Parker. Anyway I really liked this movie and it is a treat for the fans
of 90s Goosebumps show. Anyway I'm "Goosebumps" a 10 out 10 stars.
Anyway I'm RegularShow1 and HAPPY HALLOWEEN.
