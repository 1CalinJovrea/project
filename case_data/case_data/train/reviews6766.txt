pretty honest

good movie with obvious ideology loop stuff at the end, but still
pretty. kind of reset fears and phobias about animals. good act.
montage came with care. and yeah, - its about unity! 4shure. on today
social cinematography map of the world it looks descent. descent for
that genre and so on.
