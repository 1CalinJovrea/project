Boring, boring boring

SPOILER!I was optimistic before watching this, its been rated quite highly on
most sites, but after watching it i was disappointed. Firstly, i must say the filming of this was really good, everything was
set up great, but it lacked the follow up from the suspense the camera
angles and sounds created. The language used in this was sometimes
difficult to understand what was being said, as one point, the mother
was in the house after mourning her child who had just died, and i
literally could not understand a word she said for about 20 seconds. There's a goat 'Black Philip' and the twin children 'speak' to him. I
found this a little creepy, but didn't really make much sense - i mean
as to why the family had him, why they were talking to him, and why
they didn't tell anyone exactly what he was saying. Fast forward, and
it turns out the goat is the devil.... i thought this was really
strange, it made no real sense, along with the rest of the film!Overall this film is quite boring, and the story line doesn't make
sense at all. Things don't add up, or lead on properly, so when you
think of an outcome for a certain event, you can almost guarantee it
will not be that. There were some good elements to this film as i
mentioned, the filming of it; and there were a few jumpy bits, but
nothing that really scared me or questioned anything further. The only
question i had after i finished this film was 'What on earth was that
all about?' I had to look online to see what the story line even was,
and what key events meant within the film. It was a mega anti-climax. I
wouldn't waste my time watching this again!
