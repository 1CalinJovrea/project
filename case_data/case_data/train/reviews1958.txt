For the love of music.

I don't love movies that are about music bands. I always get bored of
all the scenes where a supposed artist is on stage singing a song to
the masses and everybody sings along as if it was a hit, but the song
is absolute rubbish. That in itself is enough for me to stop watching a
movie. Surprisingly enough, in this movie, they a did a pretty good job with
the songwriting. Some of the songs are quite enjoyable, and they make
the story a little more believable. But hold on! What story? A girl who
gets dumped by her emerging star boyfriend meets an exec guy from the
music industry who falls in love with her singing. And they both spend
the whole movie recording her songs around NY city to release an album
at the end. That's it....if anything else happened, please let me know.I normally take points away for the music, in this case I give points
for it. Without the music it would be a 4...
