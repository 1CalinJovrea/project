Brilliant

I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, it's my favorite
franchise, my life revolves around it and dinosaurs. I was very nervous
for Jurassic World, because it had been so so long since we've seen
them back on Isla Nublar (22 years to be exact). This made me go into
the film as a mainstream film fan, so I could really tell if this was a
good film or not, without being bias. I was amazed by how much this
film makes you feel like a kid again, it has the exact amount of
nostalgia to please the fans of the franchise and enough new material
to appeal to a younger audience who maybe haven't seen the first three
films.First of all, the cast which this film possess is used to great effect,
with the most notable being Chris Pratt, his character Owen Grady is
the perfect blend of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, making him likable and
very quirky in how he behaves around his Velociraptors and people in
general. Bryce Dallas Howard's character breaks the conventions of a
female character in a film of this genre, she takes control of
situations and you feel that she isn't a girl to run away from
danger...apart from running away from the Indominous Rex, which I don't
blame anyone for doing so. The supporting characters in the film also
help it to come alive and make you think this is a real park with real
lives at risk, especially Vincent D'Onfario in his role, he plays it
magnificently and you can feel his tension yourself and finally Nick
Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the kids in peril aren't as annoying as
Kelly in the lost world, so that's an improvement to take note for.When the first trailer for Jurassic World was released, way back at the
end of November 2014, people were starting to get very worried about
the effects in this film and how they will improve from the first film,
the same with the use of animatronics in this film. Well my friends and
fellow fans, the CGI in this film are brilliant to look at, even though
some scenes you can tell it is from a computer scene, the rest you
couldn't tell the difference, they used the animatronics in scenes
where they were necessary which has a lot of sentimental value for the
film which was a nice touch. Most people thought in this film the
Tyrannosaurus would play a minor role like it did in Jurassic Park 3,
but the way they utilize the old girl is brilliant, she is amazing to
look at and she even has the scars form the fight with the raptors from
the first film, you cannot make the T-Rex have a small role in this
film, especially when she's the poster girl for this magnificent
franchise. It will be hard to make Jurassic World 2 better than this
one, but here is to hoping!
