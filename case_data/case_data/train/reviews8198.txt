Gerne-bending, ground-breaking and an absolute classic

The thing about The Conjuring series is that it screams classic right
at the first few scenes and just works its way up from there. While The
Conjuring is definitely being remembered as one of the most excellent
horror movies in decades, its sequel does even a better job by
providing some extra well-done scenes that are not normally seen within
the gerne. But how about the scare part? Is it scary? Definitely yes. Don't bother
comparing it to the first one. Just enjoy the movie and you will find
yourself holding your breath until the very last moment. Vera Farmiga was superb. Her presence was so strong, and powerful that
she managed to pull the viewer through all kind of emotions. Patrick
Wilson was also wonderful indeed. There are some subtle little hints
about a sequel here and there in the movie. If those two continues to
star (and also with James Wan), there is no doubt that it would be
another masterpiece.
