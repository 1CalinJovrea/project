Romantic comedy, hilarious but also deeply poignant

This film depicts a couple's challenge in grappling with the cultural
differences of their Pakistani and white American families in this
portrayal of the protagonist's real-life relationship. Kumail Nanjiani
and Zoe Kazan are wonderful in their respective performances as the
couple that gradually weaves together an amazing story. Ray Romano and
Holly Hunter are equally splendid as the parents of the girlfriend. In
fact, there are no weak links in the cast.It's a film that goes from being a diverting portrayal of the life of a
stand-up comic to a romance story to an allegory on overcoming cultural
barriers in the United States. The tonal shifts might seem extreme at
first, but they gradually cement a powerful narrative that makes for a
lot of laughs but also becomes bittersweet and endearing without
resorting to a hint of sentimentality.The film takes on a new form when the girlfriend is beset with a severe
illness. From there, the comedy aspect gradually becomes something of a
supporting part to a deeper character study and exploration of family
and cultural pressures even in the face of unanticipated grave events.
You will laugh, you will be close to tears and you might engage in your
own introspection after watching this film. Brilliantly written and
beautifully acted, this one is from the heart. Recommended to the
highest degree.
