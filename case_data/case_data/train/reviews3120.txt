Skirmish of the planet of the apes.

Pierre Boulle the French novelist wrote Planet of the Apes (Originally
The Monkey Planet). A classic SF novel. In 1968 it was filmed and so
started the cinematic journey which leads to this. I watched Battle for
the Planet of the apes as a young man. I thought that this movie was
going to be along the same lines as that movie. After all, all of the
trailers pitch it as a war between the apes and man. I was really
looking forward to it. I liked the last two movies. They were not as
good as the original series but were still interesting SF movies in
their own right. Also, everything has been better than the Tim Burton
Planet of the apes.So I put on my 3d glasses and sat down in Wood Green London to watch
the war that would change the face of the planet. So there is a brief
skirmish. Then the head ape Corny (as the plot is) sets out to find
those responsible for doing wrong to him (yawn). Bring on the WAR I
thought. Then they ride around for a bit. Next, we get Escape from
Colditz, the great escape or Prison Break. I am still waiting for the
promised war. At that end, there is a battle. Not against the apes as
they are all escaping. Though unfortunately none of them get on a
motorcycle and try to jump over barriers.I walked out of the cinema and thought what a pile of dung.The 3d is pathetic. Really this is a movie that could have been good in
3d but wasn't. It is at least 40 minutes too long. Also, it is not the
movie they promised. There are no wars in it. It is littered with
mistakes. My favourite is the 350-pound gorilla on a horse. No, that
horse would have been dead.Lastly and this is my normal grump. Why did it not say it was based on
Planet of the apes by Pierre Boulle? No mention of him in this
shamefully bad movie.I really wanted to like this movie. What I got was a movie that
surpassed Burton's POTA's for the worst one in the series.
