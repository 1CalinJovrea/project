Major action scenes are inaccurate, among other distortions

The screen writers for this movie could not have bothered to use any
advice from the U.S. Military. In one scene, an Abrams main battle tank
is being used to breach the guard fence around the Whitehouse to allow
our heroes to escape. The bad guys fire a RPG-7 anti-tank round at the
front of the Abrams, where the thickest armor is located. The RPG-7
round blows up the Abrams. Really! During the invasion and taking down
of Iraq in 2003 by U.S. forces led by General Tommy Franks, one Abrams
got involved in a protracted firefight inside an Iraqi city with Iraqi
soldiers. The Abrams took 33 hits from RPG-7s. All external weapons and
equipment were blown off the hull. But the hull was never penetrated
and the main gun was never damaged. The Abrams and her crew kept
fighting until relieved. One hit from a RPG-7 will not hurt an Abrams
in any way, shape, or form.The bad guys decide to kill Air Force One while it is in flight
somewhere over the U.S. The bad guys over-ride ICBM launch command and
fire an ICBM at Air Force One. Of course, the ICBM connects with Air
Force One and destroys it. There's just one catch. There is no way in
this universe that an ICBM can be used to shoot down an aircraft. It
cannot be done, period.Then we have Jamie Fox's President character with a political agenda
that mirrors the political agenda of Barrack Obama. We all know that
Jamie Fox is a 110% supporter of Barrack Obama. But that support does
not belong in an entertainment movie. It is nothing but pure political
campaigning.
