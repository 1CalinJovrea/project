Fascinating

I enjoyed the first half of this.Took me a while to get past my annoyance at the lead character's smarm,
but the back story of how he'd changed and the twist with his cheating
girlfriend and buddy made it interesting. The old guy was good and
spooky, his menace growing, and the story looked like it could deliver
more than a padded out spoof horror-short.Then some idiot turned up in a beret and rambled on pointlessly in a
Peter Sellers voice, there were more funny voices, a perfunctory
investigation and conflict, and a postscript where everyone obviously
thought it was so absurd it had to be entertaining.Then I looked at the credits. Kevin Smith and Jonny Who? Fcuk me!
