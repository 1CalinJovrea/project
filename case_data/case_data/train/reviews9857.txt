what the F did I just watch

If I could have given this movie negative stars, I would have. This was
accidentally rented after my Mother tried to rent Horns, and mixed her
words, and came out with Tusk. We did not catch this until about an
hour into the movie, in which the man was mutilated and turned in to
nothing but an innocent walrus. Then, the movie had the audacity to end
as the man being left in a walrus cage, at a wildlife conservatory,
being fed a raw fish, by his love. Not only do the sounds of the human
thing still ring in my ears, but I am having a hard time looking at a
picture of any walrus, and I fear that I will never be able to look at
one again. I am truly mortified that I watched this film and I do not
understand how it was made. On the same note, it's going to be
fantastic recommending this total psychopathic movie to all of my
friends, and waiting to see their reactions. Thank you Kevin Smith for
ruining walruses. And any future zoo trips. I'm going to ask you kindly
to never create another animal movie while on drugs, especially about
giraffes.
