A must-avoid for all Underworld fans

I enjoy (good) vampire movies, dark movies, good screenplays, good
production, good screenplay, good cinematography and characters like
Selene. This means I really enjoyed the first three Underworld movies,
provided we ignore the prequel which was no more than acceptable.It also means that this movie ruined the franchise for me. Production
was poor and clearly quite low budget (reuse of the same footage on a
few occasions, etc.), the script was inadequate and, while Anna
Foerster has put in some credible performances in TV, this was quite
poor. Len Wiseman, or even MÃ¥rlind and Stein, could conceivably have
turned this into a movie worthy of the franchise.There is also a hole in the plot worthy of a B-grade horror. SPOILER ALERT. And here comes the spoiler: The very premise of the
movie is that Semira's coven is impregnable and Marius would be foolish
to attack it without the blood of Selene's daughter. The werewolves
specifically state that they "looked for any weaknesses and there are
none". Then, later on in the movie, with no such blood, the werewolves
walk in there like they own the place and it is clear that they would
have taken the coven has it not been for the arrival of a transformed
Selene with significant backup. The entire first 80% of the movie is
rendered superfluous in one scene. SPOILER ENDSAnd so the great Underworld franchise goes out with a whimper. Neither
Kate Beckinsale nor the character of Selene deserved this, some heads
should be hung in shame.
