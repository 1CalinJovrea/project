I didn't laugh.

OK,we're 75 minutes in, and I didn't laugh once. In my humble opinion a
movie that advertises itself as a comedy should as at least make you
giggle once every 20 minutes. I'm not going into the question if it's
feminist agenda movie or not, it's Just Plain Bad. It's a shame IMDb
doesn't allow a zero as a grade, otherwise I believe it's overall grade
would be so much worst.
