I was not expecting this... Brilliant addition to the MCU.

AntMan is a lesser know character of marvels but by no means does that
effect the quality of this movie. First off I thought that the casting
of this film wasn't going to work, that been Paul Rudd mainly, just
because I have read a few of the AntMan comics and didn't think it was
going to work, I was wrong he is brilliant, hilarious and believable,
all of the jokes he made actually made laugh out load which doesn't
happen much. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same
kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially
the story telling scenes were hilarious. This was a all round well cast
film.The action and CGI Was great, on first thoughts I thought when AntMan
shrinks down that the CGI would take you out of the movie but let me
tell you it doesn't, it's awesome! Especially seeing the world from
that size and scenes where AntMan is shrinking and enlarging when
fighting i thought would get a little too much but the honestly don't.All around I AntMan felt different to all the other MCU movies that
have come out, but a good different.    A well cast,directed and acted
film that will be a welcome addition to my marvel collection.
