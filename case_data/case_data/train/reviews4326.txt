Good follow-up to "La Grande Bellezza"

A lot should be expected of Paolo Sorrentino after "La Grande
Bellezza", and there is a lot here. In particular, I should mention
first the scenery and cinematography, and the music, all of which are
sublime.The dialogue is provocative, full of memorable lines and strong
emotions, so kudos to the writers. The subject matter was heavy, but
there is a fair share of lighter moments, and, in particular, irony.I would not think that the acting was at all improvised, with the
possible exception of some of the riffing the "screenwriters" working
with Harvey Keitel's character were doing. Still, strong performances
in particular from Keitel, Jane Fonda in a small role, the young
actress who plays the masseuse, and a dignified Michael Caine.Sorrentino continues to give homage to Fellini, which I love, while his
central characters (Caine in this one, Toni Servillo in LGB) work
through the kind of existential issues which Fellini tackled and which
Sorrentino, though he is not an old man, seems to be anticipating.
Nostalgia, regret, the sweetness and the bitterness that comes from the
awareness of the limitations of our short lives. The one thing that struck me as useless to the story--maybe I just
didn't get it--was the turn Paul Dano's character made for a couple of
scenes as...well, I shouldn't spoil it. It struck everyone in the
scenes as inappropriate, and I guess that was the point, but really,
why? For me, that takes it down to a 9 rating--still, a top-notch
effort.
