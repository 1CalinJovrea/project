Inventive and original horror

There aren't too many clown films but this ranks as one of the finest
in that subgenre. It has a really original and interesting take on
terror origin of the clown and makes it something entertainingly creepy
to watch. The storyline is well executed and follows the other trends
that make Eli Roth films great fun to watch as a horror fan. There's
plenty of gore and twisted violence, but it's always managed to be
incorporated into a context that adds rather than just distracts from
the plot in some way. There's enough films out there that offer nothing
but violence in place of a storyline, and this one manages to harness
violence in a very creepy and effective way towards the tone of the
film.As horror films go, this is one of the most memorable that I've seen in
a long, long time and as I write this I am unable to think of any other
recent horror titles that were as memorable as this, in terms of the
overall scare factor and anyone that manages to somehow find an
original take on anything in the horror genre deserves points.I saw this film about a month or so ago and as I've only just signed up
to IMDb felt that this should be one of my first recommendations as it
really has stayed with me and I've recommended it already to plenty of
people via word of mouth.If you hate clowns, this film will do bad things to you But if you love
horror then get all over this! It's amazing and since seeing it I've
been checking out other works from the director and am loving them.
