A HUGE letdown

How in the world is that rated so highly? This is nothing more than
manufactured Hollywood BS! The tension that everybody raved about
rarely happens. There are brief moments of tension, but nothing is
sustained. It all felt phony. Even when Phillips is captured, there
isn't much suspense. It's all done in routine fashion. After it was
over my initial reaction was "That's it?!" I felt severely cheated. For
a movie that's over two hours long, nothing really garnered my
interest. I'm a big fan of Hanks, but his performance isn't anything
special. As a matter of fact, he overacted. His final scene is
embarrassingly overacted. As much as I like Hanks, this isn't one of
his best performances. Barkhad Abdi is solid in his role. This movie left me feeling cold. Many will probably scratch their heads
reading this review. I just think it's more Hollywood drivel that
didn't live up to the hype5.3/10
