Missing Macbeth

I am baffled by the positive reviews this film has received. I have
seen many Macbeth adaptations and live on stage and this film portrays
none of the raw human emotion that makes the play great. Instead we are
subjected to a self congratulating aesthetic that might look visually
visceral, misses the point of the characters. Sorely disappointed with
Fassbender who usually has such depth was monotonous and dull. The
concept of a historically realistic setting was a good one, but the
execution left much to be desired. Shakespeare aficionados will notice
the alterations and cuts made to the text, which I can't help but
wonder the point of since the missing scenes would have aided the
character construction a lot. I'm fine with artistic license but why
remove the overtly pagan aspect yet retain the witches as true
characters rather than figments of Macbeths mind? There are so many
better versions of Macbeth out there, I don't see any value in this one
at all. In short, this Macbeth is well worth a miss.
