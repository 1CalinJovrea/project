Great acting but the movie is rubbish

I have no idea what movie the people who rated this highly were
watching. It certainly wasn't the one that me and a couple hundred
other people watched today. Every conversation I overheard walking out
was about how the acting was great but the movie was awful. There were
a few people whose conversations I didn't overhear because they left
the movie early.The acting, and in particular Cate Blanchett's, was outstanding and the
only reason my wife and I didn't join the others leaving early. Let me put this in perspective: I am a big fan of Woody Allen, but this
movie so was so awful that I was compelled to create an IMDb account
and express my displeasure.
