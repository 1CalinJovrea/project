Crappie

I don't usually write reviews on here, but I have to get this off my
chest. This is more of a warning than a review.I saw the high rating on IMDb and gave this movie a shot. The trailer
looked decent and reminded me of good action scenes in District 9. I
wanted to leave while watching the movie so many times. I kept waiting
for it to get better, but it never did... I had my hopes up when the
thugs were teaching Chappie how to stab people that he'd stab them, I'd
have a laugh, and we'd move on to some other characters and a better
movie! But I was let down on that one. The movie doesn't go anywhere.
You just hang out with the obnoxious Die Antwoord members the whole
time. Others have mentioned the movie being like Short Circuit and
Robocop, but the movie even adds a flare of Transcendence towards the
end -- Chappie figures out how to transfer consciousness to save his
maker, himself and even "mommy." Ninja keeps going on about a heist he
wants Chappie to help him with the whole movie. The heist was my ticket
price and 2 hours. I felt frustrated and let down after watching this
movie. I don't get how other people seem to like it? Must be Die
Antwoord fans. I wish I never saw the film.
