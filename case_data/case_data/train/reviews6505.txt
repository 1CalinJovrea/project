In shock

I don't want to come across as that typical book reader that expects
the book and the film to be the exact same. Adaptions, I understand,
are necessary at times. However, this movie was so unoriginal from the
book it felt uncomfortable watching it. I felt angry, disgusted and
humiliated. Mrs peregrine- although Ava green acted so well that is NOT
what Mrs peregrine behaved like in the book, think of her similar to
professor McGonagall. And Emma, where to begin? Again the Ella purnell
acted well but seriously? Emma and the rest of the peculiars did not
come to collect Jake because Mrs peregrine asked her to??? Emma ran
away from Jake, was very hostile and dragged him to the peculiar
kingdom for questioning. She then broke down when she heard the news of
her grandfather. None of that happened. And her power of air? Emma
wasn't as half short tempered as she was in the book. There are so many
things wrong with this movie it's hard to cover it all. I was very
offended at how the hollow gasts were portrayed and how comic Samuel L
Jackson played Barron. He was the wrong guy for the role. I was not
scared of the hollows in the film. They looked like weird out of shape
monsters..and the ending? No comment.
