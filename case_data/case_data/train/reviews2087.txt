Very good fantasy

Wow - very cool. A good retelling of an old story without any smarmy
adult jokes or insinuations, although I must say some moderately rough
visual moments. But nothing my 7 year old couldn't handle. Commoner
Hoult finds himself helping out princess Tomlinson on more than one
occasion, the most serious being when she's held or chased by giants.
Of all the actors McGregor charmed me the most in a calmly confident
role as head of the king's Guardians. Hoult and McGregor battle the
giants in the clouds and then engage in round two when the giants come
to earth. Tucci is good, as always, in this case playing the villain.
The special effects are well done but not overdone (as is so often the
case nowadays). The story is pretty much told straight, without a lot
of fluff, although the running time of about two hours was probably
more than it needed to be. Somewhat derivative but very enjoyable
nonetheless, it's recommended.
