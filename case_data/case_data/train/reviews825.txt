Hilarious, surprisingly heartfelt, and the most fun of 2013.

This is by far the funniest and most fun movie of the year; everyone
involved is as good as ever. Honestly, this is a movie made by fans,
for fans, and the entire theater loved it. I got to see this at a
Cornetto Trilogy marathon comprised of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz
leading up to the 10:00 PM premiere of the film, and EVERYONE had an
incredible time. Everyone. First thing's first: is a comedy, so is it funny? FROM START TO FINISH!
And, surprisingly, it's actually very heartfelt. The characters are
very likable (even if they're rude and belligerent, they have a good
side to them) and there is an argument between Simon Pegg and Nick
Frost towards the end that was actually very moving. This film never
sacrifices a character or plot point to make a joke, just like the
other films in this trilogy, and that in itself shows the care here. A
lot of movies are just mindless fun, but this is actually smart, and it
in turn makes it so much more fun.Edgar Wright's timing and ability to create terrific fight scenes are
as good as ever, and of course Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and all others
are just fantastic. And let me say something: these special effects are
stellar throughout and it only cost $20 million? Truly well-spent. I
just can't wait to see this again.And note: I am *not* comparing this to Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz
(which are my two favorite comedies of all time) because each entry in
the Cornetto Trilogy is so different and all of them are truly
exceptional. I will, however, compare it to everything else this year
and it's the second-best movie of the year behind Stoker.9.7/10, amazing, two thumbs up, far above average, etc.
