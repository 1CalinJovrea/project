Nothing but predictive programming.

Retinal eye scanning infants and talk of cloning dead people in order
to live forever. This movie is so obviously just a tool used for
transhumanist agenda predictive programming. I'm not a religious man
but I hate the way it deems religious people as childish and on the
flip side it bolsters the stereotype that all atheists are god hating.
Also is it just me or does the main character seem a little too
hipsterish and angsty to be a scientist. The character development is
good if they intended to make the main character look like a complete
asshole the guys girlfriend is horribly mutilated right before his eyes
and what two weeks later he's already screwing the only other female
character in the movie. The science is all wrong as well. Evolution
isn't something that can be replicated by the flip of a few genes in a
petri dish. The acting is okay but nothing special. The cinematography
is at least decent and the movie has some interesting ideas and
concepts going for it. But the characters are all contrived except for
the female scientist. I wish the movie would have been about her
striving to accomplish her scientific goals. But instead nearly the
entire movie is some hipster screwing his Latin girlfriend.
