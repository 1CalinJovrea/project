Entertaining movie with lots of suspense

'The Gift' is a psychological thriller in the true sense of the word.
It's all about psychology: at the end of the film, the lead characters
are completely different persons from who they seemed to be at the
beginning. The hero becomes the villain, and vice versa.Not many directors can pull this off in a believable way, but Joel
Edgerton does it perfectly. Every development is logical and the
screenplay is constructed in an extremely clever way. It centres on
Robyn, a housewife who slowly discovers that her husband not only hides
episodes from his past from her, but also is a very different sort of
person from the one she thought he was. The truth is slowly uncovered
because a person from the past turns up on their doorstep, and makes
Robyn question her husband's statements.There are no unnecessary sidelines, so the story stays focused and the
viewer is constantly challenged to reassess his view on what he sees
happening. Even at the very end, there is a nice twist to make the
viewer keep on questioning if what he thinks happened, really happened.
This is a very entertaining movie with lots of suspense.
