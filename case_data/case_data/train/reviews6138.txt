awful experience

I am one of the minority here who disliked the movie. Saw it yesterday
and I am still horrified whenever I remember it. Yes, the performances
were great and it was refreshing to see well known stars playing
characters that are against their usual type. But I don't understand
why the cruelty was necessary and what message could bring the audience
the violence against animals. Although this film is presented as
romantic, I didn't find any emotions apart from indifference and hatred
in the characters, or actually in the whole world and story. All in all
it's boring, too long, one does not understand why the people in the
story act the way they do or how does the world where coupling is
obligatory work. It's one of the movies I won't never EVER want to see
again.
