This had no real story. On the other hand I am a guy, not the target audience & the reason most women watch isn't for the plot

"It's not bro time, it's show time. Are you guys ready?" It's been
three year since Mike (Tatum) last danced. He runs a successful
business and is looking to make a great life for himself. When he hears
that the rest of the Kings of Tampa want to give up the life too they
all decide there is only one way to retire. The boys head to Myrtle
Beach for one last performance. First thing I have to say is that I am
a man, so this review is done from my point of view. I thought the
first movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but to me it was just
cheesy and actually pretty much what I expected. I do remember there
was enough comedy in it to keep me interested. This movie seemed to
play on the women will watch the hell out of this so it doesn't matter
what we do. As far as that thinking goes, it worked. My wife really
liked it, but I'm not sure if she liked the movie or just liked
watching the movie. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof,
either you want to see a movie about male strippers or you don't. Not
much else to say. Overall, not as good as the first one, mainly because
this one had no real story. On the other hand I am a guy, not the
target audience, and the only reason most women watch is not for the
plot. I give this a C.
