Very manipulative movie, has some inconsistencies, I liked the actors

I watched this movie with my girlfriend and we were able to sit through
it and enjoy the movie for what it was, but after we finished watching
we just burst out in discussion about a lot of missed opportunities and
strange inconsistencies in the film. The first thing that will grab
your attention is one scene where they are talking while he tinkers
with her car but puts his physics book down in the hood. You never see
him remove it, so your mind races to think "hey maybe she'll give it to
him later", but nope, never happens. On another note, it doesn't make
sense to show one character to be drinking and about to drive, then in
the very next scene have them go to the hospital due to an crash (drink
and drive) that isn't that character, it's confusing.The movie takes a misleading turn towards the end like they ripped your
heart out, and showed it to you while they drank the blood with a
straw. The ending was sad, but one thing at the end really left me
disappointed as it was going for a good ending (and it tugs you towards
this constantly), but no it slams your hand in the door on the way in.I really enjoyed the performances of Tuck, the younger Dawson, and
young Amanda. I really liked the way they went between time periods to
unravel the story, but just it really derailed once they stopped doing
that, and threw a curve ball right at your hip. I'd recommend it for
the good bits, but I warn you that the inconsistent bits and the ending
may feel very manipulative.
