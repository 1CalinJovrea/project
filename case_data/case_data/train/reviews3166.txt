Poor casting, lack of emotional depth

Why would Ridley Scott cast an Englishman, an Australian, an American
and an Irishman in the biblical story of the Exodus? Does the previous
line sounds like the start of a joke? Well unfortunately the joke is on
the audience with this visually stunning but shallow 3 hour flick.
While the performances were good, the casting was way off. I like
Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Sigorney Weaver but they are just
wrong for their roles and so was the Irishman within Ramses' group of
advisor's. I could not get past this miscasting (why not cast Middle
Eastern actors in these major roles?). Character development was almost
non existent and in the end I cared more for those being smited than
any of the main characters which came off as petulant war mongers
(including the child representing God to Moses). Perhaps that was
Ridley Scott's point. A disappointing ticket purchase from this
respected Director. Barely DVD fodder.
