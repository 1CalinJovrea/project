The force isn't with the writers

This is a prime example of a modern movie with stunning visuals but
lame writing ...not a bad way to kill a few hours whilst stuffing your
face with popcorn and playing with your phone but overhaul the story
had to many stupid moments that you'd have to be utterly mindless to
forgive.There's also nothing new here and the dark side are making the same
stupid mistakes they were making 30 years ago. It's almost like a
remake or homage to the original films.The two main good characters are awfully skilled in lightsaber fighting
and/or using the force considering they didn't even have a clue twenty
minutes earlier and had no training in either. The main bad guy despite
having training from the dark side appears average against the two
nobody's who suddenly have discovered their remarkable skill.Eye candy not brain candy. It's mindless fun but too mindless...more
brain dead...leaving the intelligent member's of the audience thinking,
what?
