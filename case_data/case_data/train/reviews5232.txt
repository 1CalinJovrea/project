A great experience!

I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since I saw the
preview. I was a big fan of the original story, and although I knew the
movie would be very different, I could see that this would end up being
one of my favorite movies. I was not disappointed.Ben Stiller is perfect as Walter Mitty. His performance was exactly
what I wanted. There was one scene in particular that seemed a little
out of place, but then again you have to remember that Walter Mitty has
a very active imagination. Ben Stiller's performance was so engaging, a
nice break from his usual slapstick roles (which I also love). If you
are hoping to see him doing one of his usual humorous roles, you will
be disappointed. If you want to see him capturing the emotions of a man
that has a hard time expressing himself, you will love this movie.The visuals in this film were particularly fantastic. From the New York
offices of LIFE all the way to Iceland. Every scene was perfectly
captured and just beautiful.Finally, the soundtrack. While I was definitely distracted by the
visuals and Ben Stiller's spot-on performance, the soundtrack deserves
a nod as well. Every song fit perfectly with the tone of the film.
There are a few scenes that stand out as particularly wonderful, and
I'm sure you'll know what I mean once you see the movie. This will
definitely be on my shelf once it is released.Really my only criticism is Adam Scott. While he is great at playing
the jerk boss, his beard is very distracting. It looks fake, as if they
pasted it onto his face. Other than that, I think the movie was pretty
much perfect and can be enjoyed by anyone looking to see a beautiful
movie about a man with a very active imagination.Enjoy!
