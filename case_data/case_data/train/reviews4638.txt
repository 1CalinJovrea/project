Good Action Thriller

Parker (Jason Statham) is a thief with codes to live by. He is left for
dead by his cohorts in crime when he refuses to join them for another
heist. He vows to go after them and get what is his. Seems that some big stars want to hitch their wagon to a profitable
venture such as any Jason Statham movie. Here we have Jennifer Lopez
doing that and when I first saw her name associated with this I knew
2-things: She would get a lot of screen time and many, many lines too.
Okay, 3-three things: this won't be as good as other Jason Statham
movies. I was in cringeville. And, then I watched the movie and was
wrong, wrong, wrong. She did good. Who knew?However, there was a difference with this movie. Most of the time Mr
Statham's character goes about his business cutting down the bad guys
without any real complication, but in here he meets his match with some
bad guys who kind of beat the hell out of him. He still wins, but it's
not easy. Some of the fight scenes were too real for me and I had to
check myself into the local ER to make sure all was okay. I am fine.
Thanks for asking. Add to the beatings, we have Leslie (Jennifer Lopez) getting in the way
of Parker's plan to take out the bad guys. Okay, we knew something like
this would happen and we cringed for a bit, but we were pleasantly
surprised that she did good. Who knew?All in all a good action thriller as we would expect from any Jason
Statham movie even with a star who hitched her wagon to a profitable
ventureÂ…..but did good. Who knew? Nick Nolte and Michael Chiklis also
star.Will we see other big stars hitch their wagon to other successful
ventures: Matt Damon, Bruce Willis, Arnold (hey, is he back?),
Sylvester? Time will tell. We can only hope the scripts will be as good
as this one was. Kudos. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, briefly, 2-times.. Language: Yes,
not much.
