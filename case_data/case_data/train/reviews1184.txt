High potential of the franchise utterly wasted

When I saw the first Hit-man movie, I thought it was quite a ridiculous
attempt at transforming a high success video game to big screen. And
then this came around. I mean, god damn, I gave it 4 out of 10 for
Rupert Friend alone, because I absolutely loved the guy in Homeland.
This movie is an insult to the source material. I mean I REALLY
wouldn't force the director, writer and/or main character actor to go
through even one of the games, but why, why on earth wouldn't they at
least have read the script? I mean, movie people do realize, that games
have scripts as well, don't they? In short words, instead of making
kind of a suspense thriller (genre to which hit-man games could be
compared) about a genetically modified assassin made in an insane
attempt at cloning people in an insane *pun intended* asylum in
Romania, they made a mediocre, at best, action flick with so bad
writing that even decent actors can't help it.Also, to the producers, next time you want a heavy cgi'd movie, make
it's budget bigger OR try to minimize the CGI. Like, one of the two.
Because this movie here is something that seems like it tried to rip
off one of the newer James Bond flicks but it fell short like, well, a
cheap rip-off.It was quite unnerving, seeing Friend play in this, I hope he at least
made a decent coin out of it, because it's not gonna be a bright point
in his resume.
