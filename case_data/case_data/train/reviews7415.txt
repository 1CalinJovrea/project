Or Â– A new take on Jack and the beanstalk. "Jack the giant slayer"
takes a classic tale and breaths new life into it. So many try and fail
at this, but this flick moderately succeeds. Despite a troubled
production.Film sees Jack. A young farmers son, sell his horse for some magic
beans, which end up growing into a massive beanstalk. This beanstalk
leads too a legendary land in the clouds, where the promised giants off
the title roam. Sounds familiar? That's because it is. But its been
delved into further, with more characters, some extra imagination, and
many action set pieces thrown in, to make it a damn good feature length
family movie.Its not perfect. For everyone loving the fact its action packed, there
will be those who find it seriously over heavy on the cartoony CGI.
There are some cheesy moments, and some bad gags. But these are not
overwhelming, in a film that is over all good fun.
