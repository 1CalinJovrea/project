Very sad comedy

For a comedy, it was a very sad experience.To begin with, it is sad to see that Kate Upton is about to explode in
size, she is getting too fat, so much so, she was never seen in a
bikini. I guess her next role will be in the next remake of Moby Dick
or Free Willy.And to make things worse, I did not even smile once during this wreck
of a film. In fact, I felt embarrassed and somewhat despondent. Is this
what people think is a comedy, nowadays.There is nothing here.
