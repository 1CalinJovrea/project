Funny, bloody and nice

I was intrigued by this movie because its concept is different from the
slasher films that we're used to watch. Here, the teenagers are not the
victims, they're the killers. The Babysitter is full of good jokes,
gives to us some bloody kills, there are a bunch of references to the
pop culture and tries to twist some clich√©s, ending up on a fresh and
different work.It's a nice film, the producers are not afraid to show violence
(sometimes they create some humor around the deaths), it's a love
letter to the 80s horror films. However has a problem, the trailer
spoiled the full movie, I knew who was going to die and that destroyed
my experience a little. Btw, it's not a negative critic, the soundtrack
is okay, but I would prefer to hear more typical 80s music because that
could improve the 80s slasher vibe.Fresh, violent but also funny, The Babysitter is a love letter to the
slasher genre. Avoid the trailer, turn off your brain and enjoy this
nice experience.Rating: 7/10
