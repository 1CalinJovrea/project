It wasn't that bad, I thought it was hilarious!

I do not see why there are so many people who hate on this movie, It is
what it is, Its a comedy movie. In my opinion Sandler is going back to
his comedic roots... I mean you cant tell me when he was on SNL and in
some of his earlier movies he didn't act stupid, Maybe some of you
reviewers are just getting old and don't know comedy anymore when you
see it. See people need to stop critiquing a comedy like this based as
though it was a movie in another genre. But thats just my opinion, If
your looking for something funny I recommend seeing this. But you might
need to be a specific age group, 12-36, I guess Sandler is tired of
trying to make all you "old fools" laugh. Also Andy Samberg was great
along with Will Forte and Nick Swardson, even though he only had like 4
lines.
