great movie

i can tell that the gun lobby is also active on IMDb. this movie is
straight told with unexpected moves. it is realistic as well as true.
but in a world of alternative facts difficult to accept. it goes on too
long far too long.. it has to stop here and today. the connection with
the gun lobby and the senate is authentic. the characters are real.
what i liked most of all was the fact that everyone is selling out
anyone except the call-boy. in this world of business and in the world
of politics , the decent one is the one who sells his body. while
everybody would kill for their ego or for wealth.. he remains sincere
and surreal . the whore is the only person with ethics and value is
messed up world is quite a message, although it had little to do with
the main story... again i feel disgusted by the reviews who have
nothing to do with the movie but a lot with their political views...
the reviews prove this movie is true!
