Another Swing and a Miss In Female Comedy

I had a Rough Night seeing this film (Ba-dum, tsh!).It's a comedy but all of the jokes and gags I remember from it are ones
that are well past their due date. Toilet humor, creepy swinger couple,
STD jokes, bad fake accents, and the dumb selfish best friend that
ruins the main character's life and acts like a hypocrite just to name
a few. There's also much pop culture riddled throughout the film which
will likely already date this film within the next couple years or so,
such as when the film tries to make a jab at president Donald Trump by
having a fictional political candidate who gets praise for posting dick
pics to Twitter.Scarlet Johansen is the highlight of this film, which is faint praise
considering what I think of her performances in Ghost in the Shell,
Lucy, and Sing, and the character's friends are almost entirely
intolerable and if this were reality she would be best off without
them, but of course this movie has to be about how friends are the most
important thing in the world even when they're self-centered alcoholics
who literally get off with manslaughter. It's a minimum-effort dark
comedy which fails to do both at the same time, which is quite
important to do as the two tones literally clash with each other and
the movie has to backpedal to try to remind you it's a comedy.YouTube comedy musician Bo Burnham also makes a minor appearance in
this film, and he ends up being both more funny and charismatic than
the actual male lead in the film despite his limited acting experience.There is very little in terms of plot in this film. It's Weekend at
Bernie's with women instead of men. The movie ends with the clich√© sort
of happily ever after type ending, confirming the characters are all
terrible people and having them gloat in being rewarded for it.This feels like a product made by machines and algorithms rather than
actual human beings, and just perpetuates the stereotype that women are
unfunny.
