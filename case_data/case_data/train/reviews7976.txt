Not what I was expecting.

When you see the trailer of this movie, I am pretty sure you are
expecting a decent horror movie. But it is not. Oculus is a weird
movie.You will never know who is that woman in the mirror, because the movie
will never tells you about her. You won't know why the mirror has
killed those 45 peoples. You will not get that point. The movie is like
a sequel of another one.It is supposed to be a horror movie but being honest, it is not. I did
not get scared in anytime, it even bored me sometimes. It is too slow.Acting was fine, that is why I gave it a 3/10. So if you are looking
for a decent horror film, skip this one. I'd vote for a sequel to know
more about that mysterious mirror, because I actually don't know
anything about it.
