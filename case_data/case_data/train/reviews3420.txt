The story keeps a pace until they decide to kill it.

The movie takes a direction for a happy ending, somehow they decided to
change everything at the end with a new drama taken out of a hat. don't
waste your time, not a good movie.There were a thousand possible outcomes for the story, with twists and
changes, instead they opted for the saddest possible story which seems
pushed and not in sync with the first 80 minutes of movie.The acting was so-so and they seem to fill a lot of time with
information not important to the ending, they could have used that time
to support their sad ending by relating the audience to the story
behind the kid
