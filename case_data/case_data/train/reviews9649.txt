Good So Far As It Goes But Doesn't Go Far Enough

Must-see?--shouldn't that mean it's relatable? This coming-of-age tale
is well acted and well written but its core is applicable to no one
I've ever known in my life, so I had the feeling of watching an alien
species: the sort-of-caring but ultimately disengaged and self-
destructive mother, her sexually desperate daughter, the moron/predator
boyfriend of both. After appalling adventures and misadventures, the
boyfriend is bounced and mom and daughter forgive one another just like
that. I'm always suspicious of movies (like this one, like Dancing at
Lughnasa and Mermaids) that end with women who have seen and done
terrible things to each other end of joyously dancing to ecstatic
music: it's the filmmaker's cop-out instead of a real resolution. The
ex-husband is played by Christopher Meloni, whom I've seen only in
Special Vic Unit and never cared for. Still, he's paid his dues and
he's insulted here with nearly zero screen time in an essentially
meaningless role. Too bad.
