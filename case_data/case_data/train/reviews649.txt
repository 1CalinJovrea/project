Appalling on so many fronts

Fair warning, this review contains spoilers, don't read it at all if
you want to see this piece of trash movie.My goodness. This is the most disturbing film I've seen in so long,
perhaps ever. But first, the general comments outside of the disturbing
part. This film is about a man (Chris Pratt) on an intergalactic
journey on a ship with 5000 passengers and almost 300 crew who, due to
a malfunction in his hibernation pod wakes up 90 years before his
destination, all alone. It's about the problems he encounters and how
he solves them.That premise could make for an interesting movie in someone else's
hands, but in writer Jon Spaihts version, it's one gapingly huge deus
ex machina after another of impossible and unexplainable events, from
medical to gravity/science to even the hospitality industry. You might
expect a few of those, and if the story in general holds up, those can
be overlooked, but, the story in general doesn't hold up and isn't
believable. In fact, the science is so poor that I'd say this is a
movie set in space rather than a science fiction movie--there's been no
attempt to create any kind of cohesive scientific setting or
environment. Now for the big spoiler. The main problem I have with this movie is it
takes a hugely immoral, rape-y act and makes it the basis for a love
story. Also, general sexism up the wazoo.Journalist Aurora (Get it? is the Sleeping Beauty reference beating you
over the head enough?--If not, her last name is Lane, as in Lois Lane.)
is another passenger asleep in her own hibernation pod, and Jim
discovers her while wondering around alone. At some point, just after a
year in, he makes the decision to wake her up so he can have company,
even though he is condemning her to a life with just him and no one
else and ruining whatever dreams she had of her new life on the new
colony. This isn't spur of the moment. It's premeditated. He doesn't
wake her up because she has special skills that can help him and the
other passengers survive, he wakes her up because she's hot, and he's
fallen a little in lust with her. He doesn't tell her he woke her up,
and lets her think that her pod, too, malfunctioned.In fact, when Aurora does find out, after they've had repeated hot sex
and he's about to give her a ring, she tells him he's murdered her. The story of the big pseudo-sciency-sort of problems they solve and how
it brings them back together is rendered obscene by his taking away her
life, her destiny, her choices. Jim's not a hero. In fact, the casting
of sweet pretty boy Pratt instead of whoever today's Crispin Glover
equivalent is makes it even worse.Even the overslick lucite cool monochromatic palette shiny black
production says bachelor dudes. And Aurora? Aurora's dream, which Jim dashed forever, is mentioned and
then killed, too. Her dream was to travel millions of light years away,
stay on the new planet of Homestead II for one year, then go back to
her home in New York about 450 years in the future and write about her
year on the planet, because "no one has ever gone to the colonies and
come back before." It seems like someone with that kind of panache would have enough going
for her, but nope, apparently not. Partway through the film, we see her
looking at video from her going away party, where her best friend tells
her "I hope you find someone who fills your heart and I hope you let
him in." The film ends with a sickly voice-over proclaiming "Jim and I
live our accidental happiness. We are all passengers Â— we go where life
takes us".I'm sorry I saw this movie. What a trash heap.
