The Worst Dregs of  Hollywood

The Plot Five best friends from college reunite 10 years later for a
wild bachelorette weekend in Miami. Their hard partying takes a hilariously dark turn when they
accidentally kill a male stripper. Amidst the craziness of trying to
cover it up, they're ultimately brought closer together when it matters
most.First of all, this is a thinly veiled retake of Bad Things without the
humor. In it's place is a silly politically correct story complete with
activists, leftie politicians, lesbians, inter-racial couples and their
mulatto kids and you name it. It's a pandering piece of garbage.Poorly written, poorly directed, and even more poorly acted. The story
is so poorly realized they actually have to explain some of the jokes
(champagne at the airport). Others are just left hanging with nary a
laff.Plus, the story makes no sense. A woman running for office isn't going
to go off for a wild weekend party. It's so stupid it defies logic.See this garbage at your own peril.
