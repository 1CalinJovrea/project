Underwhelming

I saw this movie with a bunch of my college friends (we are all in
college). They all loved it. And I will say that Johnny Depp and Joel
Edgerton were fantastic in this movie, however, the movie lacked the
qualities of a great mob movie. I have always been fascinated by the
mob genre. I have watched the sopranos, goodfellas, donnie brasco, the
godfather, and basically all mob movies under the sun. I feel like
Johnny Depp and Edgerton are great at portraying their characters, but
I feel like no other character was developed at all. Benedict
Cumberbatch is one of the great actors of today, but Cooper just wasted
his talents on a weak supporting role.I was also looking forward to see the inner workings of how Whitey
Bulger came to power. I understand that he was a silent, cold-blooded
mobster that used the FBI to become to be one of the most influential
criminals in Boston. However, other then a few choking scenes and
murder scenes, I would have liked Cooper to show more of the specifics
of Bulger's rise to power. Also, we rarely see Bulger interacting in
the everyday mob-life, but we always see how he handles unique,
problematic situations all-the time. I would have liked to have seen
one normal day in Whitey Bulger's life given the movie was only was 2
hours long. Overall, a decent movie with great acting by Depp and Edgerton, but
lacking on some of the finer details of a classic mob movie. P.S. I could not take Ben Wyatt serious in that mustache.
