Greetings from Lithuania."Burnt" (2015) is another very solid movie in so called "food movies"
like "Chef" (2014) - there aren't many of them, both loved them both.
They are very different actually. That said "Burnt" isn't just about
the creating of food, it is a about a very flawed character, who tries
to put together his life back on track as well as receiving a 3rd
Michelin star - which would make him a "Yoda" of chefs as one character
puts it."Burnt" is very well paced, and although it's editing might distract
someone (very quick cuts a la Michael Bay style), it fits very well
into showing what is happening in the kitchen while you are waiting for
your order. It's very nicely acted, especially by Sienna Miller who is
becoming one of hardest to recognize people in movies these days - she
is always looks and sounds different - she might pick up Oscar
nomination one day (not for this movie though).Overall, "Burnt" is very good movie, and it has lots of action... in
the kitchen. If you like these kind of movies, you will probably enjoy
this picture as well.
