A short review of "Underworld: Blood Wars" (2016)

I'm not sure what to say about "Underworld: Blood Wars" (2016). It
really differs little from the previous "Underworld" movies. If you've
seen those, you've kinda seen this one.The vampires look like underwear models, or maybe a goths-only high
school drama club. The werewolves look  not homeless, exactly, but
like burly, long-haired, unemployed grunge rockers. Both groups speak
portentously and repeatedly about things like "LINEAGE" and "BLOOD
LINES" and "THE WAR" and "AMELIA." (Who was Amelia again?) There are
the requisite betrayals and forbidden inter-species romances. The
entire thing felt like a feature-length music video.Maybe I'm being too harsh. I would actually give this film a 5 out of
10 for at least bringing some good things to the table. Kate Beckinsale
is a good actress, and she brings the same magnetism that she always
does to Selene, the franchise's protagonist. Charles Dance is always
superb, and is always fun to watch. (There are at least two "Game of
Thrones" alumni here  one is Dance as a vampire elder, and the other
is Tobias Menzies as the leader of the "Lycans.") The nicest surprise,
though, was seeing Lara Pulver as an ambitious vampire alpha female 
fans of "Sherlock" (2010  2017) will recognize her as that series'
incarnation of Irene Adler. She's a great actress, and she seems to
relish this kind of role.All in all, though, I can't say I actually recommend this.
