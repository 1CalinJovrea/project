great,great movie

I watched this movie and i think this is one of the greatest movies for
all the times. The story,the playing of the actors,the
cinematography,the music-all was perfect(except the killing of the one
of the main positive heroes). In the movie Izabella said to Megatron
(they were on Earth):"Go to the hell!" and Megatron answered:"This
planet is the hell." When i read some of the comments about this
movie,that were full of hate and anger,i began to think that Megatron
was right(but there were also positive comments and i am happy for
that). I want to thank to the director,the actors,the writers,the
cinematographer,the composer and all the crew for the
wonderful,splendid experience and i wish them to make in the future
many movies of such quality.
