Tedious

After reading reviews on this site my husband and I decided to see it
instead of one of the heavier more depressing movies currently playing
at the local cineplex. Our granddaughter was having a party with kids
and parents and since we don't live in the same town but were visiting
for the week end, we decided to make ourselves scarce. This movie
seemed like it might be amusing and somewhat entertaining. It wasn't!
It wasn't funny at all. We are movie buffs and rarely walk out of any
movie but had we had somewhere else to go, we would eagerly departed
after the first 30 minutes. We kept waiting for it to take off but
right to the last minute there was simply nothing. To be completely
honest, don't waste your time - even on DVD or streaming!
