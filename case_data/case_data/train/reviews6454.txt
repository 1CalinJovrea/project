One word .... nauseating

I cannot believe that this tripe has 8.5. I was unfortunate enough to
accompany two 15 year old girls with my friend and was shocked that
girls that age want to waste their time sobbing uncontrollably on a
Friday evening when there is a whole world out there waiting for them.The acting .... Oh my gosh .... The worst I've ever seen. Gus was
unbearable, smug and frankly creepy. And as for her mother -
patronizing is an understatement! I just struggled to watch them all
make fools of themselves in this silly, ridiculous film.What rubbish are we feeding our teens? We had to point out to my
friend's daughter who thought Gus was such a catch that life just isn't
like this. During the movie one girl clattered noisily out the cinema
strangled by sobs and the row in front of us shook with heart-wrenching
wails as my friend and I shook with laughter.Get real kids. Don't waste your time watching this trite pap, get out
into the sunshine and LIVE or at least watch a decent movie with a
believable storyline and great acting, something that will resonate or
affect you deeply ...... Because this certainly isn't worthy of
anybody's valuable time.
