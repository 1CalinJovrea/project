Disappointment

Fantastic beasts and where you find them. WellÂ… Not somewhere
interesting. In fact, some place that is pretty scattered and
incoherent, and very much boring.What is this film actually about: a. A story of a muggle who happens to
get a glimpse of a magic world? b. Of a journalist who tries to
preserve the variety of magic animals? c. An auror, who lost her job
and tries to claw her way back? d. An unhappy kid who possesses the
most destructive powers? e. "The bad guy" with a very sinister, however
just as much unclear agenda, in the face of Johnny Depp who makes a 30
second jaw-dropping appearance as a blond?This film has no story, no core. You know, where you can trace a
dramatic structure: some kind of problem, rise, climax and ultimately
some kind of solution. I, as HUGE fan of JK Rowling, am very disappointed to have witnessed
this cinematographic cacophony. Not even Eddy Redmayne or IMAX
experience could save it for me.
