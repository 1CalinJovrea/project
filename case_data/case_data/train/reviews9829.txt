Emotionally-charged, Impressive Action, Garnished with "dirty politics", nice acting and direction

The basic plot of "The Foreigner " revolves around an Asian businessman
(Jackie Chan) with a hidden past whose life gets turned upside-down
when his teenage daughter is killed in a politically-motivated act of
terrorism. His search for the elusive killers leads him to a British /
Irish government official (Pierce Brosnan), whose own "muddy" past
holds clues to the killers and their motives.Jackie Chan gives the best performance of his career. He has finally
managed to prove the fact that he is totally capable of giving an
emotionally-charged performance, when given the opportunity of doing
so. Of course, he will impress the action fans once again in this
movie(Don't worry, there's enough of his cool martial arts and stunts).Pierce Brosnan delights everyone once again, with his well-acted
complex role. He definitely proves that he is one of the most versatile
and genuine performers from his generation of actors.The direction is very impressive. The director of "The Foreigner"
really knows and displays the true meaning and atmosphere of the word
"thriller". I would love to become a story-screenplay writer for
movies. Employers can contact me at svhot34@gmail.com
