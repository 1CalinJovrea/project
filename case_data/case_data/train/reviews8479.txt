Wow what a shame

Wow what a disappointment !! I personally loved the books ,i saw the
back story behind all the sex of a broken man finding and learning to
love really beautiful. The movie , well there are so many things wrong
with it starting with the cinematography ,it's just all too perfect
Hollywood and not enough rawness and realness to it and i hate it .Next
is the cast i mean i love Jamie Dornan and Dakota is OK but they were
so not right for this movie!No chemistry or heat between them and very
wooden analytical acting.Jamie Dornan in The Fall was awesome by the
way i am not a hater.Other cast also was wrong from Elana to Mia and so
on.The movie also seems very rushed ,I know it is an adaptation of the
book but not done smoothly in my opinion , It makes me really sad as
these movies could have been great if only they had gotten it right
,Take a page out of "Nick Cassavetes" book because he directed The
Notebook perfectly.
