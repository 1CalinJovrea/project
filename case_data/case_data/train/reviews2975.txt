7
Pretty decent sci-fi flick

So..yes, this isn't the best sci-fi movie in existence, but I don't
think it's half as bad as everyone is saying. Let's start by the
visuals. The visuals are AMAZING and are what makes this movie worth
seeing on the big screen. The universe the brothers created is
huge,which gives room for a lot of breath-taking scenes. This however,
is one of the drawbacks of the film. The fact that the universe is so
big and that it is a 2 hour film, makes the story a little sloppy.
There are a lot of things left unexplained which is a pity,and too much
time filled with love scenes. Moreover,the characters are either good
or bad, there's not much depth to them. Despite all this, the movie is
good, I decided on 7 instead of 6.5 mainly because of the visuals. You
need to consider this movie as a sci-fi flick, taking into account that
you don't see many original sci-fi movies around,and that the plot
isn't that bad,it's just not mind blowing, I'd encourage you to see it
for yourself, grab some popcorn and enjoy the movie for what it is.
