Not for the intelligent viewer

This is one of those movies where the grown up audience knows after 5
minutes, that the target group is teenagers. Even in the middle of the
movie's major crisis, the whole world pauses, as two young characters
have to talk intimately, because it is just so important, for she's hot
and he's so cute, so the less important end of our civilization will
just have to wait.Unlike many famous sci-fi movies, this movie is not true to science at
all. If some young script writer thought that it would be "dope" for
gravity to be "defeatable", then gravity is "defeatable", whatever that
means. Small objects that are hidden can be monitored in detail by the
good guys, while objects the size of a continent are completely
undetectable. There are dozens of these examples where the movie makes
no sense.The humor in this movie has no finesse. Watching it is like being at
dinner with the distant uncle who is not funny but keeps cracking
jokes, though no one is really laughing but him.Most of the time, the dialogues sound like a wacky parody, in the way
Doc spoke with Martin in Back to the Future. They even copied the Doc
character so directly, that there is an actual long haired, wacky old
man in a lab coat talking in a nutty way while experimenting with
sci-fi technology.One thing does work, though, the computer graphics are impressive. Most
of the time, the visual and audio effects really shine. It is just sad
that an obviously huge gift budget was spent fully on the wrapping, and
very, very little was spent on the gift inside.
