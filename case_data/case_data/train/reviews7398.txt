Who would have thought a Danish Art House film could be so thoroughly gripping?

'The Hunt' is a truly accomplished film, its simple premise and themes
are executed perfectly. The film is hugely engrossing and completely
and utterly infuriating, which is a testament to the merits of its
acting, direction, script and hyper-realism.The film follows Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a lonely primary school
teacher who relishes his job and is popular with both the children and
the local community. Just as he meets Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport) and
begins a relationship with her, his relationship with another woman,
5-year-old Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), lands him in immeasurable
trouble. What happens is a completely innocuous misunderstanding, but
the community, the 'adults' who are supposed to be rational and fair,
turn into a lynch mob.The film is about the danger of mass-hysteria, ignorance and
subsequently the frightening power of numbers. It teaches the
importance of measure and consideration; it's a much needed anecdote to
the sensational vilification, general ignorance and trashy media that
permeates our lives.It's the scare-mongering, amoral tabloids that help in empowering the
dangerously ignorant lynch-mobs that arise whenever someone screams
'paedophile!' or 'woman beater!' These lynch-mobs normally consist of
pugnacious, dreadful people who enjoy drama and violence rather than
actually care about their cause. The film is intelligently and thoughtfully written. The girl is by no
means vindictive; as much as you want to vent your anger, she's clearly
far too young to understand what is happening. It's the 'adults' who
display their stupidity, their total lack of reasoning and fairness
left me indignant for the entirety of the running time and subsequently
the whole evening Â– the film really works.There is a palpable sense of danger throughout the film, you genuinely
fear for Lucas' life; seldom have I empathised with a character so
dearly. Who would've thought a Danish Art House film could be so
thoroughly gripping?'The Hunt' is a thought provoking, tactful and important film that
should be seen by as many people as possible. It's one of the best
films of 2012.www.hawkensian.com
