The Brooklyn Hearts Club

As incredibly simple this movie was, I am puzzled on what I just saw.
Maybe the reason is: why the hell did this get noticed at the Oscars?Every year, the Oscar Best Picture nomination list not only snubs great
films, but it leaves open slots that could've been filled with some of
the greats. (This year, only eight were nominated, when two more easily
could've been found amongst some incredible works.) Additionally, I
always see at least one or two WTF choices in which I thought were
enormously below average or down right terrible.Mercifully, this isn't terrible, but it does fit the WTF category. It's
justthere. Nothing special about this. Sure, I believed the actors,
believed they lived in both Brooklyn, New York and Ireland in the 50s.
But, there wasn't much substance or depth I haven't seen on a PBS or
lifetime movie back in the 90s. Ellis dreams of leaving her family and life in Ireland to make anew in
New York. Slowly  and I use that term very lightly, she does, but then
tragedy strikes and she has to choose between the countries.That's it. That's two hours of Ellis longing for both while blatantly
leading everyone on around her. She's not mean about it  heck, she'd
have to show some personality trait, that I never saw, to add some zest
to this project. But, the truth is: she's the Bella Swan of the 1950s.
She just looks longingly everywhere, forgets to smile and men just
stumble over backwards to court her.There are movies for everyone. Maybe if you'd like to spend two hours
watching an Irish immigrant making decisions, people gossiping around
her and no real payoff, by all means: visit Brooklyn. But, at least,
even though it has no shot at all at winning any Oscars, it might be
for some older folk to marvel at as they remember the 1950's Brooklyn
Irish craze.
