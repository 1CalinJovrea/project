GREAT MOVIE ..  Please Read.And PLEASE WATCH!

This Is Def An Excellent Movie , Considering That All The People Who
Are Writing Reviews Are People Of Non Color They Really Don't
Understand The Humor And How Us African Americans Act And Engage With
Each Other.... It's Super Hilarious And It's Def A Film Where You Think
About Doing These Type Of Things With Your Friends! The Movie Doesn't
Drag And The Acting Was Amazing And RELATABLE.... Every Scene You Will
See A Bit Of Your Friends In Each One Of The Characters. I HIGHLY
RECOMMEND This Movie And If You Are A Person That's Not Seeing This As
An Action Packed , Comedy , Loving , Emotional Movie Well You Might
Want To Re-Evaulate Your Life. Literally This Is The Greatest Movie For
African American Women Culture More So The Group Of Friends Who Go
Separate Ways And Come Back Together. I Was Glad To See 4 Amazing Black
Women Instead Of The Typical "White".
