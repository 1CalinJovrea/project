"The Nice Guys" had pretensions to be a slapstick-style film like
"Naked Gun." Unfortunately, it fell flat with a convoluted plot, weak
laugh lines, and poor chemistry among the actors.Films like "Naked Gun" or "Airport" can be great fun, as they build
farcical scenes around star actors playing inept cops, pilots, and
criminals. But Russell Crowe and Ryan Gossling failed to meet the
threshold of performing in the broad comic style. Their characters, who
were two incompetent L.A. private eyes, were far too understated. They
needed coaching in the broader style of acting.The scripting of "The Nice Guys" also foundered on poorly delineated
secondary roles, such as that of Kim Basinger, who plays the "heavy" as
the corrupt official from the Justice Department. Her scenes brought
the film down to an even lower depth of dullness.The filmmakers should have started their work by simply taking the time
to view the "Naked Gun" series and to study how Zucker, Abrahams, and
Zucker found the ability to put together a decent film farce.
