Rubbish

I've only ever liked a very small number of films by M Night. And this
one won't be joining that short list. It was a waste of my time and
money. Slow, boring, and easily predictable. I couldn't stand the
'documentary' style of filming, hated the characters and the acting,
and wanted to walk out of the movie before it was finished. I keep
giving this movie guy the benefit of the doubt but time after time his
movies bite the big one.The gist is a mom has a falling out with her parents. Many many years
later, out of the blue, the parents want the grandchildren to come
visit. Even though she hasn't seen her parents in years, she lets the
kids go off on their own to hang out with people they've never met.
Then weird stuff happens and an annoying kid tries to rap.
