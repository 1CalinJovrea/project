Netflix

It's a Netflix movie so everyone knows what that means at this point:Interracial relations, beta white male bait, racism, strong dominant
genius gender quotas for female bosses and more or less lead, supposed
to match the acting experience of an evil white racist villain, the
black hero and the bait. Mixed with Netflix algorithms that tells what
people "like" for each genres.If you like cliché after cliché, "motherfucker" after "motherfucker"
couple friendly i.e. female friendly watered down action with an eye
candy bait for them to be okay to watch it, while the boyfriend hopes
Jackson says a sentence without "motherfucker" pushed into the script.
This is the movie for you, especially if you have never seen a movie
before.1 out of 10 points out of respect for Jackson. The good days are behind
you, but it's not your fault.
