Worthy Addition to the JC Canon

For a lower budget horror film, JC3 does an admirable job in living up
to the quality of its predecessors. The film takes place between the
events of the first and second films and also brings Trish (Gina
Philips) back for a nod to a potential fourth installment. The infamous
truck is back and is as diabolical as ever, with a few new twists.
Editing really lends itself to a thriller-type feel, but still with a
good deal of kills/blood in keeping with the canon. Acting by the
principals was generally excellent, Jonathan Breck is still in top
form. CGI weaker in quality than most films today, given the budget
shortcomings, but not any worse than the first film. All-in-all,
thought it was better than the trailer hinted, and am looking forward
to the re-match between Trish and the Creeper in an upcoming sequel!
