Whew... Great...

I'm not a huge Sean Penn fan. To my way of thinking, his best
performance up until this movie was as Bradford Whitewood, Jr. in "At
Close Range," but right now, after just having watched The Gunman, I've
got to say, "Wow..." I never thought of Sean Penn as any sort of
"action" star and I certainly never imagined him doing a film like
this. But he can sure pick them. And picking this one was a stroke of
genius. Some folks might see it as formulaic or routine, but I
guarantee you that whoever wrote the screenplay either did more
research than he should have or knows more about it than he should. It
was almost perfect.
