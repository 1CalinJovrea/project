Dull , Dull , Dull  ****Warning Spoilers******

I joined IMDb today so I could write this review.How this has been nominated for 6 Oscars is beyond belief.The Film starts slows and plods on to dreary end where nothing really
happens, Casey Afflecks performance is wooden to the point where you
cant sympathise with his character and the fact that he was using drugs
and drinking when his house burnt down.The film jumps about from flashback to present in the early stages and
early on its difficult to tell which is which, Lee doesn't look that
happy prior to the fire , so you never really get a sense of
comparison.This film may have benefited from just running through the course of
events rather in order than flash backs, there is a sense that some big
secret is about to be revealed - but nothing happens then it ends.Just a few specifics to comment on which added to the drudgery ;1. When his wife wants to go to lunch with him it sounds like there is
a huge confession coming ie - it was me that took the guard off the
fire - but No2. Much was made in the hospital of not having his brothers personal
effects - nothing was mentioned again.3. The symoblism that was tried for in the frozen meat in the freezer
because his dad was kept in a freezer at the undertakers was quite
frankly ludicrous and in poor film was very badly acted.4. The son of the dead brother seemed really happy considering his dad
had just died.5. The overuse of emotional classical music in scenes that were just
not that emotional just didn't work.I didn't like it.
