Splendid

This movie touches your heart. It brought me to tears more than once.
Perhaps it tells nothing new, but it definitely important not to
forget. The lives of so many women who were cast away merely by gossip
and envy. How rough the system was. And I take it back, the story isn't
new but it isn't old either. Many women from around the world still
live in similar systems. That's why is so important that brilliant
films such as this one keep being made. Everyone should see it. The
actor did a splendid job too. You will not end this movie without being
deeply moved by its story.
