It's Fine

Just came out of a pre-release screening. It was fine. Above all, the
word I would use would be "safe". It was a movie created not to fail,
and it doesn't. Watching it is a reasonable way to spend 2 and a half
hours. A bunch of bad stuff happens to Zamperini, he survives it in an
inspiring way, the end.IMDb movie reviews have to be 10 lines, but Unbroken doesn't really
deserve it. There's more to be said about Zamperini the person than the
film itself. It was narratively predictable, but that's forgivable
given the nature of the film. The problem is it was visually
predictable too. If someone were to right a textbook on how to make an
inspiring movie, they could dryly and apathetically describe this movie
shot for shot. So...hoorah I guess. It was fine.
