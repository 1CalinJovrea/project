Very entertaining and a good laugh

As far as comedies go this is certainly one of the best I've watched
over the last few months. It is an interesting combination of
characters which work really well together. You've got the drug dealer,
the geek, the stripper and the runaway (who in my opinion is more of a
rebel than anything else).The story itself isn't the strongest element of this movie, however in
my opinion Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Will Poulter all
deliver a really great performance.As funny as Ed Helms is in 'The Hangover' I feel the script didn't
really allow for his character to emerge as much.Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to
anyone looking for a good laugh.
