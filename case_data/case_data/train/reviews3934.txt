insufferable waste of good acting talent

the script is at once, dreadful and unbelievable. Sam's wife (Kevin
Kline) hands him a Viagra and condom as she drops him at the airport
and tells him to go, "get it out of your system". And that is how this
piece of trash starts out. It does not improve. Got two hours to burn?
take a walk, read a book... watch Two and A Half Men if you crave some
base humor, because this movie is worse. What a tragedy, that these
great actors tainted their career by appearing in this disaster. I used
to expect decent entertainment if De Niro or Kevin Kline were involved.
No more, but I suppose anyone can be bought off for the right price. I
am floored by the 6.8 IMDb rating for Last Vegas. Have the ratings been
stacked by 13-year old kids?
