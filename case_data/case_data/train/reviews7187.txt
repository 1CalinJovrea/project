It's fun, it's fast, it's not flawless

I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie,
but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, there
aren't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. The
Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he's
always been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It
works though, it just seems a bit off.The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always.
Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he
gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the way
Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardly
any background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he's
just a means to an end (pun intended).Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss a
little seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like most
Marvel movies, the villains don't marvel.
