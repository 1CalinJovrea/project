Bale at his best...

To be honest, after watching the trailer, i watched this movie only
cause it had Bale in it. But it turned out to be surprisingly good with
strong performances from everyone involved. Casey Affleck and Zoe
Saldana deliver good work on screen. Woody Harelson is also very
convincing as the Red neck villain. The director has managed to paint a
pretty vivid picture of the environment that he wanted to portray. The
storytelling is very engaging. Thumbs up to the director and his team
for this effort. In the end, no review can be complete without praising
the man who continues to amaze with each performance, Christian Bale.
Believable and heart warming in this one. He manages to accomplish the
one thing which was most needed from anyone who played this character
and that is being able to get the audience to empathize with it. Bale
succeeds and then some. Clearly one of his best works till date, and he
has an impressive resume already to choose from. A must Watch movie of
2013.
