Worst, poor taste movie I have ever seen....

Watching a comedy is always hit and miss....My teenage son likes to
watch comedies with me, so I have viewed a fair number and always brace
myself. I accept that most of them I won't like (I am more of a Woody
Allen fan), but am always open to being surprised by something that I
think, 'well, that wasn't too bad.' This was the worst, most offensive
comedy I have ever seen, and I have seen a fair bit. I like Andy
Sandberg but the whole thing was horrible. I am totally stunned that
Susan Sarandon would agree to guest appear in this....I highly
recommend some other comedy...pretty much any other comedy as this one
was the worst I have ever seen...
