A solid depiction of a what could have been a disastrous real life incident.

There's obviously a lot of research and accuracy of facts that need to
be considered when making a film out of a real life incident. Clint
Eastwood once again shows he knows what he's doing when it comes to
sitting in the directors chair.January 15th, 2009, Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger landed an
Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after it suffered dual engine failures
from a bird strike. What he endures following the incident is a
scathing investigation team hell bent on showing him he made a mistake
and he could have in fact turned the plane around and landed it safely
on one of the many runways available to him in New York.Tom Hanks, as always, plays a solid role and character and a very
believable Aircraft pilot, although i felt at times he could have shown
just a little more emotion in certain spots. Aaron Eckhart and Anna
Gunn made good additions to the cast fitting into their roles nicely.The film itself, jumps all over the place, it starts straight away with
a nightmare from our hero. we see the timeline of events is post-
incident, then eventually goes back to the beginning of the flight
before Sully even steps foot on the plane. I wasn't expecting the film
to be structured this way and found it kind of annoying at first, but
it doesn't at all affect the pacing.Clocking in at just an hour and a half, Sully is a good hero flick
depicting the events of January 15th, 2009, because we learn everything
we need to know in just that short space of time. Nothing feels
overdone or over dramatized and I walked out of the cinema feeling
thoroughly satisfied with what Eastwood managed to do with this story.
Really good stuff!Fox.
