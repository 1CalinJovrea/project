Worst movie this year!

Don't watch it. Extremely long, extremely boring. How many more parts
are they gonna make? The story is very confusing and not well
thought-through. Everything has already been chewed over and over and
they keep squeezing the last bit out of the transformer-idea. The
actors apparently didn't like it either because even my little sister
could have done a better job. Especially the voice acting for the
transformers is very weak and one just feels stupid listening to their
voices. I had enough of this movie after a little more than 1 hour.
That's more than 1 and 1/2 hours left which I still watched, thinking
maybe something would still happen. Guess what? It didn't. Long story
short, this movie is really, really bad.
