For the Love of Upton & Daddario

I think, everyone watch this movie because of the casting. Both girl
are some of the most beautiful woman living in Hollywood nowadays. Too
bad the script is not really good, or I think we don't really get what
we kind of expect from this movie's cast. It is better if they give us
more right. It just looks like some kind of cheap chick flick from
Hallmark. Because I'm kind of enjoy it, I think its OK for one time
viewing. A not so r-rated lighthearted comedy.
