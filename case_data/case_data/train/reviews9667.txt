Original Story Line Butchered so Badly the Film Lost it's Cohesion

It is as if the concern of the producers and story writers were so
focused on the movie's DBOX worthiness that they forgot to include the
story line.I went to this movie with two friends that have not read the books, as
I have. Both walked out of the movie confused..."Where did the virus
come from?" was the first question that they asked. The beginning of the movie should have included the reason why
W.I.C.K.E.D. created the Maze, explained what the Flare is, and
introduced both groups of Maze runners. Instead, the audience is lost
in visual effects without knowing why the action is happening. To add
insult to injury, the writers turn the virus infected people into
inhuman, biologically altered zombies. The immune are now a commodity
for a short term fix to the virus problem. So much has been lost by
these adaptations that the result is a vague and confusing zombie
flick. I almost walked out.This was a wonderful book that should have been an incredible movie.
