Sad they ruined a perfect book..

Let's start with the obvious. Story isn't what it used to be in the
book. It's far more shiny, oriented toward Colonel Graff(Harrison Ford)
instead of Ender, lot of the important things in the book are
completely gone! Unfortunately, they just hollywooded it. Ender's game
wasn't a book about shiny spaceships and space stations. It was about a
terrible war against non-human enemy, and about our only hope - a guy
like Ender! It was also about his genius brother and sister, which we
almost didn't see in the entire movie! Also there was blood, a lot of
it, and here everything was shiny and clean, and Ender wasn't shown as
the genius in the book.. I got the feeling there only've been around
20-30 kids on the training camp instead of hundreds! Also too little
attention to the Ender's game at the end - 2 battles and that's it?
Pathetic! Way to short movie to picture the Ender's universe. All in
all i felt completely betrayed by this cheap Hollywood movie. I know
most movies aren't as good as the book, but this is completely
different story, only the names of the characters are the same.. P.S.
Sorry for my non native English.
