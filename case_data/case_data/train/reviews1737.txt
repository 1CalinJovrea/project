No, it's not really thought provoking, or a very good film at all.

I've seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and
Roddy McDowell, I've seen the remake with Tim Roth, I've seen thousands
of films during my life. War for the Planet of the Apes seemed to me as
simply a showcase for the digital ape effects.It's full of closeups of different digital ape faces against a blurry
background. Af if it's 1957 and we should be marveling at new
Disneyland animatronic characters. It's full of distant shots of
digital chimps scurrying around. That's most of the movie.What people are saying is thought provoking, is a simple illustration
of two groups in conflict. Draw comparisons to Nazis and Jews, black
and white, Shia and Shi'ite, slave and slave owner. The same "thought
provoking" questions arise.The only difference here is that it's put into a science fiction
context - what if apes were as smart as humans? Well, what if cats
were? Or squirrels? Had this been an action film, I'd say OK, it's an
action movie and it's fine. But it isn't. It has some action, but is
not an action film. It's mostly a very slow moving, dull, inarticulate
drama.Inarticulate in two ways. A lot of the apes use sign language instead
of speech, and the script is not clever or intellectual. A few flashes
of well written dialog come up during an exchange between the Colonel
(Woody Harrelson) and Caesar (digital ape) and that's all there is.
Less than five minutes. The rest of the dialog is mainly focused on
vengeance and war or merciful understanding. There's no complexity or
intellectual stimulation here.I'm shocked that nearly all professional film critics give this movie a
high rating and praise. Perhaps they all received $5,000 checks from
the film studio.
