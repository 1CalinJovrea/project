Scouts vs. Zombies gotta like that!

Comedy and Horror mix well in this coming of age movie. There are some
brilliant moments in this movie so it is worth a watch. Zombies and
children don't sync, so I would definitely not show this one to the
little kiddies. There are adult sexual themes for a well-deserved "R"
rating. The movie centers around 3 boy scouts that are getting too old
for the camp outs and sitting around the camp fire. The zombie outbreak
happens when they are in the woods and when they get back into town;
it's an all-out war against the zombies. Add to that, a stripper that
knows more about what is going on than the scouts and you have a funny
group of survivors trying to save the world.
