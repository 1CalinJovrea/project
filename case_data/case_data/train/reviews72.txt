Werewolves not Swearwolves

This was something I stumbled across almost by accident and is one of
the funniest films I have seen for years.The documentary style combines with absurd, macabre humour and
brilliant comic acting performances to produce what I suspect will
become a cult classic along the lines of Withnail & I and Spinal Tap.The story of a small group of vampires 'flatting' in the Wellington
area of New Zealand, their back histories spoken to camera, and the
lead up to the Unholy Masquerade result in some truly hilarious set-
pieces and complications such as who is responsible for doing the
dishes and how best to be 'invited' into the hottest nightclubs in the
city on a night out. A couple of the cast members are known through their performances in
'The Flight of the Concords' but others were, to me at least, unknowns
and all turn in masterful performances without exception.The music score is integral to the movie and used in a similar way to,
say Pulp Fiction, in setting the scenes and adding polish. There are
lines of dialogue that will become, if they're not already, classics to
those in the know.This really is a laugh out loud, ludicrous movie. Hugely original and,
I suspect, the result of a lot of hard work edited down to a marvellous
feast of black comedy.
