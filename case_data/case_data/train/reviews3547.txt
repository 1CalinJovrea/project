Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe

...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not
enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the
Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best
film in the entire Marvel series!)Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of
Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by
no means flawless. The good:Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the
horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!)
and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to
do in this film. The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around
this character.The Bad:Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie
cold. I know some people say "It was necessary for character
development", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving
Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely
nothing for me.The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really
do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm
usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between
Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we
saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough
build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it
is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.
