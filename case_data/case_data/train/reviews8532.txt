I HIGHLY recommend this film!

I went to IMDb to read reviews of this movie before seeing it. What I
read was not too encouraging so I had fairly low expectations. Boy, was
I surprised to find myself smiling throughout the film while my
daughter and I nudged each other to comment on how much we liked it!
Julie Roberts and Nathan Lane make a stellar duo, and every role was so
well cast. Conceptually, I was thrilled with the visuals, the costuming
and computer animated sets and special effects. Any changes made to the
original story were in my opinion quite clever. The surprise Bollywood
number at the end cinched it for me! Take your family to see this
movie!
