Total Crap

Guys, this movie was a joke It seems like they took all the extra
costumes from 'Flash Gordon', 'CG from any Transformer movie,
"screenwriting" from 'The Last Starfighter', and character development
for 'Gigli' and overall logic from 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai
across the 8th Dimension' and put them together!Basic breakdownAct I. Kidnap + Rescue + Channing Tatum on magic roller-skates +
Redmayne OveractingAct II. Kidnap + Rescue + Channing Tatum on magic roller-skates +
Redmayne OveractingAct III. Kidnap + Rescue + Mila Kunis on magic roller-skates
