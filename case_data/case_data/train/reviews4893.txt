An interesting crime-thriller that is quite enjoyable despite all the hate it gets.

As I read many reviews the two things people hate this movie for is:
It's a crime-thriller and not a horror story like the book was. Because
I haven't read the book I can't say on what level they differ, but the
movie is still very interesting and exciting. And the other thing is
the ending. I agree that it comes a bit fast and leaves you kinda
hanging, BUT it fits the whole frosty northern scenery well and makes
the story line a full circle.I really enjoyed it, can't really understand why it gets so much hate.
