8
A Great and Funny Buddy Film!!!

I have never written a review before and I have no idea how to do
this... Well, I'll start by saying that this movie took me several
simultaneous laughs... Hilarious acting by Jonah Hill, good plot and
nice jokes too! I got to stay i was not very satisfied with the
performance of Channing Tatum as a high school student, but... Anyway,
this is a good movie to watch on a Saturday night if you want to
entertain and laugh. This film does not deserve a 10 because it is not
perfect, there are some weaknesses in some parts, but, anyway, an 8 is
very satisfactory. I recommend you to watch this film because I laugh a
lot. Thank you for read my review and bye!!! PS: Sorry my English :/
