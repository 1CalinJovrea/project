Horrible - All special effects, poor plot development

I don't typically review many movies, but I felt compelled to warn
people about this film. My husband, 14 year-old son and I have very
different movie preferences but we were all looking forward to seeing
this film. None of us liked it. The worst part about it was that there
was sooo much going on in virtually every scene that it actually became
irritating to watch. Too many special effects can detract from a film
and this movie was crammed with so much "action" that it was just
complete overkill. Granted, it has been quite a while since I saw the
original, but I remember there being at least some amusing parts and I
felt some connection to the main character- not so with the re-make. I
could also follow the plot and thought it was better developed in the
previous version.Before the halfway-point I found myself checking my watch every 10
minutes or so, and my husband and I both admitted afterwards that we
dozed off a couple times (in self-defense I think) - something I NEVER
do when I go to a movie theater. This was the closest that I have ever
come to walking out midway through a movie. The only reason we stayed
until the end was that we invested $25 for the tickets and felt
stubbornly compelled to stick it out. I hope that others who decide to
see the film have a better experience than I did, but I honestly
wouldn't even recommend renting it when it is released to DVD.
