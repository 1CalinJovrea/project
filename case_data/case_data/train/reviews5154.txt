Expectations seem too high

I have never written a review here, but I felt compelled to actually
step up and defend this movie.The Bourne Legacy was everything I expected it to be. It couldn't be
too close to the previous Bourne films, but had to be close enough to
let us know a storm is coming.Bourne's presence throughout the film is what spins this story into
action and I felt it was balanced perfectly. We all want Bourne, but
this is Aaron Cross's story. Renner and Weisz were great, but I think
the scripting has been derided by many as terrible. I had no issues
with anything and even felt compelled by Renner's character motivation.
This was someone yearning to be more, not someone who was already
better than everyone else, but just couldn't remember.Let's cross our fingers and hope we all get what we want and pair
Bourne and Cross in the next film.There is so much more going on than just Jason Bourne and if we don't
get to explore that then the franchise will be poorer for it!
