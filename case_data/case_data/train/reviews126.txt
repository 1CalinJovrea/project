I am appalled.

****May Contain Spoilers**** This was completely awful. If I were Kami
Garcia I would be embarrassed. There were actually only 2 things in
this movie that followed the books and I can't even remember what the
second one is that is how disturbed I am. Within the first 2 minutes
they had already screwed it up. The dreams that Ethan has pertaining to
Lena. Where is the rest of the cast?? I can understand them not having
a big budget (I don't know whether they did or didn't I am just
assuming they didn't because of lack of characters) but really? They
can't get even the lollipop that Ridley uses correct? Lena and Ethan
don't Celt at all in the movie. Ethan never dies. Why the heck did
Genevieve kill her Ethan? And not even have the Book of Moons. Where is
the Sharpie? Why wasn't Lena driving a hearse? This really just makes
my head hurt. I am so disturbed by how much they butchered what could
have been an amazing movie. I really don't expect them to be able to
even make a sequel now that Ethan didn't even die. I won't be watching
it either if they do. This is an atrocity.
