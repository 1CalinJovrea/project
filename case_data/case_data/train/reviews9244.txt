"All may lose control"

It's hard to review an unconventional movie, because this one is sort
of six movies all in one. Relatos Salvajes (Wild Tales) is about six
different and independent stories with one thing in common: the limit
of our patience, or like it's tagline says..."All may lose control".
Ordinary people that find themselves in awkward situations they didn't
look for, and that's the beauty of this movie. It's almost impossible
not to feel identified with one of the characters, with one of their
situations, despite the awkward moments they struggle that in some
passages make us feel uncomfortable. And the merit of director Damián
Szifrón is to tell those stories with an exquisite combination of
intrigue, suspense and a remarkable and effective dark humor. The
acting, editing, photography and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla are
all ingredients that give extra points. You'll get out of the cinema
talking to each other which tale you enjoyed the most and reviewing
some of their hilarious scenes.
