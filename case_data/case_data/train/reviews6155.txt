Watchable: only if Serena is muted

As the name indicates, a successor of original XXX. Movie is fine;
action stunts, plots, all watchable and enjoyable for once. Only thing
that irritates is Deepika Padukone's dialogue delivery. Every time her
role comes up, it's like she's narrating a story like a granny. If
filming an Indian actress was the only demand then Priyanka Chopra
would've been much better.
