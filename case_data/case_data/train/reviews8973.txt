Terrible story - the Gods must be spinning on Mount Olympus

The story is absolute rubbish. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of
mythology would cringe at the terrible things they made the Gods do.
There are so many bad things about the plot.1. How could they make Ares and Hades fight against Zeus and then make
Hades change sides for hardly any reason? 2. How could they make Zeus die? 3. Why is Perseus speaking with an Australian accent? Come on Sam at
least fake something neutral! 4. Since when did Andromeda become some tomboy warrior amazon? 5. Why would Ares be jealous of that silly little fisherman Perseus
when all he was doing was fishing? What pointless animosity. Since when
were the Gods thugs?6. Why is Pegasus so dark?I thought the 2010 Clash was a terrible remake of the 80s version. The
2010 Clash had no charm romance or dignity of the Gods. But Wrath is
worse. The story is so rubbishy and the dialog so terrible that it's
gone light years away from the right direction. The acting and casting aren't good. Rosamund Pike isn't appealing
enough for a princess. Her cold blank expression is annoying. Sam
Worthington looks even more nondescript let alone heroic than before.
He isn't even 1 percent God. And why did he start speaking in his
native accent? Are the Gods from Down Under? And the sudden kiss at the
end is so out of place even Andromeda looked shocked. Liam Neeson and
Ralph Fiennes are too good to be in this bad movie.Don't watch this one - it's an example of silly people just throwing
money away on effects when the plot stinks.
