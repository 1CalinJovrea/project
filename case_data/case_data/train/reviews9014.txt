Totally predictable, boring, pointless film

I had seen and heard the hype so I admit that my expectations were,
perhaps unfairly, high. But even without such expectations this film is
worse than bad. With such an illustrious cast, I starting watching the
film and kept waiting for a moment of redemption, which never came. On the contrary, the film starts somewhat promising but degenerates
into a predictable, lousy story. It is a totally wasted opportunity
because the ingredients were there for a good indy film: a chef that is
tired of cooking boring food leaves his well-paid job to pursue his
real passion, while juggling a challenging relationship with his son
and ex-wife. However the film never delivers: the relationships are
utterly superficial, the gourmet cooking scenes disconnected with the
rest of the film, the character of Scarlet Johannson is confusing and
unnecessary, the road trip boring and dull. The only one who comes out
as a great actor is the kid.
