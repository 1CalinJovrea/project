Meh

I went to go see this movie with two friends, Im a big fan of Tom Hardy
and have seen all of his movies and other stuff. I... kinda liked the
movie... it was kinda bad but I kinda liked it. Lets get a few things
out the way. Editing was horrible, the entire opening looked like a
trailer and the later scenes I was screaming "CUT!" at the movie.
Acting is solid through out the movie although the movie really just
centres around FDR and Laurens relationship because Tuck and her don't
have any chemistry really. There are about... four fights, they use
shaky cam and you cant tell what was happening, for some reason when
FDR and Tuck fight its really short and Tuck takes most of the hits.
There are a few good scenes in the movie but I didn't laugh that much
apart from Tucks date scene that I found amusing as he guns down
teenagers and man-handles others in a paint ball game.Really, the best parts were in the trailers and thats really it, if you
want Chris Pine watch "Star Trek", if you want Tom Hardy watch
"Bronson" or "Warrior", Reese Witherspoon... I haven't seen any good
movies with her in..."This Means War" could have been a good movie but its to much of a
RomCom that has horrible editing and choppy fight scenes. The action
scenes are few and far between and generally meh except the Paintball
scene that is in all the trailers.
