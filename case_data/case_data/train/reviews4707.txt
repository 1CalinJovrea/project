Lead actor bombs the film

Ironically, Kumail Nanjiani, the lead actor in this film stands out as
a terrible actor against the fantastic talent of Zoe Kazan, Ray Romano,
and Holly Hunter. I say, "Ironically," because it is the lead actor's
project and story! Zoe Kazan is adorable and charming as his love
interest, but he is flat and wooden, which has the effect of creating
zero chemistry between the lovers in this romance. Additionally, there are random, out-of-character scenes forced into the
story which are unbelievable and clumsy. For example, when Kumail
Nanjiani shows up at a drive- thru restaurant, the bit seems like it is
from another character in another movie.Topping all that, the film keeps its emotional connection to the
audience at arm's length due to the insensitive directing that seems to
prefer the syllable of every written line in lieu of nuance and charm
that may have been between the lines.
