Master Piece ... just don't know why this is so underrated....

One of the best Movies i have watched till date. This movie makes you
imagine all what you can feel and all what you want to feel in just 120
minutes. Worth watching millions of times. I have seen many time travel
concepts before but this is where my heart pounded better than any
where.Not only romances is magnificent, humor and drama are also far better
than many Classics. With Heart touching soundtracks and songs, the
movie has Eye pleasing Scenes.Characters are perfectly casted. Performance, screenplay, dialogues etc
all are first class. But the best is the Presentation of emotions which
could be linked to every single person who ever Loved someone or just
believes in.The movie begins with casual entries and remains a good entertainer
till second half while in the last quarter(ending) it cross a bridge
and steps in best movie category platform with a message of living.I strongly recommend this movie to all the viewers.I rate this Movie 10/10.
