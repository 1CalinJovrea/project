So Implausible It Became Boring

TV shows and movies that feed certain stereotypes make me angry. This
was one of them. It annoyed me how mentally ill people were portrayed
in general. They depicted the practice of psychiatry as it was 100
years ago. Sessions 2-3 times per week. Shock therapy. Nurses in
psychiatric hospitals running around with sedative needles
administering drugs to "crazy" patients who refuse them (that's been
illegal for maybe 50 years, not 100). Then the crazy ending, which is
supposed to "blow your mind" with the ridiculous twists and hot lesbian
tongue flicking. The only reason why it wasn't predictable was because
it was so implausible you could never guess what would happen. That's
not mind blowing. That's just cheating.
