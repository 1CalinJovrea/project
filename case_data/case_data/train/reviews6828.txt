Sometimes Sweet But Somehow Unpersuasive

Spoiler alert: true love wins in the end! Phew. Got that out of the
way. The set up to this sometimes endearing romantic comedy is that the
two protagonists meet 'cute' in college, love a bit (light,though
momentous) and become reacquainted after many years bearing many of the
same 'issues' they had initially. They commit to friendship, navigate
the shoals of misguided affairs, and (ta da!) find each other in the
end.The actors carry this movie in a way that would not be possible if
lesser skill were applied. It is cute, but so overdrawn at points -- is
all sexual adventure to be reduced to 'addiction' -- that it is hard to
believe. For light fare, though, not so bad.
