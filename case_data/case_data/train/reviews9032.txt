Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.

The first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing,
the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in
the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers.
To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not
the case with Gone Girl.Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots
whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn
into thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock
movie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's
narrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is
a lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy
to overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish
really well. This may be the very reason why he is completely
overlooked.And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a
contemporary piece of work! Stellar!
