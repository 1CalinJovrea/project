Really stupid

This movie has so many holes that I cannot even cover them all. I love
how movie makers think of Artificial Intelligence as Artificial
Feeling. It was really ridiculous that the robot immediately started
acting like a child as soon as it had AI. A machine will act like a
child only if it's programmed to behave like one. Not just by giving it
self awareness. It was also stupid that the movie tried to make heroes
out of the stupid vicious criminals. And implanting the consciousness
to new body to achieve immortality, this has been used in the movie The
6th day with Arnold Schwartzenegger. Implant memory to new cloned body
to live forever. But is this real immortality? If your body die as soon
as you transfer your consciousness, it may seem like immortality but
what if your body doesn't die? And this clone with your memory is
standing in front of you. Is that clone really you? It's just a copy.
Overall, this movie tries to deal with few philosophical topics but at
very elementary level. And just copied elements from many other movies
that are far more interesting and just made it worse. Actings were
horrible too.
