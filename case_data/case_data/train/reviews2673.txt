Just not for me.

I go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like
it. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems
like a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came
home and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.In my case, the humor is not funny, is like they try so hard, the
action scenes are to fast to really enjoy them and I found the plot no
interesting at all. And the worst was the characters, which aside of
Batman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.To me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.People really like this movie, and that's great! I'm happy that people
can see thing in stuff that I don't, but personally, I found this movie
already very overrated.
