Fantastic Franco.

Why him? I tell you why, because I can't think of any other actor who
can transform this this cinematic excrement into a gourmet dish. There
is a matteroffactness in his character that lives somewhere between
Rupert Pumpkin and Howard Hughes, the thing is that the life James
Franco gives to his character is absolutely real. The film could have
turned into a horror thriller, because Franco forces you, in the most
entertaining way, to feel slightly off-balance. That alone keeps you
glued to it in spite of the moronic lack of ideas. Bryan Cranston, of
course, is sheer perfection. Reacting hilariously to the absurdity with
infinite generosity - A trait of great actors - I wish them a Billy
Wilder next time or a Preston Sturges or...you know. Fearless originals
just like Franco and Cranston.
