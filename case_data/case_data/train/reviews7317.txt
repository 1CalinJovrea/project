Not Like "Taken" But Still Great!

This film is not like the other Liam Neeson films of "Taken" but still
in the rank of it up there.He plays a former disgrace NYPD cop turned Air Marshal. Who has a
drinking problem to cope with the death of his daughter from leukemia.
As he does not like flying despite the position he is in.Julianne Moore stars as a friend and also frequent flier that is pretty
scared of flying who will later understand Bill than anybody else.But then a breach in his federal phone warns Bill that every twenty
minutes, someone will be killed if $150M is not delivered to that
person or persons. As he becomes the prime suspect in the hijacking.He must clear his name along with saving the passengers and crew in the
movie. Lupita Nyong√≥ the recent Oscar winner for "12 Years As A Slave"
is really wasted in the film as a attendant. More lines are given to
her UK co-star, Downtown Abbey's Michelle Dockery.Still a great movie. Not like "Taken" but still great!
