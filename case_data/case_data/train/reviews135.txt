Overall Good Quality Movie

Overall, The Giver was a good, quality movie. It conveyed an important
message: we need the bad in order to appreciate the good. I definitely
plan on buying it when it comes out on DVD.First, what I thought wasn't great about the movie: I thought the first
little bit of the movie was rushed, as well as another segment later
on. I also don't feel that time was conveyed wellalmost a year passes
from the beginning of the movie to the end, but the movie portrays it
as just a few days. As a result of the time warp, we don't properly
understand how love develops between the characters. We also don't see
enough of Fiona's and Asher's developmentthey play key parts towards
the end, but their actions seem out of the blue.Now, the good of the movie: Above all, this movie conveys what I think
is a very important message about needing pain with joy. I also
appreciated that they touched on the differences between simply "a
family unit" and having a real family. The emphasis on love as
overarching was also good and appropriate. I appreciated that the movie
doesn't show details of the painful memories but still is able to
convey a little of the sorrow from them.Again, I think this is a great movie overall. And I left the theater
wondering, "Will we remember? Will we remember that love is worth the
price of sorrow?" I certainly hope we never forget.
