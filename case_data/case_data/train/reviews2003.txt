Just as well I didn't pay!

Saw it as part of a double showing after Kingsman. Talk about chalk and
cheese.All I can do is condemn with faint praise: I've seen worse. I was more bored with all the tired clichés than anything else. They showed the villain early on then, dragged a rather nonsensical red
herring across the trail, followed by a pretty crap twist that
distracted you only because given the rest of the plot, ANYTHING was
possible.Then it turns out the bad guy actually is the bad guy and because it
really doesn't add up, Liam and the Cop hastily waffle up some half ass
explanation. I presume for the benefit of the dim wits in the Focus
Group who didn't get the feeble plot, nor that the feeble plot was
actually simply feeble. I'd lost interest well before that despite they hadn't done all the
Action Sequences, still had a few to trundle out, and the obligatory
last chase after the villain grabs the girl and drags her along for no
reason at all.It's hard to catalog all the clichés, especially in the action scenes.
Stop me if you've seen the wrong way speed chase down the freeway, with
the inevitable tumbling heavy objects flattening everything in their
path before bouncing over our hero.The super bad Russian ex-commando, the one everyone kills themselves to
avoid, simply can't hit Liam Nielsen for love nor money. Inside a
lounge room! Because all he has is a super gun that fires a zillion
bullets a second! Liam runs through it all unscathed. Everything around him gets shredded
to demonstrate just how dangerous these guns are!At that point "we're going to need a bigger gun!" would have raised an
easy laugh.The ending was pretty lame and just seemed to run out of puff. After
which it looks like they are setting Liam up to save his granddaughter
as the next target. That is at least a couple of "Takens" too far for
me.
