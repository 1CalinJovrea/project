We made so much money on a crappy film that we made a part 2

This movie has horrible acting and it's basically nothing but a cheesy
cringey chic flick that makes all the single girls that fantasies about
having a relationship that is abusive but also stand up for women's
rights panties wet. And for the dudes that go watch this..there are so
many porn sites that a free and you don't have to sit through hours of
bad dialogue for a 15 min soft porn scene. The only reason they keep
making these films is because idiots keep buying tickets to go watch
this movie. Horrible ratings and people still stand by and defend it.
Stop giving a movie high ratings because it increases your hormone
levels you horny animals lol
