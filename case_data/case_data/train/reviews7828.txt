Superly Awesome Drama !

Yes, we do not fully understand how complex, chaotic or random nature
is, but deep down in our heart we always feel that there is something
which connects us to everything that has ever existed or exists. Just
like the fact that we are all star dust coming from a singular event
that happened billions of years ago. Still here we are questioning and
reasoning every possible way we can to the very creator of the whole
scheme.I Origins gives you one of the best way possible to explain the
interconnection of the complex yet simple world we live in and soul we
carry. Acting and casting are perfect and so as direction and editing.
At one point it gave me goosebumps, just by imagining a possibility
that what if it is true ?! A must watch.
