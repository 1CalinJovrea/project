9
It is exactly what I expected.

First of all, Adam Sandler movies are nothing more than goofy films. He
had a lot of success in the 90's and that set audience's expectations
high. Too high if you ask me.The Ridiculous 6 starts out terribly. Just hold on because the universe
the film takes place in grows on you. I'm not going to put any plot
points. What I am going to say is that the characters are over the top
in a movie that is over the top. It's silly, fun, goofy, and there are
scenes that are so stupid you can't help but laugh. I was entertained
and I'll watch it again. It's more silly than the 3 Amigos, but not by
much. It's typical Happy Madison jokes and if you just relax and watch
the film, you'll realize it's Fun. That's all it has to be. Have fun,
and enjoy it for what it is worth.
