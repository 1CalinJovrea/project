Terrible Story and Poorly Written Screenplay

The seventeen year-old Belle Walker (Bella Thorne) moves to Long Island
with her mother Joan (Jennifer Jason Leigh), her little sister Juliet
(Mckenna Grace), her comatose twin brother James (Cameron Monaghan) and
her aunt Candice (Jennifer Morrison). James suffered an accident and
depends on the life support equipment to survive. His neurologist Dr.
Milton (Kurtwood Smith) knows that the braindead James will not recover
but Joan does not accept the truth and has high-hopes that her beloved
son will recover. When Belle goes to school, she learns that her
address is the notorious Amityville house where a father killed his
family forty years ago. Belle discovers blood stains under the
wallpaper of her room and soon mysterious things happen in the house.
When James recovers after a flat line, Belle believes an evil thing has
possessed he brother. "Amityville: The Awakening" is another Amityville horror film with
terrible story and poorly written screenplay. The characters are not
well developed and the conclusion is deceptive. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Amityville: O Despertar" ("Amityville: The Awakening")
