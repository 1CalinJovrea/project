sad, awful, depressing movie that will leave you second guessing why you even watched it in the first place.

this movie is so messed up. i could barely watch it. from beginning to
end the whole premise of the movie is sick and sadistic. i don't know
how anyone would see this as entertainment. if you enjoy watching
people torture each other, suicide, and tragedy then this movie is
perfect for you. otherwise, stay away. i don't know how this movie is
so successful. such an awful film to watch. the fact that this movie is
on Netflix and has 4/5 stars makes me want to vomit. i don't understand
how anyone could sit through this film and watch the screen the entire
time, it is not suitable for young children, even myself, who
frequently watches scary movies and crime shows had to look away from
the screen multiple times because this movie is so disturbing.
