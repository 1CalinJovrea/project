A perhaps sad ending (?) to one of the best cartoon sagas out there...

Another Despicable Me instalment means a load of popcorn for me and the
kids - and days of laughter!!! Normally that is...We'd already seen the trailer so we knew that Despicable Me 3 involved
Gru's estranged twin brother Dru. (I assume everybody knows this so I'm
not marking this as a spoiler.) We were also made aware of the new
"super villain" Balthazar Bratt, an 80's themed crook, in the trailer.
In the trailer he sort of made sense in the deranged world of
Despicable Me, but not in the movie.I don't know why they chose this script because it's a really poor one.
If it is to kill off the franchise then it worked because good it
wasn't. Also changing the voice actor for Agnes from Elsie Fisher to
Nev Scharrel was a bad move. Nothing bad about Nev, but it was too
obvious and the kids reacted instantly. You have to be careful with
voice actors because they "are" the character and not just a paid actor
that can be replaced at short notice. There might've been a reason for
this, I don't know, but it was too obvious.Without going into detail about the movie for those who haven't seen it
it's the usual stuff with some sort of heist and one super villain -
and something going wrong, but with a happy ending. Sadly without any
finesse or enthusiasm as the previous instalments.If you love Despicable Me and the Minions movie then watch this one as
well - but don't expect it to be as fantastic as the previous ones!
They had the chance of doing a movie about the young boy Gru and his
adventures with the Minions, following up on the Minions movie, but
this fell between the chairs somehow... Me and my kids must've seen the previous movies at least 20 times each!
This one we probably won't see again. That says something...A weak 5 out of 10 - sadly.
