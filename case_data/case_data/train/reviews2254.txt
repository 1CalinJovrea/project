Garbage

This film should have been put in a recycle bin to make some plastic
Dixie cups from. 4 or 5 plastic cups would have been a much better use
of the material. Its hard for me to believe Cooper and Helms agreed to
participate in this abomination.Trouble with this film is its for a 12 or 13 year old, but you need to
be 17 to get in and see it. Also the few chuckles in the audience
sounded like they were from a 79 - 80 IQ patron.If you are a 40 year old adolescent or have a room temp IQ you may find
this amusing. A level beneath fart jokes, this expletive laden
non-script couldn't give anyone a chance to act even if they had the
skills.I wish I'd have spent the 90 minutes reorganizing my garage or deleting
old emails - and I'm not kidding at all. Hope this saves you an
excruciating time (and $) this holiday weekend.
