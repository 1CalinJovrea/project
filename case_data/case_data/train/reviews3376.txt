Brilliantly done!

For start, if you are looking for something like the Blair Witch
Project or anything that has an unsteady camera and 'lost footage',
this is not the film for you.If you are looking for something gory and jump out of your seat scary,
this isn't the film for you.This is a film that sets a eerie mood, similar to "The Shining". We
have a Puritan Family banished from their plantation and forcing them
out into the world on their own.Set in 1630, this film uses the same dialect of the time, and the
beliefs are the same. If you are someone who struggles with religion,
this movie also may not be something of interest to you. This film
delves into the loss of faith, both figuratively and literally, as a
series of events unfold.It is interesting to see the family's journey on how they descend into
their fates, and you are left wondering and questioning many things: A
sign of a very well written film.WARNING: If you are hard of hearing, I would highly recommend you wait
until this film is available on DVD with captioning. The actors all
have accents and even I had trouble understanding what they were saying
(add to that the way they spoke in that time period).The Witch to me, is a brilliantly shot (natural lighting and using a
different aspect ratio to get the sense of isolation), well acted and
fascinatingly told. It is a simple story that leaves a big impact, if
you are looking for an eerie, haunting film that will make you think.
If you are looking for something to scare you and gross you out, you
will be disappointed.
