Ignore bad ratings here

Wow lives up to its legendary original, really enjoyed this from start
to finish. Enough gore! And entertainment! When you watch a movie in
this genre aka slasher its just what you expect, gore stupidity with
good production values. Ignore the reviews and judge for your selves. I
did ðŸ˜Š
