Decent enough action film but lacking punch from it's original.

Firstly let me say, you know what you going in to see so don't expect
any Oscar performances but still decent enough sequel, although I think
they must have decided to play it safe and toned down the violence and
swearing that made it's predecessor successful. The cast knew what they were doing and appeared to play everything
tongue in cheek, rather than take it too seriously by the looks of
things, which probably made it more enjoyable to watch. A few laugh out loud moments, especially from, surprisingly, Elton
John's kick-arse scene and a scene involving a heart racing snow lift
escape, agents in distress and an elderly gentleman's bowel movement!My main plus was Julianne Moore, she probably was surprise package of
the movie, for me her role as the protagonist was perfect, not as over
the top as Samuel L Jackson, more understated and less in your face,
which for me worked better. Shame her death was a bit anti-climatic.Story itself was by the numbers and there were a couple of plot holes
and ending predictable but if you switch off your brain and just enjoy
the movie for what it is, then it's worth watching.Will be nice to if we get to see more of The Statesmen if they decide
to make another film (which is more than likely) hope Matthew Vaughan
would behind the scenes again if they do and possibly improve some this
sequel flaws.Manners.. maketh... man
