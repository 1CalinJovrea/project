another over hyped movie that fails to make a point.

Everything nowadays is so over hyped like breaking bad the dark knight
and now this crap this movie is such a mess it's a comedy that is 3
hours long that's right a comedy that is so long and so over the top
and it drags on and on and on. This movie is what other country's see
us as stupid people that spend money on drugs and take from people to
waste it . This movie is so stupid you will ask your self did I really
pay $8:50 for this and why and you will find out that your day was
wasted too. This movie is just a movie that will be forgotten in a year
from now no one will know what it is because no one will remember this
crap it is not a classic like scarface it is a anti American film that
show' show great Jordan Belford with his middle school language and
intellect that make you feel dumb that you watch it. It's a trashy
movie with no real meaning but to waste your time and life so stay away
if you have one this movie is just a nether epic fail that might get a
award because it was over-hyped and this movie will be on a award
mistake list in the near future.
