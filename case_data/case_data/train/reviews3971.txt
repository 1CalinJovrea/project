One the best surrealist films I've ever seen.

So I'm writing a film and struggling for a title, I decided on Boyz in
the Wood (no plug, it will probably never be made) so I did a quick
google search of it to check it hadn't already been used and Boys in
the Trees came up. So I read the reviews you lovely people had written
and decided it sounded right up my street so made a note to look out
for it. Well, lo and behold a few days later it serendipitously arrives
on Netflix. Well, suffice to say I was not disappointed. In fact, two weeks later
I'm still playing Gary Numan's Down in the Park every five minutes and
the film is still lingering around my thoughts confirming Boys in the
Trees has etched itself onto my soul.Wonderful cinematography on what appears to be a fairly low budget. The
genius of setting the film on Halloween means the film can achieve the
dreamy, surrealist aesthetic successfully blurring the distinctions
between fantasy, imagination and reality. The ghostly tales interwined
with the narrative just purely enhance the films surrealism and parable
tone and offers some wonderful imagery and horror.I'm not going to spoil, but the director, unwilling to patronise his
audience, lets the viewer in on the secret mid-way all the while
encouraging speculation on the outcome whilst generating a genuine
concern and lament for the character.The two mains are wonderfully gifted actors, and the plot and narrative
is intelligently and masterfully structured, ultimately delivering a
sucker-punch of an ending. Boys in the Trees is a must-see for any of us who crave a little magic
and surrealism, but be warned, this is a parable with a strong message
about actions and consequences so don't expect a feel-good factor!
