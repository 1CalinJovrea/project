A Dumbed Down Kids Version

* Includes Spoilers *Just been to see Taken 3 at the cinema - not impressed at all. It
didn't feel like a Taken film, in the same way Die Hard 5 was nothing
like a Die Hard film.Performances were alright, but the script writing was notably bad and
the action scenes where heavily cut with each shot taken about 0.1- 0.2
seconds of screen time, a punch you'd be looking at 7-10 different
shots, including some of shadows or walls or fingers.There were no stand out action moments, at least not for the right
reasons, and no "MacGuyver" moments. Freight containers can apparently
fly into the sky if a lorry stops, cars can reverse at 100mph (or
160km/h), the best of the best, most paranoid, CIA super soldiers
forget to lock the front door of there house. Super Spetsnaz (or
spetnats in the film) soldiers evidentially can't hit a target 10m in
front of them. Wounds heal on dead people and form a nice scar only
hours after being killed and there is no blood at all, whether you've
fallen off a building, been stabbed with a bottle or shot in the liver.I'm boring myself just writing about it.Not the worst film, decent production values, but it's slow, uneventful
and catered for the 12 rated audience.
