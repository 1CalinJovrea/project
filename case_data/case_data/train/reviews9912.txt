Beyond awful

I liked the previous movies of the franchise. They were decent action
flicks, exactly something you go to watch in a cinema with friends. But
this? This is beyond awful, it's worse than a parody. Every line is a
clich√©, the acting is not even mediocre, the plot line is exactly like
something a 12 year old boy has come up with.There's no way the 10 star reviews are NOT paid. This movie is an
insult to anyone who pays to see it.
