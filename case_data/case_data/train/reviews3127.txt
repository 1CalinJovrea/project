Unfunny

A far fetched story with very few laughs, barely watchable. The plot is
weak and and the performances rarely hit the tone. I started watching
it because "Bad Teacher" wasn't so bad and usually Jason Segel
portraits a good lovable loser, but this was a mistake from beginning
to end. Even the Jack Black's cameo was very unfortunate.After the first act the movie went straight down, and there was no
coming back from there. I was patiently waiting for the movie to pick
up at some point but it never happened. Even though the idea of losing
a sex video in the cyberspace is not such a bad premise for a movie the
poorly execution here do not provide a decent outcome. Even the title
is wrong, there is no tapes anymore. Avoid if possible.
