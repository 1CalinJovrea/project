This movie isn't sure what it wants to be. A straight out comedy, a
drama or a black comedy. For me it misses out on being a straight
comedy or a drama - and just about fits into the black comedy genre.I will say that the basic premise of the story is pretty good - fairly
original. You can pick holes in the story like moths on a blanket - too
many to mention.In some ways, it reminds me of Waking Ned Devine - a small town full of
bizarre characters (set in Australia). I don't feel able to recommend
you go the a movie theater to see it, but it is worth a watch on
Netflix or Red Box. I didn't dislike it, but I wanted to like it more.I feel that the movie would be better in the hands of a more
experienced Director.
