Excellent Night at the Movies

I had no idea what this movie was about, but decided to go because the
critics panned it but it got good reviews from viewers. This is a
wonderful story about some wonderful people in a very not so normal,
but loving family. And first and foremost, it is a STORY!!!! So you can
suspend your feelings of, "it just does not seem real to me"! It is
beautifully filmed; wonderful acting and character development! Your
feelings will run the gamut, but that is what excellent storytelling is
all about. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie!
