10
Brilliant

When you very nearly spray a mouthful of drink over the person in front
of you, its generally a good indicator the movie is pretty funny. The
sandwich joke had me in stitches! This movie doesn't rely on just a few
jokes to carry it, they maintain a subtle layer of humour throughout
and then have you in stitches with some brilliant jokes. The cast in
this movie are well picked, and Stu was brilliantly played by...well
Stu. Taiki Waititi & Jemaine Clement really get the whole dilemma of
everyday life as a vampire! Hopefully this gets picked up and the
masses get a chance to enjoy this wee gem. Loved this movie and would
definitely recommend it. Gave this a 10. A must see!!
