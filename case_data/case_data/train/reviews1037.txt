Funny purposeful movie ... recommend indeed :)

It's a fresh idea ,, new definitions and it's kinda purposeful which
makes it a bit exciting .. not the type of comedy where you laugh your
A$$ off ,, but it has more than a bunch of funny bits which made it
fine in that area. Ken Jeong appearance was one of the few of scenes
that intrigued me to keep on watching the movie, Hilarious man.. to be
fair ,, this project would look so much better as a TV movie or
probably as a series on CBS, and it could hit huge success, but the
idea of series based on these type of stories is not really new on TV
(like "Awkward" 6 seasons so far on MTV which is a success),, the plot
seemed entangled but it went toward a clear goals .. the writing looked
okay ,, tight in some parts but still it didn't help much to cover some
holes in the production as there were a couple of still scenes in the
mid of the movie.As for the cast ,, it was well picked .. again Ken Jeong in the
beginning of the movie ,, he was really funny ,, the girl from
"parenthood" ;) Mae Whitman she has flown up high to be really good
funny gal and all the other girls as well were fine,, Chris Wylde was
hilarious in the end of the movie :D ,, Robbie Amell really good acting
all popular and careless .. "you were nerdy on fire in the flash" :D
:D,, adding the lovable Allison Janney i think all of that crew made
the movie a bit more funny and well it helped out with the rating.Overall,, it is fresh enjoyable movie .. with a funny bits from another
perspective and not forgetting to shine a light on cyber bullying
problem.. so it is a recommended.
