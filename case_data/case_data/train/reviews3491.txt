What in the Hades was THAT

I can not believe, how bad this movie was - - - Script was boring,
clich√©d, and utterly lazy. Character development - - - - there was noneDirecting - - - the director knows crap about his jobThe plot was absolutely predictable, and boringActing - - - - The actors are good, but what they had to work with, was
utter tripe. Michael Caine - - - one of the best actors in my book - -
- Even he was struggling with this movie . . . I guess, even these
actors have bills to pay I can't imagine why in the world he decided to
do this movie - - - maybe he thought it will be fun."Chemistry" between the characters is forced, non existent. There was
absolutely no charm in any of them . . . CGI - - - it is not done properly, the scene at the beginning of the
movie, you can see, that it was made with a model of a B206 helicopter,
and the angle of a camera, to make it appear as it was real . . . .
Today if you can figure out this kind of tricks in the movie, the alarm
bells start ringing - - - I am actually watching the movie now, just after riding the giant bees
- - - The logic behind the island, and it's evolution It is the same as the
"holy bible" has - - - - Non existent, explanations are just thrown
there, for the sake of it. But come on, they could have thought better
logic behind the "science" of the island and evolution. I understand that in fantasy movies there is no great room for logic,
or explanation of certain things, but come on - - - - enough is enough
- - - - All in all - - - avoid this movie - - - I will stop watching it now,
cos I can't stand it anymore - - - - it is an utter Tripe - - - - This
kind of movies, are the reason I don't pay to see them in the cinema
anymore . . . .
