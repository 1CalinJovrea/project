The soul of Star Trek is fading very fast...

Watched this wretched movie last nite. The only good things: Nice to
see a tribute to Leonard Nimoy/Spock. Sorry, only one good thing.Action? Nope, not even the crash landing of the saucer, seen that
before. With no engines, tell me again how it got moving? Acting? Nope,
and I am getting tired of Bones (Karl Urban) constantly 'joking' with
Spock, way too forced and contrived. Give it up already.Kirk (Chris Pine) can motocross like a pro on convenient roads. Instant
action scenes that give me ADHD attacks.Bad guys? Nope, nothing new, seen in many other movies. Morphed human
goes berserk.Logic? None, why did Krall wait for the Enterprise to attack Yorktown?
Simon Pegg/Scotty, should stay in the engineering level and fix
nacelles or food replicators and definitely stop writing screenplays.If there is one more Star Trek movie like this, I am out forever as a
fan and will not watch beyond (pun intended) it.The soul is gone.
