Unique and hysterically funny!

Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the few auteurs left in Hollywood. He
gets to do what he desires, which makes me very happy. "Inherent Vice"
is like no other film that came out in 2014. It can't even be compared
to Oscar-bait movies like "The imitation game" or "The theory of
everything" (who I by the way have trouble separating).What the film focuses most on is the atmosphere, like most great films.
It's not really about the story, in fact the story gets harder and
harder to follow as the film progresses, but that's not the point. The
atmosphere creates this strange feeling inside of you and you get
caught up with the character's relationships with each other and the
strange situations surrounding them. It's a movie to re-watch (like
most of Andersons movies)."Inherent Vice" is hysterically funny. There aren't that many jokes,
but the situations themselves are incredibly funny. Much of the films
humor comes out of Joaquin Phoenix's performance. And of course I can't
forget about Josh Brolin, he is outrageous in this. The cast overall
did a terrific job.I think "Inherent Vice" is a huge step forward from Andersons last
movie "The Master". It's more playful, atmospheric, thematic. Don't go into the cinema expecting anything normal that you can just
watch to pass the time, expect something unique and something a bit too
puzzling. It's not a movie that you can take a leak during. I haven't read the book, and I probably won't, because I find the film
just so vivid and entertaining, I don't feel the urge to. Paul Thomas
Anderson challenges the way of mainstream filmmaking, and even though
this film probably won't achieve either award-success nor
audience-acclaim, I think it should. Well done, Mr. Anderson!
