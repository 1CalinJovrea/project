Unfilmable story

Filth, the novel, was exciting and experimental, but because there are
so many extremes in it, it is very difficult to sanitise it for a movie
going audience. How do you make a talking tapeworm work on film? It is
a character in the book. Very difficult. Compromises had to be made and
some of the racism, sexism, homophobia etc etc had to be toned down if
not cut out completely. I watched the film at a local (noisy) theatre. The performances were
decent and the film was passable as pale reflection of the book, but I
felt there were many edited cuts in the film which were bizarre. At one
point David Soul (starring as a taxi driver) started singing his big
pop hit from the 70's "Silver Lady". Jim Broadbent as Dr Rossi popped
in and out of the film without much explanation of why he and Bruce
"Robbo" Robertson were having these one to one sessions. Inspector Bob
Toal is trying to write a book but it doesn't tie up with the rest of
the film. Luckily I have read the book before and know the story well,
but if I hadn't, I think I would be a bit confused. Stealing the show for me, is John Sessions as Chief Inspector Toal. He
captures the character of the book as a traditional white police
officer out of date in a modern world.
