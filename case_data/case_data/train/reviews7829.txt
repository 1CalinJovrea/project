Not worth your money

Most annoying movie, period. Don't waste your money! I had to watch it
for a class. It's about a girl and her friends continuously causing trouble for
their neighbors and maintenance guy. And somehow they get a way everrry
single time. No lessons are learned. But I blame the mother of the
girl, who's a bad influence and can't seem to change. Yet it ends
somehow in an ideal candy-wrapped fashion. Nothing gained, nothing
achieved. The characters themselves have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
Moreover, this movie has no heart, just a flat story line, not much
plot, bad acting (except Willem Dafoe), weak dialogue, and just
emptiness. The cinematography is also kinda messy: a lot of tracking shots from
behind and awkward framing. (I get it's supposed to be voyeuristic look
but come on, this is a visual medium, man. At least make it somewhat
decent). Also, the sound design isn't that smooth. Very noisy and
rocky.There was Q&A with the director, cinematographer and actors after the
movie. The director apparently strove to capture the feeling of
childhood (and also because -fun fact- he liked the Little Rascals).
I'm sorry man, but this movie fails to deliver.
