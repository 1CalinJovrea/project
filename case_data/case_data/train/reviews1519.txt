Don't waste your money ...it's time to stop supporting his crap flicks

Shyamalan again disappoints. Idk if I can even say I have spoilers the
movie was so boring me and my girlfriend nodded off several
times....this guy shouldn't be allowed to make movies anymore. This was
like watching golf without the ball ...his therapist ignores signs of
of his erratic behavior for nearly 90 percent of the movie ...the lead
girl has flash backs of her creepy rapist uncle in a truly unnecessary
and lame sub plot. Why not focus on the main plot or making the
audience feel the women are in some real danger. It's teased
relentlessly that Macao's character is evolving into the beast but when
he becomes the beast literally nothing happens..... the plot is trash
and I am done paying to see this guy's. Horrible movies ..just like the
happening and so many other movies don't waste your money
