Keeps you engaged throughout - Good story

Loved the way the movie started and the climax, although was understood
after a point of time, had some suspense.I will recommend this movie. Loved the scene where 2 airplanes misses
each other by a whisker( for viewing experience). The actress is
portrayed as a beautiful professional lady. The series of pattern is
also quite interesting.
