A script as phony as the world it skewers

The good: The animal and the kid are wonderful. Okja, the CGI
character, is marvelously executed, and feels the most alive of the
entire cast.The bad: This script needed a few more passes  and a harsher editor 
before it went into production.The movie aims to be a sharp satire of corporate greed and gung-ho
animal rights activism, but its satirical knife is dull. It has nothing
perceptive or unexpected to say about any of its characters, and little
wit to say it with.Satirizing the amoral executives should be like shooting fish in a
barrel, but their dialogue sounds like a 14 year old's idea of
corporate-speak. Satirizing the gonzo animal rights activists should
likewise yield some loving farce, but the movie is so thoroughly of
their party it finds itself unable to laugh at them for long and
instead meanders into hagiography.Good satire comes with an "aha" moment, when in the midst of laughter
we find ourselves face to face something surprising and uncomfortable,
but so viscerally true it is undeniable. This movie does not have that.
All of its shots at uncomfortable truth feel familiar, and tired. Both
its thin humor and its disturbing visuals are built of tropes, not
insights.The two wonderful main characters can't save this film. Its final
destination is ham-handed vegan propaganda, with neither the levity nor
the surprise to make that propaganda hit home for anyone who doesn't
already subscribe to it.Which is a shame: the movie is reaching for hard truths about greed,
food production, and the harm people do by forcibly imposing their
moral compass on others. Somewhere in this phony script is a much
better movie that actually manages to grasp those truths.
