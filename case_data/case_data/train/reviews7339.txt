The first Lego movie I didn't like

** This movie is politically correct and contains gender politics ***
The first Lego movie was different from the other movies around at the
time. It contained a stream of quick witted jokes and it wasn't afraid
to laugh at its characters. The Lego batman movie followed in a similar
vein, even down to similar flaws in the characters across both movies.Then came the ninjago movie. The trailers were excellent, but the movie
used the same basic formula. There's a significant male character who
is out of touch with his emotional side who continues to skirt the line
between being conscious and an ignorant jerk all the way through the
movie. Add a lead female character who tells you men are all sexist
(like every other Hollywood movie says today - you know, where the
writers/directors should actually hold a mirror to themselves as to who
is really sexist because they play identity politics constantly).For the first three quarters of this movie, you won't give two hoots
about any character. There's no emotion, there's no soul. It's like
watching a video game (or the Matrix Part 2, "Reloaded"). In the last
quarter, the story comes together and you start to feel for the
characters, too little, too late.Don't let the trailer fool you. You've also been warned of the usual
Hollywood identity politics (all men are sexist). We really don't need
such propaganda in our children's movies. Spare your kids from the
sexist propaganda and save your money and avoid wasting your 1.5 hours.And Hollywood, stop making me have to screen movies before i'll let my
children watch them. It's getting tiring. Keep your sexism to yourself.
