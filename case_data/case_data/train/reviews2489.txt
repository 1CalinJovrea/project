Awful

Six high-school friends are chatting through Skype when they receive a
message from their former friend Laura Barns, who committed suicide
after watching a footage in Internet showing her completely wasted.
They believe it is a troll, but soon they learn that something
supernatural is happening. Further, their dirty little secrets are
exposed while they are mysteriously murdered one by one."Unfriended", a.k.a. "Cybernatural", is among the worst movies ever
made. The idea of a group of friends in front of monitors is only to
make an extremely annoying low-budget movie. The great mystery is how
there are viewers that write reviews promoting this terrible flick. My
vote is one.Title (Brazil): "Desprotegido" ("Unprotected")
