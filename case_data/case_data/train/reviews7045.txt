Age of exhaustion......

After Bay made his poisonous 'Arthouse' movie, he comes back with all
guns blazing with this, the fourth in possibly the worst franchise of
all time.All Transformers are now classed as a threat, so Frasier is leading a
literal headhunt for the remaining robots,mot clear the world of aliens
and to put more human in humanity.But he has an ulterior motive of course. Stanley Tucci wants the
Transformers metal, so he can introduce a new product called, wait for
it, Transformium, to build his own army of robots to bring world peace.But silly old Marky Mark has decided to work with Bay again, and
inadvertently buys Optimus Prime off some bloke for 150 dollars.And there's two and a half hours of this......As expected, I hated this film, I wasn't looking forward to it, but I
give any film a chance. I like the majority of the directors work. I
think The Island is a hoot, and The Rock is still one of the best
action movies of the last twenty years, but since the first
Transformers, I feel like he couldn't give a damn about the audience,
as he knows that they will pay to see this anyway.Heaven knows why the film is as long as it is, its a film about robots
fighting other robots, and at 160 plus minutes, I really think he's
bitten off far more than he can chew. The film is written horribly, the
script is laughably horrid, and the film wreaks of stereotypes, racial
ignorance and is awfully sexist toward females.The action scenes are all confusing, and again, for the fourth time in
a row, you cannot make out who is fighting who, and it's just more of
that at the end.I was so close to walking out around the ninety minute mark, and
although lots will say, 'well what did you expect?' Or 'leave your
brain at the door', well allow me to retort, I expect to be entertained
when watching a movie, not offended, and as for the leave your
brain.... Statement, that's just for people who are in denial at just
how bad the film actually is.But to console my self, after the film, I had a Bud Light, bought some
Beats Speakers, Gucci Sunglasses, my girlfriend some Victorias Secret
underwear, and my daughter a My Little Pony.......I can't for the life
of me understand why, probably some subliminal advertising I saw
somewhere.The cinematic equivalent of a portaloo, and the biggest mistake I've
ever made going to the cinema.
