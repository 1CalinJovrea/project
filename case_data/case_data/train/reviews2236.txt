Either you get it or you don't

You have to have a certain sense of humor to get this movie. Seth
McFarlaine has a kind of sense of humor that isn't universal. I
actually understand why some don't get this movie. That's fine, but
don't pontificate and say this movie sucks just because you're the type
of person who is easily offended. Yes, it is offensive, but you should
have known that going in. If not, it's not the movie's fault. So many
fat assholes on IMDb who think they know what a good movie should be. I
love classics, deep love stories, the better comedies, and also
alternative newer movies. This is alternative. Either understand it or
just leave it alone.
