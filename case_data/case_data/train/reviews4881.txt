One of the worst movies I've seen so far...

Nothing in this movie seem to line up at all...the fight scenes are
somewhere between kung fu panda and save private Ryan...the
gun-handling is terrible as well as the tactics what makes even me as a
civilian question the consulting and supervision on set. what the heck
is Ben kingsley doing there? who is that guy from riddick jumping
around with curved blades? he survived attack on him so where was he
the remaining movie? the second riddick guy - or is that him? how is he
supposed to fight between gunmen with blades? kingsley commanded 2
snipers on position. one was taken out by bond-eras with a mateba 357
(prevously referred to as an FN 57) on a distance that looked something
around 300 yds. but where is the second guy...just vanished? how the
hack didn't the snipers see the mall cops lighting a couch on the malls
rooftop?an how the hell is banderas surviving a hit by a snipers .50 cal?bollywood for retards
