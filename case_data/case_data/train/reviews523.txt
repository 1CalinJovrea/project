Very Interesting Plot, Fun Movie

This film follows a man named Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg) and his story
after being granted the ability to get whatever he wishes for by a
group of aliens as an experiment.This film had some great advertisements that interested me to watch
this film. Its plot line alone, the ability to grant any wish you have
to come true, had me intrigued. The film does a good job at keeping the
'wonder' feel going throughout the film. The missing two stars are
because i just feel so much more could of been done in this film and
there were many opportunities to branch out and do different stuff, but
most of the time they kept it simple. A few of his wishes were clever
and mad me really wonder 'what would i wish for?' but some were far too
simple.I won't spoil it because this is spoiler free, but the ending to this
film isn't as good as the first half of the film. That was probably the
weakest part. You won't walk out of this movie thinking 'Oh my gosh
Simon Pegg just delivered the best performance in his entire career'
but, that does not mean it was bad. the acting was good, the editing
was fine as well and overall, i recommend this film on a rainy day as
entertainment to pass the time. I doubt it will be the best film you
have ever seen but you will have a fun time with it. 8/10
