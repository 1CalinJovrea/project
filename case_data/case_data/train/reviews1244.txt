A Simple Story saved by an Eerie Atmosphere

* TBD is an interesting film that is GUARANTEED to polarize horror
lovers. It's a very simple narrative from a story standpoint, but what
it lacks in narrative it's saved in spades by atmosphere and mystery.
This is more of a psychological-thriller than a splatter-fest or
hack-and-slash.* So let's get the obvious out of the way, yes, it's a slow movie. It's
a slow burn and I'd even say the climax is rather tame (not lame) in
terms of gore/excitement/reward. Yes, it builds to a somewhat bloody
climax but it's not balls to the wall crazy, so I'm afraid some will
think the slow burn 70 minute build up isn't worth the wait. * The movie is a classic case of style over substance. The gray color
palette and dreary snow gives the movie its potent atmosphere. Throw in
a great soundtrack/score (note: the music isn't like "It Follows" where
you can listen to individual tracks). This movie's music perfect
compliments specific scenes and builds some tension. It's a great
addition even if it's not something I would go to Youtube and listen to
compared to other horror soundtracks.* This is a good slow burn horror movie, it's not perfect (mostly
because the story is bare bones), but it's definitely watchable thanks
to the three female leads. All of them are fantastic! So if you think
you can handle a slow burn (with a more thought provoking climax
opposed to a splatter fest) then this is something you should check
out!
