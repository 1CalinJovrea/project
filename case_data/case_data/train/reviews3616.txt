Michael Shannon is Cold as Ice

The Iceman was an amazing, gritty, and gruesome movie that portrays
death unlike other films. Michael Shannon continues to showcase his
acting prowess as Richard Kuklinski. As Kuklinski continues to kill he
becomes increasingly addicted by his gruesome actions, and like most
addicts Kuklinski has masterfully concealed his secret life from his
loved ones. But unlike other psychopathic killers, Kiklinski is
motivated by a basic human trait, which is to support his family.
Although being a hit-man is not an ideal profession, it does have a
huge cash reward.The movie does an excellent job portraying Kuklinski's tragic dilemma
and to top things off Shannon's chilling performance glued me to the
edge of my sofa. But this film does have some faults. Some of the secondary characters
are a bit shallow and some scenes tend to drag on a little bit. But
these are just little knit picks to an overall outstanding movie.
