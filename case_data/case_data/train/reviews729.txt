Disturbing on so many levels. The layers of fear in this are palpable.

Watching this movie, you get this sense that something isn't right. It
doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the film, but the
underlying themes presented within. The story of a demonic force that
uses a persons talents as a means to channel evil is pretty original,
but the way that the story just burrows under your skin like a lesion
is just the tip of the iceberg. The acting is great, and each character
carriers a nuance that is hard to find in the horror genre. The script
is subdued, but what it lacks in any depth it more than makes up for in
creep-factor. Like watching a satanic ritual as you hide in a corner,
unseen, this movie forces you to witness madness, and how art can be
used to channel some twisted and diseased emotions.This movie is reminiscent of The VVItch, in that both feature no real
blood or gore, but still manage to disturb to the highest degree. The
is no overt violence, but the few scenes that show it are haunting. I
watched this film three nights ago and I am still thinking about it.
That guitar riff has been sneaking its way into my dreams, and that in
itself is an accomplishment. This is not a movie for everyone, and gore
hounds will be sorely disappointed. What it is, however, is a private
look into the mind of those affected with psychosis, and how the world
seems to bend and warp around you as you battle mental illness.
