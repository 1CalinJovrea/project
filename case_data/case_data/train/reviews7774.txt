Disappointing, anticlimactic, and silly

A Cure for Wellness promised so much. It had an intriguing trailer and
an intriguing first half. It promised to go down a similar lane to
Shutter Island, where a mystery would be unfurled and explain the
mysterious moments sprinkled throughout the film. However, as it
becomes more absurd and more mysterious as the movie moves on, there
comes a moment when realisation sinks in. Realisaiton that the story
was not thought out, and it had come to an absurd turn that explains
little, and attempts a feeble attempt at incestuous and immortal depth.
Instead, it is a farce, riddled with silliness and questionable
motives. Dane DeHaan shows poor talent in A Cure For Wellness and the
character could have been more fleshed by any other actor. Jason Isaacs
plays a similar role to the villain he is becoming accustomed to in OA,
and the Harry Potter Franchise. Whilst he maintains a strong presence,
it is becoming an eye-rolling ordeal. Gore Verbinski once made decent
films, but he seems to be rolling down-hill with this tragic effort. A
Cure for Wellness will leave nothing but a feeling of being cheated and
shocked that something could promise so much, and delivery so little.
