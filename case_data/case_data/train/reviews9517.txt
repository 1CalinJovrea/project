Eli Roth's attempt to create a CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST movie is a complete failure

The greatest achievement of "Cannibal holocaust" was its success in
creating a sense of authenticity and atmosphere of savagery, danger and
fear. "The Green Inferno" completely lacks all of them.This movie is the result of bad direction, acting, effects and editing
and a most predictable and bad plot.The film opens in a most unnecessary and amateurish tiny pre-credits
scene that foreshadows the poor job the entire has to offer and sums up
many of its bad elements: Scenes that were obviously shot in different
times and locations and were edited together into a single scene,
spoon- feeding the audience, over-dramatization in the wrong place and
going the wrong way by showing the savages from THEIR point of view
instead of showing it from the point of view of the "visitors" (as was
done artfully in "Cannibal holocaust").After the much-expected wasting of over 40 minutes in unnecessary plot,
full of terrible amateurish acting and bad writing and direction, the
movie starts its "gory" part: A plane, that takes off from one
location, suddenly flies conveniently above a jungle. As expected, it
crashes in one of the most poorly directed plane crashes I remember
seeing in a movie. It is then that you realize that the gory effects of
this movie are so poorly made, that they all look completely fake and
staged. At that point, the movie also suddenly changes style and is
shot in a "commando" style, in which the camera shakes and frequently
goes out of focus, all done in a very obvious way that contribute
nothing to the authenticity of the film.Everything in this movie looks staged. Quite a lot of the violence is
done completely off-screen and the stuff that is shown either looks
completely fake or is done with lots of quick and bad editing - and all
accompanied by fake and inappropriate reactions.The amateurish aspect of this movie includes lack of coverage (e.g.:
the river escape scene), sloppy direction (e.g.: a kid slashes the
throat of a guy that is at least a meter above his reach), silly
situations (e.g.: people escaping while everyone around them doesn't
notice that) and maybe worst of all - being dramatic in the wrong
parts, including over-dramatic music and over the top, yet completely
unbelievable reactions.The lead actress cries in almost every scene. Her acting is over the
top and doesn't let you suspend your disbelief even for a moment during
the entire movie.While "Cannibal holocaust" wasn't a perfect film and had its flaws,
"The Green Inferno" only comes to show how good it was in comparison.Over 30 years after "Cannibal holocaust" was made, Eli Roth shows that
he didn't learn anything from Ruggero Deodato's movie-making and the
best he can do is giving Deodato a cameo in "Hostel 2".You have to be blind in order to take this movie seriously.
