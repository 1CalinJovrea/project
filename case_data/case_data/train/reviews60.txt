You get what you expect

I am guessing the main reason to watch this movie is the cast, and it
delivers. Everything you would expect to be there, is there - in full.Dialogue is a bit stilted, but then again: to be expected. Acting and
story also not amongst the strengths of this flick.All in all: one of the breast movies of 2017.
