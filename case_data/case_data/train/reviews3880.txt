Huge Disappointment!!!!!

1. For those who have read the book:This movie should not even have the honor of having the same title as
the book. There are approximately 4 characters that are the same, and
that is just because of their names. The storyline is in no way similar
to the book. All movies that are based on book face the criticism of those who have
read the book. The usual is that some things are left out due to a time
constraint, a scene or two may be added in for Hollywood drama, or
characters may look different due to the expectations of movie
goers...This movie does not follow the usual. There is literally
nothing that is the same. The characters personalities and intentions
are completely different, there is a storyline that runs throughout the
movie that does not exist in the book, and there is a "main" character
in the movie that Does Not exist in the book. It is a disgrace that the
author of the book would create a screenplay that does not only do
injustice to the book, but is Not even similar to the book. 2. For those who have not read the book:If you have not read the book, then storyline does not matter near as
much because you don't know what happened. From a movie standpoint, the
acting is sub-par, the CGI is Terrible, and the production (of which I
was sadly disappointed in Tim Burton) was choppy and looks like it
could have been done by a high school student. All in all it is a movie
that is not worthing watching, let alone pay for. Disappointing.
