One of the best films I've seen

I loved this film. I perfect balance of story, humour and sincerity
along with excellent acting and a wonderful cast. Even the soundtrack
was superb. Not your average time travel movie. Very thought provoking
and one which tugged at the old tear ducts in the best way. Some
reviews complain about how it is like this or that film. No film is
unique, and for sure there are similarities with other Richard Curtis
films, but that is all. Plus to be compared to other great films is
surely an honour. Forget about all that and enjoy what is a great film
which will inspire you in ways you were not expecting. Thoroughly
enjoyable and I'm already looking forward to going to see it again.
That doesn't happen very often.
