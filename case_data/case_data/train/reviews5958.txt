Not so bad if you wan't to lose appetite

It feels like Seth M. Sherwood, Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury,
have only watched One flew over the cuckoo's nest, The silence of the
lambs, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and a lots of Mexican Telenovelas
(because of the plots), and than they decided to make this movie. But
still great makeup, and costumes, lots of blood and horrendous scenes,
just like some decent horror should have.
