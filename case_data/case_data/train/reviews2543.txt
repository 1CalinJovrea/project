"Lincoln" & Daniel Day Lewis Incredible.. Warning:not an action film

Just read some of the "bad" reviews & simply just don't get how you
can't like this GREAT MOVIE. Spielberg's "Lincoln" was AWESOME. The
Director was able to take you "Back In Time" when things were much
simpler & primitive, way back in the 1860's. And Daniel Day Lewis moved
me in this film like no other actor has ever done. Mr. Lewis'
performance was mesmerizing and spellbinding. He was "Abraham Lincoln."
His acting in this movie is definitely "Best Actor/Academy Award
Worthy."Lincoln" was not directed or produced with the main intention to
deliver an Action "Civil" War Movie concentrating on horrific action
battle scenes. If you want mainly entertaining action scenes then James
Bond & "Skyfall" should be your pick. I'm sure it is also an awesome
film. I want to see "Skyfall" also. But "Lincoln" was my first pick of
the holiday blockbuster season.Stephen Spielberg, designed this Movie to specifically concentrate on
"The Man" Abraham Lincoln: Our 16th President of the United States. And
how Mr. Lincoln helped end the CIVIL WAR and at the same time Abolish
Slavery in our United States of America in the last few but Very
Important months of this Great Man's Life. Daniel Day-Lewis helped show
the truly human sides of Abraham Lincoln. I Admire and Honor Abraham Lincoln even more so after viewing this
Film.
