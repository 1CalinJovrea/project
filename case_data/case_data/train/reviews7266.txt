I loved it!

Low budget, but high quality sci-fi film. It focused on the characters
and the story and it had real world building - no pun intended. The
ending was really great, can't say why or I will spoil it. Enough to
say that it leaves room for more volumes.Imagine a cross between Alien 3, Screamers and Elisium and you get this
film. The acting was solid, the effects really well done, yet minimal,
the plot kept me going and the structure of the movie, with out of
sequence episodes gave it a fresh feel.If it weren't for some clich√©s, this could have been close to perfect
in my book. You need to watch it.
