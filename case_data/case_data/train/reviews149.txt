Meh

In the beginning I was surprised because the movie sounded very unique
(at least I have never seen any horror movie that develops from the
autopsy of q victims corpse) which I thought was hard for an horror
movie as the genre feels like a broken record. However I was very
disappointed at how it was all wrapped up, it's kind of lazy to wrap it
up with witchcraft and call it a day. They had an original concept in
my eyes, wouldn't be hard to make a crime scene reconstitution or
something of the sort to make it more interesting. Also, the whole
family story and cat thing seem very random and unnecessary to me, if
it was to explain the fact that he volunteered to suffer for his son,
well, the fact he is his son pretty much explains it, so the time spend
trying to give the characters some dept wasn't used wisely.
