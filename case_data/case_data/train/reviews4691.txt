nonsense; waste of time; disappointment

I hardly ever write movie reviews.But I felt strongly about writing one for this movie to warn others.I feel cheated out of 2hrs and 20mins of my life.This movie was a big mystery throughout, but I kept on waiting and
waiting for the big "revelation," hoping that it would be worth waiting
for.What a disappointment.I should have trusted the low ratings. Foolish me. I should've checked
the box office too. I just did. It failed big time.How did this story become a movie? It's premise is atrocious and
nonsensical.I can't believe I wasted my time.Please do yourself a big favor - don't waste your time with this one.
