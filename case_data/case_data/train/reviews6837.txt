great true survival story

you will be able to tell soon enough that this true story has a good
ending if you know nothing about the main character and it is worth
watching. i recommend it for the reasons of the choices he made that
saved his life and the love of his mother that did not give up and as
well as he did not give up with all the way to his last conscious
moment. sometimes when we accept our life choice, we forgive ourselves
and make peace, the miracle happens.
