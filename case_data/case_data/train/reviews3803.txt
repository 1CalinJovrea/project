Much better than Monster's University!

What a delight.After being put off by the terrible terrible MU,i was
double happy to see this.It definitely lived up to the original.I
really loved it.When i read the plot for the first time,i thought they
were going to side the three girls.But they did not.The jokes were
laugh out loud,both for kids and adults.The animation has to be the
most beautiful thing of this movie.The colors,environment,everything
was just too cheerful.I don't care if they make a 100 movies,but if
everyone is as beautiful as this,i won't mind watching every single of
it.I'm so happy that i grossed 850+M.I really don't get all the hate so
much.I want this to win Oscar,not MU.I can't say anything because Pixar
always does magic,but this time,DM2 stole that magic!
