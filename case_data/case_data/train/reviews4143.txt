Glorification of Drugs

This movie ranks at the very top of my list of all time stinkers. It's
supposed to be a Christmas comedy but is mostly about indiscriminately
taking drugs leading to sweating and bleeding out your nose into
someone's drink. If that is supposed to be funny then I'm missing
something. The whole movie is geared to the mental midget crowd that
only find things funny when their excessively gross, slapstick, and
something a two year old would do. Sorry folks Seth Rogan is not a
funny person. Stupid is not funny. I usually don't put spoilers in my
reviews but this movie moves me to do so. With so many people dying of
accidental overdoses due to taking drugs without knowing what's in them
I just don't see the point in a big star like Rogan turning it into a
comedy and a Christmas one at that. Some lame brain may argue this was
a buddy movie but it was just too stupid to be anything but absolute
crap. And speaking of crap, given a choice of a free DVD of this movie
or a bag of Doggy doo I'd take the Doggy doo and thank you.
