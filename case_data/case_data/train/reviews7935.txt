Unamusing Garbage

This was one of the worst films I have seen of any genre of movies in a
long time. There was little to know story line. It seems the entire
film was one giant fight between an incompatible married couple. There
was absolutely no point to this movie. And for a comedy/drama- there
wasn't even one funny scene. This was an utter waste of time. I almost fell asleep during the entire
film. It made me hate life (and myself for watching it)- the characters
were so stupid, unlikable, and completely bland. I always finish a
movie I start, I have never had so much trouble wanting to shut
something off so badly than I did with this movie. My overall thought of the movie-this film tried to hard to do something
with nothing (and failed miserably).
