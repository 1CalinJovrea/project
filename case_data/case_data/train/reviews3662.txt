It's actually kinda fun

I have to admit I'm coming to this film as someone who has never seen
the original movie or read the book, therefore, I enjoyed it possibly
more than someone who knows the story. The material itself never really
deviated much from what one would expect from the story (or so I've
been told after discussing the film with friends who actually know the
background story), so there's that.I thought the movie didn't take itself too seriously and that helped
convey a sense of amusement. The liberties that were taken with the
traditional zombie lore also helped to make this movie far more
engaging than I would've expected.
