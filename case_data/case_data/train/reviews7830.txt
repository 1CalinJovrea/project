I enjoyed the movie

I am not very familiar with Tim Burton's work (only watched a handful
of his movies), neither have I read the book, so I will review this
movie as it is, without comparing it to the usual craftsmanship of Mr.
Burton nor the characters or events as depicted in the source material.I found the movie entertaining, and at no point did I wonder "How long
more is this going to be?" Any movie that never prompts me to ask this
question automatically gets a 6 out of 10.Many reviews mentioned about huge plot holes in the movie, but I never
really understood what the plot holes were that make this a terrible
movie. I thought the story was quite easy to follow, even with all the
time loops, and makes sense in the make-believe world that we are
watching. I usually have trouble making sense of time- travel stories,
so the ability to simplify complicated concepts and making it easy to
understand for me deserves another star for intelligence. Though
probably it wasn't easy enough for a seven year-old to comprehend.I also thought the soundtrack was quite good, I actually stayed till
the credits finished rolling to enjoy the music. This, along with the
camera work, gets another star to make it 8 out of 10.To be honest, if the voting score is in increment of 0.5, I would be
more inclined to vote it 7.5 out of 10. I don't expect character
development for all the "peculiar children" in a movie like this (that
would perhaps be more fitting for a drama series), but the acting can
be improved. Eva Green has the best "on-screen presence", but she
doesn't appear until 30 minutes into the movie, so a bit of patience is
necessary. Also I found the editing a bit too abrupt at some points,
but that's about all the complaints I have.I am quite satisfied with the movie, considering the amount of bad
reviews I have been exposed to. :)
