Utter, utter crap what are people watching??!

Spoilers - but seriously that in itself is a joke, the plot, acting,
and script is so insanely stupid it cannot be spoiled any further.With so many good reviews I can only think that its the emperors new
clothes effect, oh look its semi Korean sort of, and has oh such
important things to say about humanity so it must be good! Get a
goddamn grip people its just sh*t! I love post apocalyptic films,
social satires and commentaries so this looked good on paper. Apart
from the whole humanity on a train thing, I mean that just sounds
stupid and pointless. But I was sure that would get explained in some
clever way soon into the film. It wasn't. Nothing was. At all. There is
no point to this film. The whole plot comes to zero.Putting aside the stupidity of the premise that a train could run for
17 years in a frozen dead world where track maintenance guys are all
dead, and of course the premise that living on a rapidly moving train
would somehow be better than building a base, the plot holes in EVERY
frikkin scene is staggering. Continuity is non existent. The heroes are
fighting a horde of people on second, the next they have simply
disappeared.The rich have meat and wine from thin air, and party on drugs. No-one
does any useful work apart from about 5 conductor types. The poor do
absolutely nothing apart from whine about oppression. The speeches
given by Tilda and Ed Harris are so monumentally derivative and dumbed
down its insulting, apart from which they make no practical sense in
reality. Ed Harris must be desperate. John Hurt even more so.The hero ends up derailing and entire train, killing everyone except a
teenage girl and a 5 year old. They have approximately 10 minutes to
live as they've just seen a polar bear who is probably very hungry.
Well done hero guy! I've just wasted 2 hours of my life. Don't waste
yours.
