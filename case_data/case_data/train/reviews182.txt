Why bother on originality when the execution is so well-handed?

There are multiple plot strands from other films gathered into a union.
I won't give you any hint but you'll get it when you see it. Nowadays,
movies are short on originality. But, in this case, you won't give a
thing about it. Premise: An inexperience military officer was sent to war to fight an
alien race invading the earth. In the middle of the battlefield, he got
into an accident which causes him to go into time- loop that repeats
each moment when he dies.The basis of the plot looks familiar... That could be a big problem. On
the contrary, it succeeded to provide a big summer blockbuster
satisfaction. The pacing is perfect, the acting is perfect. Oh, and did
i mention the effects? It was ragin'!See this movie with low expectations (2D or 3D doesn't matter)...
