Really nice family film

Great show, held my attention and warmed my heart! This is not an
action, shoot em up show. Just a little cursing. No nudity. Just the
presentation of a dilemma of life and the love for a growing, young
girl. Excellent acting and filming. The best movie I've seen in a long
time.
