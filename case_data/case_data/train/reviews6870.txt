Terrible

Portman gives a great performance and she carries the impersonation of
Jackie very well but this movie is a snooze-fest. It's like the same
scene is being played over and over in different locations with
different people, so after the first 10 minutes, you feel like you've
seen it all before. I didn't learn anything new from this movie. It's
exactly what you expect would have happened. Husband gets assassinated
whilst sitting next to her. She is wracked with grief and a complete
emotional wreck but does her best to hold it together. She deliberates
over what sort of funeral there should be. The End.
