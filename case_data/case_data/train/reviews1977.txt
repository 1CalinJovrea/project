Edward Woodward will be rolling in his grave

I'd been really looking forward to this film since I first saw the
trailers around six months ago. An intellectually-untaxing revenge
plot, a reboot of a classic 80s TV show from my childhood, and, to cap
it all off, a fine actor in the lead part. However, it was something of
a let-down in the end. Denzel Washington was fine, and Chloë Grace
Moretz did well for such a young actress. But the script and the
writing were simply horrible and gave them too few good scenes to work
with, and some ridiculous choices to portray plausibly.Without giving too much of the plot away, the final scene in particular
turns into something of an unintentional farce. Denzel kills a guy with
a *drill* at one point, FFS. What's the matter, McCall? You had two
hours of setup plot to realise these that guys were experts and were
coming at you tooled up, but you still decided to prepare for facing
them like an unfortunate cross between MacGyver and Tim Taylor from
Home Improvement? Oh, and, apparently former Spetznas soldiers have
criminal tattoos all over their bodies. Just, you know, to badass them
up a bit.All-in-all, this is about the laziest and most cliché-ridden screen
writing I've ever seen. I've seen worse, but not often. I generally
like mindless vengeance movies like Taken and Die Hard. And I loved
Edward Woodward's underplayed version of this same character. I don't
recommend seeing this one if you usually enjoy that genre of film, or
like me have fond memories of the 1980s TV series. Get the box set of
the original and rent some Liam Neeson movies instead is my advice.
