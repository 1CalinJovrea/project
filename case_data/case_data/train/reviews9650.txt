Great horror comedy if you understand that its COMEDY

OK so i see a lot of hate for this movie and its clear most people
don't understand it. Its a comedy. Its very good at what its trying to
do. My wife and i were in tears laughing at this movie, we thought it
was one of the funniest we have seen in years. If you like horror
comedy than this is for you. If you have a weak sense of humor or are
easily grossed out don't even bother. You ll just add to the perception
that its not a good movie which isn't true. Just don't take it
seriously like the idiots around here and you'll love it. God i saw one
review complaining about how the end could never legally happen. Duh.
Its a joke. Great movie. 10/10 if your not an idiot.
