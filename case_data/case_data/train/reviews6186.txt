Absolutely disappointing

While I don't think it's "One of the worst movies ever made", or
"appalling", as some critics have said. But I must say that I was
really disappointed with Absolutely Anything, because I had such high
hopes for this movie to be great just by the cast behind the movie and
the director, but it didn't reach my expectations has I wanted. What's
more sad is that this is the very last Robin Williams performance (He
voices the dog in the movie).Not once did I laugh or even smile. It was very predictable and not
that original when it comes to the story. Simon Pegg dose make a
likable main character and Robin Williams dose a great job voicing the
dog named "Dennis". But what's more crushing is that The Monty Python
crew were involved in making this movie, because they wrote it, stared
in it and one of them directed it.Overall Absolutely Anything isn't awful, but nowhere near great or
good.
