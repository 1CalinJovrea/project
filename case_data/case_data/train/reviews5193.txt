What a Great Surprise

I hadn't planned on seeing this film (I feel we are over-saturated with
animated films these day, most of them mediocre), but I looked on as my
kids watched it. This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of
prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live
side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and
order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male
dominated police force. She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes
sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and
eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom
she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter
napping. In the process, she reveals her own prejudices and hurts her
partner. The movie has stunning animation and intelligent dialogue and
lots of social references. Very good stuff.
