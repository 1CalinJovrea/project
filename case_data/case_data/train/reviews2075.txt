Easily the best War Movie since "Saving Private Ryan" only an actual story.

If you read the book and heard the interviews with the actual "lone
survivor" you know that this movie got as close to the real events as
possible. The 4 actors really gave it their all. Beginning long before
shooting when they started their training so they would look realistic.
This movie is also the most visceral experience since "Saving Private
Ryan". There were falls in this movie that actually hurt more just
watching than when I broke my foot 2 years ago. And in the making of
you see that crazy stunt people actually did those falls, supposedly
without dying. It's of course impossible to spoil this movie given it's
title but it's important to note that the guy who helped him risked his
whole village for "The Americans" Safety. And he didn't think twice
about it. Sometimes we forget that not all of them are Taliban. After
all is said and done this is a must see if there ever was one.
