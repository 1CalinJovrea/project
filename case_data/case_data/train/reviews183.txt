Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Vampires

The teenagers Rose Hathaway (Zoey Deutch) and Vasilisa "Lissa" Dragomir
(Lucy Fry) are best friend and escapee from the St. Vladimir's Academy
for more than one year. When the guardian Dimitri Belikov (Danila
Kozlovsky) from the St Vladimir's Academy and his team find the girls,
they bring them back to the academy. Rose is a Dhampir, a good half
human-half vampire breed that can eat regular food and are trained to
protect the Moroi from the evil immortal vampires Strigoi. Lissa is a
Princess of the Moroi, a good mortal breed of vampires that feed of
blood from donors and is capable to control one of the four elements. When they return, the Headmistress Kirova (Olga Kurylenko) intends to
punish Rose, but the old Moroi Victor Dashkov (Gabriel Byrne), who was
a friend of Lissa's family, dissuades Kirova from her intent. Lissa
dates her outcast schoolmate Christian Ozera (Dominic Sherwood) but
unexpectedly she is threatened by someone that wishes to harm her.
Victor's daughter Natalie (Sarah Hyland) joins Rose and Lissa to help
them to seek out who might be the enemy."Vampire Academy" is an entertaining fantasy with a story that is a
sort of combination of "Harry Potter" with "Twilight". Zoey Deutch is
gorgeous and charming and if the viewer sees this feature with low
expectation, he or she might have a pleasant surprise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Academia de Vampiros: O Beijo das Sombras" ("Vampire
Academy: The Shadow Kiss")
