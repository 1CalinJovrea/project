Refreshing Performance

I loved it and I believe you all will feel the same after seeing the
movie.That was one refreshing performance by both the leads. Both the
characters were so perfect and the actors delivered perfection. You
will not get bored throughout the movie although the movie revolves
around two main characters.That was unexpected and an out of the box
performance for me. The dialoges are so perfectly timed.The music too
complements the movie. A simple storyline but definitely not the
performance. Let me put it like this,"charming and refreshing".The
movie kind of gets on you as it goes. Before I go,let me tell, you'll
love it.
