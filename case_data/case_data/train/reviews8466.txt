Why the hate?

How dumb do you have to be to misunderstand a movie like Pan? Because
this movie has generated some of the dumbest review comments I've ever
seen. "There's no Wendy." Because this is a PREquel. Look up "pre" in a
dictionary. "It's dark." All fairy tales are, and their modern
imitations like Peter Pan or Pinocchio have to be, too, to remain true
to the genre. Fairy tales originated in a time when meeting wolves and
bears in the woods was all too likely, and they weren't cute and
anthropomorphic, either. And the original Grimm stories, unlike their
sanitized modern retellings, carried the clear message that Awful
Things happen to Naughty Children Who Don't Obey The Rules. The prize
comment was someone complaining that a flying pirate ship over WWII
London was unrealistic. So name some historical periods when it WAS
realistic.Overall it's a satisfying action story, and wholly undeserving of the
scorn some reviewers have dumped on it. The weakest links are Garrett
Hedlund as Hook (still a good guy at this point) and Rooney Mara as
Tiger Lily. Hedlund tries to be Harrison Ford, complete with Indiana
Jones' hat and Han Solo's flying off to save his own skin but coming
back to save the day, but he just doesn't have charisma. Neither does
Tiger Lily, who's pretty but bland, and goes through life with a deer
in the headlights expression. They're both stiff and lifeless.
