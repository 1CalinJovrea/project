Wow how could this piece of rubbish score above a 2?

Just terrible. Woeful script, terrible over acting, stupid premises
that just needed to be accepted.Where to start? How about with Little Miss Sunshine. Go watch the first
5 minutes of it. In the first 5 minutes all the central characters are
introduced, they are flawed but special... immediately you bond with
them and care what happens to them. You are on board.Then watch this piece of dodo. In the first 5 minutes we are introduced
to many of the main characters. We immediately could not care less
about them as there is nothing alluring or special about them. Ryan Gosling is funny when he is simply trying to be cheeky and cute.
When he is doing it in an understated way. In this movie, he is doing
slapstick and its hopeless. Russel seems to think because Mel Gibson
did action and comedy he can too. He can't. Just not funny. At all.
Like, as funny as an abortion not funny.Oh woe is me the ridiculous scenes where 500 bullets are sprayed from a
machine gun and they hit everywhere around the hero but miss the hero. Just tripe. Not funny. Not clever. Barely watchable. I watched it 3
days ago yet forget how it ended - perhaps its a self defense mechanism
from my brain seeking to erase this terrible experience from my
memory... or maybe the movie is just that forgettable
