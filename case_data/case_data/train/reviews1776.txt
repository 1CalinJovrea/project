Three scenes on repeat

My hopes were high for this movie. With a cast like that and being an
adaptation of one of the previous century's most famous books it can't
be all bad, I thought. How wrong I was. All right, the film is not
completely rubbish, the cinematography and the acting is good and
sometimes even brilliant. That said the movie is still a waste of two
and a half long hours and yes indeed those two and a half hours feels
like three long days. Despite the decent performances by the actors none of the characters
are ever allowed to evolve. We never get a sense of how they are as
persons or what they have at stake. There's nothing that makes the
viewer care about the characters, except maybe for Dean Moriaty in the
end. Here we get a glimpse of why he's so messed up but it in the last
five minutes of the movie. All the other characters are portrayed very superficial, especially the
women who are all portrayed as extreme stereotypes of distressed women,
all the characters do is discuss on a quasi intellectual level, then
have wild and crazy sex, which after you've seen it for the 117. time
seems dull, and then they go their separate ways for no apparent
reason. Then a new character is introduced, then another and then yet another.
Most characters are on screen for less than five minutes which of
course means that you as viewer don't get to care about them at all. For instance Viggo Mortensens character. Viggo Mortensen is on the
poster for the movie for crying out loud but he is in the movie in
three short scenes and nobody knows why the hell is in the movie. But
oh, gone he is and on to the next chapter with a similar character
doing similar things. After an hour I felt I was dying inside. After two and a half hours in
the company of this repetitious movie I felt like I had been in
Guantanamo prison for a year.
