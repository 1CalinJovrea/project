An honest telling of a true story--with no moralizing.

Love this film. I highly recommend it. Written/filmed/acted
beautifully. Very human. Very funny.If you're prude or judgmental, go see this film, but be warned.Movie-goers complain that Hollywood films are all the same. But then
movie-goers complain when an original film like The Diary Of A Teenage
Girl comes out. Funny that.Yes, the subject matter is dark, but the filmmakers have struck the
pitch-perfect tone. There is nothing cynical about this film.This true story is told from the point-of-view of Minnie, a lonely
15-year-old girl who loves to draw, and who loves to have a bunch of
consensual sex with her mother's pathetic 35-year-old boyfriend Monroe.The animated parts are sweet, funny, raunchy--the drawings a
15-year-old girl.I disagree with the UK reviewer who says she speaks in the "wise beyond
her years" dialogue typical of American teenage films. I had the exact
opposite reaction: I was relieved to hear her speak in plain, simple,
sometimes downright dumb sentences. (So ignore the numpty Brit
reviewer.)Many will find it impossible to separate the (illegal) deed from the
brilliant story. So I'll address this review to people who are on the
fence: If you think you'd like to see this film, go see it. Don't be scared away. Yes, the material is a little uncomfortable at
first, but take a couple of breaths, and remember that this is a true
story. Enjoy the honesty. Enjoy the non-judgment. Enjoy some empathy.
There's so much cynicism on TV and on the internet. You deserve a
break. Go see this movie and show yourself some cinema love.
