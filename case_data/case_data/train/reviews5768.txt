not perfect, but OK

i'm surprised by the venom shown by the pages of reviews i just read
sure this isn't Citizen Kane, but i felt its a reasonably decent
conclusion to a film series that probably needs to wrap things up.Milla does a fine job as ever, as well as my bae Ali Larter ... maybe
the shakycam isn't as bad on home video, but i enjoyed the movie
regardlessworth watching if you're a fan..i enjoyed it
