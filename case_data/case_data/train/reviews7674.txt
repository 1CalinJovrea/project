The Unfunny Comedy!

What a disappointment. As someone who actually thought Hangover II was
even funnier than the original, I was looking forward to seeing the
third installment which promised to take us back to where it all
started "Las Vegas" with more of the same humor?? How wrong I was to
believe that! Gone was the spontaneous feeling you got from the
Wolfpack waking up not knowing what has happened to them, which I felt
was the most interesting part of the first 2 movies as you followed the
characters as they hunted for clues into the night before! In this 3rd
serving we get a boringly flimsy storyline that dragged on, very few
laughs, a short visit to LV and a script that could have been written
by a ten year old! Stu (Ed Helms) has few interesting scenes and is for
some strange reason constantly put down by Alan (Zach Galifianakis, who
has now been given the central role of the movie along with Leslie
Chow(Ken Jeong) who's antics were bordering on childish stupidity.
Bradley Cooper who plays Phil was given more time and lines but failed
to be convincing in the delivery of the character. Sadly this was a
movie too far for the writer/s as it was totally unimaginative and as I
said at the beginning extremely disappointing.
