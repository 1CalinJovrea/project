Worst. Movie. Ever.

My title is honesty. Of the thousands of movies I've seen, this is by
far, the WORST one EVER. I can't even think of another movie that would
be a close second.Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan's acting skills are so bad that they
make the performances by Ian Ziering and Tara Reid in the "Sharknado"
movies seem Oscar worth. If you mix in the awful acting with a terrible script, putrid directing
and the most unrealistic story line ever written this is what you get.The only saving grace for this review is the fact that IMDb won't let
me give less than 1 star.Save your money and don't waste the nearly two hours of hour life.
Those two hours could be used for something better like watching paint
dry.
