silly unbelievability

After seeing the trailers, I looked forward to this movie. But although
I am a fan of Dwayne Johnson, I cannot recommend this movie to much of
anyone. It moves too quickly at the beginning. The premise is
interesting but completely implausible, especially the time frame. Some
of the scenery is enjoyable but fleeting. Michael Caine's character is
entirely too negative. The special effects were not very realistic
either. The plot was designed to be a dramatic thriller but it was so
pat it was boring. I almost left before the ending as there was no
mystery left shortly into the film. Also, the two young people were
rather lackluster and the pilot was annoying. For something that held
so much promise of a lovely adventure, it was a big disappointment.
