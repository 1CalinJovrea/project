A beautiful film

Excellent performances, a truly poignant story. See it, you won't be
disappointed.Director Lee Toland Krieger wisely speeds through the scientific
mumbo-jumbo, treating it as the least-interesting aspect of this tale.
Instead, he focuses on the relationship fallout of Adaline's
predicament. It's a disarmingly affecting film, and very sad at points.
A rumination on loneliness. Cinematically, Krieger serves up numerous
arching, overhead shots and slow-motion sequences. This coupled with
the various time periods tackled gives the picture a buoyant sense of
scope.Particularly memorable in this is Harrison Ford. After stiff and stagey
efforts in movies such as "42," Ford delivers a beautifully conflicted
performance as a man trying to reconcile his past.Highly recommended.
