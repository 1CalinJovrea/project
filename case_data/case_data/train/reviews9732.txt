Original, daring, fascinating

Not to mention beautifully and cleverly directed.This is the first of Chan-wook Park's films I've seen and if the others
are half as good as "The Handmaiden" I'm going to see them all. Min-hee
Kim stars as Lady Hikeko, a young Japanese woman of wealth and beauty
living in an isolated estate with her sadistic uncle in
Japanese-occupied Korea in the 1930s. A gaggle of Korean thieves and
con artists dream up a scheme to separate Hikeko from her fortune. The
idea is for one of them to pose as a Count Fujiwara, seduce Hikeko and
then marry her. Aiding this scheme is a pretty little pickpocket named
Sook-Hee (played with great skill and charm by Tae-ri Kim).That's all I can tell you about the plot. Rest assured it is
fascinating with some very surprising twists and turns. This is also
one of the sexiest movies I've ever seen. It is billed as a crime
thriller but actually it is the story of a beautiful love affair. Again
I will not elaborate since any more information might spoil the film
for many viewers.Bottom line: I plan on seeing this again and I seldom watch films more
than once, only the great ones.--Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review book, "Cut to the Chaise
Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote"
