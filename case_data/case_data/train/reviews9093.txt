Avoid the cult of Von Trier

First off, if you want to see a movie that depicts sexual compulsion in
an engrossing and compelling way, see Shame starring Michael
Fassbender.This film is not porn, not particularly raunchy, not in the least bit
sexy, nor shocking in the least. What it is is a tiresome, disjointed,
and utterly pedantic piece of faux-art.The dialogue is so bad with its philosophical pontification that I
physically winced many times throughout the film. This is the sort of
wincing one does not at challenging art but at amateur, college level
film. It screams intellectual phoney in every other scene.Why is this film even 4 hours long? Because Von Trier was too lazy to
pare it down for us. It's like when your friend posts 300 photos of his
art project on his website and expects you to pick your 10 favorite,
because he can't be arsed to do his own editing.Lars Von Trier's surname, although pronounced differently in his native
tongue, is very telling if pronounced as an English word. Try and try
again, his scam art fools the gullible masses who will imbue his work
with meaning themselves. It is akin to religion -- lacking in both
profundity and truth.Do not let the cult of Von Trier brainwash you into believing.
