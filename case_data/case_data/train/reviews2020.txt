Chick flick and not a good one.

One of the marks of a bad movie is unmotivated or out of character
behavior. That pretty much sums up this whole movie. The main character
is set up to be sweet, loving, quiet, and innocent. She is forced to
emigrate in order to have any kind of future. Then she goes to a dance
with a new girl at the boarding house and treats her horribly for
absolutely no reason. She remarks, based on nothing, that the girl is
"awful." I guess the awfulness must have been edited out. She marries hastily before returning to Ireland due to a family death.
I mean this was set up to be a real love match and then continues to be
that at the end; but, she gets involved with another man while in
Ireland for absolutely no reason. She refuses to read or respond to her
husband's letters, again for no reason. She never tells her mother
she's married...you got it --no reason. She seems to make her decision to return to the US based on the fact
that she got busted for being married. But, her reaction to being
busted is pure righteous indignation. How does that follow? She's indifferent and withdrawn from her mother, and she spends her
time working and running around while in Ireland for the funeral. Then
she abruptly leaves with only a day's notice after being busted. I
guess we're not supposed to care about the mother at all. It's only
this little sweetie that matters. Totally unsympathetic main character and false/unmotivated behavior add
up to a really lousy movie. That's what this is.
