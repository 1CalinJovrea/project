Life Love Loss

Honestly, I thought it was a wonderful movie! It was extremely sad but
I thought it sends a great message. Even though I was very upset about
how it ended after everything Amanda and Dawson had gone through. From
being together even after their struggles with family and then losing
each other, but then finding each other again, and then losing each
other again. It was very difficult for my mom and I to keep our
emotions in check. We both couldn't stop crying. But we are both very
empathetic people, so I wouldn't expect anything less. It was still a
great movie! I love the two main actors and it was great seeing some
new actors on screen as well. I have never felt so touched and
compelled by a story as much as The Best of Me from Nicholas Sparks! I
feel that his books are usually about Life, Love, and Loss. I feel like
that is what life is all about. I will be watching it again and reading
the book! Thanks for a wonderful movie!
