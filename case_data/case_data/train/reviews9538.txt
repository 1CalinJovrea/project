Well done, entertaining movie

Nice performances by Chris Evans and Alice Eve. Slightly predictable
and unrealistic at a couple of points in the plot, but easily
overlooked because the film entertains with charm, humor, and
thoughtfulness.For what should be an otherwise whimsical movie, it's actually rather
thought provoking on the subject of the different depths and
entanglements of relationships.Really good on-screen chemistry between Evans and Eve. They both come
across as flawed yet likable. The dialogue between the two is
interesting, funny and, at times, painful. You can't help but want them
to succeed, but you're not quite sure what success might look like for
them: Just solving their problems for the next 24 hours? A long term
friendship? Love?
