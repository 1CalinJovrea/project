An insult to the original Death Note (Desu Nōto)

I have never felt compelled to write any reviews but I felt that I
needed to say something for this movie.I normally like Netflix TV shows but movies lately have been really
sub- par with this one being the worst I've seen from them.This is a total waste of time and this movie should have never been
made, it's an insult to the original Death Note (Desu Nōto). The plot
was totally ruined since it was changed from the original, yeah they
kept the premise but they decided it was a good idea to mix it up with
stupid teen drama/relationship and a bunch of other nonsensical BS.Go watch Desu Nōto instead if you haven't or if you have then watch it
again!
