Best cheesy kung fu flick since the 70s

It's kind of messy, like Punk Rock, or Tarantino film (why else would
he attach his name to it?), but the Rza does a BANG-UP job directing
this movie. If anybody thinks it's terrible it's because they're taking
it too seriously. A simple, fun, colorful movie with a bit of CGI to
highlight what is already well-choreographed practical FX action.
Although some can complain there's not enough Russell Crowe, or that it
has every action clich√© in the book, but therein lies the fun of it.
Nothing's too precious, and lots of stuff is in there just because it's
cool *cough Iron Fists cough* Ever see Iron Monkey, Hero or even Shoot
'em Up? This is along those lines. I'm glad that when a Wu Tang member
went kung fu, they went all out. Worth watching with friends.
