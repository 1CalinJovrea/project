Great Action Turns Into a Sleeper

Maybe I was just expecting too much. Having seen the trailer, I was
wanting to see this one for a while and excited to finally get an
opportunity. It started great - lots of action and let's face it - you
really can't go wrong with these actors. They're superb. But.. even
great acting couldn't save this one. I found myself clock staring for
the whole last hour. The build to the climax was far too long and the
climax was certainly the worst part of the film. It was one of those
movies where you anticipate the many exciting, different ways the story
could play out and when you see how it actually does, you just wish you
had spent the night laying on the couch and watching something on
Netflix. Wait for it to come out on Redbox. Shouldn't be long.
