Looks more like a TV Drama compared to Anthropoid, All locations in Budapest

Movie looks more like a TV drama compared to Anthropoid, thus the
latter is decisively better. The movie is entirely (with the exception
being snowy mountains probably in CZ, Sk o slo) shot in Budapest: - the
assassination attempt location is at the crossroad between Dobozi Utca
and Magdolna Utca. - the Train station is Nyugati Train station (like
most of WWII movies train stations use it as a location), the church of
the final battle is the Assisi Szent Ferenc Templom in Bakáts TérAnthropoid's Locations are all real ones in Prague.
