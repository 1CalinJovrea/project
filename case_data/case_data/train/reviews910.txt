One of the best

This movie will haunt you hours after you see it. While you will
certainly be emotionally moved by this movie, it will affect you more
to realize that this was a true event. Well done Hollywood. Its nice to
finally see a well filmed well acted movie. The core elements of the
story are true, and the characters are real. And of course the final
event was exactly as it happened as best as anyone can determine. All
of the actors should be commended. Not a weak one in the bunch.
