wretched

A wretched musical with rotten musical score, plot befitting a porno,
and only one scene with character development. Maybe the special
effects were OK if you go to movies just for special effects. The
all-star cast were given roles without sufficient emotional depth to
allow them to be authentic. From the start, the musical phrases are
trite and awkward, no doubt partly because there is not much to sing
about other than 'going into the woods' which apparently is supposed to
have some metaphorical significance that doesn't really develop. The
whole thing reminds me a lot of the old Wizard of Oz yellow brick road
trip. This was a waste of money and 2 hours of life.p.s. If you knew me, you would know just how awful a movie would have
to be to move me to register for IMDb to write a review -- and this
movie crossed that line very early on in the two hour ordeal. It's
badness is epic. It fails to entertain. The trailers should have just
shown people singing boring music, because that's all this show is
about. If you see good reviews on here, trust me they are not from
general movie-going public, probably they are shills with some interest
in this movie's success. And don't fall for the Emperor's New Clothes
line of how ignorant the bad reviews are -- this movie is
unforgettable, and that is a bad thing.
