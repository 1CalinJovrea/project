About as interesting as watching paint dry...

I was amazed to see how many movie goers sung the praise of this
turkey. You see the poster touting a Lost City...you are not expecting a drawn
tale of a wasted life. Three times the guy goes looking for the lost
city and the last time the guy(and his son no less...what the hell
happened to the rest of the expedtion?) get captured by the local
fierce natives who drug them and then...eat them? Sacrifice them? Toss
them in the river to feed the piranhas?Stupid non-ending to a movie that belongs in art houses to be watched
only by people who "have read the book first" and know what is coming.Go to a nice park, ignore the kiddies playing, the guy throwing his
Frisbee to his faithful hound, the young couple on the blanket doing
what the traffic will allow or the old dear stuffing the pigeons and
find a freshly painted an park bench. Stand for 2 hours (with or
without popcorn) and watch the paint dry. It is a more riveting
experience than a flick which tries to get you in with a cool poster
and some weirdos praising it on IMDb.
