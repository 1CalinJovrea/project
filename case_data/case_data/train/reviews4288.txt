A big let down!

"On the Road" is one of my favorite novel. Knowing that very few movies
do justice to the novels, I should have kept away. Unfortunately, I was
curious.What a mistake that was! For one it is not able to relate, on
the big screen, to the spirit of the book. It is so boring that I
really wanted to get up and leave in the middle of the movie. The only
reason why I decided to stay on is because of the price of the ticket.
Also, why do people hire Kristen Stewart? She cannot act. AT ALL! I
hope this is the last time I see this girl on big screen ruin an
already horrible script!That said I have to give credit to the
cinematographer to capture the beauty of American landscape.
