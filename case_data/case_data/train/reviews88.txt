Jordan Peele debuts in style

Get Out provided me with something I long for. The debut of a new
filmmaker that makes you look hopefully into the future. Jordan Peele
has done just that. He wrote and directed this smart, elegant film and
even made us find a new way to classify it. Horror, comedy, drama,
social satire. What matters really is that it's a first of sorts and
then some. It introduced me also to a major talent in front of the
camera. Daniel Kaluuya is sheer perfection. As an actor he projects and
provokes empathy. Whatever your race or races you will be in his shoes,
feeling what he's feeling. I was him, throughout. The gasps of fear
mixed with the bursts of laughter from the audience - me included -
made Get Out one of the most rewarding film experiences of 2017. Kudos
also to Bradley Whitford and the phenomenal Catherine Keener. They are
terrifyingly recognizable and what about Caleb Landry Jones? Menacing
enough and comic enough - he reminded me of Peter, Chris Elliott's
character in Everybody Loves Raymond - to be all the things he needed
to be. Perfect. As is the human relief provided by the wonderful Marcus
Henderson. As you may gather I'm celebrating. So, Mr Peele, thank you
very much.
