If u spend $10 on this bs, then donate $10 to charity to have a clear conscience!!

Sony pictures are so desperate to make a franchise out of anything
especially now that spider-man has gone back home to marvel that they

Please fellow humans don't see this save mankind. We have seen movies
on crappy minions, Lego toys now bloody Emojis', What next MEME movie?Go home Hollywood you are drunk!!
