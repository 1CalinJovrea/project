Classy story of war, spying, love and family

A Franco/Canadian secret mission is an unusual twist for a WWII story.
This and the setting of the first part of "Allied" reminded me of "The
English Patient". Canadian Max (Pitt) is sent to Casablanca for a
dangerous mission. Marianne (Cotillard) is the French agent already in
place to help him.Out of the desert and in London, "Allied" moves into a different
territory, albeit still with plenty of style. Max and Marianne's
wartime romance in exotic settings turns into a real family, but doubts
arise about Marianne's identity.London during the war as the main setting for two thirds of the movie
looked very realistic. I did not mind what could be the historical
inaccuracy of the Blitz, because the bombing added a layer of drama to
the story.I particularly liked the scene during the party, with Sing, Sing Sing
playing in the background. It is a slightly menacing tune and it
complemented perfectly the atmosphere of tension, suspicion and slight
desperation.Even if I have never been a Brad Pitt fan, he did a good job playing
quiet Max, a man of a few words who sees his new world disintegrating.
One can easily imagine him as a long-term bachelor falling for the
beautiful, brave French partisan. Cotillard was also convincing as the
ambiguous "femme fatale". Contrary to what some reviewers wrote, plenty
of chemistry between the two, but also tenderness.If you like movies with a solid plot, linear storytelling, believable
characters, difficult choices, great costumes and soundtrack, then you
should like this.P.S. couple of remarks: Pitt's French was not the best and no way he
could have passed for Parisian, but that did not bother me too much.
The final scene is a couple of minutes too long, but again, not a major
problem. However, what a relief to follow a good plot without the zig-
zagging in time, overused but often useless editing style.
