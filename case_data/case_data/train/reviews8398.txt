Promising Debut

I write as an escaped West Australian. We've all got something to live
down.Like Adelaide, Perth has had classic serial killers with an eerie
Australian twist. Riffing on a grim 1980s case, Ben Young delivers a
fine first feature, for which the Metacritic 72% is not far off the
mark. The cinematography is great, capturing the endless hot sky and
bleaker suburbs (read Coolbellup or Hamilton Hill) of the 1980s. Also a
fine score. The three key players are excellent. The script maybe
needed a little more rounding for the ending to gel properly, but I
sure felt the tension. As with Don't Tell and Berlin Syndrome, here's a rare Aussie feature
that captures Australia but which I'd be proud to show overseas.
Discouragingly, I wonder if the three taken together will pull much
more than $1-2m. Actually uses a real street name, no kidding. Hope it doesn't lead to
disaster tourism. Meanwhile, some eagle has already spotted the curious
anomaly of the 7-character number plate, never issued in Perth before
the 1990s.
