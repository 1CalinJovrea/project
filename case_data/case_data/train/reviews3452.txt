The whole premise of this story was flawed from the beginning. For
SciFi fans time travel is what its all about. Its meant to be
intriguing and full of conundrums that most importantly, some how make
sense. All the best time travel movies have a consistency that holds
the idea together. This is precisely what Loopers does not have. There
where so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with
it. If your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you
need a Looper. why not beam them straight to the furnaces. And if you
have to use a Looper why rely on him to kill himself - let someone else
do it. Seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of
the gaps in the plot of this flop. If Bruce was not in this i would
have walked way before the end. I was fooled. You don't have to be.
