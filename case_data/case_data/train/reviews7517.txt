Oh Cousin Matthew...

So a guy who claims to know your dead son turns up at your house one
day. He seems nice and looks like that bloke off of Downton so you let
him stay for a while... That is pretty much all I knew about this film
before I went to see it. What follows is an enjoyable thriller with
laughs aplenty and an excellent central performance from Dan Stevens
(more on that later).The plot, at the end of the day, is fairly nonsensical and there are
some troubling loose ends that I found a little unsatisfactory. I can't
say that any of the story is particularly surprising or original but
what does that matter when everyone making it and everyone in the
audience seems to be having so much fun? The cinema I was in was
probably around half full and while there was nobody in full-on
hysterical laughter, there was a satisfactory amount of appreciative
chuckling (me included).I feel that the majority of my enjoyment of this film should really be
credited to Dan Stevens in the main role. His character is charming,
pleasant and helpful and yet strangely sinister and unsettling from the
outset and he plays it absolutely perfectly. You can't help but like
him even though you're not sure that you should. Apart from a smallish
role in "The Fifth Estate", I am only familiar with Stevens from
Downton Abbey and his role in this couldn't have been more different
from both of these. I look forward to seeing how his career progresses
but this was an excellent example of his versatility as an actor.Overall a good Saturday night out at the cinema but I can't imagine it
is the kind of classic film I would watch again and again.
