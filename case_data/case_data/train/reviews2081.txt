Golem starring Bill Nighy, Olivia Cooke, Douglas Booth, Eddie Marsan,

Victorian London in 1880, our tale begins in the baroque, grandiose
music hall where the capital's most renowned performer Dan Leno
(English actor Douglas Booth - Noah, Jupiter Ascending) takes to the
stage. The whimsical thespian performs a monologue, informing his
dedicated audience of the ghastly fate of a young woman who had once
adorned this very stage, his dear friend Elizabeth "Lizzie" Cree
(English actress Olivia Cooke - Me And Earl And The Dying Girl, Ouija);
for the beguiling songstress is facing up to her forthcoming death by
hanging, having been accused of murdering her husband John Cree
(Australian actor Sam Reid - '71, The Riot Club). Lizzie's death seems
inevitable, until Detective Inspector John Kildare (English actor Bill
Nighy - Love Actually, Shaun Of The Dead) is assigned to the case of
the Limehouse Golem  a nefarious, calculating serial killer, murdering
innocent, unconnected victims, leaving behind barely identifiable
