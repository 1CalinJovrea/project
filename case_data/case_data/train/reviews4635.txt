First off three questions:1. What is it with films being so dammed dark these days, it really is
annoying that filmmakers think that by blacking out films or washing
out colour with a blue/grey tint it lends the film some gravity and
depth. 2. Why are films soo long as well, it's an excuse for lazy story
telling...this pile of film is two hours long and by my reckoning that
is 50 mins too long 3.Amazon rating system of films is really flawed as
its suckered me into watching bullshit films.This film irked me for some time until I decided to watch it as I am a
fan of a good horror film and this is nothing like a good horror. The
premise is based (and I used that term very loosely as did the script
writers) on the Enfield poltergeist. Now the cynic in me wrestles with
the part of me that just wants to be entertained, now I know that the
famous ghost hunters (read hoaxers) Warren are asked over to Jolly ol'
Ingerlund to sort of a family haunted by a old ghost (who incidentally
reminds me of Jim Carrey as Count Olaf I was expecting him to say "Ere
He's just a boy barely out of his Osh Kosh B'Gosh". The accents are
okay apart from the two adult women they seemed to have just gone the
whole Dick Van Dyke thing, which is strange as they are both from the
UK.The film is just a series of jumps scares, the only bit that made me
laugh was the bit with the dinning room chair and the bad facial hair
on Maurice Gross. I made the choice of wasting my time with this film over watching 'The
Mist' again, which is a much better horror film, as it is able to build
tension and the scares are more based on something that could be
tangible.four stars: one for the acting, one for the 70s nostalgia, and two for
making me laugh twice.Awful film, steer clear watch A Series of Unfortunate Events instead.
