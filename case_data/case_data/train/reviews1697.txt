Densch Steals the Show

This is a fictionalized account of an actual relationship between Queen
Victoria and England and an Indian man who befriends her, becoming an
adviser. While the story is probably greatly exaggerated, it tugs at
our hearts. The old Queen, now in her eighties, is tired and bored with
the role she needs to play. Our modern Elizabeth must have trouble
attending all those public events, having to exude a persona. Anyway,
Abdul brings light toe the darkness, much to the dismay of Bertie (the
Prince of Wales and later Edward VII) and the other courtiers. Because
his ways are so foreign and he doesn't fall into the sycophantic trap
other must sustain, he becomes refreshing. Not that there aren't some
pitfall. He withholds some information from the Queen at times (more
lies of omission) and she feels betrayed. Classism is so dominant,
particularly at this time in history with the breadth of colonialism in
the British Empire that its ugly head is put forth time after time.
Judy Densch is amazing as Victoria. She has all the angst of a person
who sees no positives in her world, and then she sparkles as she begins
to realize what life could offer. I don't know how accurate the
portrayals are, but it is a delight and we would hope that much of it
is true.
