really? most people liked this film? Oooooookay.

I thought this was one of the worst films of all-time. I only went to
see it because it had an 8.3 rating on IMDb. Wow! It is still rated
over 8.0 as we speak. Holy crapamole Batman! This film was boring,
lacked ANY character depth, and wasn't amusing or visually interesting.
I have literally never been so shocked at the poor quality of a movie
script or character development.Wow. This is the worst film I've seen in many, many years. And I'll
tell you, it boggles my mind that MOST of you found it enjoyable. Just
boggles my fracking mind.And here is my tenth and final line so that I can post this review,
which most people will dislike but a few random souls will agree with
passionately.
