Expected Better! 4/10

Review: This is an average movie about 2 best friends who both love the
same girl and fight to prove who is worthy of her love. One is a famous
bull fighter, who really wants to be a musician and the other is a
highly decorated soldier who protects his village from evil. There are
some other elements to the storyline which makes it quite interesting
but the animation looked weird, especially the characters with the
weird noses which looked more like snouts. Personally, I think that the
storyline is a bit too confusing for kids and the songs weren't that
great. I did enjoy all of the scenes with Ice Cube but most of the
movie was corny and it seemed a bit messy. On the plus side, the kids
will like the vibrant colours and the love story between Manolo and
Maria but I was expecting more from this film. Average!Round-Up: Although I didn't think that this movie was that great, it
did make a healthy profit at the box office, mainly because it's a fun
day out for the family. I couldn't really tell who was Chaning Tatum
but Ice Cube and Ron Perlman was blatantly obvious. The animation
looked a bit blocky but the attention to detail was quite impressive.
As the film had a Mexican flavour, I think the director missed the
chance to have a great soundtrack. Anyway, it's not an all time classic
like Frozen, which did rely a lot on the soundtrack, but it's harmless
fun for the whole family.Â Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $97.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies
about 2 best friends who are fighting against each other to impress
there true love. 4/10
