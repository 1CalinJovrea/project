A Top Ten Horror Movie

The best part about The Witch, besides the acting, is the dichotomy
between drama and what is actually a surprisingly fast paced and
accessible horror movie (with few genre clich√©s.) The film could be
looked at as two separate stories heavily intertwined: the supernatural
horror of the woods vs the very real terror of violence erupting within
the family, and amazingly this is all done seamlessly, missing no beats
and never seeming to give up one for the other. In that way, The Witch
has the elegance of a clever children's story (A New England Folk Tale
to be precise) with the intensity of a melodrama. This would never have
worked if the cast didn't kill every role, but luckily for us they did;
they murdered those roles.I don't think I've ever actually seen a movie during which people, in
the middle of a crowd, screamed. The Witch did that. The Witch made
people scream and gasp so loud the whole room heard and it did other
things too: it told an engrossing, intelligent story. There are minor
"complaints" I may have that keep it from being 10/10 (the shots don't
carry the film as much as the writing,) but really this is a horror
film that could easily make a top ten list. It's just good fun (and the
ending is great... don't bash the ending... people are bashing the
ending but I don't know why... it's really a perfect ending...)
