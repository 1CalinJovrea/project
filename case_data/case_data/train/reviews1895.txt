The worst Bourne movie.

I re-watched the old ones before going to see this in the theater, and
in my opinion, this is the worst Bourne movie. My 2 main problems with this one:1) The plot is stupid. The whole "hacker" part was probably written by
somebody who's still using a typewriter. All the previous films had a
computer room full of furiously typing agents too, but those were
thankfully never the main focus. The focus used to be on Jason Bourne's
ability to creatively solve seemingly hopeless situations. This film
has it the wrong way around. It tries to be about computer hacking and
data privacy, and does all of that wrong too.2) The cinematography is awful. Watching this on a big screen will give
you motion sickness. You can never tell what's going on during most of
the action scenes, because it's all shaky cam close-ups.Do yourself a favor, and watch the 3rd one again instead. The perfect
end of the trilogy.
