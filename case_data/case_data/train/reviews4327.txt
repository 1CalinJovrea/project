Lowest denominator shoddy tosh

The supporting cast is a jumble of ham-heads, over playing vileness
just to hammer home the point that the protagonists love is meant to
come to fruition. This point alone underscores the absolute naff
unbelievable absurdity of this trashy little film. That said - as way
of consolation - the main actors pull off their toffy anguished
tormented soul routines to at least the low standard Hollywood has set
for romantic comedies; they are both watchable. The adaptation was
worthy of the book, but that wasn't very hard now, was it? As the film aged, the actors apparently ceased to. Consequently, it
reached a point where I thought the children of the leads would surpass
their parents, and the small couple (strangely) reliving verbatim the
lives of their parents, would reset the entire film, going round in a
perpetual loop of worthless forgettable tripe that should have been
discarded in the 90's. There are red flags signifying a dying art-form plastered all over this
film, bogged down in clich√© as it is. But if you're in the mood for
something vapid, with a climax that will satisfy your sentimental
idealism, it may well do just that, satisfy.
