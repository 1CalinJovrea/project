Average Affair with Some Big Laughs,

Keeping Up with the Joneses is a good movie with a reasonably well
developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. The highlight of the film
is certainly the connection and chemistry between the four main cast
members, all of the individual relationships between Zach Galifanakis,
Isla Fisher, Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot is what makes this movie watchable.
They all have great comedic timing with one another, it was clear they
had trust in each other.I did feel the plot did not go as far as a viewer would expect a film
about spies to go. The final act is very underwhelming, as we are
expecting this big blow out, but it actually ends up being very
straight forward and predictable, nothing shocking or truly exciting
really occurs. As well as that, it simply is not as funny as it should have been. I
had higher hopes with a cast like this, I was expecting a laugh a
minute sort of movie, but there are several scenes without a single
good joke in there. The writing came across as somewhat lazy, as if
they gave up halfway through. It does show that a film that is verging on mediocrity can be saved
simply by the sincere chemistry between its lead cast. While it is
certainly flawed, Keeping up with the Joneses is still mindless fun,
worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy, but do not go out
of your way to see it. A suburban couple discover their new neighbours are undercover spies. Best Performance: Jon Hamm
