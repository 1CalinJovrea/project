Is there such thing as a set-up movie?

I had never heard the term "set-up movie" before today. There has
definitely been a trend of splitting up a story into multiple movies.
These movies don't have a beginning-middle-end the same way other
movies do but at the very least there's some progress. The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly
made. In fact, there is a lot of excitement in this movie. The problem
is that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes. If
you look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they
are in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens
in the very end. Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much
of the effects of her actions.I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning. I
just can't give this my seal of approval when I left the theater
feeling like I saw half a movie. By the time the story gets its payoff
my memory of this movie will be worn-off.
