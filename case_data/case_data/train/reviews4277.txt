Nice war romance

War time is not easy, particularly for lovers, the stronger the love
is, the bitter they will feel. That's how French village girl Lucile
and German lieutenant Bruno linked together, they are not just linked
by second world war but also piano, the cruelest thing and the most
beautiful thing in the world simultaneously, different from the other
WWII war films, Suite Francaise showed a warm German heart under the
cold uniform, perhaps that's reason the officer's name is Bruno Von
Falk, "Von" reminded people his German side, but Bruno is a typical
Italian name -- here the officer already lost half of his coldness, and
his piano composer background causing his sensitive character covers
his solider's duty particularly when it is peaceful war time, the
Chopin taste piano piece pulling submissive Lucile into his emotion
world: a little bit sad, a little bit helpless, a little bit
romantic... Any women would just love this character, after knowing the
movie is based on Ukrainian Jewish author Irène Némirovsky same name
novel, people might wonder what really happened to the author so that
she wrote such a beautiful story.Madame Angellier (Kristin Scott Thomas) is another shining character in
the movie, she was mean as much as Grandet, as the war going deep into
the peaceful village life, she changes as much as Lucile and other
villagers like Joseph couple, Madeline family etc.
