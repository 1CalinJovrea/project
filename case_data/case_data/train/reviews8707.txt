M. Knight has redeemed himself! Movie is a trip!

I love horror and some flat out just suck but I have been wanting to
see this one.Tyler and Becca are sent to see their grandparents, whom they have
never met since Papa and Nana had a falling out with their mother years
ago. Some bad blood between them and Mom wants to go on a vacation with
her boyfriend so she sends the kids to meet their grandparents for the
first time. They live on a rural farm in the middle of nowhere with no
cell service and little internet access.At first they seem like a normal old couple but soon after it becomes
obvious something is off esp with Nana. They maintain in constant
communication with their mother. It is obvious Nana does not like to
talk about their mother so the kids are still trying to figure out what
the estrangement is all about. Things then get weird! A good solid
flick. Great job M. Knight for keeping me entertained and scaring me a
little
