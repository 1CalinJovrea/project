An enjoyable if somewhat lengthy movie

I was lucky to get an advanced screening. First off, at least it kept
my attention the whole way through. I had previously seen Cruise in the
"Mummy" movie recently released and was not impressed with his acting
there.In this movie he returned to form and therefore the story-line was far
more plausible. I say story-line, but in reality it is one of those
docu-drama's, being based on fact. I wonder how much was dramatization
as there were some parts where you would ask "did this sh*t really
happen?!"Would I be inclined to add it to my DVD collection, no. It was good as
a one time showing. I suspect the length of it worked somewhat against
it. A long movie needs to build up to a crescendo, and whilst this had
lots of action it never seemed to hit that top note.
