A perfect cure for insomnia

I have seen the original version of this film, which starred Clint
Eastwood, many years ago and remembered it as being atmospheric and
full of sexual tension so was looking forward to seeing this.
Unfortunately I was in for a huge disappointment. The pace was slow,
dialogue laboured, scenes so darkly 'lit' my overwhelming impression of
the film is endless greyness. Even the beautiful and talented Nicole
Kidman couldn't lift it out of the gloom. The characters had no flesh
on their bones, there was no back story of any depth and I cared so
little for any of them that I fell asleep. I was saddened to wake from
my slumber and discover I had only slept for a few, too brief, minutes
and this turgid film was still playing. I decided I must try harder to
get on board as it was my time and money after all and I could sleep
for free at home so concentrated on staying awake and waiting for the
excitement, as every film has at least a little bit of excitement, but
not this one. It is one-paced, boring, dull, nothing of any import
happens at all. Save your money, stay at home and watch the original,
it's a far better film than this drivel.
