Make it stop!

Ha! Where to start? First of all, I am not a professional critic but I do work in the
entertainment business. I am not motivated by politics or corporate
positioning and have no vested interest in this or other films
competing in the current marketplace. With that said, this is a
pretentious experiment that only daft art school students and guilty
"professional" critics can appreciate. Fans of the theater will find it
amusing for the first hour until it begins to feel like Ground Hog Day
meets All That Jazz, orchestrated by Paul Thomas Anderson's nails on a
chalkboard. Performances: Exactly what you would expect from talented actors but
the fun ends there.Creativity: A one trick pony, think Hitchcock's Rope without the fun,
that will make you want to get the heck out of the "theater". Keep in
mind, you need to avoid seeing this if you get motion sickness. Cotton
mouth, here it comes! Execution: As an example of what can be done in and around a Broadway
theater, with a "single" take, it succeeds only as an experimental
museum piece. Even then, most folks would walk out before the end.It's one of the most pointless, sluggish, and taxing experiences you
will have in the theater.
