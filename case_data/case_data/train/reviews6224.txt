Surprisingly good

A lot of people went into this movie with expectations that this would
follow the mythology, and I think that's what let them down. However,
as an artistic representation of not only the myths, but a possible
truth behind the myths, this was an entertaining watch.I'm only vaguely familiarly with the mythology, but I know enough to
know the way it was represented. This film represents that mythology in
a different way - more genuinely believable, and less fantastic - but
blends the original mythos in in a way I found very interesting. A lot
can be forgiven for an intelligent, new look at an old story, and I
don't think this film needs to be forgiven very much at all.The story was fairly well rounded with a some light/moderate complexity
to it which was nice, and it was much less far-fetched than I thought
it would be. The acting was - in general - excellent, with only one or
two instances where I thought it was a bit too cheesy or overdone.Dwayne Johnson was fantastic; having seen him in several films I was
expecting a less solemn, more caricatured, performance. But he was
excellent, and I have gained a little more respect for him as a serious
actor (though I wouldn't cast him outside head-bashing quite yet).Overall an underrated movie in my opinion, and definitely worth a watch
if you like a good story.
