10
The 5th one is better then the first 4.

This a great movie. It is one of the best movies ever. It has a great
story line. It also has great acting. It also has a great special
effects. This is better then the first four Transformers movies. And
that is not easy to do. 5.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a great
movie 5.3 is underrating it. A lot of people are giving it 6. This
still to low for this great movie. I give this movie 10. This is a
great movie. If you do not like this movie then you do not know good
sciences fiction. This is a classic of our time. See it. It is better
then The Dark knight. And that is not easy to do. This a great film. I
do not know why any one would not like it.
