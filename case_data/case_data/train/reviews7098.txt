Very well acted

I overall liked the movie. It didn't try to take on a large topic. It
wasn't fun or nice or had a happy ending, just a well told story. Many
movies are trying to be more than they are, and this wasn't one of
them. It was very well acted and has great visuals. Often times, movie
will go for 1-3 minutes without any dialogue, which I found to be an
effective way to tell the story.Main 3 characters didn't have any allusions of hope; they were just
there trying to survive day-to-day. I am a fan of the Dystopian genre;
however, often times, it ends up being unrealistic or trying to a
franchise maker. This didn't try any of it, and just succeeded to be a
strong movie.
