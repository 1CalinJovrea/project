Do you have 119 minutes to waste?

On what grounds does this movie have 6,9 rating on IMDb? This insults
the intelligence. Shailene Woodley has no character and acts like she
is first time in front of the camera. Action is meaningless. This is
what happens when you run out of ideas. 45 minutes before the end I
wanted to quit, but...I did not do it. Why? Because I had hoped it will
improve, and then... nothing. This is the most honest opinion about
this movie that I was able to give you. Now, I'm asking you, do you
have 119 minutes of your life to waste? Oh what, you do not believe me?
No problem! Just remember what I told you and come back after you watch
this piece of abomination. As regards of Kate Winslet, first I have to
say that I'm fan of her earlier works, but this is something else. This
she did not need. A huge step backwards in her career. As someone
(Author: siderite from Romania) already said: "Bad enough to make one
doubt IMDb ratings forever".
