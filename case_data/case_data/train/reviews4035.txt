An Excess Devoid of Thought or Merit

Beyond all the pink-cheeked, bated-breath laudation that has come from
critics and horror aficionados in the 38 years since the release of the
original film, it's not a stretch to say that the two things that
worked together so effectively in the execution of the original was the
stark, naturally-lit and flat documentarian style of cinematographer
Daniel Pearl and the sparse writing of Hooper and Henkel, whose utter
lack of exposition lend a terrifying, claustrophobic immediacy in
counterpoint to sun-baked Southern Gothic vistas, which place the
viewer squarely and unremittingly in role of Hitchcock's man filming in
the corner, with all of the legendary director's flinch-inducing
atmospherics and not of whit of his restraint, such as it was.With so much latitude in which to effect a direct sequel (apparently
given a seal of approval by Hooper, undoubtedly for monetary incentive
and despite his directing a direct sequel in 1986), with so little to
hamper questions of plot or motivation, Texas Chainsaw 3D fails so
completely and morosely that one might wonder for whom the film was
even made, for it definitely was not for a viewer with any sense of
taste or even the ability to do basic arithmetic.It is generally understood that the events of the first film take place
in 1973 or '74. Once this film left the confines of those few brief
sequences which dovetail immediately from the end of original, in which
a lynch mob and the most ineffectual sheriff ever are party, directly
or indirectly, to picking off the entire Sawyer clan to which
Leatherface is kin, and then burning the farmhouse to the ground, and a
member of the mob inexplicably taking the lone babe of family home to
raise as his own, we skip, by all accounts of vernacular, media, and
what little of civilization we see before plunging back into the wilds
of rural Texas, to be modern day; a tombstone later in the film
confirms that the year is in fact 2012. From this, we must conclude one
of two things: Heather Miller (the now grown-up Sawyer child from the
intro, played by a disturbingly thin Alexandra Daddario) is either the
youngest looking 40-year-old heroin chic store butcher (as heavy-handed
a nod to the nature vs. nurture debate as I've seen in film since being
lampooned in Trading Places) in the history of cinema, or people were
picking up retarded hitchhikers in VW bugs while wearing bare-backed
polyester fashions of the seventies sometime between the fall of the
Berlin Wall and the Rodney King riots. So far is this discrepancy from
being explained that all reference to the date of the original film's
events are limited to "August 19th" with the year consistently being
deliberately obscured.The rest of the cast is equally unremarkable in presence and abysmal in
performance, from the Tonia Raymonde shedding her more tame bad-girl
image from ABC's absurd Switched at Birth series to become the
requisite slutty slasher-bait, inexplicably involved in a love
triangle, never exposed or explained beyond its smarmy, innuendo-laced
exposition, with Heather's boyfriend, played by Trey Songz, included no
doubt in an attempt to add urban flair and coax minority viewers that
are probably sick of seeing Caucasian kids lumber around stupidly and
getting fileted in the dark woods.The greatest disservice to the original material was the ridiculous
attempt, by way of the Sawyer family slaughter at the beginning and the
near single-minded thuggery of the lead vigilante, now serving as the
town's mayor, to make Leatherface and company sympathetic characters,
even swinging for the anti-hero fences when the bloodthirsty mayor
meets his boring and contrived ending. Were the mayor and his retinue
of good old boys terrible people for mowing down a slew of people and
burning the house to ash with Molotov cocktails? Undoubtedly. But we
should not forget those people were part of an inbred family of
murdering, cannibal sadists, something that no amount of rural
oppression can allow any sane person to ignore.The film exists for the same reason that the sequel to the Blair Witch
Project was released: to produce a sexualized, tangential story with
hot young actors in a shameless attempt to cash in on a franchise name.
At least Book of Shadows attempted a story even if it was a terrible
one. Avoid this one, unless you have enough morbid fascination to see
both the death of a franchise's self-respect, and one torn button-down
shirt which maintained its wearer's modesty purely by proving that one
of the few forces in nature greater than gravity is a non-nudity
clause.
