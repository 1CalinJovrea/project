Gangster Movie

I went to the theater to watch a Gangster/Mafia movie, and I got one.
Mafia movies are by far my favorite type of movie. Live by Night
delivered that 1920's gangster look. Ben Affleck does an amazing Irish
Mafia member persona. The story was very moving and the characters were
likable. There was just enough action in the movie. The tommy gun fight
scenes felt like a real 1920's gang shoot out. Live by Night shows a
true gangster movie look. Most Mafia movies rely on the story to make
their movie good. Live by Night uses action and an amazing story. I had
a little trouble with keeping up with the names of the characters but
later on I started memorizing their names. Defiantly go see this movie
if your a gangster/mafia movie fan. Live by Night will not disappoint
you.
