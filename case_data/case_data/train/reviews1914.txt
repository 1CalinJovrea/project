Fabulous screenplay and intense acting and emotional

I am one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to get an advance
premier screening for Sully at AMC IMAX Somerville, Boston ten days
prior to the release.This is easily the best movie of 2016. I have been following the Jan 15
controlled ditching incident of US Airways Flight 1549 case for a
while. Everything about this case was covered on TV and the hearings
are uploaded on YouTube. I have watched nearly 5 hours of the footage
on YouTube and I was skeptical before the film whether if it offers us
anything new.I was mind-blown; the movie is truly an untold story. The drama, action
and intensity is all along. It left me and many audience in tears. It
feels realistic in the IMAX edition with great sound effects
surrounding you. The screenplay of this film is unique, Client Eastwood
is an outstanding director has outdone himself with this gripping tale.Tom hanks has been the heart of the film. The acting was top notch. I
am sure his meetings with Chesley SUllenberger must have contributed
something in the acting department. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles also
did a great job with his subtle humor and great screen presence. He
makes you wanting more of the character.Coming back to the facts, Client Eastwood has left what we all know
because of the footages shown in YouTube and the hearings. Overall, great performances, superb screenplay, neat editing and
fabulous visual and audio effects make this film easily the best in
2016.Above all, this one has a heart!9/10
