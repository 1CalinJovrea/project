Far exceeded my expectations!

I went into this movie really with no expectations. I had only seen a
few fragments of commercials and got nothing at all interesting from
them. So, WOW, was I surprised and impressed when I saw it!! The movie
was a creative story, quick moving action, funny, heartwarming,
visually interesting and sometimes surprising - this film had a lot of
great things going on, and I found myself really engaged and far more
interested in the characters than I would have guessed. Sure, there
were a few "as if" moments, but for the most part I found it to be fun,
funny, and a film I heartily recommend! Kudos to the writers, voice
actors and animators.... With a youngster in my home, I'm sure we'll be
seeing this again soon.
