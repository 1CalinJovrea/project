Political trash...

Jamie Foxx is the worst actor for this movie. He acts silly and
overacts while imitating President Obama. It mocks politicians and law
enforcement. This is the main reason the movie fails, i.e., it does not
display the truth. It also mocks Rush Limbaugh and conservatives. Note,
I am not a conservative: I hate both RipThePublicAns AND DemonCrats.
The entire script of the movie is not credible and thus the movie falls
flat. A better and more credible film is Olympus Has Fallen, but it too
is lacks credibility as when the enemy is armed to the teeth...really?
A problem in both movies it the political correctness. Neither wants to
portray any Muslim terrorists. White House Down wants to say that
Americans are worse than Islamic terrorists. May I suggest a very good
movie, Executive Decision, made in 1996? It is very believable and 10
points ahead of this movie which should be renamed, White House, The
Downer.
