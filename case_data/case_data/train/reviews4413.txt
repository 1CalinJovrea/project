I Want My $ Back

Two hours after the movie ended, and I'm still shaking my head.
Disgusted. Seems writers, director and producer DID NOT READ THE BOOK.
I do not expect a movie to follow the book exactly, but the other 2
movies mostly did. The 3rd movie had very little to do with the first
two. No point to the changes, it did not make the story more powerful,
it actually neutered it. I can't see how Veronica Roth could have been
happy with the Allegiant movie. Poor Naomi Watts, her lines were so
horrible. Her Evelyn was just whinny. Miles Teller had nothing to do.
The world they created in the movie, the airport and the fringe, not at
all accurate. Again, the changes were pointless. If you are a fan of
the Divergent Trilogy, do not bother with this movie.
