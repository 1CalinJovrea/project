Wow...I mean...just wow

What a movie and what great acting. Frances McDormand has done amazing
job and deserves awards for playing Mildred Hayes. Although a very
serious subject, this movie is a comedy.The punch lines are to the point and absolutely hilarious. I went to
the Toronto International Film Festival to watch this movie and boy, do
I consider myself lucky to have decided to watch it.The story, screenplay, direction are amazing. After The Grand Budapest
Hotel, this movie comes as a breath of fresh air.
