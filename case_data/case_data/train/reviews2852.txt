Investment Banker goes through quirky and unappealing mourning process after losing wife in car accident

Director Jean-Marc Vallee was responsible for Dallas Buyers Club, a
film that impressed me very much. Sadly his new offering, Demolition,
veers into Wes Anderson territoryÂ—a veritable quirk fest that does a
disservice to its tragic subject matter.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell, a successful investment banker,
who's driving home with his wife Julia when their car is T-boned by an
unseen driver. When Davis wakes up in the hospital, he discovers that
his wife is a fatality and he has survived virtually without a scratch.Screenwriter Bryan Sipe then proceeds to serve up a protagonist who's
hardly believable in his pre-mourning incarnation. Davis appears as an
unlikable automaton, completely cut off from his emotions. After a
package of M&M's get stuck in a vending machine at the hospital, he
bizarrely begins a letter writing campaign to the customer service
department of the vending machine company. In a series of letters
(narrated as voice overs), Davis clinically explicates his past life
experiences prior to the accident.Soon afterward, he shows up for work shortly after the funeral, much to
the chagrin of his father-in-law Phil, who owns the investment company
where he works. Davis' mourning process is a quirky one indeed as he
feels a compulsion to take everything apart--which includes dismantling
the bathroom stall at work. It's Phil who suggests he take a leave of
absence.At this point, Davis meets up with Karen (Naomi Watts), a customer
service rep at the vending company, who has been moved by his letters
and is just as quirky as him. Karen lives with Carl, her boss, along
with her 15 year old son, Chris (newcomer Judah Lewis). When Carl goes
away on an extended business trip, Davis develops a platonic friendship
with Karen and stays over at her house.Karen proves a weak character with little to do, but it's Judah Lewis
as her foul-mouthed son who steals the show. Lewis has natural acting
talent playing Chris, the juvenile delinquent who eventually bonds with
Davis, confessing to him that he might be gay. Davis becomes a mentor
to Chris as he enters the deeper anger phase of his mourning process.
First he conscripts his young charge to accompany him as he demolishes
his own home. Later, he encourages Chris to shoot him in the chest with
live ammunition while wearing a bullet-proof vest. Davis' mourning period concludes when reality rears its ugly head.
First Davis is worked over by a jealous Carl but worse yet is Chris,
who ends up in a coma after being beaten up for coming out. There's
more heartache for Davis when he learns that Julia was pregnant with
another man's child before she was killed.I suppose all this was enough for Davis to transform into a mensch and
that's exactly what happens at film's end when he reconciles with both
his father and mother-in-law and asks for their help in refurbishing a
carousel, as a living memorial for Julia.Demolition is an original concept in that it treats the mourning
process as a black comedy of sorts. But most of Davis' actions, as he
goes through his catharsis, are grating and unpleasant. The contrast
between the unemotional Davis whom we meet right after the accident and
the quirky man who needs to let out his anger in a big way, demolishing
everything in his path, proves to be tiresome. Ultimately Davis'
farcical "blowing off steam" is too negative to appeal to the viewer
who desperately would like to feel something for the film's main
character. Davis' sudden transformation into a completely sensitive,
caring guy is a welcome twist after all the negativity, but hardly
exhibits much verisimilitude.Gyllenhaal can do little with a script that makes its protagonist a
running joke. And the aforementioned Watts is completely upstaged by
the teenager with a much juicier part.Demolition garnered mixed reviews from the critics. While the main
character's internal arc reveals a true progression leading to
significant change, there is a sense here that the protagonist's core
is not only unlikable but too unbelievable to be true.
