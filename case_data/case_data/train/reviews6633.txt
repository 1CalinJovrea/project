A devil put aside for me

I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if
it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One
thing's for certain: this film is not "just like" any other film you
could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a
while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my
enjoyment.The film has graphic sex talk and graphic violence. The dialog could
hardly be any nastier. And of course, hardly more sacrilegious.
However, despite all of that, the film is surprisingly good-natured.This is not a film for children or for family viewing. Anyone who is
squeamish or easily offended should stay away.And don't automatically assume that anyone over 40 would not like this
film. I'm over 60; I had a great time. So I saw it a second time, and
loved it even more.
