Dull, cheap and no where near the prequel

While the first installation was enjoyable, the second one does not
live up. The plot was bland and dull and dragging. The dialogue was dry
and just downright stupid. The magic tricks were OK (and unnecessary),
but there was no wow factor. No jaw-dropping revealing or mind hack or
anything like that. If the first movie keeps you guessing until the
final scene, then Now You See Me 2 just basically tells the whole story
in a straight line. It's just plain badTo pair with the bad plot, the acting was also horrid. Lizzy Caplan was
beyond tragic. There is no charisma in her character at all. Replacing
Isla Fisher was a really bad move. And when you thought: "Well, at
least Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman will provide some top-notch
acting?", you were wrong. Their characters are just so dull that even
their talents can not save them.
