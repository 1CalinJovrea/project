Great film in a special way

This Audiard film is one that grows on you. For quite some time into
the film it seems both the film and its main characters aimlessly sit
in their cocoon without breaking out. One feels some very vague
potential in people but somehow their very lives seem the greatest
impediments to its blossoming. One wonders what the film is about and
where it is going. Like its characters, it feels like a bunch of loose
ends aimlessly hanging about. But I must say that at the end of the
movie it has grown on you: suddenly, as the story progresses, the film
hatches, the characters break out of their cocoon and in retrospect one
feels one has been witness to the improbable -and yet realistic- birth
of an unusual but deep love story between two common people. The story
has a hidden intensity of screenplay which is intensely performed by
Schoenaerts and Cotillard. It creeps beneath your skin. If you like
Audiard's way of developing gradual character drama with an intensity
that seems to be implicit, buried beneath trailer-trash but still
strongly present, you'll like this film. It's a story of how one can
find anew a purpose in life when one feels like wasted trash. I watched
this film in a full theatre of some 300 people. At the end most
everybody sat silent for some minutes. It seems the film had touched
something inside quite some of us there. Film as it should be.
