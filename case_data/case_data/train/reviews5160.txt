Dark comedy at it's finest - THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

I watched this movie during the 2017 Toronto International Film
Festival (TIFF) after it had won the Grolsch People's Choice Award. I
already had high hopes for this movie and it definitely did not
disappoint! Concept of the movie seems pretty easy to understand:
Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand) is still grieving the loss
of her murdered daughter and challenges the local sheriff's (Woody
Harrelson) inability to find her killer. From watching the trailer I
was a little unsure if this was going to be a drama or a comedy, but
turns out it was both, or more accurately a dark comedy. The first few
minutes of the movie really set the tone for keeping you interested in
the dramatic core, maintaining the humour in events as they unfold. Not
only are the characters perfectly cast individually (example my fav Sam
Rockwell as Officer Jason Dixon), but the writing of the entire script
makes it so easy to enjoy this entire movie. Writer/Director Martin McDonagh deserves a high five for this
accomplishment!
