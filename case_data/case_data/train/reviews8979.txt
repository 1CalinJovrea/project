Hands down the WORST editing in the history of filmmaking

You are probably not going to see this film for riveting story-lines
and in depth character studies. The RE series has about action and fun
sequences. Leaving aside all the ridiculous plot points and lazy screen
writing, the editing of this movie is going to become legendary for
it's awfulness.I've never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the
expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This
movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie.
Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera
switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4
camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was
insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of
quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so
it's impossible to follow what's going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but
this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or
shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to
figure out what's happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane
actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes
5-6 edits and quick cuts? Bring the puke bag.I guess they tried to film some neat locations and the costumes are
pretty and sets, but you wont even notice with the multiple edits
jarring your eyes.
