Awesome Intelligent Marvellous Raw Black Noir Art

I am a Sollima fan from India.His previous works inspired me a lot.I am
a wannabe director.The film is masterfully shot.It successfully hold
the rhythm of noir art.Sollima did it again.I read someone's post that
it lacks subject and strong script I agree but want to point him that
there is the victory of the director who played technically and
artistically and fantastically.He is successful producing the black
noir flavor.Music is fantastic so as Paolo Carnera.Hats off to Rai n
Cattleya team.This same team was behind the success of Romanzo
Criminale Gomorra.All the actors specially Favino was extraordinary.No
more exaggeration 10/10 from me.
