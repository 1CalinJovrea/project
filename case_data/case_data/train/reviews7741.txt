By far one of their greatest work in quite some time

I have to say that I was a bit surprised to see how well this was
thought out, the director and the animators put their hearts and souls
into making this movie with their special effects and amazing plot line
laced with funny humor for both ages (young with the new-gen gaming and
the old with retro-gaming). But not only is it funny, but very well
thought out and well played.The characters were very well thought out and planned to show how it
would be if a old-styled video game character would do in the
after-hours when no one was around, they opened the door to a untapped
imagination that blew me away. The originality behind the video game
characters brings the term nostalgic to a whole new level.They also did an amazing job with the little girl named Vanellope and
how her story unfolded, with surprising twists and turns to keep things
rather interesting. Not only did they did a great job on the plot but
also on the aesthetics of visual effects and gestures as well;
Vanellope's character really blossomed because of this (as well as the
other characters too).Ralph is one of those characters that you kinda hate being around with
and shows that off by his enormous size (and his ape-like hands), he's
a bad guy by code but he shows that when there's a will there's a way
and Ralph eventually figures it out sprinkled with laughs along his
crazy journey to save the day.An amazing job on the visuals, the story line, the character
development, the overall plot, and most of all is how they managed to
weave all these threads together into a solid movie for everyone. One
of Disney's greatest works to be produced in a rather long time and
really worth seeing again and again.
