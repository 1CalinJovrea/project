"Tweenie" dystopia copycat of Hunger Games/Battle Royale 2

Oh dear god why'd I go see this movie?! If I wanted Hunger Games:
Catching Fire, I should've went to see Hunger Games: Catching Fire.
Wait! No, I take that back. If I wanted Hunger Games, I should've
watched Battle Royale 2.Cause if I'm honest, this movie is a copycat of a copycat. Oh how I
miss the good old days! The good old days where if you went to see a
movie set in a dystopian future where a corrupt government put its
citizenry in peril on a whim, it was rated R because it contained great
special effects, gritty foul language laced dialogue, and contained
adult themes. But this! Okay! I understand the concept of movie studios
dumbing this type of film down so tweens can partake in something that
makes them feel like they are cool, or makes them feel like their
rebelling.Even though they aren't really, they're just soaking up things that
have been rehashed from what was cool 25+ years ago. Please! Tween
society, realize that when everyone is a rebel, the only true rebellion
is against rebellion itself!
