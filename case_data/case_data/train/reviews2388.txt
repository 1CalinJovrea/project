Great comeback for 2D animation

I know I speak for a lot of people about wishing for a 2D film to
return to the big screen. None of us expected it to be My Little Pony,
but don't let the title fool you. The story is a bit simplistic, but
the colorful cast of characters and personalities make the adventure
worthwhile. The animation really brings these qualities out and is
reminiscent of classic Disney movies. The songs are also great; two of
them already stuck in my head. This isn't a kids movie just for the
parents to groan over. This film gives everyone of all ages something
to enjoy. Give it a watch and I'm sure you'll have a great time with
it.
