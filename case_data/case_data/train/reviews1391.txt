Great film,  especially for spidey fans! Equal to Spiderman 2

First off, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and
Dennis are all Perfect in their roles. This movie is very different
from the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be
changed. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The
chemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting
story lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga.
The new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the
sequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional
scenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the
ending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to
come. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out
does the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2
is equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme.
