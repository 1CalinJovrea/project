At least it had some big names

The Last Witch Hunter really left a lot to be desired. It's a typical
last of your kind story. Vin Diesel stars as that said last of his
kind. Oh, and he's immortal by the way. Something about killing the
witch queen. I'm not really a big fan of Vin Diesel, but even to those
who are I'd just avoid this. I mean Vin himself does what he can, but
honestly the guy couldn't act to save his life. Though he's far from
the worst of it.The biggest shocker was Elijah Wood. I mean, seriously? The guy doesn't
really give a convincing performance. I mean he's had his fair share of
bad movies (ex. North, All I Want, Spy Kids 3-D (etc.)), but his
performance in the movie made it almost seem like he was desperate,
knowing he could in no way save the movie, but felt he had to make a
conscious effort to do so. The problem with his character being the bad
guy is that the movie hints so many times he's the bad guy and he at
one point is even questioned and denies it. This wouldn't be such a
problem if they didn't make it so painfully obvious he's in cahoots
with the Queen. Like I said, I love the Lord of the Rings movies as
much as the next guy, but he's had better movies.The rest of the cast doesn't leave much of an impression, but we do
have Michael Caine as the guy who was cursed. He's bland, but what can
you expect? As for the story it's more confusing than interesting. Most
of the logic seems to be set aside for glimpses of CGI effects which
are only average at best and the editing during these scenes is too
jumpy. Can't seem to stay on one thing too long eh? And for a movie all
about action there doesn't seem to be very much of it. It seems like
70% of the movie is philosophy BS and 30% is actual action. So there you have it, a 106 minute winded philosophical mess. It
probably would've been better off as a TV series or a short film, but
as a movie it wears out it's welcome far too quickly.
