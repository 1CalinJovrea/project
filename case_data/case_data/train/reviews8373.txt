Mesmerizing, Haunting, and Beautiful

A wonderful rendition of the vampire genre. From start to finish, this
movie is breathtaking. Director Neil Jordan ( who won an Oscar for
screenplay for The Crying Game) does a fantastic job at the
storytelling of a mother and daughter duo and the journey of their
lives as the undead. Sean Bobbitt as the Director of Photography (who
also did 12 Years a Slave and Place Beyond the Pines) transports us to
the past and present seamlessly and captures the horror and beauty that
life has to offer. Tony Lawson as editor (who also edited Stanley
Kubrick's Bary Lyndon) beautifully crafts this story that has themes of
love, revenge, horror, and and truth. Javier Navarrete as composer
creates a hauntingly compelling score that captures and reflects the
character's internal conflicts and external setting. Gemma Arterton as the mother is sexy, compelling, charming, and
damaged. There is no denying her acting abilities as she steals every
scene she is in and captivates us with her story and emotional
conviction. Saoirse Ronan as the daughter opposite of Arterton holds up
her own as a conflicted woman who conveys her struggle with restraint
and loneliness. Ronan's portrayal of innocence and anger taps into the
humanism in all of us and we feel every emotion she conveys on screen. The film is also surprisingly deep and reflects themes relating to
social classes, gender inequality, humanity, and the concept of being
obsessive and letting go.Give this movie a shot and let it surprise you.
