A complete waste of anyone's time

I am really just weighing in out of obligation to try and to prevent
anyone else from wasting their time. The main question I have to ask is
WHY WAS THIS MOVIE MADE?? Seriously, have you ever been a captive
audience to a co-worker or fellow passenger and they go on about some
dream they had. Well, this is worse. Whoever convinced the studio to
actually make this film is a great bullshit artist. The acting isn't
bad. In fact, Hugo Weaving does an excellent job and Nicole Kidman is
sold. Sadly, the movie starts at nowhere... chases its tail.. and ends
at nowhere. There seems to be some rule about a minimum of 10 lines, so
i guess I should go into more detail: (spoiler alert) the possibilities
of the daughter's disappearance are many, but in the end, none of them
are realized. Which would be fine if the weak plot wasn't mostly built
around this revelation. Shame on the person who ever thought this idea
was enough for movie.
