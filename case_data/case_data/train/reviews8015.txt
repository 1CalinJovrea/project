Perfect sibling time

Frankly I was prepared to watch a huge waste of money on crappy visual
effects and famous actors. It turned out to be pleasant time with my
brother. Jack and the Beanstalk is a well-known international fable
with not so well story compared to other myths and fables, but the
writer did a great job adapting the scripts. Visual effects are
good-not bad- and nothing is overrated. Watching Jack the giant slayer
is a nice sibling time. Highly recommended. Somehow I'm not looking
forward to watch a sequel of the story. Especially not with giants
walking around London. it's like watching Thor: the dark world (2013)
all over again.
