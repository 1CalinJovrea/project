Easy to forgive the plot holes

I'm not a zombie movie fan but I am a huge Matt Smith and Pride &
Prejudice fan so I felt the need to see Pride & Prejudice & Zombies. I
try to retain the image of MS as the Doctor so I haven't watched
anything else he has played in but because the two afore mentioned
worlds collided I HAD to see this movie and I was not disappointed! I
found it easy to look around the obvious plot holes and simply enjoyed
hearing the old familiar lines spoken in such a different
setting/atmosphere with MS's performance being the icing on the cake.
This movie is not award winning but it is very entertaining and I only
had to look away a couple of times.....
