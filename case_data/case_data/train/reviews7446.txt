One boring un-surprising movie

Wow, talk about a movie written to a well-worn Hollywood recipe.There are 0 surprises is this movie. As soon as the two main characters
meet at the dinner party the rest of the movie flows like a ad-lib.Wow, she wrote the letter? What a surprise. Yawn.Wow, they scored exactly what was needed to win the bet? Yawn.Wow, he decides on the new girl instead of his old wife? Amazing, never
saw that twist coming.....And I thought M. Night Shyamalan had gotten bad at twists. Even my
wife, who is a sucker for she flick comedies thought it was wayyyyy to
predictable.
