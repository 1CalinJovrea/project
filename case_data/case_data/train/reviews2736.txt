Pixar does it again

Having really enjoyed Monsters Inc when I was younger, I was pleasantly
surprised when I heard that there was going to be a prequel released.It was interesting to see how all the characters had met and what their
friendships were like in the earlier days. The film has a good simple
plot and is perfect for the whole family to enjoy as there is also some
funny parts as well as heartwarming moments. It was great that Mike and
Sulley (the two main characters) had the same voice-overs as the
original film, this made it feel more authentic.Overall I really enjoyed this film, but then who doesn't love a good
Disney Pixar film? 8/10
