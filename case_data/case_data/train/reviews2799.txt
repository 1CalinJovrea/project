Walked out of this truly disgusting revolting movie

Quentin Tarantino is a case of arrested development at 12 who keeps on
making revenge fantasy movies, my guess against bullies who picked on
him as a child. This film is a combination of spaghetti western and
blaxploitation. I know I am odds with others, but I don't find hearing
the "N" word at least 100 times entertaining; watching two men fight to
the death as "entertainment" (the hammer used to kill one of the two
wrestlers); the murder of a black man by a pack of vicious dogs;
constant whipping, etc., etc., etc. - and with all that said, my least
favorite character, by far, was Django - he's supposed to be "hip" and
manly and blah blah blah, but he's really just a despicable macho jerk.
I was very disappointed by Leonardo Di Caprio's performance (I didn't
see the last 40 minutes of the movie; I had enough of the constant
violence).I get that others just love guns, violence, the "N" word, and find it
oh so funny when the Klu Klux Klan can't see through their sheets
(hilarious - not!) - I get that others just love violence against
others. Let's see: Aurora, Newtown, Columbine, drone planes murdering
innocent children, women and men in countries we are not at war with -
hmmm - could there be a connection? A society in love with violence
can't quite reconcile the kharmic blowback that inevitably occurs.Yes, this film is well-photographed; there is one interesting
performance (Christoph Waltz); the music, while weird, has its moments
- but that's it as far as I'm concerned.Tarantino is always infuriating. If he could get away from his
adolescent revenge violent fantasies he clearly has a knowledge of film
history and has the money to hire fine movie technicians. But this film
is a complete waste of time and money.Did you really find all the violence "fun" to watch? It turned my
stomach. Films I enjoyed had violent scenes in them but they did not
glorify violence.
