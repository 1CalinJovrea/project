Everyone in theater was laughing - the movie was that miserable.

The movie was very stupid and naive. Producers did not bother to make
anything meaningful assuming that people will go watch it anyway. What
a disappointment. Nothing has remained from the realistic first part.
This one is more like a naive boring drama with infrequent heroic acts
of Liam Neeson. In fact, most of the time he looks like a pompous clown
trying to be serious while playing a stupid script. As in a regular
cheap movie, bad guys are not really bad and are very respectful to the
main characters, always giving them plenty of time to talk and to run
away. What irritates even more is ridiculously large amount of product
placement. Save your time and money, don't watch this movie in
theaters.
