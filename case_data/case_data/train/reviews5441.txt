New perspective on Snowden

This movie succeeds in padding out the personal dimension of the Edward
Snowden story. Its focus is the impact of Snowden's highly secretive,
demanding work on his home life  and particularly on his relationship
with his girlfriend, Lindsay.The Snowden story is so bloody interesting  which makes this film
interesting, thought-provoking and definitely worth a watch. However,
the script was a bit melodramatic at times and I did find myself
wishing they had done a better job with the content.If you're interested in Snowden generally, I would definitely recommend
the documentary Citizenfour over this one. But if you've already seen
it, then it's worth adding this one to your watch list.
