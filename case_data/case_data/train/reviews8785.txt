Jackie Chan and another masterclass action providing thriller.....

I have always been a superstitious fan of jackie chan...a kind of blind
one i think...from the early age of my watching movie time i was
thrilled by those action packed movies of him.and yet again he proved
me right this time.This movie contains jackie chan..it is enough for me
to say it a good film...but when i saw this i found besides him many
crucial parts of it had to be watched and to be thinked for...the
plot,the twists and turnes ...the music...all this adds to the
flavour...I realized jackie is a small part of this fabulous
movie....May be 30-40%...in maths..This movie offers many aspects of sudden and chronic mind blowing
thoughts and ideas..so thrilling...so executive and the movie build up
is so progressive that it pulls u into it. As the movie starts with a
simple londonian buisenessman, accelerates with the death of his
beloved daughter,rides with the truth revealing actions full of
terrorism, buried past and a British government official. The movie
gently will be blended with u...will generate a storm in ur
brain....will particularly play with ur thoughts and at the end will
toy ur perceptions.The movie moves on dynamically towards a thrilling climax...touchy one
as well..acting is u know will be always excellent with jackie
chan...but others also have done well including pierce brosnan.... Good
to see him in a very good form after a time i can say...the actions are
also eye soothing....u can not ignore those when jackie is around
...can u ??????such movie should not be missed.....never say no to this
one....never.......
