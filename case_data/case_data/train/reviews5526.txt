The worst Adam Sandler ever

I am really sorry to see that this is an Adam Sandler movie. I have
watched them all as I grew up with Adam Sandler and was thrilled to see
a new one appear yesterday on Netflix, especially with this great cast.
But I have tried so hard, but had to stop after 40 minutes into the
movie. This is really really very sad. Happy Gilmore, Spanglish (..I
know), Anger Management, Just go with it and Big Daddy (and of course
many more) were all great movies I have watched over and over! All were
very humorous and the fact that his friends appeared in all movies was
fun to watch. This is just really sad. I am very interested to see how
this one will be doing money wise... I would have given a zero, but a 1
is the lowest.....
