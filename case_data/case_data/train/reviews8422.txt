Poorly Executed

What should have been a tense exciting retelling of the Iranian Embassy
Siege is instead a slow moving turgid non event which is not worth the
effort. A massive disappointment and every time Abbie Cornish appeared
on screen as the BBCs Kate Adie I had to look away it was that
embarrassing.
