Unbelievably Good

Superb acting with a story line that'll draw you in and really make you
feel like you're part of the crew. Loved it. Can't believe someone
would rate this poorly and call it cliché. It's based on a true story
so I'm not sure how that's cliché. Either way - it's amazing and I'm
glad they made the movie so the world can honor these brave heroes.
