Awesome Film. Blew away my expectations!

FLIGHT is a great film! In a day and age where almost all Hollywood
movies try to thrill us with special effects and gore, FLIGHT 'soars'
with extraordinary acting and a story that will change lives. I went
not knowing really what to expect. A drama about a crashed airplane,
right? Well this film is much much more. It is truth. Truth about life.
Truth about addictions. Denzel Washington does an awesome, believable
job as an alcoholic airplane captain, struggling with his addiction and
accusations after the plane crash. John Goodman plays an interesting
character and provides some laughs. Without giving too much away, I
will say that if you like drama movies or Denzel, go see it. If you
are, or know anyone who is struggling with an addiction of ANY KIND...
go see it! It just might change your life. 9/10 A+
