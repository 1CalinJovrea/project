fantastic four = fantastic bore

Terrible movie as previous reviewer writes the pacing is all wrong the
characters are bleh you don't feel any attachment to them with them
creating no chemistry.The middle section of the movie is drawn out
while the climax feels rushed like the director went gosh where running
out of time quick rap it up. After the recent awesome avenger movies
and the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering.The
story has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist
doing super stupid things and Miles Teller playing Mr Fantastic is just
a terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader. Wait for DVD
or what ever and let it go quietly in to the past .
