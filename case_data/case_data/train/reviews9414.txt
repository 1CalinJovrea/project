13 Hours

I loved the movie! I will say that it raised my blood pressure 100
points though. Watching Americans under fire after this lying
administration told sold many lies and acted so cowardly made me sick
to my stomach. The outcome is what you get when unqualified incompetent
people are put in charge. This movie should be considered a documentary
and proof in court to prosecute clinton and this administration! They
pay the taliban/isis to bring home a deserter traitor but couldn't
activate units to assist Americans under fire for 13 hours? Total
disgrace to America and Americans. The movie shows what happens when
unqualified people make decisions in a combat zone concerning ROE. This
is a movie that all Americans need to watch to understand how most
muslims will act toward non-muslims.
