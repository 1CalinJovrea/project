It had it's moments

Finally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had
had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was
missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he
should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't.
Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in
this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story
line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's
hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed
greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special
effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for
sure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!
