Boring and Pointless

One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over
nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I
was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV
series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his
pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the
story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when
their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily
accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action
still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at
other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It
didn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going
to fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to
explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. "superheroes",
"superslaves" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was
nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The
story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and
hollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would
enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is
the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of
"F" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is
gory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Characters
are terrible.
