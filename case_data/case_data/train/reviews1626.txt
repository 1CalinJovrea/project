It could have been better.

This was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read and I loved it, so I had
high hopes for the movie. Like usual the movies are never as good as
the books are. For some reason they changed a lot of basic info. Like
location. Why change the state? Any way the love making scenes were
very good so if you are just going for the romance you won't be
disappointed. I think that Zack played Logan well. He had a depth that
I didn't expect as an actor even though he didn't have much to work
with. It wasn't my favorite movie but it wasn't that bad either. Maybe
if you didn't read the book first you might like it better. And for
those who haven't read it but liked the movie, you should read it. You
will love it.
