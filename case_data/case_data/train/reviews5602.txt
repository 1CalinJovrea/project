The 1 hour and 33 minuets lost forever!!

What shall I saith to thee!! First I barely understood what they were
saying. The beginning had some potential, was the daughter a witch? Did
the twins do something? Then somewhere in between all this nonsense,
the black goat was the evil entity, for a lack of a better word. I
don't know if the producer, director or writer took too much acid
before finishing the movie. There is really no words to describe what I
just watched. All I know is if I could bleach out my eyes, and my brain
I would. When I looked at the reviews here at IMDb, and the trailer, I thought
well this could be a good horror movie. WRONG in every sense of the
word. Those who gave it positive reviews were taking the same acid that
the producer, director and writer took. I have so wasted an hour and
half of my life, that I can NEVER get back. IF you decide to watch this
after reading my warning, watch it at your own risk.
