Seriously Great "Joss Whedon" Type Film

Very good movie that's smart, funny, and actually isn't predictable.
Great original and stylish directing. Not very scary really, at least
on t.v., but I'm sure it would have been scarier on big screens. It
really didn't matter though, because the kid's character in the movie
threads through the entire story seamlessly, perfectly developed, and
the babysitter's character is actually believable and the babysitter we
all would have fallen for when we were that age, and been equally as
brokenhearted to find out she's actually a psychopathic killer, and was
just using us for a satanic ritual.
