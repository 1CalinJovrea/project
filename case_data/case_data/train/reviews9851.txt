Such a horrible and boring movie

A full waste of my time. This is not a zombie movie nor a
Schwarzenegger kind of movies. Don't expect any action what so ever.
This is a sad and poor way to tell a father daughter story. I waited
for the punch line but nothing happens in this movie rather then the
expected and the obvious. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry
Arnold, I really love your other movies.. but this is total BS. I am
supposed to write 10 lines on this awful movie and I am doing this just
to warn you all from seen it. 10 lines? it is just another waste of my
time.. I really wish I hadn't seen this movie. DO NOT GO TO SEE IT OR
RENT IT.
