--- Why this movie was burnt ---

I saw this movie yesterday..i am no critic i just saying my opinion...This could be a grate movie..but it was burnt to the ground...or in
other words it was saved by the astonishing performance of the
actors.First of all the plot has many gaps,the story alone could have
help the director to put many more scenes into the movie to make it
more interesting to the public. The surroundings are beautiful but its
not enough. The Secret Scripture (by the way the title of the movie)
was not focused. it could have been shown that the old lady was indeed
changing the books phrases so that no one could read it except her,
showing that she was more capable and smart,instead of a left alone
crazy woman abandoned in a sanatorium .The scenes with the priest could
have been more analytic as far as how and why did he grow this maniac
jealous attitude about her.Even the love that she has for the young guy
could have been more deeply shown. The fact that the doctor is
interested about this woman past and suddenly out of nowhere when he
had a conversation with the nurse about his family realizes that the
birth dates of him and the old crazy woman matches and then he
understands that its his mother,it is just a big hilarious fail.The
hole movie was like pieces of different scene materials put it all
together just to make a movie.In my opinion again this could have been a great movie,like a mix of
The notebook with the Pearl Harbor combined.
