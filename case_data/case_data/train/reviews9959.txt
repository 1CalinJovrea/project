Unsatisfactory would be an understatement

I watched this film several days ago, choosing not to review the
picture immediately after viewing with the mindset that I may
appreciate it more with enough time to process it properly - but the
more I process it in my mind, the more I realise just how terrible this
movie really was. Entering the theater those few days ago, the expectation was not
originality, unpredictability or even a decent performance from cast
members (of which there were none). The sole expectation was a fun and
entertaining movie that wan't thinking about awards season when being
written, but was instead thinking about its audience members and how to
keep them engrossed for what turned out to be a very frustrating 105
minutes.The main issue is the lack of variety - specifically in the screenplay,
plot and most of all the jokes. The assumed chemistry between the
actors and the jokes that should have worked so well as a result of
this were nowhere to be seen. Comedy that did amuse was nothing
unexpected due to the main humor already shown in the trailer and all
other jokes borrowed liberally from better films of a similar genre.
This resulted in the visual gags coupled with shots of the vegas strip
standing in as the driving force of the film.All in all Last Vegas is a movie that never seemed to really get going,
making the experience feel short, but for all the wrong reasons. News
of a sequel already in the works? You must be joking.
