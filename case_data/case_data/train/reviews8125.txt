Will do for pets, what Toy Story did for toys

Well known Pets are friends in the neighborhood, until one incident
separates two dogs from there owner, there friends who are also pets
must band together to find them.The movie makes you realize the joy of having a pet, made me remember
my dog who passed away years ago. The voice actors really do well with
there characters. It's a fun adventure and misadventure also. The
animation is amazing, not Toy Story amazing, but amazing. Awesome to
see all kinds of animals working together. Kids and adults I believe
will enjoy this. Will make really enjoy owning a pet, and what a pet
means to you.
