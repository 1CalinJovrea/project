Stop-motion at its best

moviestoenjoy.wordpress.comAfter 26 years of the short movie, Tim Burton brings us a movie with
his name written all over it. Creative and original, Frankeweenie
illustrates its writer's original roots.The concept is fascinating. Most of the characters are based on iconic
horror movie characters, like Frankenstein and Van Helsing. In
addition, the movie is set in black and white, trying to capture the
old look of horror movies. And yes, I don't think this film is suitable
for children, more like teenagers and adults, containing some scenes
that may disturb children.It's the story of Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan), who,
after losing his beloved dog Sparky, tries to revive him using
lightning. The experiment is a success, but no one should know about
what happened. Things start to get messed up when Edgar (voiced by
Atticus Shaffer) discovers Sparky.The animation is great. Tim Burton brings us a stop-motion masterpiece,
paying attention to every detail from the movie's beginning to its end.
The decent overall voice performance does the job just fine, giving us
spooky character, Atticus Shaffer's voice gave me the chills. Tim
Burton's fine job and the voice actors' performance give us the horror
atmosphere necessary for the movie.Burton is always highly imaginative and creative, but he's somehow
missing something. Don't get me wrong, the movie's great, but something
would've made it better. Frankenweenie will entertain a good percentage
of its watchers, making it a must see 2012 movie.
