As Dredd should be

Dredd is the guy. A personification of justice and the bitter medicine
that is needed in Megacity 1. He doesn't hesitate, never, because there's much more work to do. And he is incorruptible, and doesn't care about rising in crime rate
despite his efforts, because he is doing his part and doesn't have time
for theories and chitchat. He is ruthless, also. And he applies the sentence the way the criminals
kill their victims, to show them the pain they caused. Right or wrong, leave to the theoretical, because Dredd will keep
cleaning the streets.
