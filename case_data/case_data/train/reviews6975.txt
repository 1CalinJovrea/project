Survival on a bed

"What would I do if I'm chained to a bed in a house in the middle of
nowhere?" I asked myself while I watched this movie. This movie really
let's you feel Jess' dread and desperateness throughout. Stephan King
took a simple concept like this and turned it into a story about the
human condition, and this movie translates that well. The fact that
Jess was already a broken woman but uses that brokenness to her
advantage is amazing. If there is one negative thing I have to say
about this movie it's that it is a lot more "drama" than I expected,
because I expected a nail biter and this movie isn't really like that,
but it is sickeningly brutal though and that is awesome!It's a MUST WATCH from me.
