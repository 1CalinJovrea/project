You'll find yourself saying 'What am I watching' more than once

Well what can I say, Tusk is a film of it's own. The premise of the
film is Justin Long being turned into a patch- work walrus. It is a hit
or miss film, you either love it or hate it.Justin Longs acting in this film is great, but the film had a lot of
jumping around and doesn't feel fluid with it's character arcs. It aims
to be a dark comedy and I did find myself chuckling at some parts in
the film, I equally found myself saying 'What am I watching' just as
often. There isn't really much character development in the movie, but
you do grow attached to Justin Longs character by the end of the film.
The actual walrus when you see it is slightly disturbing.I genuinely felt slightly upset at the end of the film, but I felt as
though the film could have been written better. If there was a more
fluid feel to the scenes, and more development on the characters then
this film would be getting better ratings. The overall story is original, the acting is great, but as a final
product it feels very rushed and choppy. I enjoyed tusk and think that
it is underrated and being played off as 'too weird'Yes, it's a weird film but it's trying to be different and is a nice
change of pace from most horror films these days. If you want a film
that will make you genuinely say 'WTF' at the end, tusk is for you. If
you're going into this film expecting a good horror film, you're going
to be disappointed.
