Much Better Than I Expected

When I first saw the trailer, I thought it would just be another
generic action movie. However, I found myself to be enjoying the movie
and was entertained.Non-Stop stars Liam Neeson as air marshall Bill Marks. The journey
starts out as any other until he gets a text from an unknown person
which says that he will kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150
million is transferred to a bank account.As the movie progresses, the stakes get higher and things just keep
getting worse for Liam Neeson's character. If you haven't watched the
trailer, there is a twist which would have made some scenes much
better. In my opinion, don't think they should have shown that in the
trailer.Along the way, there are some sweet action scenes and plenty of moments
to keep you guessing. You will have to suspend a lot of disbelief
though, some of the events that happened were timed so perfectly and
seemed just lucky to even occur the way it did. The final third of the movie, although very entertaining, felt a bit
weaker than the rest of the movie. Mainly because of the reasons of the
villains -didn't really like reason. Apart from that, I enjoyed the
action, the story and the ending. Plenty of action to keep you
entertained and a decent story.
