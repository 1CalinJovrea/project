Awesome

what can i say. i LOVED this film. yeah sure, it has a *few* weak points and maybe a plot hole or two. And
the acting is barebones, these are kids, not Cyrano De Bergerac or
Mephistofele, but boy the film is well done.I mistakenly googled the film's name before it was over, and
disappointed myself to learn that it's just the first of three parts,
so it means waiting another 2-3 years for the other two films, but that
means also that i have something to look forward to.Now, i normally like more "profound" films, but for once, i really
enjoyed this sci-fi romp and no, it's nothing like Twilight. A couple
of the characters (Gally, Chuck) are phoned in, but then again, how
would you write this kind of plot without these characters getting
thrown in?So the film is a very pleasant, well paced, well directed, reasonably
well acted, decently scored, great .. well, nice CGI, entertaining film
that will please just about every audience there is, without being
horribly commercial, soppy and clich√©.I haven't had this much fun in a long while - although i gotta say Edge
OF Tomorrow was just as good.My final vote - a very solid 8/10, and I'm wishing for parts 2 and 3
ASAP.
