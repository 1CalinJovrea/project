A huge disappointment for a true horror movie fan!!!

This was one of the WORST horror movies I have seen in a long time!!!
(Short of "The Bay", which managed to be just a tiny bit worse than
this one.) I am an Ethan Hawke fan, and I can honestly say he was the
best actor in the movie... Besides Ethan, the rest of the acting was
not good! The lines were hokey, not at all believable. And I would
personally like to scold whoever composed the musical soundtrack for
this movie! It was extremely irritating and/or sounded like bad porn
music at times... Absolutely terrible. The "special effects", i.e. the
dead children and Mr. Boogie, were awful - obviously computer animated,
and you saw them so often they lost their scare factor. As a true
horror fan, I feel there were SO many things they could have done to
make this movie better and scarier! The story was very predictable and
disappointing. If you paid to see this in the theater, I am sorry for
your waste of money... If you haven't yet, DON'T BOTHER!!!!!
