How can people slate this movie???

I just don't understand how people are not liking this film. It is just
perfect!!! Any Richard Curtis movie I rate against Love actually,
because to me that is his best film and one of my all time favourites!
But About Time for me beats love actually hands down. The film is so
well thought out and the cast is just so good! I have seen this movie
twice already as it was such a great story. The main focus of the film
is about love and family so don't be too worried about the travelling
in time, it fits into the film so well and makes some great comic
moments when things go wrong. Don't listen to the haters, this really
is a fabulous movie! It is a sad thought though that this could be
Richard's last film he is going to direct, I hope not, but if it is,
what a way to end his brilliant films! Well done Richard Curtis! 10/10
