Disaster..

why is this film made in 3D,i have no idea.so many of the films made
today are introduced in 3D with no what so ever need..(only AVATAR were
that much great in 3D). The story in this part is very weak.i expected
a more convincing script than this one.the idea of being captivated in
a frozen form and waking up after a certain amount of time is already
worn out. Kate Beckinsale gives a good performance but the film and the
screenplay didn't help much,at some times i felt the script was naiive.
the movie's duration was very short,i felt it was an episode for
television not a full movie. i expected more of this film but i didn't
get what i was expecting.
