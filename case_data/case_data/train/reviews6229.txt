Trash

I can only say that my children could have written better dialog than
the crap that was put up on screen. No depth in any of the
characters,no conflict to move this thing forward. Don't waste your
money unless all you want to see is the dancers. then again, you can
get that all for free on the internet, so its not even worth it for
that.The story is very weak at best, the "love" interest creates absolutely
zero compassion or desire within the audience to even care if they end
up together or not.Unneeded forced drug use at a sorority dance job. No real situation has
a bunch of guys hanging at a sorority house in the other room while the
male revue is dancing for the girls. All i can say is thank goodness I rarely go to the movies if this is
what is being pushed on audiences.save your money and get a netflix account for two months.
