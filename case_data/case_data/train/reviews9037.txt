Enjoy

Well I'm gonna push my English to the limits to try and express the
wonderful feeling I am still savoring. It is all about pieces coming
together perfectly in this movie for me. The plot, THE ACTING, the
dialogs, the settings etc. Very shortly after beginning of the movie I
had gotten the sensation of being in the presence of a perfectly
balanced yet joyfully spontaneous story that allowed me the feeling of
a real life playing out in front of me however incongruous it might
seem. We all search for this in books and movies the story that would
just pick us up and take us along on an exciting ride. So few can do
that. Immersion isn't that what gives us the most joy in life. Do not
expect anything from this movie
