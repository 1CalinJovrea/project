Been a while since I've laughed so hard

Went to this movie a little leery because of the reviews and because I
haven't loved all of Adam Sandler's movies. I was very surprised to
find that I laughed nearly the whole movie. I thought Adam and Drew
Barrymore did a great job together. All of the supporting cast was
hilarious, especially Kevin Nealon and his "wife," and Terry Crews, who
cracked me up every single scene he was in. Some of the scenes were a
bit emotional, and even these scenes teared me up a little bit, thought
all the acting was well done. The Africa setting was beautiful and the
scenes in the hotel were gorgeous.All in all I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants a few laughs
and a feel good movie.
