CHEF is a real charmer

CHEF is a total delight! I was expecting a forced attempt by Hollywood
veterans to make a "charming" and "heartfelt" indie. Instead, I
discovered a truly genuine film that is both charming and heartfelt for
real with no unnecessary plot points (OK, the end is a bit rushed and
tagged on). This is the best film since SINGIN IN THE RAIN to depict
the pleasure and fun of hard work, friendship, and camaraderie. CHEF
has a great spirit that is never forced and every performance is truly
perfect. Just spot on in every way. Favreau really shows what a great
director of actors he is in the direction of Emjay Anthony. This is a
real kid, not a movie kid.CHEF will surprise you in the best way! Work hard, appreciate what
you've got. A great message.
