One of the worst movies...

I don't like to be negative, but I feel obligated to help save the rest
of the world from wasting their hard earned money on this movie. This
is just about the worst movie I can recall ever seeing in my entire
life in the movie theater, and I have seen more movies than anyone I
know. There were about 10 minutes of this movie that I can honestly say
were funny, but the remaining 84 minutes were just complete and utter
agony. The movie takes the concepts of silly and campy to new lows. The
movie is laden with deliberate and unintelligent attempts at campy
humor, but every attempt falls flat. The concept behind the movie was
great, but the execution simply does not measure up. Disappointed! Can
I get my money back?
