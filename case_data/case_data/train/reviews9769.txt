Thrilling and Exciting All the Way Through,

Non-Stop is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a
talented cast.The films story was certainly an original one,and I
though I think the final half of the movie is a disappointment,the
movie is still a very exciting action and thriller from start to
finish.Liam Neeson is without a doubt the best actor in this film,he
really carries the rest of the cast and the movie certainly wouldn't be
the same without him as the very likable lead,although Julianne Moore
did deliver a great performance and none of the actors were bad.The
reason why I was disappointed by the ending is because it seemed like
there was going to be an amazing twist,but that never happened,nothing
was very shocking which I did find to be a big disappointment.Non-Stop
is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to fans of Liam
Neeson,thrillers and actions.On a plane headed to London,an air marshall must springs in to action
after he receives text messages that someone will kill a passenger on
the plane every twenty minutes unless the airline transfers $150
million in to an anonymous bank account.
