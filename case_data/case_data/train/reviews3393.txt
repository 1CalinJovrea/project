One of the best thrillers of cinema. Excellent!!!

Congratulations to Spanish cinema by presenting us with yet another
thriller / mystery spectacular without showing explicit sex, as we have
seen in some Spanish films. The movie is great! The way that every
thriller should be: it leaves you lost, but arrives somewhere. And this
place is beyond the obvious. The atmosphere of suspense and tension
remains, and we are honored by the environment's main plot: nothing
less than a morgue! The unwinding of the film is fantastic, amazing and
high quality. The Spanish film hardly disappoints me. This one does not
disappoint at any time. We watch unblinking eyes and is surprised as
the quality of the excellent climate of suspense. The final part is
amazing, leaves us with an open mouth and makes us wonder as was
thought up this great script. Without blinking my grade is 10! Never
has a movie surprised me as much as this in recent years.Thanks again Spanish cinema!
