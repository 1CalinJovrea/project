It's beyond Awesome word....

Great work by whole team of Snowden. There efforts paid off and i hope
what they want to show, exactly that have been shown. This is the first
time i am writing a review for a movie. It's worth to write a review
for a guy who has put lot of efforts and still fighting for it. Yep
it's sad to see getting mixed reviews. I can't comment on public review
as everyone has there own perception and own thinking, how they look
movie. I look every particular scene and i take all positive things. I
loved the role played by Joseph and he has nailed it. Thanks all for
putting lot of efforts and making such a nice movie inspired by true
events.
