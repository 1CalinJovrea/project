To Purge Or Not To Purge?!

After a pretty effective but fairly muted debut with its first
instalment "The Purge" franchise actually took a few very welcome steps
forward with the much improved and thoroughly entertaining "Anarchy", a
pretty rare feat at any point in time, but especially in today's
prequel, sequel, reboot and remake flooded movie scene... That positive
change came in large part at the hands of Frank Grillo, a genuine
on-screen bad ass if there ever was one!So I was very much looking forward to the third (and final ?!)
instalment of this franchise. But from its opening frames until the
closing credits, "Election Year" proved to be a disappointment and a
letdown. It is as far as I am concerned the weakest entry in the
franchise!First of all Frank Grillo, who was the heart of the second movie, and a
large reason of why "The Purge" franchise improved, is completely
misused here and basically relegated to a glorified secondary
character. "Election Year", is a messy and underwhelming creation of
bad casting, bad acting, bad directing and writing. Too bad that this franchise stumbled at the end, and offered a most
unsatisfying concluding chapter...
