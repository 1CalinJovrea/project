An Excellent Movie with a few rough edges

Chappie is exuberant, playful, funny and perhaps one of the most human
characters to grace the screen in years. He's an unwilling action hero
that one can both identify with and admire. His story is gripping and
will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately some of Chappie's
brilliance comes at the expense of the world around him. Plot holes and
logical fallacies abound, and although some of it can be written off to
the imperfection of humanity (a central theme in the movie) there are
enough "Wait, why the would he/she/they do X."" moments to be a
significant distraction.Many reviewers have complained that Chappie Cliché. In an era where the
majority of box office darlings with >8 star reviews are remakes,
reboots or result of the Disney/Pixar/Marvel equation the majority of
those reviewers are clearly either hypocrites or they don't know what
cliché means. Chappie is soaked in the Blomkamp style and while that
style was new and fresh with District 9, its unreasonable to expect a
director's primary product to be novelty.Overall it's a good movie, certainly more interesting than most of the
box-office-safe fare out that's been out there.
