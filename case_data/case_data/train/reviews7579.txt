Incredibly Gripping

This movie isn't for everyone. It isn't for people who are vehemently
anti-torture. It isn't for people who need a feel-good story with a
happy ending. That being said, this movie had me literally on the edge
of my seat for 2 1/2 hours and is a fantastic f-ing movie.People will want to compare this movie to the hurt locker, which is
fair in the way that it locks you into scenes and is a war movie. The
hurt locker was more of a pure war movie, whereas Zero Dark Thirty uses
more dramatizations and has a more coherent direction, while still
being an incredibly suspenseful movie.Some people might criticize this movie for a lack of character
development, but they are really missing the point of this movie. It's
not your typical Hollywood movie that introduces a protagonist and
develops him/her until the conflict is resolved. This movie is about
tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden, and the way they used the main
character as a metaphor for America as a whole was really impressive,
even while refraining from your typical, often boring character
developing scenes.Much more than your average action movie, Zero Dark Thirty was a
combination of badass scenes, phenomenal editing, and music, and a
fantastic (mostly) true story with epic scope that I can't wait to see
again. This is the BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, and this is coming from a
huge batman fan who also just saw Django Unchained a week ago.
