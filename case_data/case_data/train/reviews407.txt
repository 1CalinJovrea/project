Could be great but ruined

First of all, it was a great action movie with a great acting. BUT, the
script was worthless!I just wanna point some of the silliness out, (though there are too
many).The Last 5 minutes of the movie was the worst part of it.- The 911 picks phone after 3 - 4 ringing and not instantly. Really!!!- The operator of 911 says that they are triangulating the phone
location. But it is not a cellphone and it is a landline that does not
need such a thing.- The police cars and the helicopter arrive at the same time. I did not
know they have the same speed. And do we really need to see that much
police cars at the end?, while there was almost zero police car from
the beginning. Maybe all of the police were at a party with the 911
operator included.- Could not she ask for a cellphone of a pedestrian and take it? Maybe
all the pedestrians with cellphones were at the same party.- The movie could be logical if there was a zombie apocalypse at the
city. And by the way, i wanna one of those red minivans because the hero of
the movie was the red minivan.It is a shame that these days they make these absurd movies while they
have a potential to not laugh people and be real movies.
