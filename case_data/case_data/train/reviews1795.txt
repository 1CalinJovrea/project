Rich Moore Brings The Gamer Out In All Of Us

Wreck It Ralph is an astonishing Disney animation for the whole family.
It is a story about a villain from the fictional old fashioned game Fix
It Felix Jr. Where Ralph (John C. Reilly) wants to be a good guy. This
movie is set in an old fashioned classic arcade center where characters
travel into different games and meet up with each other after the
arcade closes.Rich Moore brings out the child in all adults and brings out our
imagination and curiosity in all of us as the characters all keep going
after the lights are out... Do they really? This animation was the best
animated movie of 2012! the whole movie has you gripped from start to
finish and has some tricky twists that are not expected when they hit.
Fix It Felix (Jack McBryer) And Calhoun (Jane Lynch) start a quest to
find Ralph but some of these scenes can be drawn out for a bit to long.This animated movie had many of our favorite gaming characters like
Bowser, Pac-Man and Sonic. and shows a wide variety of different games.
the ideas that this movie plants in your mind are mind-numbingly
awesome and the HD animation is amazing. There are many heroic scenes
led by Ralph and there are always funny remarks made by Vanellope
(Sarah Silverman) along Ralph's journey.The Comedy, Drama, Action, Adventure movie was enough to make me think
of games in a different way and the animation in the movie was great,
John C. Reilly was a perfect Wreck It Ralph and Jack McBryer does a
great job at being Fix It Felix Jr. This movie is a great family movie
and is to be watched again and again. <9 Out Of 10>
