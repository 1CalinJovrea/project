Incredible

I tend to side with critics often, and usually find they are on target
- case in point- Man of Steel - which I had the highest of hopes for,
and felt it was mediocre at best. So, I went in to Lone Ranger with low
expectations based on reviews I had read from the so called experts. I
was a fan of the series as a kid. Was not sure what to expect from
this. Well, This is the Lone Ranger movie for the 21st century. It was
fantastic. What movie did these critics watch? It set a perfect tone.
Depp was terrific. Hammer was pitch perfect - he became grew to be the
Lone Ranger. It left me wanting more, and movies rarely do that for me.
Spread the word of mouth - we need this movie to have legs so we get a
much deserved sequel. Trust me, its GREAT. And my 7 y/o son loved it
just as much.
