Shocked by all the bad reviews

I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to movies in general, with
comedies' standards differing a bit. I was very pleasantly surprised
with this movie. I expected it to be pretty funny, but nothing special.
I came away thinking it was pretty funny; but also found it to have a
lot of heart and actually/shockingly, quite thought provoking. As I get
older, relationships with friends are becoming confusing, complicated,
and frankly quite difficult. And this movie hit on that really well. I
also thought Mr. Green was an amazing character; and he's now a bit of
a personal cult favorite of mine id say. This goes down as one of my
three or four favorite Christmas movies.
