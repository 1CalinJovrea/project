When everything goes right,why ?

Masterpiece. Johnny still rock although those years he stay out of his
ship. I cant say same thing for the movie. Something missing that i
cant named but you cant feel movie because of it. 2 hours movie has
story line worthy of 30 mins which it makes movie slowly built. Movie
says everything is over but after credit scene still trying. Didn't
like it. For whom it concern; Don't make any spin-off or another
episode just leave it nice don't screw. Also i want to mention that
hector will always in my heart. I will always remember. R.I.P. by the
way i almost cry that scene because he is my favorite character of the
sequel
