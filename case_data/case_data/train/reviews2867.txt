The newest soon to be forgotten entry in the 'loophole' movie genre.

If you surf the web regularly, then you sooner or later encounter
annoying ads promising to reveal to you some sort of secret or
'loophole' that will make you rich. While they are overwhelmingly
ignored, the persistence of these ads proves that they gather at least
some clicks, if only from people who are bored.Recently, Hollywood appears to have evolved the 'loophole' idea into a
little movie genre of its own (seen in 'limitless', 'the big short',
'wolf of wallstreet'). The protagonist, an ordinary Joe with whom we
are supposed to identify, comes across a loophole which allows them to
generate very large amounts of money using immoral and/or illegal
means. To avoid real controversy, the discussion of what is wrong with
the system that allows this to happen regularly is usually very limited
and there is a catharsis in the end: the protagonist is caught, but
gets to go back to an 'ordinary' life. The fast food version of social
criticism if you will.If the kind of movie I just described is familiar to you, then there is
nothing in 'War Dogs' that you will find unexpected. The acting is fair
but not memorable - and so is everything else about this movie. The
plot does not offer any real twists, down to the fact that (here slight
SPOILER) the 'catharsis' part is triggered when the guy who is
introduced in the first part of the movie as somebody who cheats people
does just that with our protagonist. I can't say that I hated 'War Dogs', but this is only because I did not
really care much about it.
