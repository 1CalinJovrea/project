Greatly exceeded my expectations

No Escape is a film that greatly exceeded my expectations. The trailer
a few months ago looked OK but I hadn't really heard anyone talking
about this film. Having now seen it, I strongly urge more people to
give it a chance as well. The storyline is excellent and we jump straight into the action. The
action is very fast paced with proper sound effects to keep you on the
edge of your seat. It's a very gripping film and I really connected
with the characters and hoped they got out of their brutal predicament.
I've seen similar actions films to this but the storyline really gave
it a unique feel (to me anyway). Lake Bell & Owen Wilson shared good chemistry and both of their on
screen daughters gave good believable performances. Overall a very
enjoyable disaster type film and similar to San Andreas earlier in the
year, I feel this one is underrated too. A fun watch which had me gripped from start to finish. Highly
entertaining. 8/10.
