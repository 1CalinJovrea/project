I wish the writer had finished the movie he started

Don't get me wrong; this movie is very well made. It was well acted,
shot and directed. I was never bored.But I started out watching a movie about a hit man who shoots mob
victims sent back in time from the future, and knows that his final
victim will be his older self. Interesting idea--even if it's not very
plausible. But okay, let's just run with it. That's the movie I saw in
the trailers, the one I expected to see.So, when his future self comes back, present-day self hesitates for a
moment and future self gets the drop on him and runs off. Now
present-day self must hunt down and kill future self. Also interesting.SPOILER FOLLOWSBut then, it's all about a telekinetic farm kid who will one day rule
the world with an iron fist. . . er, brain. . . if he isn't stopped.Huh. . . ? Where the hell did that come from? I know, I know, it's
foreshadowed by showing us that 10% of the population has trivial
telekinetic powers. They can make coins float above their hands.But to me, this film starts one story and then switches in mid-stream
to a story stemming from a second, unrelated science fiction premise.While it was refreshing that the movie didn't just turn into a series
of action sequences in which JGL tries to kill BW (which would have
been a pretty one-sided conflict, admittedly) I found this shift in
emphasis to be far more distracting than Joseph Gordon-Levitt's
prosthetic nose. Which I never had a problem with.Anyway, I appear to be the only one bothered by this so just go ahead
and enjoy the movie.
