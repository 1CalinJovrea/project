Knew IMDb would not like it... lighten up...

A dark comedy starring three women. That's all the basic information
you need to know this was not going to bide well with film snobs, much
less the misogynistic ones. Bachelorette is a very humorous and fun
movie that I had a great time with. I knew as soon as I got through
watching it to come rate it on IMDb though that people would be bashing
it, but I had no idea the backlash would be this harsh.The story is simple enough: Four high school friends all get together
to relive their glory days as one, the most unattractive (Rebel
Wilson), is about to get married. The bridesmaids consist of
high-strung Kirsten Dunst, burnout Lizzy Caplan, and dim-witted but
lovable Isla Fisher, which in my opinion Isla Fisher absolutely stole
the show. I loved it. It is very mean and in your face with it's
brutality. You almost wonder why these women are even friends to begin
with, but unlike everyone saying there is no reason, the film ties up
all it's loose ends and shows how all of the women have their own
battle scars and shining personalities in the end.Don't let the comments and rating shy you away from this one, there are
some gut-busting scenes. Like I said, Isla Fisher was magnificent. I
thoroughly enjoyed and believed in her character, not to say the other
stars didn't deliver, she just outshines them!
