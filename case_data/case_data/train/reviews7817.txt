Captivating and intense, but lacks some substance for those who can't "let it go and watch the movie"

This movie has everything you could ask for, in an action-packed
emotional thrill ride, provided that you are able to just let go, and
let yourself to be engrossed. For those who prefer films that may have
a little less predictability, or people that find themselves unable to
maintain the "suspension of disbelief", this movie would be
understandably less enjoyable.Right alongside moments that range from somewhat cringe-worthy, to
positively grisly, there are enough instances of justice, and pleasant
surprises to cause powerful feel-good moments just shortly after even
the darkest of situations. I personally felt a constant paralyzing
tension keeping me glued to my seat in the theater throughout the
entire movie, and couldn't bring myself to leave and go to the
bathroom.The cast and their acting is just about flawless, (though admittedly a
bit clich√© at times), and the sets and cinematography are superb. Sean
Penn is positively frightening, and shines in his role as the villain,
while Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling perfectly portray the face of their
vigilante-style band of misfits; The Gangster Squad.If you are familiar with the story that this movie is loosely based
from, you may be disappointed by the fact that it is QUITE loosely
based indeed. I feel that this makes is a likable, albeit somewhat
predictable movie, but others who expect it to stick with the "real
story" may not find it as enjoyable, despite the overall positive tone
that the new adaption allows.Though the reviews seem to be a horse-a-piece, I recommend seeing it
and judging for yourself, because it truly is an interesting thrill
ride that will have you rooting for the good guys, tearing up from time
to time, and cringing at the evil that Sean Penn is able to embody in
an absolutely brilliant and stylish movie about good guys doing wrong
to take down bad guys doing worse.
