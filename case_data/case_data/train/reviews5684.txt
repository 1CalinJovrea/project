The best Dreamworks film since the Shrek franchise, albeit its confusing title

When I first heard of this film, I got it confused with 'Legend of the
Guardians,' a live-action fantasy film about owls. Due to my passion
for animation, this appealed to me more when I saw this trailer, which
had the most impressive character designs since those from the 'Shrek'
franchise, particularly those of the guardians themselves.The animation quality is on par with that from the 'Shrek' franchise
with intricate character designs, pretty special effects and
atmospheric backgrounds if some were a little too dark. The musical
score is powerful, epic, poignant and magical while the closing credits
song is absolutely beautiful. As for the story and dialogue, they both
have a fine mix of excitement, sadness and humour while the story is
adventurous and uses representations of Jack Frost, Santa Claus, the
Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in an entirely new and unique way. The
funniest characters for me are the elves (they reminded me of the
minions in the 'Despicable Me' franchise if they were not quite as
humorous), the Easter Bunny and the furry creatures with moustaches.
With regard to the main characters, Jack Frost is ambitious, Tooth is
bubbly, Sandy is an effective communicator by expressing himself
through facial expressions, body language and various sand symbols
floating above his head and surprisingly comes back to life towards the
end of the film, North is supportive, the Easter Bunny (I love his
accent) is cynical yet comical and Pitch, while reminiscent of
Voldemort from the Harry Potter series and Maltazard from 'Arthur and
the Invisibles,' is threatening yet suave. The child characters are
sweet and full of fun, especially Jamie Bennett and his little sister
Sophie. Moving on to the voice acting, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin
(despite his Russian accent making his voice as unrecognisable as Steve
Carrel's voice for Gru in the 'Despicable Me' films), Isla Fisher and
Hugh Jackman all provided a brilliant variety of voices to their
characters while Jude Law provided Pitch with a chilling combination of
intimidation and menace.To conclude, 'Rise of the Guardians' is a stunning fantastical
adventure that is better than 'Shrek the Third' and 'Shrek Forever
After' and nearly as good as the first two 'Shrek' films. 9/10.
