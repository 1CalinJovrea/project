good movie overall

OK it's not the greatest thriller of all time but it still kept me on
edge from time to time. It's the story of a man out of jail who accepts
to be the driver in a bank robbery to pay back a part of what he owed
to a local gang. the robbery goes sideways and he is in a situation
where he doesn't know who to trust. That's the most i can tel you
without giving any spoilers. But you can imagine how this can lead to
several interesting situations. The only thing that bothered me is that
story doesn't go deep enough in the characters background and sometimes
you don't feel how dangerous a character can be to the Wheelman. So i'd
say that if you're looking for a good thriller to spend time without
having to blow your mind, this Netflix movie will do the trick.
