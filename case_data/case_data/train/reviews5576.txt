No Ash Leaves Ash In Your Mouth

SHAME RAIMI SHAME!! Sam, why would you risk your outstanding legacy by
attaching yourself (loosely), to this utter shemozzle?!? Clearly you
were offered a few bucks to help promote this film and give it some
credibility, but is money worth more than credibility? Reputation?
Respect?!?! I could say the same about Bruce Campbell, but he has never
been more than a B-actor, (though still totally awesome), and thus I
understand his desire to make a quick buck, but Sam....you have no
excuse.As for the film, well it is gory and boring. That pretty much sums it
up. Poor-quality gore by the truckload. No tension. No story worth
noting. No scares. No charm. No Ash.NO ASH!!!! Except for a tacked on cameo after the credits, the lack of
Ash makes this film even more execrable than it already is.Plot-holes galore. Contrived plot twists. Obvious ending. Terrible
acting. Woeful characters. Lack of depth.Just an awful film.Sam.............what have you done?
