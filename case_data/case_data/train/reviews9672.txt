Brilliance!

Now i'm going to begin with me telling you that this is my first review
on here which is mainly down to an annoyed state i was left in reading
what some of you have even thought up for this film.It was nothing but brilliant! Seriously, form start to finish the mix
of hilarity, dumbness and violence was done great. Bay has taken the
true events of the Sun Gym gang and made them into the black comedy
masterpiece this film is. The way he has had these actors play the
characters from the real story may not be the exact portray of them but
from what actually happened, he can't be far off! Everyone fits the part perfect. Wahlberg the more serious of the three
yet throws in the comedy perfectly as he always does. Johnson (The
Rock) as you should know him, funny, cocky, beefed up and packing
punches! I'll be honest, i didn't know who Anthony Mackie was until
today but again, the right choice to have and this made a trio of
criminals/idiots the funniest i've seen in a long while. It wasn't just
those three actors though, everyone was fitting to their role and if
you're like me, you know why these choices were funny to add into this
film.This obviously won't be everyones cup of tea but if you can see this
film for what it is really supposed to be, which is not by any way a
straight up comedy, then you won't be disappointed. Plus, The Rock on
cocaine for 40+ minutes is movie gold.
