Blonde, Atomic Blonde

Her name is Blonde, Atomic Blonde. We are presented with a movie that
reminds us of the spirit of the Bond movies. A spy movie set in the
late 80s, the end of the Cold War, or kind of with a woman in charge of
the story and the action, and boy there is plenty of action to enjoy
this movie made in the old spy style.We are presented with a typical situation during Cold War, having to
recover something that is on the other side while you need to
collaborate with someone. Nothing new here. What is kind of new is the
style. Above all the movie reminds us of the old spy movies and
specially the JAmes Bond ones. Where he, and in this case she (always
with style) does whatever it takes to get to their objective while
seducing someone on their way. And Charlize is brilliant in this role.
After watching her in Mad Max, all action movies suit here specially if
she plays a badass character like in this one. Simply fantastic.Besides how the movie is made and how good the actors are, there is
another main character that gains the audience attention: the music.
Pure 80s music that will take you to your childhood or to a previous
life, or if you weren't alive then, you wish you had been. You won't be
able to replay the songs one after another in your head or in your
Spotify list.A really enjoyable movie, that now is getting some copycats. A movie
that will let you forget about everything else and will make you want
to travel back in time into Cold War Berlin to have some adventures of
your own. Best of all, we can smell a sequel on its way, let's hope is
as good as the original one, which by the way, is based in a comic, so
there is a background for it.
