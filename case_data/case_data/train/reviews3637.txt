Bored in the Jungle

Really boring. The dialogue is horrible.It gets worse, the movie has progressive PC politics littered around in
the dialogue. It portrays Europeans as evil racist wasteful bigots, and
of coarse when talking with his wife all they ever do is talk about
feminism.And actually, after reading up on Fawcett, it is clear that he was
probably crazy. He claimed to have seen an Apazauca spider, and a
Double-nosed Andean Tiger Hound, two species which don't actually
exist. And he basically kicked the only real biologist (James Murray)
off the team.Basically, his tours to the Amazon were a scam. Maybe he was just going
there for the drugs and the native senoritas.Best part of the movie was when it was finally over.
