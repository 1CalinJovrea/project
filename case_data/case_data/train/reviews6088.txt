If you like the 80's big-hair era, ignore the negative reviews!

My wife and I were both in high school during the 1980's and we loved
this movie. So the story isn't Academy Award material, but it was the
most fun we have had at the movies in a while. The 80's music is not
the original work, but still performed well and placed great in the
movie. Tom Cruise is a hoot in his role (think Axl Rose) and the others
weren't bad either. Small cameos by some 80's rock stars. I have seem
some references to its similarity to Grease and its portrayal of the
1950's. I think that is a pretty good comparison. Again, if you are not
a fan of the 80's, you probably won't like this too much. But, if you
like the 80's and its music, you will probably enjoy this movie and
leave with a smile.
