Couldn't get much Louda.

On of the best Grand Prix movies ever made.RUSH is a testosterone race fest. Ron Howard deserves credit for taking
a redundant series of races and making them interesting and watchable. Good performances all around. The movie is elevated by an outstanding
Hans Zimmer score. Excellent cinematography and ear pounding sound of
engines put the viewer in the action.The hospital scenes are a bit tough for the faint of heart. The quiet
face to face scene at the end between the competitors takes the movie
to a higher level.This one should be seen and heard on a big screen.
