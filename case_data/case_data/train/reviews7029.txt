A Nutshell Review: Beautiful Creatures

The word on the street is that this is the expected successor after the
conclusion of the Twilight film franchise, having some parallels in its
tale that deals with the supernatural, and love between a being of
higher power and that of an ordinary human except for the reversal of
genders, and set in a schooling environment of an idyllic small town
where people know just about everyone else. It's also based on a
successful series of novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, so it's
everyone's bet just how this first installment would perform that would
determine its future as a potential film franchise, where many other
potentials have fallen after its initial start - The Dark is Rising,
The Golden Compass, and I am Number Four, to name but a few in this
genre.Beautiful Creatures starts off rather beautifully, with awesome visuals
that would set to engage and create that visual feast for the eyes,
crafting a mystery from the onset in the dreams of protagonist Ethan
Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), who see an ominous sequence of events, only to
not see who that raven haired female is due to a deliberate obscuring
by her long tresses. But soon enough the latest stranger in town
happens to be Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert), who brings forth with her
immense powers, conveniently unleashed against those who taunt her
because of their small town mentality, especially that of Ethan's ex
Emily (Zoey Deutch).But Lena has other problems to worry about, and that's due to an
internal family feud, with different camps set up who want her pledged
allegiance, being a caster and thought to be one of the most powerful
ones yet. On one hand there's Macon (Jeremy Irons) her uncle who serves
as adviser and father figure. But on the other, is mom Safarine (Emma
Thompson) and evil cousin Ridley (Emmy Rossum) who try to turn her, all
of whom come together for that merry celebration of computer generated
imagery that in all honesty, are gorgeously rendered, making Beautiful
Creatures live up to its namesake. It's almost like Star Wars with
Safarine dead set in getting Lena turn to the dark side when it's her
16th birthday, so that they can rule the universe and galaxy with their
powers, between mother and daughter. Lofty ambitions, but that's what
evil folks fantasize about.The romance is something you'd have to get used to though, since it
forms the bulk of the story here. If you're a fan of Twilight and its
treatment of first love between two unlikely beings separated by life,
then this would be something quite up the same alley, with inherent
powers that define the abilities of one side of the couple, which are
used for that effective courtship. There's plenty of cooing between the
love birds here as they spend time together like any teenager in love,
if not researching with Amma (Viola Davis), who is a seer of the town,
and an ally in Lena's identity crisis.If I had to give this film its due credit, it will be how it set up the
hook for that emotional resonance in the final scene. There has to be
some personal sacrifice in store for our protagonists in order to
cement their relationship, although the solution presented here was of
a taller order, that called for some twists during the big magical
battle set against the recreation of the Civil War's Battle of Honey
Hill. It was in fact, the final few minutes that became the movie's
saving grace, and lifted it from mediocrity, providing it that bit of a
heart beat and soul that primed itself for subsequent episodes in the
series.
