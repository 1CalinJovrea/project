you are about to enter the Animus..

Assassin's CreedNo man, no, come on Fassbender, not from you. I didn't see this coming
at all. And I am disappointed with Marion too. Why would she do such a
movie? Bad script with bad direction, i mean the audience is much
smarter than some silly fights or stunts and even the visual effects
weren't good too. There is not a single moment or a thread of the story
that you might wanna hold onto so, basically a four-year kid wrote the
script. A disaster, a nightmare, a tragedy; basically a glimpse of
2017.NO.
