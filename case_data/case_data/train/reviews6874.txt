While not great, This Is Where I Leave You was pretty entertaining

Just watched this with my mom on Netflix disc. She wasn't crazy about
the dysfunctional aspects of the film plus she thought it was too
raunchy. I liked both of those and mostly emphasized with the
characters. Tina Fey does a pretty good job with both the drama and
comedy as does Jason Bateman, both of whom are usually known for the
latter part. Jane Fonda looks and performs as fine as ever in her
advanced years as the matriarch who just lets things play out between
her now-grown children as they work out their issues in the wake of
their father's death. In summary, This Is Where I Leave You was pretty
touching and entertaining.
