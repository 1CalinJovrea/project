Blair Witch on Steroids!

Caught an early screening of this film today at a Scream Unseen event &
was surprised by how good it was. I had my doubts this would suck & it
didn't!The film is basically about 4 university friends who go trekking
through the forests of north Sweden but are stalked by a malign
presence that doesn't want them to leave.The first 30-40 mins of the film is of them getting lost, having
sinister visions & them b!tching/f-ing & blinding at one another. So I
was hoping it wouldn't be like that throughout, I mean, alright, the
visions were alright, but I wanted to see more. It does get going after
a short while, & the first part isn't all that bad. It will remind you
of the god awful Blair Witch film back in 1999. Only this film is way
way better!The effects were pretty good! The blood & gore were decent enough,
though could've been better. But the creature, took the cake with this
one! It was great to actually see the creature unlike the BWP which
just held back everything & well was boring as!This film has a satisfying climax, a bit sad but satisfying! The end
was pretty good & kind of how I wanted it to end! I won't spoil it for
you but it was pretty satisfying for a film of it's type!Overall I give this one a solid 8/10.
