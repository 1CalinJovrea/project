Joyous fun

In my life as a parent of a 10 and 12 year old, I have been to see a
lot of animated kids movies, some of them quite painful to sit through.
This one ranks at the top. The action, the humor, the characters, the
plot, all rolled up in to a big ball of fun. I was belly laughing with
my kids the whole way through it. And the message is lovely to boot.
Excellent casting...the chemistry between the characters stood out in a
way I never thought a cartoon could, no doubt due to the talent of the
actors and standout animation (not something that I'm usually all that
dazzled by.) It was the interaction, along with thoughtful humor of
what is important in life, that really put this over the top for me.
The complete implausibility of the plot didn't even mildly annoy me,
the way stories of this genre sometimes do. I could actually stand to watch this a second time. Well done
Hollywood, please put this level of thought in to more children's
movies.
