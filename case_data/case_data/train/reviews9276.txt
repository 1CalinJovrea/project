A Standalone In Horror!

This film may not seem like much from the trailer, but it delivers. The
actors all perform admirably, especially given their recent arrival to
the big screen. Moreover, the cinematography is done very cleverly to
capture suspenseful images and vantage points. There is hardly any
redundancy, which makes the plot progression unpredictable, keeping you
on the edge as you anticipate what's to come next. Overall, due to the
seamless meshing of sheer performance into a horrific cyberspace
environment while at the minimal expense of realism, Unfriended is an
unmistakable standalone in its genre that does not fail to captivate
and shock even the most seasoned audience!
