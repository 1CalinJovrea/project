This is not a comedy.

Don't get sucked in by the ads that claim this movie is a comedy. There
may be an intentional funny moment but this dysfunctional family is in
the vain of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf", but not that good.Meryl Streep gives her usual great performance. Julia Roberts smiles.
The supporting cast is excellent.The movie based on a play is dialogue driven. Little or nothing is done
to open the play up. Sisters quibble at the dinner table. They talk in
most rooms of the house. Occasionally they talk outside the house in an
enclosed patio.If you enjoy two hours of bickering sisters this is for you. If you are
looking for a good movie or a good time at the movies pass on this one.
Other then the cast, there is no reason to see this one. If you are
inclined to see it, wait for it to come to a non theatrical platform in
your home.
