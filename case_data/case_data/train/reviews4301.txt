Original film with a lesson

The critics were way too hard with this movie. Yeah, there were a few
sequences that looked dumb and somewhat false, but let's be honest
guys, what horror movie doesn't include a sequence like that? And I'm
including the horror cult classics too.But anyway, Mr. Leonetti brought us something similar but still
different to his latest horror film 'Annabelle'. 'Wish Upon' is indeed
a horror/fantasy movie that is completely worth mentioning between the
most original and interesting films of the genre in recent years.First of all, I was completely impressed by the performance of Joey
King. It was completely convincing and I hope her future jobs were as
good as this one, or even better.The story, although some may find it as a clich√©, it is very well
managed and eventually you will forget that there were other films that
had a similar story-line before. The script is well done and
entertaining.And now, about what I'm putting as the title for this review, the movie
isn't necessarily a horror movie with jump-scares and gore throughout;
it is a film that leaves you an important lesson: If you find an
strange object on a strange and unusual place, would be better if you
don't touch it...Thank you for reading!
