Thrilling Sci-Fi Survival Adaptation

In an era where science-fiction survival tales are becoming a popular
occurrence - with 'Interstellar' last year, and 'Gravity' the year
before - writer Andy Weir and sci-fi connoisseur Ridley Scott team up
to craft a complex tale that is carried by a single character, that
character being Mark Watney, played fantastically by Matt Damon
(Hollywood's biggest calamity, who requires being rescued... again).As the film tees off, we are instantly given a first-person view of the
dangers of Mars and the fight for survival each astronaut is living out
each day on the planet's surface, that is until their emergency
evacuation - but nope, even Damon couldn't do that right. Abandoned
upon the desolate surface of Mars after being presumed dead by his
crew, Damon must do all he can to endure the martian environment. One
huge thing I admire about this film's plot, is that it doesn't care
about the intellectual level of its audience, as the quote above states
so well: it'll science the s**t out of them. It's such a complex and
well-executed premise that on paper seems nothing more than a
impossible feat to pull off.Technically this film is stunning, the cinematography, the CGI, the
production design, all utterly gorgeous, and according to the Golden
Globes, it's one of the best comedies of recent years too... yeah,
sure. Admittedly the tongue-in-cheek humour does add a more fresh
appeal to the film, making it a little more unique than previous sci-fi
adventures, it piles on layers of thrills, emotional value and complex
character development to create one of the finest science fiction films
of recent years.
