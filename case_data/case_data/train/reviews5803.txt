Stunning! One the most original films I have ever seen. Every frame was beautiful

It is a perfectly paced surreal piece of cinema. its like nothing I
have seen before. Stills from movie will shown in galleries for years
to come.The film is not for everyone I must admit. But don't be discouraged by
dim witted reviews. The plot is not explained by the characters at
every free moment and requires you think and use your imagination to
fill in the blanks, which I found so refreshing. I urge you go check this film out first chance you. It's great to
original film and original film makers like Glazer pushing the
boundaries of film in ways other vfx. The only way people like Glazer
will get to carry on making films if everyone gets out and supports
these kinds of films. Or we just end up transformers 4 ,5 and 6.
