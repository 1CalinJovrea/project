De Niro and Hathaway's chemistry is a sheer delight, but Nancy Meyers' distracted screenplay in the second hour undercuts an otherwise genuinely entertaining start

As far as on screen pairings go, 'The Intern' boasts probably one of
the most interesting ones in recent memory. On one hand is Robert De
Niro's 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, presently struggling to deal with the
concept of retirement; on the other is Anne Hathaway's 32-year-old
Jules Ostin, the founder and CEO of a tremendously successful
fashion-based e-commerce company called 'About the Fit' or 'ATF' for
short' who is presently struggling to deal with the demands of her
investors while not neglecting her six-year-old daughter and stay- home
husband. Diametrically opposite as they may be, writer/ director Nancy
Meyers wants to prove that these two individuals can have much more to
learn from each other than you and I can imagine.So through a community outreach programme which one of her company's
executives hatched, Ben finds his away into ATF as a senior intern
after impressing some of the much younger employees with his warm sense
of humour, his cheery can-do demeanour and proving least likely among
his competition to drop dead while on the job (yes, we mean this
literally). Despite Jules' initial chagrin, that same executive assigns
Ben directly to Jules in order to set an example for the rest of the
employees in the company. And as the trailers would have you know, Ben
will slowly but surely overcome her reservations with a keen sensitive
eye and an unerring professionalism, eventually becoming not just a
calming ear amidst the day to day chaos at the workplace but also an
invaluable source of advice for her professional and personal woes.Just so you know, De Niro and Hathaway do not eventually fall in love
with each other, so you can rest easy if you're wondering or worried if
things would eventually get weird or awkward between them; and to put
that at rest, Meyers finds De Niro a romantic interest in Rene Russo's
in-house massage therapist Fiona and occupies Hathaway with the
discovery that her husband (Anders Holm) has been cheating on her with
the stay-home mother of her daughter's schoolmate. It is also in the
latter where De Niro will come most prominently to play counsellor and
confidante, nudging her not to blame her workaholic tendencies for her
husband's infidelity. Oh yes, there is a message of empowerment and
encouragement for all career mothers within  and a slap on the face if
you will have it for their other halves who use that as an excuse to
commit adultery.In keeping with her recent movies, Meyers has eschewed male- dominated
Hollywood stereotype by fashioning Jules as a strong, opinionated and
successful female individual who can be a hands-on CEO to over 220
employees at her company while being a dedicated mother and loving
wife. Her response to her husband's infidelity isn't to fall in love
with a fellow co-worker or to divorce him immediately; rather, she
wants to give him a second chance, believing that a re-affirmation of
their mutual love for each other will convince him to end his affair
once and for all. You may disagree  as Ben does  with whether she is
being naïve, but hey it's undeniably still a strong gutsy move for a
woman to put aside her pride and her hurt to offer forgiveness and to
choose to stay together.Meyers also has yet another intention here, and that is to quash ageism
at the workplace. It isn't just coincidence that the company Ben joins
is in the Internet business; as incongruous as his presence may be in
an industry that arguably does not appeal to his age demographic,
Meyers wants to let the young upstart CEOs of today's tech companies
know that  as the tagline goes  experience never gets old and that
there is something that the Gen-Y leaders can learn from their Gen-X
counterparts. You can almost hear Meyers' own lament through Jules that
the men of today are a far cry from the likes of Jack Nicholson and
Harrison Ford, and that just as Jules does, we will find something to
learn from the silver-haired members of our workforce.Both are equally poignant lessons, but perhaps not so wieldy in the
same movie. Meyers tries to convey the latter first, and does so quite
persuasively through a mixture of situational comedy and punchlines
that are gently amusing but never by way of caricature  indeed, the
closest she comes to farce is an 'Oceans' Eleven' like 'heist' led by
Ben to break into Jules' mother's house and delete an email that Jules
had accidentally sent to her mother. The first hour of the movie
cruises by like a breeze, in large part as well thanks to De Niro's
spot-on comic timing that he hasn't lost since the last sequel of 'Meet
the Parents'. There is also much delight to be had watching De Niro and
Hathaway break the ice between their respective characters, their
dynamic sincere, heartfelt and genuinely affable.Unfortunately, Meyers doesn't quite do the former as well, and the
latter half of the movie sags as a result of a more melodramatic change
in tone and pace. Not to trivialise women in similar predicaments, but
it isn't quite so convincing just why Jules' husband would cheat on her
in the first place and a tad too convenient how Ben comes to chance
upon the fact which ends up putting him in a moral quandary. And though Meyers' screenplay could do with some work, it is the sheer
effervescent chemistry between De Niro and Hathaway that keeps the
movie afloat. Both are equally lovely in their respective roles, and
the strength of their performances is enough to make you forgive the
fact that their characters are probably too good-natured to be true.
Yes, 'The Intern' works best when it is a two-hander between its
unlikely on screen pairing, and fizzles out especially in the last
third once it decides to make three a crowd.
