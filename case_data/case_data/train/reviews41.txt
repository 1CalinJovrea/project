Walk when Ben does!

Stick around for the first few minutes to watch a master class in
acting from Ben Kingsley... When he leaves so should you.What could have been a brilliant 'Total Recall' type thriller is just
another soap opera with blubbering women, needy kids and ridiculous car
chases. It's horrible to watch.But the single biggest gaff in this celluloid effluence is the fact
that the ruthless businessman (Kingsley) suffers a massive personality
transplant after his 'shedding' and turns into a touchy-feely pansy.The second biggest (and even more painful to watch) gaff is hiring a
child who can't act. Yeah, sorry kid... you ain't gonna make it in the
talkies. But the best line in the movie happens about eight minutes in when the
old dying Kingsley is trying to make a connection with his daughter who
runs some kind of NGO in the city."This isn't work. It's a bunch of children throwing a tantrum!"Just brilliant... and so true!Three stars out of ten... all three for Ben Kingsley.
