Boring and Humorless

I watched this movie based purely on the high ratings and favorable
reviews on IMDb... wish I hadn't bothered. Movies are subjective,
that's for sure... one man's meat is another man's poison. Not sure why
my opinion of this movie is so contrary to the majority. Maybe the
generational gap... I am an oldie. Or maybe because there have been so
many really crap movies released recently that, comparatively, this one
fares reasonably well.About 30 minutes into the movie I turned to my wife and said, "this is
a load of rubbish". She nodded her head violently in agreement. There
are a few good performances from established actors in the cast but, in
the main, this movie is boring and humorless. The main actor is
apparently a stand-up comedian, I reckon he should probably stick with
that. His performance is flat and wooden, very amateurish. The Big Sick
is maybe something the under 30s might enjoy but, as an oldie, I
thought it was far worse than ordinary.
