Better Than Average Horror

Back in 2009, director Sean Byrne brought The Lovely Ones to the
Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The film won the Midnight
Madness People's Choice Award, but it somehow never really caught on
amongst horror film enthusiasts. I myself must admit that I missed it.
I missed screening it at the 2009 Festival and I made the mistake of
overlooking the feature for a few more years. When I eventually did
screen the film in 2011 I was shocked at how such a fun, violent and
well shot horror film escaped my screen habits. I began to champion the
film amongst my tiny circle of friends and even though the film has a
release date in 2009, I listed The Lovely Ones as the best horror film
of 2011. So it is with incredible anticipation that I screen The
Devil's Candy, Byrne's latest film which will again compete for the
People's Choice Award at this year's Midnight Madness.Unrecognizable Ethan Embry plays Jesse Â– husband of Astrid (Shiri
Appleby) and father to teenage Zooey (Kiara Glasco). Jesse is an artist
without a muse who uses heavy metal music to both propel his adrenaline
and inspire his paintings. Looking for a change, Jessie and Astrid put
a bid on a remote Texas home. The house is ample for the family of
three but the real selling point is the large barn on the property that
Jesse foresees as his art studio. The home has a selling price that is
ridiculous for the market. But there is a catch. The realtor is
obligated to reveal the history of the home. And the history is death.
Jesse and Astrid seem unfazed when they learn that a mother fell down
the stairs and the husband killed himself in his grief of the loss. But
an early scene shows us a different story. One of murder and maniacal
behavior. The house may be haunted with supernatural forces tormenting
its residents to freakish behavior. And Jesse and his family might just
be in situational danger that could cost them their lives.It doesn't take long for the things to start going awry when the family
moves into their new home. Jesse is particularly affected and he begins
to paint on canvas pictures that represent the dark and the macabre.
His involvement with his work draws a rift between him and his
daughter. But these fractured feelings are put aside when Ray (Pruitt
Taylor Vince), the large homicidal son of the former owners of the home
begins to lurk around Jesse's family.Ray is unstable. He hears voices in his head that can only be muted by
the loud obstruction of noise generated from his electrical guitar and
amp. He rocks and rolls with intensity while further slipping from
sanity. Ray is a killer. The worst kind of killer. A killer of
children. His weapon is his massive frame (well, that and any large
rock he can get his giants palms around). Ray's rampage is exhibited in
a shallow grave not too far from his childhood home. It's here luggage
containing the remains of children he has killed and cut up are buried.
Ray's next target is Zooey but the young lass will not go quietly or
without a fight. Fueled by satanic forces, Ray is persistent in his
pursuit of Zooey. And his objective will leave a trail of bodies in his
wake.The Devil's Candy is the brainchild of Sean Byrne who catapulted
himself onto the horror scene with 2009's The Loved Ones. Byrne both
wrote and directed The Devil's Candy and although it is not as
refreshing as The Loved Ones, it is a competent and crowd pleasing
horror film that has the look and feel of a Rob Zombie film but with
much better results. Pruitt Taylor Vince is perfectly cast as the
tormented Ray and Byrne keeps the film simple with a trickled down call
sheet and a story that never fails to move forward.Although The Devil's Candy may be considered horror, it is more
psychological thriller. There are some elements of gore but the crux of
the film is on the individual characters all of which are interesting
and authentic. With a heavy helping of heavy guitar riffs, The Devil's
Candy is a surprising hard rock pleaser filled with atmosphere and
sweat. It was given a world premiere as part of the Midnight Madness
series at this year's Toronto International Film Festival and it will
surely find an audience upon release.http://theintestinalfortitude.com/
