awful not for the purist

was one of the movies i was looking forward too, enjoyed the likes of
helicopter spies etc. Started to watch, what hit me was how poor the
acting was - so wooden. the storyline was terrible, one not to watch
again.The film was long and drawn out or lets say it felt like it and really
wanted it to end as soon as possible.The was a distinct lack of action don't really know what the film was
trying to achieve, what ever it was trying it failed.This movie is destined for the DVD bargain bin along with schlotty the
psychedelic donkey 3
