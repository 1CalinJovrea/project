Ruined the legacy of the Disney Classic

This movie is a complete joke, the only thing going for it is the
visual effects, In the 1959 Disney classic Maleficent is the mistress
of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she
is a good person? her name does not seem good at all!Also I want to write in some details why I did not like this movie and
why the story was very weak in my opinion. First why is King Stefan
evil? why did he send Aurora to live with the three fairies until she
is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like
death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all
those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with
them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the
fairies to come and protect her on that day.and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots! the good fairies
are idiots? and Prince Philip is not the true love of Aurora? what
nonsense! finally the motherly kiss of Maleficent lifts the curse? she
put it on in the first place!and finally Maleficent kills Stefan (Aurora's father) and Aurora is
happy about that? what the hell?Really a silly movie, I gave it 2/10 just because of the CGI which
Hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing
and casting!
