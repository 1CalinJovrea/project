Sucks.

I have never written a review before, but I feel that writing one is
the best way to clean my mind of the crappy film I have witnessed. This
movie was extremely awful. The humor attempts to be "offending", but it
instead sounds like something an 8th grader finds humorous. In fact,
even an 8th grader would tire of the pathetic nonsense that is Movie
43.The plot centers around two teenagers that make up an outrageous
picture. However, I've heard it's different for other parts of the
world. I'm currently in the UK, so the kids wraparound is what I saw.
Their little brother looks for it on the world wide web and ends up
finding lots of clips that we get the displeasure of seeing. There's
one called "The Catch" where Kate Winslet goes on a blind date with
Hugh Jackman. However, get this: Hugh Jackman has penises where penises
aren't supposed to be! Just hear the crickets sing. I can hear the
screenwriter just laughing and laughing as he adds more unfunny jokes
about poop and semen.Also, the hilarious basketball sketch where they comment on the fact
that basketball players are mostly black! Wow! It's so funny! Naked
women and iPads! It's funny too!In short, Movie 43 is a disjointed mess, full of lousy jokes, terrible
writing, and actors that no doubt deserve to be in something else. Now,
I'm going to rally up Best Actor/Actresses winners to be in my new
screenplay, "Boners of Fire". Just kidding, of course. I'm not THAT
evil.
