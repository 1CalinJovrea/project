Fun Movie

'What if' is about Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe), a heart broken medical
school dropout who meets Chantry (Zoe Kazan), an animator and Wallace's
love interest. The moment they meet, Wallace is in love. Unfortunately
for him, Chantry is already in a serious relationship and just wants to
be friends.Like most movies of this genre, you can for the most part guess how
this movie progresses. However, that didn't really matter as the movie
was fun and quite enjoyable. Most of the jokes were witty and didn't
feel forced. All the relationships in the movie were enjoyable to watch
as well. All the actors did a great job as well. At the end, I had a good time watching this movie. It was a good fun
movie.
