Beautifully filmed Coming-of-Age tale on the Mississippi River

Mud was very well-received by a packed house at the Paramount Theatre
for its Regional Premiere at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The crowd
particularly loved local favorites director Jeff Nichols and the always
shape-shifting Matthew McConaughey. (How is it possible that
McConaughey hasn't even been nominated for an Oscar yet?) Mud is a
charming, entrancing film that has almost lyrical quality as it unfolds
along the rural backwoods of Arkansas's Mississippi River. The story
revolves around the adventures of two young teenage boys who meet a
mysterious drifter appropriately named Mud. Mud is hiding out an island
in the Mississippi River awaiting the arrival of his beloved Juniper.
The story has elements of drama, thriller, and romance. While the film
is slightly too long and the story has a few unnecessary and
distracting subplots, its overall eloquence and is absorbing. So like
the Mississippi, the story meanders a little too much. The River
setting becomes a character in the film that shapes the drama playing
out along it. The two teenage actors are excellent, but the film is
tour-de-force for McConaughey who is its heart and soul. Highly
recommended for those who like serious drama and appreciate natural
beauty.
