Calvin creates a real girl out of his writing

It is an honest movie. In the beginning it is cute and funny, but then
it quickly turns very serious and a little bit dark. Calvin creates a
very similar relationship, to his last, with a woman who appears after
he writes about her. It is a movie about their struggles as he attempts
to create his perfect relationship by changing it on paper. It is a
beautifully written story. Most movies today are about the special
effects and don't have enough of the story. This movie is full of story
and a great one. You will leave the movie theater feeling like you just
watched a really great movie! Must see! This is what movie making
should be about.
