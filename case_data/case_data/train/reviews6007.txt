The overall rating is false: it's being down-voted by genocide denialists.

Well, screw those who would destroy History because truth hurts their
feelings. The Armenian genocide happened, and whoever tries to censor
this film will do so in vain, or so I hope.The movie is good, in general Oscar Isaac doesn't disappoint, and Le
Bon adorably shines. That said, the crude, sad part is hard enough to
watch, especially when you consider what's been shown is a mild version
of what happened.It's a good movie, even though a ten is too much, I have to over-vote
it to compensate for those who willingly down-vote in order to bury the
truth in the sand. Worth to get to know what happened, if only because
many wouldn't want you to.
