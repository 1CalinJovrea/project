Outstanding mix of Genres, Revolutionary, Original

The movie had the right mixture of emotion and with its signature style
of having a sad music on its supposed to be energetic climax created an
outstanding effect. It also promotes viewers of realizing and
acceptance in their Identities just like the "This is the end" movie
with the same directors. For me it can revolutionize the film industry
especially to the films under comedic genres. It has the usual comedic
twists an plots. The usual comedic over-reaction is in perfect timing.
The difference of this movie to other comedy movies is the "lows" of
the movie that gives emphasis on its "highs". It is cute. The movie
inspires me somehow. Good original style. Excellent actors. Excellent
storyline. The movie makes perfect sense to me.
