Nicely acted below par written story

I don't agree with a lot of IMDb user reviews, however many have this
spot on - it's a very well acted, but ultimately badly written movie.Christian Bale plays Russell who along with his younger brother live in
an economically- depressed small town, USA. Struggling to copy with
there own inner demons, the movie shows how the brothers lives
intertwine and ultimately come apart when they come into contact with
local thug Harlon DeGroat - excellently played by Woody Harrelson.
There are a subplots involving Russell's girlfriend and the local
sheriff, but they aren't ever brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The character arcs just aren't well defined, and it's hard to care one
way or another for the final outcome. Many characters seem superficial
to the plot, including Forrest Whittaker, a fantastic actor who just
seems wasted in his role as the sheriff. It's a shame as technically
the movie looks great, the opening soundtrack by Pearl Jam seems
perfectly fitting with the movies backdrop of blue collar middle
America.It's just a shame that the great cast, visual quality and sound aren't
complimented by a great storyline.
