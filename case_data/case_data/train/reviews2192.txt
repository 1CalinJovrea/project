Dear oh dear where do I start.

Pros: I stopped watching after 20 minutes so I didn't waste too much of
my life.Cons: 47 not bald Absolutely no silence whatsoever. Explosions,
explosions everywhere. Stupidly boring acting from whoever is playing
47.And the main thing that really bugged me from minute one of that awful
monologue, they didn't even get the name of the cloning scientist
right. It was Dr Ort-Meyer. Not whoever in the blue hell this
"Litvinenko" chap is.Honestly I would have settled for them using ANY of the Five Fathers to
be the "creator" or "monetary backer" for the cloning program, but no,
instead they made it up.
