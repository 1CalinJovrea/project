Absolutely fantastic 10/10

This film has great animation and a great story, it has an all star
voice cast example Morgan freeman and will Ferrell. This film will be
up on the shelve as one of the greatest films ever animated, ever
thought about and ever written. When I was a kid playing with Lego I
never thought to my self that they will make a film on it now that they
have all my Christmases have come at once. Cant wait for the special
features on blue ray. This movie will be up there with toy story 1 2
and 3 , the lion king , frozen and wreck it Ralph. The power of good
films are in Lego hands people are genius congrats to all the Oscars
for the road ahead
