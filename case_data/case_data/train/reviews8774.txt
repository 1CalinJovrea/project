Extrimly fu**ing awesome

Why you should definitely go to Hardcore Henry: 1. This is the best
action movie of the year, and probably in general. Remember the
wonderful impressions of the scene in the church in the movie
"Kingsmen"? So here are the impressions almost the entire movie. 2. The
director obviously loves Tarantino, fine jokes, blood abundance and
diversity of murder. sometimes people in the cinema was just
hysterical. 3. Great soundtrack, which brought even a song by Queen. 4.
The plot, though not perfect, but it was much better than expected. 5.
Sharlto Copley rocks. 6. Lots of interesting cameo, even Tim Roth. 7.
The film was made for just $ 2 000 000, and it Exceeds "Adrenaline" and
"Raid". 8. The film was shot in Moscow. Very cool to watch the action
taking place. 9. The film contains a lot of dirty jokes, plenty of
jokes is based on the obscene vocabulary. 10. A number of references to
(and not only) the gaming industry.
