Pathetic drivel

So the guy falls in love with a piece of software. This loser wanders
around aimlessly, unable to have a meaningful relationship with a
living person. His character is so boring, so lifeless, so inane you
just want to scream at the screen. I actually did. Several times.
Meanwhile, his OS is being unfaithful. When he finally figures it out,
he is so weak that he can't bring himself to call up Microsoft or Apple
and get another operating system. One that is actually useful. Heck,
even Linux would be an improvement at this point. At the end I was
hoping that he would hurl himself off the top of the building, taking
his pathetic neighbor with him. Curses - foiled again. This, too shall
not come to pass.Camera work - nice shots of anonymous impersonal cityscapes, all filled
with folks endlessly blathering onto their cell phones/computers,
oblivious to the world around them.Acting - uninspired.Script - boring. I once thought Phoenix had potential. I can't believe
he actually participated in this tripe.My wife and I both give this twaddle two thumbs down!
