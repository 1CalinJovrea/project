Give it a try, it may surprise you!

This movie was great! I brought my friends and they thought it was
going to be lame but they ended up loving it just as much as I did! Go
see this movie, its adorable! I loved how its dark and gory in a cute
way. This movie is funny, suspenseful, a little bit of a horror and
romantic; its the perfect date movie! I don't get scared easily but
this movie made me jump a few times... The whole movie i was
entertained! I was very impressed with the way the make-up and hair
team were able to make the zombies so realistic! R was very easy to
relate with and this movie has a little bit of everything for everyone.
I suggest going even if your a bit skeptic about it. Go out and see
this movie!
