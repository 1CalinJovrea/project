A steaming pile of disgustingly potent f*cking garbage.

Transformers: The Last Knight may just be the worst movie I've seen in
the last few years. While it may not objectively be a 1/10, my utter
lack of enjoyment and the pain endured during the movie warrants the
lowest of the low. It's been a month or so since I've seen it, and while I don't remember
everything from it, there is one thing that I cannot ever forget that
highlights its incompetence. Most movies have a particular aspect
ratio, and if it changes, it is usually gradual, scene to scene. The
Last Knight, however, cannot even keep its aspect ratio same in the
same scene. Did they use different cameras for the same scene? Clearly,
no even gave enough of a sh*t to fix it in post. It's disorientating, a
lot like the movie's plot, dialogue and general terribleness. Maybe the
different ratios are a metaphor.
