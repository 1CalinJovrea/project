Something's went wrong

'Lawless' is definitely a great film but there's something missing. The acting is really strong; Tom Hardy's performance is probably his
best so far. His voice is so different to his normal voice which really
highlights how he has worked hard on his performance. I was really
surprised by Shia LaBeouf's performance, he's never really impressed me
but he gave a great performance here. He really proved that he could do
some proper acting in the future and hopefully move away from the
'Transformers' series. Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain both perform
well but their roles are wasted here. They have no real purpose in the
film and are merely there as love interests. It wouldn't have been such
an issue if they had gotten any actress for these roles but they
instead chose two of the best rising stars with huge amounts of talent.
Guy Pierce is outstanding here but his role becomes almost comical
towards the end. He gives a great performance though and is quite
disturbing. Gary Oldman gives a really good performance but has only 5
minutes screen time! It seems like such a waste, it would have been
interesting to see his character included in the plot a lot more.Overall this film was fantastic but there was a few things that
director John Hillcoat could have improved that would have made this
film truly brilliant, such as giving more characters some crucial
screen time. The violence was not really an issue; I don't think it
diverted the film away from anything which is good. It contained the
right amount of violence for the film and shouldn't put anyone off from
watching this.
