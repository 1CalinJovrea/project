Too loosely 'Inspired'

Pretty much nothing in this film actually happened(time-wise, people-
wise, story-wise), so what's left is just the movie at itself. Where
Ben Affleck portrays a man with clearly no emotions, the group of six
'escapees' clearly experienced difficulties portraying fear. Add up the
classic 'America is the smartest country in the world, and the bad guys
have the intelligence no bigger than a pile of (you know what)' and
you'll find this movie pretty annoying (like I did). I could, would and should go on about why this movie fails (like pretty
much every Hollywood movie) to actually capture a foreign country the
way it REALLY is, instead of the way we (apparently) think it is (Iran
is a country with a lot of bearded people who are all angry and hate
Americans), but it's pretty useless to do so. John Goodman and Bryan Cranston were fun to watch and some parts of the
movie were entertaining, but overall I wouldn't recommend this to
anyone.4 out of 10
