A film who's creator knows no bounds of imagination

David Bowie introduces the first five minutes of Valerian, and perhaps
its fitting we should have the Starman himself lead us into a glimpse
of what the future could hold for humans and all interstellar life.By
the time Mr. Bowie completes his Space Oddity, we've learned that the
titular City of a Thousand Planets is the international space station
hundreds of years in the future.suddenly, a peaceful seashell world is
decimated without explanation.from there, Valerian and Laureline take
over the action as two agents in pursuit of their stolen commander, and
everything gets weird from there. Director Luc Besson is his own
starman here, and he commands the world of Valerian with pizazz and
passion. Not everything works, as our space agents wrestle dialogue
that falls pancake flat; but the actors play well off each other and
comedic moments succeed more than fail. The ending half of the film
loses steam,except for Rihanna's literally acrobatic performance,but
Valerian is a bonkers crazy, geeky, and likable space opera that can
only come from someone who's imagination is truly free.
