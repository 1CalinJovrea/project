A beautiful film about a terrible incident!

Stronger is about Jeff Baumann who was at the 2013 Boston marathon
bombing. He was there to cheer on Erin Hurley but when the bomb came he
lost both his legs. Jeff is in the hospital for a while trying to heal
from the terrible incident. Jeff and Erin actually were with each other
and then broke up, but they are getting back together when the incident
happened. Everybody sees Jeff as a hero and he feels really awkward
about that.Jeff is played by one of my favorite actors Jake Gyllenhaal and he is
excellent in the movie. Everybody gives an excellent performance in
here. And the relationship of Jeff and Erin is very interesting. The
problem I have with this movie is that sometimes the story can feel a
little messy and I had absolutely no interest in Jeff's mom who is a
lot in this movie.This a a gut wrenching movie with great performances and a good story.
The directing of David Gordon Green is also very good, because you feel
like you're not watching a movie, it feels like you are watching events
happen in front of your eyes. A very touching film and definitely worth
a watch.
