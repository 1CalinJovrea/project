On April 15, 2013 Boston, Massachusetts, Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders is
pulling security duty on the annual Boston Marathon when the Tsarnaev
brothers strike with their homemade bombs in an act of terrorism. In
the resulting chaos as the wounded are cared for, Saunders and his
comrades join forces with the FBI to get to the bottom of this attack.
As the investigation continues, the Tsarnaev brothers realize that the
authorities are close to identifying them and attempt to flee the city
to continue their fanatical mayhem. To stop them, a police manhunt is
performed that would have bloody confrontations and a massive dragnet
shutting down the City of Boston to make sure there is no escape from
the law.
