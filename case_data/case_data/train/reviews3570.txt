Cut your losses

Beth Raymer (Rebecca Hall) leaves her exotic dancing job at a Florida
strip club to become a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas. Her ditzy
personality looks like its not going to giver her too many breaks until
she meets Dink (Bruce Willis) an underground sports bookie.He sees through her bubbly exterior and discovers that she has a good
mind for numbers and she places illegal bets all over the town. Dink
regards her as a good luck charm but his wife (Catherine Zeta Jones)
becomes jealous. Dink fires her and she goes to New York to work for a
rival underground bookie who is being hunted down by the law.The film is based on a true story but its poorly told. It spirals
downwards as you increasingly lose interest in a largely predictable
plot. Rebecca Hall looks rather old to be playing the lead and although
she is energetic her quirks tend to be off putting. Willis and Zeta
Jones do not fare any better. Vince Vaughn has a small and thankless
role and only Joshua Jackson comes off best.Its a light tale that is neither funny, satirical or even show the
thrill of sports book gambling. It does not amount to much despite the
star wattage and a usually reliable director.
