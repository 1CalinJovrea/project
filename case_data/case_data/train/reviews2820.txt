A Powerful film depicting true events, an embarrassment and tragedy which could have been avoided.

Michael Bay did a masterful job of capturing the attacks on the U.S.
compounds and the gallant efforts to save the ambassador and the other
U.S. staff. He did an equally great job of showing career bureaucrats
at work.It's too bad the film didn't include scenes showing the president being
briefed on the attack and then going to bed in order to get some rest
before his fund-raiser in Las Vegas. It would have been powerful to
contrast what was happening in Benghazi and the presidents actions
while the attack was still taking place. What's truly sad is how these people were abandoned by the politicians.
It's also sad to think the late Ambassador Stevens had made 600 plus
requests to Hillary Clinton for additional security, all ignored.
