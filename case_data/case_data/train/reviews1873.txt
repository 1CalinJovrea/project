Long and Rambling

When Lars von Trier finished his rambling speech at the Cannes Film
Festival in 2011 (in which he claimed to be a Nazi) I recall feeling
bewildered and disgusted. Likewise with his two "Nymphomaniac" movies,
I am left with the same feelings.This review covers both movies: We are introduced to a self-proclaimed
nymphomaniac named Joe (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg), who, based on
her condition makes choices in her life and causes drama to follow.
Everything is related in chronological chapters. She reveals all of
this to a man named Seligman (played by Stellan Skarsg√•rd).The sexual scenes are not erotic at all. This must be intentional?
Whether intended or not, some scenes just drag on for too long. There
are number theory references, literary references, and a little Mozart
and Franck thrown in as well. Talk about pretentious! The viewers are
supposed to believe that they are watching something arty and
intelligent, and thus might feel less turned off...Lars von Trier could have made the same story but used a different
medical condition. Why not have a person who suffers from Irritable
Bowel Syndrome? Said person could then relate their life story around
all the times that they suddenly needed to use a toilet and couldn't
find one! I am sure there would be lots of drama there too; and it
would be about as interesting to watch.I am giving this movie a "2" since I liked looking at the trees. There
were many shots of them throughout the movie, and they were nice to
look at.
