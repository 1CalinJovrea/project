This Review is going to be Short and Sweet

Don't let ANYONE spoil you ANYTHING about the film.Don't see the trailer when it comes out.Avoid clips and any promo materials they may release in the future.Go in knowing as little as possible.Just know that watching Green Room is like getting a shot of adrenaline
that doesn't let up until the very end.It's fantastic, tense, and entertaining.Take my word for it.But also...Don't get too caught up in the hype.See the film when it comes out.You'll be glad you did.P.S. Jeremy Saulnier is definitely someone to look out for.
