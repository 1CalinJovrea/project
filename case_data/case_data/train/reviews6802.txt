Underwhelming

Great cast. Great acting. However, The entire film feels like the
beginning to a movie. You keep telling yourself, 'wow, the intro was
long now the movies really starting..oh nevermind'. ::Spoilers:: The
entire goal of the protagonist is to acquire more of his regimented
medicine. The goal of his enemies is to kill him. There is no trying to
get back at the CIA, no typical Bourne stuff. The Bourne series was
unnecessarily reused and they really should have just started off
fresher. Scenes were drawn out, there were only about 2 clever plays
made, and the main enemy never meets the prot. It's all very separated
and remote. No connections are formed and we are not given the hope
that he seeks to solve the issues at hand. They also completely write
off Bourne.. wouldn't he know Pamela gets framed and that the overhead
is still controlling black ops groups? A lot of things were not well
thought out for this movie and it was entertaining but disappointing.
