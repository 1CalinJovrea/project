This movie was awful.

I'm generally a fan of comedies, and tend to prefer intelligent
comedies to most dramas. Lay The Favorite wasn't funny, it wasn't
entertaining and it felt so scattered that it was hard to follow any of
the character's motivations. This felt like one of those movies where
they just wanted to have a bunch of named stars so they could have fun
on set. If the movie was allowed to be slightly slower or if they
allowed the movie to be slightly longer it might have been able to gain
footing but in it's current state by the time you've figured out why
someone is doing something they're already four moves ahead of that. If
you just want to see southern women depicted as ditsy sex objects and
older men that wear Hawaiian shirts and gamble then this movie is for
you.
