Brilliant Movie, could be a play, if you like that sort of thing like me.

I haven't written a review in ages but I feel this deserves one.I like to take gambles on movies with promise and it usually pays off -
this one certainly did!I'm no nerd but I like a bit of sci-fi. I also like movies with a small
cast and a small set - maybe I am a nerd. ..or I just have good taste.If you have a bit of intelligence and 20 minutes patience - you will be
rewarded. It takes that time to be introduced to the characters and the
scenario - alright? Alright.The acting is pretty spot-on, considering I didn't recognize anyone.
(Upon inspection this isn't a bunch of new actors, it has the dude from
Homeland and a dude from Buffy.)Without spoiling much it ends up tapping in to the 'alternate reality'
or 'multiple reality' game - which is cool. It starts off being quite
amusing for the viewer but escalates nicely in to a dramatic
conclusion.All I can say is watch it. I am looking forward to watching it again -
it's gone straight in my 'watch again pile' which isn't very large.I wish more movies were like this. Well done everyone.(My honest review would be a 9, but it deserves a 10 here for the sake
of it.)
