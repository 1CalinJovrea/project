Good, Gritty, No Apologies

THis move, Sabotage (2014), was fantastic.It has grit and does not apologize for it.It's violent, and does not apologize for it.It's "hero," has an edge with a purpose and does not apologize for it,
Women are killed, no apologize for it.By standards are killed,....This movie is a true gritty movie, where lines of right wrong, and good
and bad are blurred. People are sacrificed, and friend betrays friend
in a very realistic, gritty, NON-STYLIZED manner. If you like Dredd
(2012) and the grit, you should love this.Arnold's best movie since the 90's maybe and A REAL GUYS MOVIE! Arnold
is DEA and leader of a group of specialists, and one by one people are
killed off. Friend and foe die, and new allies are formed or are they?
Is Arnold a good man or a bad man...must watch to find out.It is violent and NEVER has to apologize for it. It's a modern day
action movie.Must see....10 out of 10!!!!
