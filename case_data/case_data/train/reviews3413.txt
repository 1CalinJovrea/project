Another disappointing summer movie

In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men
trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US
army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for
the 'The Hangover' trilogy.Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually
is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a
predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would
otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is
very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting
considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy.
Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards
indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not
seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is
clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make
the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a
grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the
viewer's interest back.The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a
very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does
not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a
certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is
shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix
in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've
probably turned out roughly the same. The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as
they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately
not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the
2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.My rating: 4/10
