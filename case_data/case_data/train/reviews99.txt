Run now. When this movie falls down, don't go back for it

Found-footage movies have a muddy track to run on. The drive by writers
and producers seems lately to make cheap horror movies. Waste tons of
money on superhero movies, but stop making quality movies in the horror
genre. "Creep" is another mutant franchise- child to try to make an
endless string of movies that cover their meager outlays by lacking in
production value. The found-footage movie is a favorite vehicle of
budget-slashing studios that lack fresh ideas to keep us frozen in
terror. Less articulate notes:"Creep" features tacky shock scares with abrupt cues in the background
score, boring (I tried falling asleep), predictable, improbable
premise. My wife and I booed at the end of the movie. Like a
lower-budget, found-footage version of "Vacancy". Whats not to like? If you see this movie, push it down a flight of
stairs before its too late. I gave it an extra star because I'm a
moron, like Aaron.
