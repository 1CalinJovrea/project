A great big middle finger at everyone that's ever written something

The title is this review says it all. This movie isn't just bad. It is
INTENTIONALLY bad. Not just in the sense that it goes out of its way
over and over again to be offensive, but in that it goes well out of
its way to avoid ever being funny.If you have ever written a script, poem or short story, it is
guaranteed to be better than Movie 43. And Movie 43 in turn is a
collective effort by some of Hollywood's greatest underachievers to rub
it in your face that you will never get to work in Hollywood -- that
they can crank out the greatest travesty in the English language and,
not only will they get it on the big screen, but all of the biggest
names in Hollywood will be forced to degrade themselves in the process,
while your life's work will continue to collect dust while you continue
to live in a perpetual state of wage slavery.
