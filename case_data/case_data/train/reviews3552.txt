What exactly was the point of this movie?

From start till the end, Mark's character, our protagonist, is shown as
the golden boy who is not only awesome at doing what he does, but just
cannot take a misstep that will result in total failure even if he's
forced to do something.He breezes through all challenges in his path while the "big bad" guys
spend time trying to act scary or plotting something, while being one
of THE lamest bad guys I've ever seen. They not only DON'T look
threatening, but they act that way as well.There comes only ONE moment where I felt "Hmm, wow, they actually did
that?" concerning the death of a main character, but they even chicken
out of that in a few minutes.Seriously, what exactly IS the point of this movie? Is it to show how
awesome Mark's character is? Cause the ending not only shows that but
proves it. It's ridiculous.This movie is a really dumb "action" (if you call people walking around
fast "action", then I guess..) movie that fails to be a "entertaining"
dumb action movie. Meh!
