Not As Good As the Original But Fun!

It is not as good as the original. But it is still very funny. And
really shows Adam Sandler who has starred in some flops recently, still
has his charm as Dracula.With his girl now grown up and married Mavis to human Johnny. Played
respectively by Selena Gomez and Andy Samberg. As they become parents
later on to a boy named Dennis. With curly red hair and Dracula hopes
he becomes a vampire like his grandfather.In order to prove he is a vampire with his only child and son in law to
visit his human grandparents, Dracula and friends like Frankenstein
must take off with young Dennis, without Mavis knowing about it.Mavis gets to discover a bit of the outside world along with doing
things that she never did like ride a bicycle or drink slur pees. Much
to Johnny's amusement.Still it is about accepting people no matter what in their hearts. Not
just with words. There is a "cameo" with Mel Brooks as Dracula's
estranged father. Not as good as the first one but still fun.
