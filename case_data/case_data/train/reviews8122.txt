Horribly overrated!

What can I say about this movie? I think it's overrated, over-hyped,
and overpraised. I believe media loves this movie because they're
actually praising Tom Ford the stylist, not Tom Ford the filmmaker. The movie undeniably has good qualities - beautiful cinematography,
lavish costume design, amazing cast (Michael Shannon's performance is
flawless and deserves an Academy Award).However, the screen script is weak, pretentious and childish. The book
written by Tony Hastin looks more interesting than the movie itself. I
don't understand the need to tell a story inside a story when the main
story line is weak, full of clich√©s and unconvincing. The love story between Susan and Edward didn't convince me at all. It
all seemed very poorly developed, the flashback moments were cold, they
always seemed like two teenagers speaking - no substance, no deepness,
nothing that Tom Ford's target audience would expect, I believe. Edward's little plot of revenge is absurdly childish, also laughable.
That's why the character is not convincing to me. It's all absurdly
immature. Honestly, I believe Tom Ford was more worried about making a visually
impacting movie than actually a good one. He has yet a lot to learn
about what is necessary to be a good filmmaker.
