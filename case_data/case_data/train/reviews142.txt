Disappointed because the name set up expectations

I tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when
I can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of
Tomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led
me to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past:
that Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow
him. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.Unfortunately Ultron turned out to be a rather impotent villain. He's
full of potential danger, but doesn't manage to realise any of that
potential. The trailers made the movie look like the threat is a lot
bigger than it was. Pretty much every danger in this movie is short
term and thwarted without too much problem. I kept waiting for
something truly dramatic to happen, but it never did. There's no Age of
Ultron in this movie, not even a glimpse of it, and for me that was
disappointing enough that I didn't enjoy the movie much.There's decent action, drama and humour, it's not a badly made movie,
but the villain is weak, and even the ultimate danger, the death of the
human race, is less dramatic than potential subjugation, which is what
most villains go for.
