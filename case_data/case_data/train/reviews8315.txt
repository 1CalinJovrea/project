Just as well those Taliban can't shoot straight huh?

Or this movie/true story would have ended after 45 minutes, but
thankfully for the 'true story' the Tallis could only shoot toes and
buttox and elbows and fingers with their Ak-47's and rocket launchers
and such and any actual body shots were thankfully not immediately
fatal, compared to the headshots popping from the marines left right
and centre it just became comical (almost bullet for bullet at one
point). At that rate of accuracy i am amazed there are any Taliban fighters
left on that planet with the headshot ratio in regards to bullets fired
and headshots acquired, don't think i was ever even that good on
Counterstrike back in the day.I am sure as mentioned by the other reviewers that kit details, camp
set out and beards and sunglasses details were very accurate and I am
thankful for that aspect of the storytelling, which is what this is
storytelling, only truth being is that a bunch of Marines went in and
only one came out and as we know from the title at the end of this
misery there was a lone survivor so is there any need to even watch it,
obviously the lone survivor he can the tale however he likes with as
many Marines getting headshots as he needs and he clearly did, unless
the producers felt the story needed embellished to keep us watching and
are responsible for the headshot count.I mean no offence to any soldiers out there fighting these corporate
wars, out there doing their duty but i see no justification in ever
taking a human life, i don't care what religion, colour or creed they
hold true, or what they done or didn't do, life is either sacred for
all or not at all, it is black and white not shade of grey. History will look back on this era with shame and we all share it
equally, we have global awareness for the first time in human history
and we turn a blind eye to the disgraceful behaviour of our political
elite and the wars they have us fight in their cause, through inaction
we are as much to blame as those who make it happen.All in this is the worst war film i have ever watched, true story or
not.RIP everyone on both sides who died in the making of this true
story(all the human beings, yes that includes The Marines and The
Taliban soldiers), my condolences to all your loved ones left behind in
pain, don't worry no goats were harmed (just people) in the making of
this true story although they are everywhere when the shizer hits the
air circulation apparatus the marines were focusing on Taliban
headshots and the Taliban fighters (although clearly inhuman as
depicted) did not feel the need to slaughter the goats to get to the
Marines.
