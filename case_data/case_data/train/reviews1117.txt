Overrated but watchable

The film started off OK but as the story developed, if was very slow
and boring. I did watch it to the end because I always likes to see how
the underdog beats the powerful opposition which, in this case, were
investigators who had already made up their minds that the two pilots
were 'guilty'. However, in the final part of the film, I found that the
woman investigator's actions wrong and, IMO, she and her colleagues
should have been investigated for ignorance and contempt. Why??? Well
had Sully not questioned the number of times the pilots practiced their
run, the investigation would have found them guilty. However, because
Sully did question this, the simulator was rerun with new parameters
and the pilots were then found to have acted correctly.... WHICH brings
to me to my point. The investigator (Anna Gunn) then had the nerve and
audacity to say that she had never met a pilot like Sully, his actions
were heroic and so on. So either her views changed within about 30
seconds (which I severely doubt), or she knew he was heroic from the
beginning but continued along her path of scapegoating etc. with her
other investigator colleagues. So if the did indeed say those words
then she/they should be investigated and if it was just artistic
Hollywood licence, then it was really OTT.
