Jonah and James: Won't get fooled again

Jonah Hill, James Franco, and another: "Hey I've got only a trailer
length's worth of funny content for a new flick that's another ATM for
us! We'll stick in some (now formulaic) prolonged disturbing sexual
content that differentiates us/the film as young and hip."Really, if you saw the trailer you saw the best of this movie. Whoever
made the trailer really deserves a big payout for creating something
people would look forward to as a funny diversion from all the serious
political crap of late.It's got a good cast that's wasted on the lame writing, but hey it's a
pay check!
