It was no legacy...

Ouch. I wish Greengrass directed this film, because to me it felt like
a mess. Had a good idea with a solid backing, but it failed to take
advantage of it. I like that they intertwined the story within the
Ultimatum storyline like you see in the preview as well as playing
homage to the original series, but the execution sucked not to mention
that the Bourne events had no influence on Cross' character - something
that "Legacy" would suggest. The storytelling felt disjointed, and the
action sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them (the first
trilogy wasn't so bad). Other than Manila, and the solitude of Alaska,
location is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the
first three films, the assassins didn't need to speak to have
personality and character - this film's assassin was just a ghost in
your memory.Even though not directly stated, I think most people would understand
by watching this film what MAY have actually happened to Jason Bourne.
The only way this film will have any more meaning is if they continue
the new trilogy.
