Tulip Fever is not contagious

Here is only one review of the 2014-version. Based on that review, it
is fair to say that some of the plot holes have obviously been stuffed,
while others are still wide open (or have been opened). I don't know if
the holes have been faithfully adapted from the book or if they were
specifically designed for the film.In the 16th century there was a big economic bubble based on tulip
onions. This is the background for a romance between a painter and a
married woman. They make out a plan to get rich fast, so that they can
run away to the East Indies. So far, so good. The point is now that the
two strings never really are woven properly together. The development
of the plot is, at best, sketchy. Character development, if any, is
rather rhapsodical. The lovers (Vikander and DeHaan) are not really
likable. The script gives them zero personality and they compensate by
overacting. The only person carrying a bit of sympathy is the cheated
husband (Waltz). On the other hand the makers strive to give us
impressions of street life then, raw, loud and rather vulgar it is in
their view. The final twist of the plot is surprising, but not
convincing. There are further things that were rather annoying in this film: The
use of a narrator. It seemed that the makers didn't trust the force of
their pictures and thought they had to spell it out for more distracted
viewers. Shaky camera and fast clipping. I think it is a misconception
to edit a costume drama to fit the taste of the MTV generation. (Make
it more like The Girl with a Pearl Earring!) One reason for historical fiction is to make us understand the burst of
the recent economic bubble on the basis of a historical example. The
makers of this film didn't really succeed in doing that. The persons in
this film are far away and two-dimensional like drawings on a wall.
Unless you write a review about them, you have already forgotten them
tomorrow.
