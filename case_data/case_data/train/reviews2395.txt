Ruined absolutely ruined (spoiler alert!)

This movie was absolutely a waste of my time and my money. I went to my
local theater on March 7th which is also my birthday and I wanted to
see the movie based on the performance of the first 300.The first 300 had catharsis, it had actual character development and
made you want to keep going. This new 300, "rise of an empire" was
absolutely horrendous. Rise of an empire, what empire? This Great War that united the Greeks was barely touched on. It was all
about the blood and the guts and breasts. I don't mind nudity. I don't
mind blood. But the way the director went about it only cheapened the
experience. This movie has a line in it "you fight harder than you
f***" (Artemisia). It could have been beautiful and filled with the
promise of something both hilarious and invigorating if the scene it
referred to had not been so vulgar. 300 Rise of an Empire was not worth
the money I spent on it. There are books out there on this point in
history, historical fiction books that have stronger character
development than this script. The actors did the best they could with
what they had, but writers and director, you owe the public an apology
for this poor display of cinematic "genius". It was cheap, crude and
not well thought out. I had higher hopes. Next time actually make
something worth watching.
