You have seen this movie before

I guess there is just no new way of telling this story. A boxer on top
of his world loses everything in the blink of an eye, then battles his
way back. Every trite plot wrinkle is there. Every sympathy trigger is
there. The writing is not bad. The story is as well told as it can be,
but the story just does not need to be told again. Jake was great. His transformation from the pale, ghoulish
"Nightcrawler" to a ripped pro boxer is startling. His portrayal of the
punchy, brutal fighter on a journey of redemption is every bit as good
as one could expect. Top marks for Jake. And the boxing scenes are as
bloody as you could ask.So there are some good things in a very predictable movie. Overall, go
ahead and watch it and enjoy it for what it is. Just don't expect
anything new.
