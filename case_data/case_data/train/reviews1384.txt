A Cute Movie

I loved this movie, think it is a cute movie and everyone of all ages
would love, this would be a perfect family movie.This movie is about Jack Frost no one can see him, this is because no
one believed in him but eventually they do, he was chosen to be a
guardian, at first he didn't wanted to be, but after he see his
memories he understands why the moon chosen him, he was chosen to be a
guardian because he saved his sister.My favorite character is Jack Frost, because I loved everything about,
he was viewed as a good guy and not a bad guy.I thought this movie was cute and hope you will too.
