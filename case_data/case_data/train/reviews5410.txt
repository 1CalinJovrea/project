The synopsis of this film couldn't be more misleading. This is NOT 'a
journey to find gold in the uncharted jungle of Indonesia', like the
synopsis suggests. It's more like an office drama set in the big city,
with only sporadic scenes of actual gold hunting. It has completely the
wrong focus and is told in a way that the viewer can't help but feel
detached from everything that's happening on screen.Part of the problem is that this film is supposed to be based on a true
story, yet the whole thing feels like pretentious Hollywood crap. It's
dull and emotionless. The entertainment in this film is restricted to
only a few scenes, while the rest of the film is just extended scenes
of dialogue, which the audience couldn't care less about. Speaking of
the dialogue, a lot of scenes at the start are mumbled and difficult to
understand, which only added to my dissatisfaction.
