Interesting Premise...

When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it looked quite
interesting. Sure, the Groundhog Day plot seems to be becoming a clich√©
nowadays (with movies like Before I Fall), and it was most likely going
to be a jump-scare-infested film, since it came from Blumhouse, but I
actually had interests in seeing this film, so I went and saw this with
a friend.I thought the movie was okay, but nothing special. I liked the premise,
I liked how the girl went from this unlikable bitch to an actual caring
person as the film went on, and I liked how she gradually learned from
the error of her ways. I also liked the design of the mask and how so
many people had it in their possession, which only makes it harder to
guess who the killer is.But no film is without its flaws.In some parts, it seemed like they were trying to go somewhere, like
when the girl is spying on the people who she thinks might be out to
kill her, but that was quickly dropped. The scene where she takes out
that criminal was pretty good, but it then came off as pointless once
the twist came. Oh, and speaking of that, while I did admire the twist
and how they chose an unsuspecting person, the heroine jumped to the
conclusion WAY too fast. Like, she just assumes all these things and it
ends up being right. Like, you need to build up stuff like that. You
can't just rush it.Overall, this movie was okay. It didn't rely too heavily on
jump-scares, so I applaud them for that. Give it a watch if you want.
