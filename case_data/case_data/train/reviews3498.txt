Ever seen the movie Equilibrium?

So... first of all, I have not read the book so this is not a
comparison. Not to the book at least.But the story... It's not an original one, to be honest. And, as a
movie at least, it's told and shown less alluring then the movie I know
that tells a similar story; Equilibrium.Some other reviewers also state that you don't really get emotionally
connected to the characters, with which I have to agree. All in all it's really not a bad movie and the underlying moral is
beautiful! But if a movie tells a story you've heard before it's easy
to compare it with each other and, in my opinion, the other told it
better. So; if you did like it or liked the story but missed the connection;
Equilibrium!
