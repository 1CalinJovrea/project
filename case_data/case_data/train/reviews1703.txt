What Happened??

Seriously what happened? What happened to the Adam Sandler i use to
know. Happy Gilmore, billy Madison, Mr deeds.....remember when those
were actually and genuinely funny? I think Adam Sandler has really lost
his humor now. Honestly this movie has a bunch of 30-40 year old acting
like a bunch of children, the humor is just really dry and awful and
quite frankly makes the actors look stupid and to top it all off...WHAT
A STUPID STORY LINE!!!. Poor directing, great actors and actresses that humiliated themselves
in this movie, bad story line. Grown Ups 1 was decent but this was just
a waste of time. Not worth watching in theaters and not worth buying,
hell maybe its not even worth renting and god its probably not even
worth pirating it!Don't waste and Hour and a Half of your life watching this garbage.
Adam Sandler love you mate but honestly what happened.
