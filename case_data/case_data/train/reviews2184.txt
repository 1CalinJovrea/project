Still waiting

Well i watched this all excited thinking oh yes Nicole Kidman's in it,
she's normally in good films. I like her. Good actress in good films
etcAnyway the story starts off promising, a mystery a mother and father in
despair, a few family secrets are revealed, we get to know the
characters a little bit and then nothing literally nothing. I kept
waiting for it to pick back up and get to the good bit but alas it
doesn't go anywhere. I think i started playing on my phone half way
through it as well.Anyway to conclude nothing happens, no conclusion to events. No
nothing. My 8 year old could have written a more gripping storyline.It will kill a few hours if you are bored anyway. :)
