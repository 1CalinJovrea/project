Great movie very educational.

Girls Trip Movie Review. I tried not to but some of you will think I'm
spoiling so read at your own risk. . . . . . I loved, loved, loved this
movie. Besides being a comedy and have lots of rated R scenes and
vocabulary, is very educational. I think everyone (specially women)
should watch it. It shows the value of friendships and how important it
is to stay close with the ones who love you the most, no matter the
differences you have. It shows that it is okay to let loose and have
some fun, you don't need to be so uptight, life is better when you're
willing to take risks and enjoy. It shows an issue that unfortunately
happens everywhere in the world: how women stay in bad and destructive
relationships because they get so used to this person and are willing
to diminish themselves and stay in the relationship out of the fear of
being alone. It shows reality on how people can't have it all. It
doesn't matter how hard you try, or how good you want to be seen in the
eyes of others, your life is NEVER perfect. Most importantly this movie
is about being honest with yourself. Realize when you're acting wrong
and changing your path.
