How vile and disgusting can you get!

This movie is an exercise in how revolting they can go. But stupid
scatological humor, and a plethora of f-bombs is one thing; when
disgusting explicit sexual descriptions come out of the mouth of
children, well I think this descends into the category of child
pornography. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed.I didn't expect this kind of movie from an actor like Bryan Cranston,
or the director of "I Love You Man". There must be a grown-up somewhere
in the process, you would think, to say no, this is beyond decency.
I've seen a couple films from Jason Bateman, "Bad Words" and "The
Change-Up", that both put children in sexual situations, which should
be offensive to everyone. Studios need to feel repercussions from
foisting this kind of sleazy contemptible depravity on unsuspecting
audiences.
