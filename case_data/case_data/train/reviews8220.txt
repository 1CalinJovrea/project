Where did the storyline go?

A pretty bad movie. Nothing more. I am a big fan of the series, number
1 was my absolute favorite, i like the prequel they started in number 4
but number 5 was weird but still made sense in the "storyline" of the
other films. But what the hell is up with this one? It does not make
any sense what so ever, it has absolutely nothing to do with the
previous movies other than the 3 inbred brothers. It pisses me of, but
i hope they are putting more sense to it in the 7th movie and explains
what exactly was going on in this one. A random guy who inherit a hotel
and is somehow related to the 3 brothers, a small "town" in the middle
of the woods with a whole bunch of inbreeds and a weird and creepy
brother and sister running the hotel. But where the hell has their dad
gone? I was hoping this would tie the prequels together with the
original trilogy somehow like the last "final destination" maybe the
ending could have been the brothers view from the opening scene at the
1st one with the mountaineering. But no we just get a movie that has
absolutely nothing to do with the rest.
