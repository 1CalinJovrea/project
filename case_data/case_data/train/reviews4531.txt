An elegant and moving Testament of Youth

Having read some of the negative remarks regarding the film makers'
decision to not show extensive scenes from the mucky trenches, I must
respectfully disagree. From War Horse to the Wipers Times, there have
been quite a few films over the last few years that covered the
horrifying reality of life in the trenches of Europe.I found this to be a well-acted and balanced presentation. It has left
me with a lingering sadness and I feel that it has accomplished the
purpose of showing the viewers the aching emptiness and futility of
war. No one in this story escaped the impact of the World War I years.
Although most of the focus is on Vera, we do see the anguish of the
others who surround her throughout those years.Previously unfamiliar with the back-story of this writer, I was very
satisfied with the film portrayal of her life.
