A well acted, well filmed piece let down by a poor ending

My wife and I had decided "Brooklyn" was not a 'big screen' movie but
when the accolades poured in we thought perhaps it was something out of
the box. So we plonked our money down and bought tickets.
Disappointment! "Brooklyn" is a movie populated with interesting
characters, good acting, well constructed scenes and excellent 1950s
atmospherics. But Â… what I can never understand is how a script can
make its way through the system to the big screen, getting by a myriad
of people who apparently have never read Robert McKee's "Story", or
having read it failed to understand that one of the basics of story
telling is that the central character has to make a decision and take
action and the decision must be BIG, must be hard, must be a choice
between conflicting ideas of good (not between good and evil which is
no decision at all). And the decision must be taken by the central
character, not forced upon him/her. What a let down at the end of
"Brooklyn" where the decision taken by Eilis was a 'no brainer' forced
upon her by someone threatening to expose her real situation. Come on
script writers! Read McKee. I can't go higher than a 4.
