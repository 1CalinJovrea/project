Brilliant acting isn't enough

This is not an enjoyable film. I could appreciate Cate Blanchette's
truly great performance but after a while I hoped there would be
something else. It is obviously a morality tales about the section of
New York society that is shallow, materialistic and callous, but we got
this message and all about Jasmine fairly quickly. There was nothing
else - that was it. As we continued to follow her downward path, I had
expected the ray of light about the future. Instead we got a more
detailed description of the past, even though she had already told us
all there was to know about her history. There was never a sign that
the penny had dropped about what was really important in life. All we
ever got was an indication that things were going to get even worse
without even a hint of redemption. Thoroughly depressing. When they
give out the Oscar I can say I saw it, but that is a small consolation.
