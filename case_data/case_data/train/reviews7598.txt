A quality comedy which is rare to find these days

Wasn't expecting much before watching the movie, but was pleasantly
surprised. Firstly and most importantly the comedy was not lame. The
jokes were down to earth, made sense and made me laugh sincerely. This
rarely happens with all those stupid comedies nowadays. Secondly - the
topic and the storyline was so relevant in regards to relationships and
families of our society. Though it is a comedy genre - but underneath
that you can fell that the problems and situations that are being
touched are important and worth thinking about. The performances by
Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and Maude Apatow - were amazing. Paul and Leslie
were perfect, but also my respects to the youngest cast members, as
they were convincing and did their part flawlessly.
