Dredd is an uncompromising vision of Judge Dredd's world and
adventures.There is no hesitation in any aspect of the film. The script,
performances and direction are all first rate. Karl Urban is excellent
as Dredd to the extent that Sylvester Stallone's campy buffoonish take
on the character is forgotten. Lena Headey is typically excellent as
MAma and Olivia Thirlby is both vulnerable and tough as rookie
Anderson.I'm delighted that I own this bluray and I hope that we get a chance
for a sequel. Easily one of the best sci fi action movies in years.
