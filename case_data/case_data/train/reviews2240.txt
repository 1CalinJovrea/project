Creepy and Well-Written

This movie was one that I was very excited to see, but unfortunately it
was a little harder to find then I thought it would be so I didn't
watch it until now. I'm pleased to say that it did not disappoint. I went into The Gift with almost no idea what it was about. I'd seen
the ratings, the cover, the content advisory, and the word 'stalker' at
some point. So I had little to no idea what I was getting into. The plot was very interesting. It's relatively simple, but the
characters really drive it forward. The characters are noticeably amazing from the beginning. The actors
are great, and the characters act and feel like real people. From the
get-go they're all authentic and engaging. You want to hate some of
them, but they're so relatable that it's difficult to do so. They're
easily the best part of the movie. The tone set by the movie is great, and so is the pacing. It never
feels slow, and it seems to get darker throughout. It doesn't follow
the regular movie formula, which is a little surprising considering
this is Joel Edgerton's first full-length movie. That fact makes it all
the more impressive that he actually pulled this off. Overall The Gift is nothing short of fantastic. The plot is great, the
characters are superb, and the tone and pacing are very well done. In
the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Gift to anyone. If the
word 'stalker' interests you as a movie, then take a look. I really
hope you won't regret it.
