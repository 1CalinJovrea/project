Tedious, Dull, Tasteless, Unfunny

I'm wondering if the infant in the film has fired her agent for landing
her this gig.I love bawdy humor. I actually love bad movies ("The Thing With Two
Heads", for example) but this one misses on every count and I'm
supremely puzzled by the positive reviews along with alleged media
critics asking if this is the "...funniest comedy of the year?"Really?The basic concept was not a bad one -- partying frat boys next door to
a 30-something-couple-with-infant trying to retain their youthful
coolness -- that the couple never convinces you they had in the first
place.As a former journalist who knows many useless small details, it grated
on me that the frat house operated so far outside of municipal
regulations its existence would never have been allowed along with
rickety plot gimmicks that derail the couple's efforts to uproot the
frat boys through official means.The sexual humor was uncomfortably crude and unfunny rather than bawdy
(i.e., the scene where a frat boy wins a fight using his erection) and
there is not the slightest success in creating the most threadbare aura
of believability necessary for genuine comedy.Those who made this film could have taken some lesson's from Chaucer's
Miller's Tale on how to handle off-color sexual humor and scatology
with precision and good effect.It seemed the writers thought up crude things and then
reverse-engineered them into the script making it a collection of
rather dumb gags disconnected from a discernible story arc.My afternoon viewing of this film was interesting in that the entire
audience was 60 or older and when the film ended the house was silent.
