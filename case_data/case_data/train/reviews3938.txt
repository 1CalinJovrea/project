Could have been good but just not so...

Well, I had high hopes for this movie. I had awaited it's release and
enjoyed the build up... hearing that Shia Lebouff didn't wash for weeks
in order to get into role; much to the annoyance of the other cast
members... Though, in truth this movie didn't reveal a lot about what it was like
living and fighting through the war. I understood nothing after
watching the movie about how cramped or what it might be like to live,
fight and die inside a tank. Instead it seemed like "it's the best job
ever" - alcohol in the pantry and (seemingly) plenty of space...The movie did provide loud noises. Colourful explosions. Some gruesome
and somewhat shocking deaths. Some love. Some hate. And about as many
war movie clichés as could be fit into the running time. Seriously, the
end of the film will have you thinking - This is definitely an American
made movie. I would still rate it as a 'decent' war movie. Though, do not get your
hopes up. There has been such a dry patch and nothing can come close to
Saving Private Ryan or the characterisation of band of brothers
series...This movie played all the stereotype characters and yes they did play
well. But I wanted so much more from the film. I wanted to feel like I
had learnt a bit of history or at least a bit of insight after the
screening. Instead all I learnt was that American blockbusters still
play the stereotypes, the clichés and SO much cheese at the end the
movie ends up stinking. Enjoy for an easy war flick but don't expect too much.
