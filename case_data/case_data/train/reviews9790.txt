The OK 7

Come on now. If you're going to re-make "The Magnificent 7" let's do it
magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative
cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles
Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that
Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and
McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't
yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except
perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly
entertaining.This is a modern re-telling. You might call it the Diversity 7. The
producers threw in just about every minority you can think of Â–
Mexican, Asian, Black, Woman. The only thing missing was a "little"
person .Personally I liked the idea of the woman, played very well by Haley
Bennett who has been with Washington before ("The Equalizer").An action film like this works only when the villain is villainous. Eli
Wallach was terrific. Peter Sarsgaard wouldn't scare a fly.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. It's OK, but it's not magnificent.
