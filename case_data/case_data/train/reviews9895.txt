A disappointment for this huge fan of the book

I have been looking forward to this movie, having loved the book and
admiring Louis Zamperini like so many others. While the movie was
well-crafted and well-acted, it failed to blow me over emotionally.
It's one movie that could have been longer, while at the same time
tightening up the POW sequence by at least 15 minutes. The director, editors and committee of screenwriters (never a good
sign) cut out too much of the back story of what shaped Louie's
character as a kid, and (critically) his PTSD and religious awakening
at the end. I know this would have made Unbroken a three- hour movie
but Louie's story deserved a fuller treatment. Instead, the character
is turned into a Christ-like vessel of suffering for his fellow
prisoners, rather than a flesh-and-blood person, although he seems
oddly unscathed by the ordeal when he reunites with his family.I was hoping for a "Spielberg" experience to leave me in tears, and it
just didn't happen. Too bad.
