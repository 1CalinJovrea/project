The simplicity of storytelling on screen!

This simple yet profound movie hit me deep in the heart. This movie is
the reason I love indies. No CGI, no loud jumps, or scares. I haven't
seen a survival drama told with such subtlety. Yes there are some
really heart-stopping moments but I immensely appreciated the
director's restraint in letting the audience tune in to what the
characters were truly feeling rather than manipulate us with loud music
& startles. Most of the movie rests on Matt Bomer's Cal & Josh Wiggins'
David with lots of close shots of their faces. Matt Bomer has proved
his mettle as an actor but I think this is his most subtle performance
ever. The emotions on his face are so subtle yet so profound that he
invites the audience to not want to blink lest you might miss a nuance.
Josh Wiggins plays David's arc from a grumpy teen to a man so
beautifully. Bill Pullman is a delight in a small but powerful role.I felt as though I just traveled to Montana & spent time with Cal &
David, the mountains, the moose, the bear, the deer, the wildlife. What
a ride. Don't miss it!
