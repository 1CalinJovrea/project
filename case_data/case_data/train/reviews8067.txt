How to make money out of a 200 pages book

What a disappointment ! While I watched all LOTR movies with great
enjoyment, this one is just a movie created to fill someone's pockets.First of all, there is no suspense, no pace to the movie, nothing to
give you that nice feeling of holding your breath during the whole
movie eagerly awaiting what will come next. No, this was just a waste
of 3 hours of my life.Then the movie itself doesn't make sense, some examples: - the whole
group except Gandalf is deep down a Gobelin mine, fighting the king and
obviously loosing the battle. Then tadaaaa Gandalf appears, teleported
or something, to save them all. And of course after that they have to
run for hours to find the exit, instead of taking the path Gandalf took
to enter ( or teleport back ). - again in the Gobelin mine, right
before the exit, they defy all gravity rules, the king falls down
first, then the bridge they stand on (which they use as a skateboard of
course), and when they reach the bottom they get crushed 5 minutes
later by the king who finally decided to finish his descent... - why
did Gandalf call the giant eagles at the end of the trip and not on the
beginning? Due to a lack of mots in the beginning area?And I skip all the parts not in the book, just created to extend the
length of the movie, allowing for 3 episodes.Finally, I must admit the special effects are stunning, but all fights
(and there are many of them) have a big problem; either you see the
movie at 48fps and you have a big chance of getting sick (just google
it) either your eyes will hurt at the end of the movie because of the
fast and blurry scenes.
