An idiotic book...

...made into a pretty stupid film!Where authors(sic) get these unbelievably lame ideas? A world divided
into 5 factions? This is ridiculous. This is another politically correct tripe. The plot is based on
countless Hollywoodian stereotypes. Actors all look like they came out
of catwalk fashion show. They have as much substance and personality as
bobble head dolls. The film is tedious, move at a snail's pace and do
not even fall into the category "so bad it is good"It is embarrassing to know that there are those who classify this
sophomoric attempt at literature as a dystopian science fiction novel.Pure waste of time, money.
