Flawed but Fun

The eighth film in The Fast and the Furious franchise, "The Fate of the
Furious", might not be the best in the series, but I must say, it's
pretty damn good and just as fun and entertaining as I expected. The
franchise as a whole, for what it is, it offers great entertainment,
especially with its latest instalments.The Fast & Furious family is back, but this time things will get
serious. Dom is going evil and betrays his friends and family to work
with Cipher (a.k.a. Charlize Theron), a cyberterrorist who is really
evil. And that's not enough to describe how wicked she is and all the
things she does.The movie is full of twists and surprises, although it should be said
that these twists are not something none saw coming. They are quite
predictable. That's a problem with this franchise - and I believe every
franchise and movie that has mainly to do with car racing. Don't expect
much story wise.However, it gives you what you want. It gives you action, fun, family
spirit, cars, racing, and Vin Diesel, the Rock and Jason Statham
kicking ass - Tyrese Gibson is also a scene stealer. It lives up to
what you've come to expect from FAF. Do you really want more?
