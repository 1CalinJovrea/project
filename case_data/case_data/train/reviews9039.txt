More Pain than Gain for me this time....

I love some of Bay's other directed films like "The Rock" and "Bad
Boys", and this is obviously WAY different. Yes the directing style is
similar, language similar, actors similar (Fiennes and Harris), locale
somewhat similar (many of Bays films are filmed in Miami), but the flow
and feel of the film is much different. This is based on a true story,
and the focus is not as much about the action as it is about Bay's
stylish comedic way to tell this story. I did not particularly care for
this way. The excessive profanity and mockery of Christianity and
religion were a bit annoying for me; it's evident and often throughout
the film. Paul (Dwayne Johnson) is an ex-con who has apparently changed
his ways, has recently been "saved", and oh yeah, has a mild problem
with violence, lack of intelligence, and addiction to substances. I'm
not sure how much of these are attempts at humor or from the actual
true account. The violence wasn't necessarily over the top, but there
is a little more grit and gore than in typical Bay movies. The overall
experience here was just more disappointing than not, and while I
welcome another Bad Boys movie, I don't welcome another true story
crime comedy drama from Bay. Unfortunately, we may have to wait until
the next "Transformers" saga to see anything.for more, go to www.moviescoundrel.com
