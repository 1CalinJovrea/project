Only the stunts were good , Rest a Big Let Down

This is below average . No story . Acting is very bad , Every character
was half-written or not at all written. This movie is way below
expectation compared to the original starring Keanu Reeves.There is no
point to compare the original , the original was way above in the level
of thrill , story and acting. This movie only has good locations and
great stunts . Especially the cliff climbing and surfing. Much said ,
but if someone has to watch these picturesque locations or sports ,
switch to Discovery or Nat Geo channel and enjoy that. The lead actor
and actress are wasted along with every other character. Very Abrupt
ending . Trailer raised the expectations and movie was way below that .
If want to watch wait for the Blu-ray and then watch only the stunts .
Abrupt review ending as well.
