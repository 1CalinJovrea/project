A surprisingly good movie...

First I had some doubts about this film - while I was watching the
trailer I thought it's going to be a failure even though it's Bradley
Cooper we are talking about. But it got my attention immediately, right
at the beginning with that cool soundtrack! The film has his own
dynamics and it keeps the trill till the end. I also enjoyed the
mysterious past of Adam(Bradley) which was chasing him for the hole
movie. In the end, not a great movie, but definitely a good one - my 8
is because it's different and well served :P So, in short: chefs,
delicious food, chasing past, good soundtracks, Bradley,
Sienna...Enjoy!
