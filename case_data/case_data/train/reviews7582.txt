Somewhat enjoyable but predictable

I watched this movie as the trailer was pulsating. As for the film,
both O'Brien and Keaton do justice in their roles and acting was
top-notch. And for a cast of mainly unknowns, the acting felt real and
overrides the story-line. I would love to see more of Charlotte Vega in
the future!The ending visuals were dazzling and impressive without any need of
so-called "being immersed in 3D". If you are the person dying to watch
the same old Rogue Story or a new story of Hobbits like Fantastic
Beasts...just don't go. But if you really want something refreshing
without the prequel/sequel tag, there is no harm in trying!Watched it with Stronger (for free!) Overall, a decent one-time action
flick watch could have been more better.My significant digit score: 6.5/10
