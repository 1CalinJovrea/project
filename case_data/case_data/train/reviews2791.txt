Woody's Best of the 21st Century

I took my seat for the new Woody Allen movie 'Blue Jasmine' with some
misgivings: he hasn't made a truly great film since Deconstructing
Harry (and maybe Sweet & Lowdown), a good 15 years ago now, so I did
not have any great hopes for this one. But, I do still keep checking
them out from time to time, just in case. And here I was, back again.It began pretty slow and overly stagy, the way many of Woody's weaker
efforts are wont to do, but slowly I got more and more engrossed in the
story, and especially Cate Blanchett's performance, which really is as
amazing as everyone says, and must surely bag her the best actress
award at the next Oscars.It's been pointed out before that in some ways the story is simply
'Woody does Streetcar Named Desire', and there's something to that,
although, like his very best movie 'Stardust Memories' (from one point
of view a most overt tribute to Fellini's '8 1/2') it is still a Woody
Allen film through and through, clearly unfolding in his world, through
his own unique set of lenses.Something that really grabbed me I don't think I've seen anyone else
point out is that the twist of the film is (spoilers!) that this
greedy, pampered, narcissistic woman - who we have nevertheless been
viewing as an innocent victim of her unfaithful husbands crooked
business dealings - the twist is that she herself, and ONLY herself, is
responsible for her own ruin, that everything that befalls her
throughout the film was set in motion through her own actions. As I say, I don't think I've heard anyone else draw attention to the
gravity of that yet, what it says about the modern victim mentality of
the Oprah age we are living in, but it's stayed with me for quite some
time, and ultimately is what what marks the film out above pretty much
all Woody's other films this century.
