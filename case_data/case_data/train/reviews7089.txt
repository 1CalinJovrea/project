It kinda fell flat.

What started off as potentially a great film, suddenly turned into a
complete boring mess. While going in a different direction to the
1990's version, I don't think the creators knew exactly what that
direction was as it seemed to jump all over the place. While I giggled
at certain ridiculous moments, the rest was spent thinking what exactly
is going on? Ellen Page's performance was okay but I think the movie
itself squashed what could have been a great acting role.
