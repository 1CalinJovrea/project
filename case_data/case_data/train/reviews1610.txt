What a Horrible Movie

First of all this rant is going to be filled with SPOILERS so now you
are warned. Where do I begin? Do I start with how the antagonists all have magic
bullets and the secret service agents don't or that the good guys are
too stupid to seek cover when being fired upon. Maybe I should start
with the plane that decimates DC and how it wasn't even questioned on
the radio till it was flying over DC. Or maybe how Mike Banning (Gerard
Butler) is giving information to Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and
says that were forty terrorists and now they are down to twenty-eight.
Seriously, I think Banning killed over six so out of all the other
agents they killed the other half.My biggest angst is that Kang (Rick Yune) is torturing people for some
codes and the President (Aaron Eckhart) keeps saying "Give him the code
he will never get mine." and when it finally comes to the point in the
movie where Kang needs his code it is ALREADY in the computer. What
happened? How did Kang get his code? Also, the fact that they gave into the terrorist demands over the life
of the President is hysterical especially when they bring up the phrase
"We do not negotiate with terrorists.".Overall, I thought this movie should have been renamed a comedy because
I have never laughed so hard at all the ridiculous inaccuracies and
weak story line.
