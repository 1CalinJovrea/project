Breathtaking. Gripping. Spine Tingling. Remarkable.

Certainly not your every day movie. This story pulls you in from the
very beginning.I expected very little, but being familiar with Geoffrey Rush and his
prior role selections did hold some expectation as to what kind of a
story and setting I would be witness to.May I say that after watching this movie, I am certain I will see his
character from this film in future when seeing Rush perform. His
execution of the role was impeccable.Overall - movies are very rarely made like this, from storyline,
script, acting to music, there was not a moment in which i wasn't
captivated.Chilled to the bone even after completing the film, this is top shelf
work and an unlikely gem I commend and will be indefinitely
complementing and recommending.Certainly a timeless movie, embark on with a cup of tea (or some pop
corn) and settle in for a remarkable journey and emotion roller
coaster.10 stars.
