Entire point of view and concept is changed - invalidating it

The worst thing is reading all the reviews that think the movie is
"close" to plot line of original with "slight" changes. What the hell
are they talking about? The ENTIRE point of the written piece was
REVENGE and INCEST, voluntary and involuntary by entrapment. Violence?
just a part of an amazing thriller and stylized. This film has removed
more than an octopus and a tongue - it removed the entire foundation of
the story. I'm pretty angry actually - if you're going to remake a
story, then remake THE STORY. Man locked up for 20 years by fellow
student who had incestuous relationship with sister, which was exposed,
leading to her suicide and his broken heart, thereby explaining his
insane revenge plan. This mess seemed like maybe he copped out because
Americans can't handle the real plot without outrage. The ending
thereby makes no sense at all given everything else. I will say that
the technology in this remake makes it a bit more believable as a
story, and I appreciated some plot clarifications that the Korean were
hard to understand because of sloppy subtitles. I'm just mad, and
disappointed. If you are a fan of original, stay away. If you just want
to see these good actors do an OK job of a watered down thriller, it's
about a 5.6.
