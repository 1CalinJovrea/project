A whole lot of nothing happens - minutes two likable characters

It was really boring. Probably one of the worst movies he's ever made. It took one hour and 38 minutes for a gun shot to go off. Samuel L.
Jackson is just playing the generic old grumpy guy he always plays,The only likable character was John Ruth. I guess Walton Goggins was
pretty good too. He was somewhat likable, he had some morals compared
to the rest of the boring characters. And the only other character that
I actually enjoyed was Zoe Bell. One notable thing was Joe Cage poisoning the coffee they were drinking
and, I guess, Bob "The Mexican" was a pretty good character he was the
only character I actually liked the most, besides Zoe Bell's character. All they did was talk and talk and talk and Quentin Tarantino, for some
reason, had a guy pleasing Samuel L. Jackson's character orally in it
while he is naked. Great story development there!And we also get a narration from Quentin twice in this movie. I
personally feel like it was so he could hear his own voice. Because
there is really no reason for their to be a narration in this movie. It
didn't do anything for the movie and it didn't advance anything. And the fact that one of the main selling points of this movie is that
it's filmed in a high- resolution of 70mm... They are in the cabin for
two hours of the movie and you get, like, a total of 10 minutes of
screen time to the actual depth of the scenery. This movie was a disappointment. I honestly don't recommend it. I found
it really boring. If you've got time to kill, then watch it. Otherwise
I wouldn't waste my time. Its not good and it's not fun, and it's not
even enjoyable to watch.
