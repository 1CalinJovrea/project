If all the scary movies would be like that one....

I watch a lot of scary movies, and i must confess that i'm often bored
by them these days. If it's not a crappy remake, it's a "found footage"
made with a lack of talent. Sometimes, we could have goods surprises,
and that anthology is one of them. If you like scary movies, you
probably like the Halloween, and if you like Halloween as much as i
did, you'll enjoy every segments of TALES OF HALLOWEEN. We feel the
passion for the genre, and the knowledge of it, by the creators. It's a
movies for horror geeks, made by horror geeks, and that works pretty
well, from the beginning till the end. TALES OF HALLOWEEN is the proof
that horror is not dead. Every horrors fans will like the cameos, and
at the end, we'll just hope for a sequel.
