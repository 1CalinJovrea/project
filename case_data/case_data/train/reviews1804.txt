Extremely Entertaining

This movie starts off looking like some shaky cam movies and soon turns
into a gruesome, egg laying nightmare that I found extremely
entertaining for no particular reason.I think that I found none of the characters likable, they ranged from
hated to disliked. So as they fell foul one by one there was a mild
sense of enjoyment found. Even the rapid demise of the main character
as she went from "I don't think I'm ready for marriage" to "My job is
to lay as many little eggs as possible" was something to look forward
to.There reactions were great as well, going from "It's just a little
bite" and then the big "BITE" title comes up. To - where there are
eggs, and webbing everywhere and the visitor is saying "It's not as bad
as it looks." By the way, it doesn't matter who's room your walking into, if you open
the door and there's webs and eggs everywhere and it looks like some
giant insects den you say "opps, sorry wrong room" close the door and
run.Acting was not brilliant, dialogue was just okay but for some reason
this has been the best horror I have seen in a long, long time and I
need to give it 10 out 10 and I have no idea why.
