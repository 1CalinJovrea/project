A great examination of extremism verses conformity!

'CAPTAIN FANTASTIC': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)



Indie drama flick; about a family, that has lived in isolation in the 

Pacific Northwest forests (for a decade), that's forced to reenter 

society when tragedy strikes. It was written and directed by actor, 

turned filmmaker, Matt Ross. The film stars Viggo Mortensen; and it 

features small supporting turns from Frank Langella, Steve Zahn, 

Kathryn Hahn and Ann Dowd. It's been a small hit at the indie theaters, 

and it's also received mostly positive reviews from critics, and fans 

alike. I went into the movie knowing very little about it (having not 

seen a single trailer), and I really enjoyed it.



Ben and Leslie Cash (Mortensen and Trin Miller) had been living 'off 

the grid', in the Washington state mountains with their six children, 

for close to ten years. They taught their kids very strict survival 

skills, as well as the benefits of a socialist society. When Leslie 

suffers from severe bipolar disorder, and kills herself because of it, 

Ben decides to take his family to her funeral, in New Mexico, despite 

Leslie's father (Langella) strongly discouraging him against it. The 

family's new experiences, in the conventional world, challenges all of 

their staunch views on life (especially Ben's). 



The movie is a great examination of extremism verses conformity; it 

does a very fair job of weighing the pros and cons of each. It's also 

an excellent character study, that's filled with involving 

performances; especially from Viggo, but the child actors are all good 

as well. It's equally funny, heart breaking and thought provoking. It's 

definitely a film that will leave a lasting impression on me, and I 

wouldn't mind revisiting it, at some point in the future. I look 

forward to seeing more from Matt Ross.
