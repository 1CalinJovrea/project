Still Disappointing

Of course we all know that Disney has become a master of delivering a
formula and we expect it, but this one is one of the worse
clich√©-ridden deliveries by Disney.I also did not realize it is a musical as I do not enjoy the voice or
the music. I am just not a fan. You may be.Finally, The Rock should go the way of Adam Sandler and Jeff Goldblum
and be considered a straight-to-video no-talent. Frankly, I only
watched this because I used to do a girl named Moana at work, but
otherwise even my kid thought the film was boring. Disney needs a new
shtick because Star Wars is out of ideas and Marvel has already begun
to wear down its audience.
