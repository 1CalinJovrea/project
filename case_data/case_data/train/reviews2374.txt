Weak plot and boring!

There were so many problems with the film that I felt let down. I feel
that Casino Royale was the best film to date; Skyfall was just a
disappointment.The first 10 minutes or so were great, Bond's on a mission and there
are some memorable scenes (digger coupling the trains), but there are
major plot-holes. When Bond is fighting on top of the train for the
hard- drive, Eve says that she has a shot. Bond can hear the whole conversation between Eve and M, so why doesn't
he get out of the way (or at least co-operate to provide an easy
shot)?! M mentions that the choice was either possible success (taking
the shot) or guaranteed failure (leaving Bond to fight). You'd have
more chance with a TOP MI6 AGENT than a risky shot.I must be missing something, because QOS shows Bond finishing his FIRST
assignment, where Skyfall shows him to be old, out of shape, and at the
end of his career; there's a MASSIVE gap between the two films. It's
almost as if the last two films and the reboot have been ignored.The Aston Martin from Goldfinger, Q's mentioning of the exploding pen
(Goldeneye), and the appearance of Q (In the previous two films, Bond
has not met Q) seem to make it clear that CR and QOS have been
forgotten, and so Skyfall was used purely for a "50 year special",
looking back at the previous bonds.When Bond leaves a trail leading to his house, why on earth wouldn't he
call back up to meet him there? If you have the Head of MI6 under
protection, you would need some actual protection - the plot makes no
sense!Why did Silva want to get captured? He just escapes! If he wanted to
kill M, he could have done that with the explosion in her office (with
a delay), so what purpose did his capture possess? None!Overall, I was disappointment with Skyfall; possibly the worst Bond
film to date. I expect more from Bond, and I hope that the next film
forgets Skyfall!
