Biggest disappointment since Phantom Menace

I liked the first, I loved the second, I thought the extended trailer
was silly (shoot down high-tech planes with a bow, also called
Mockingjay Part 1), but then I was in for an ice cold shower. I haven't
felt like this since listening to Jar Jar Binks.The first two Hunger Games movies prepare you for an epic battle
between the rebels of District 13 against the Capitol, which could just
as well be the Empire of Star Wars, led by an equally cunning
president/emperor.However, instead of using all the lore that has been carefully built
up, especially in Mockingjay Part 1, the producers/writer decided to
keep the main cast as far away from action as possible. The heroes
suddenly become actors instead of the warriors they had been in the
previous movies. Everything is fake and nothing they do (or not do) is
supposed to affect the story. On purpose! I have no idea what happened
here. Did the writer die and someone else had to finish it? Did they
outsource the production to a galaxy far, far away from the first two
movies? I simply cannot believe that this was an accident. There has to
be purpose to this letdown and I wish I knew what it is, but either
way, Mockingjay Part 2 is the biggest disappointment since The Phantom
Menace.
