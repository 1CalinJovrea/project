Lucy took the drugs, Luc Besson got high...

Obviously the main purpose of Luc Besson with this was initially to
please the audience. The poor scared girl who takes revenge on the bad
guys that hurt her. But with the ridiculous premise "what can we do if
we acquire the 100% of functionality of our brain" the movie tries to
be philosophical and ...fails miserably. What is the meaning of life?
The purpose of humans?The problem is that Luc Besson's brain isn't capable to provide such
answers.When Lucy's brain is at 20% she's starting to control ...tv signals!
It's obvious that the writer will hit a wall by his own brain
limitations. At 30-40% she has telepathic and telekinetic powers. Later
she travels back in...time, and the way she controls it is with...swipe
move as in a smartphone! What else is there? The writer couldn't think
of anything else! I am everywhere! It's now a clich√© since Edgar in "electric dreams".
Johnny Depp has done it too! Well good for you.
