The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen

I was actually holding on to keep watching this movie in theater. I
should have left it in the middle. It was a waste of 2hr. The movie was
SOOOOOO slow. The audio was terrible. The Video was also terrible, all
dark and cant see anything. The story was predictable and not
interesting at all except the last scene. And to be honest it wasn't a
shocker since they have showed a man at the beginning and then we all
were waiting him to appear somewhere. It is waste of your money, time
and space in your brain. I am a huge fan of HP but I am kinda
disappointed. They shouldn't make more of this movie. Its quite waste
of resources.
