Over rated nonsense

I cannot understand some of the other reviews on here for this film.The front cover describes the film as 'a shot of adrenaline from start
to finish'. I can only assume the author of that quote has never been
excited in their life.The film was slow paced, the characters unrelatable and unlikeable, the
action scenes felt like they been shot in someone's bedroom with sound
effects to match, the claimed 'gore and violence' was pretty tame and
there was little or no tension.The idea that this was some kind of Carpenter-esque thriller couldn't
be further from the truth. The bad guys would repeatedly send in 1 or 2
people at a time that meant there wasn't really a sense of real peril
or terror.Mark Kermode said this was worth checking out but his stock has
certainly dipped now. It just really felt like the kind of film put
together by some pretentious chin rubbers who think they know what
tension and violence is but ultimately don't have a clue.The kind of people that would look down their nose at other more
mainstream films yet think their poorly constructed and uninvolving
movie was the height of art and edge of the seat excitement.Believe me you'll get more reward stumbling upon a gem on Netflix than
making the same mistake I did and buying this.Utterly woeful.
