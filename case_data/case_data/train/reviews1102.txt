Great way to destroy a decent film series.

I actually enjoyed the first two films as they were thrilling and there
were some parts that I found intense. The first based around a family
under attack by two types of people, in there own home. Then the second
is based around a man who wants revenge for his sons death but gets
tangled up in other situations, which I found made it a fairly decent
film.Then there is this third addition the the set The Purge: Election Year,
it was firstly so predictable on what was going to be the overall
ending to the film. Woman goes against the purge, rich guy who profits
from the purge doesn't like that. Rich man get mercenaries to catch
her, they fail cause of the bodyguard and then s**t happens and the
woman survives it all. Whooow totally not enjoyable. I would say it is
clich√©d. Too many films have the same standard plot. Someone is wanted
dead "the bad guys" try kill them and in the end they fail and "the
good guys win". Yeah not all films are like that but most are and its
boring.I personally found the film the best way to end The Purge. I want The
Purge to go on. I like the films they were something to watch. I wanted
Sen. Charlie Roan or Minister Edwidge Owens to be killed so that the
ending had a twist to it and wasn't predictable. But the film has been
made so nothing I saw will be taken into account.
