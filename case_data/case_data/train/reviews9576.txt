One Of Woody Allen's Best Films

Cate Blanchett gives her best acting performance of all time. Her
character changes dramatically every scene. There will be nominations
in the future for CB - in my opinion. Woody Allen punk-ed himself with
the French nanny angle. Andrew Dice Clay was spectacular. Sally Hawkins
stole many scenes in this movie. This movie was a commentary on the gluttony of Wall Street &
Finance...on many levels. It also pointed out the desperation of people suffering from mental
health issues. I recommend seeing Blue Jasmine. You will not be disappointed.
