Loved it! It's a hit.

Absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Usually I'm not too crazy
about Tarantino's movies, but this one is definitely the best one I've
seen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overall
experience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was
a bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie
(it's a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very
beginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid
to miss something. I'm usually very particular about the movies,
nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5.
Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I've done some more research
on it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this
film!
