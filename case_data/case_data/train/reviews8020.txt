A real Halloween treat

Book of life is one of the most colorful and original set designs I
have every seen in an animated movie, especially in that is CGI
animation.This movie toke a real surrealistic style to the character design in
order to pay homage to Mexican culture.It's a classic fairy tale being told in a story within a story manner,
with a museum tour guide telling a group of kids a fairy tale of three
children who lives will effect the center of the universe, aka Mexico,
when Gods gamble on what type of people they would be as adults.Although as a semi-musical, the Glee approach in mixing in original
content with contemporary hits kind of lessened the originality of the
flick, but as a whole the movie was quite entertaining.
