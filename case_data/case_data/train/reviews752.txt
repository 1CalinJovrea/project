Avoid, avoid, avoid!!

I don't think many people liked the original Grown Ups but I genuinely
thought it was quite funny. We looked forward to watching the follow up
but oh my God, how wrong we were! This follow up is truly awful and I
barely made it through it without turning it off. The jokes are
terrible, like they were written by primary school kids in the school
playground. The whole film is so immature its unreal (and that's coming
from someone who like The Ringer!). They have lost their way soooooooo
badly with this film and I hope to God they never make a 3rd one if it
follows in the footsteps of this one! And the worst thing is that they
had a reasonable setting after the first film and with some good actors
but they just ruined it..
