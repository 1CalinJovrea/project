my iq is 137

and i didn't understand most of this film. is this a sequel? of what?
who is who and what do they want? why steal a car and kill people when
you are a billionaire and can just buy it? stupid fake action and race
scenes, meaningless sentences and very, very stupid criminals. I hoped
that Ana would save the day, but after watching this garbage i could
only thin: "Should i watch the new BladeRunner?"
