The secret of disgrace and stupidity, "Monalisa by numbers"

The only sensible reason to watch this pathetic disaster is for the
students of cinema, cinematography and everything related, and analysts
(professional and amateurs) as a study. It is not first neither last
time Hollywood butchered great script and created mockery of art. "Abre
los ojos" and "Vanilla sky", "Solaris" (though if you never seen the
Tarkowsky's original it may appear as not so bad) now the Campanella
masterpiece. I can see his name in the credits, wow, is his financial
situation so bad ? Was Juan Jose really part of this remake ? If so
than this is sad indeed. There is no tension, no suspense and sorry to
say it made me realise even more how outstanding was Soledad Villamil
and Ricardo Darin. Shame that the non Spanish speaking world may never
enjoy their outstanding films. Darin is probably one of the greatest
actors of our times. What they created in the original film was
amazing. "El secreto de sus ojos" was a revelation to me, watched it
several times and after that all the films of Juan Jose Campanella and
of Ricardo Darin, that film opened to me the fascinating world of
Argentinian cinema. This thing, reminds me of old recipe from the pop
music world "simplify then exaggerate". Another Hollywood fail
