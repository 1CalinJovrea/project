Dull, predictable, the most pointless ghosts I've ever seen

What a disappointing movie. It starts promising - a few motives,
characters, conflicts, sumptuous period detail (if all a little "clean"
and theatrical if you know what I mean - everyone with perfect teeth
and makeup and speaking like a thoughtful scriptwriter). Then gradually
you realise that everything that is glaringly obvious and predictable
IS actually what is happening - and its a long, painful process
watching it play out just as you expect it to. There's nothing to make
you go "ah! That's interesting!" whatsoever. The ghosts look incredibly
CGI and therefore not scary at all, but more to the point they had
absolutely no point or function - clearly just shoehorned in (perhaps
after the original draft?) as a way to make it "horror" and more
marketable to the teenage market. Jessica Chastain is always watchable,
and the film looks pretty colourful, but that's about it.
