A masterful tale of inspiration, set against a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation

An unknown title, by an unknown director, starring an unknown lead,
what does that form? Only one of the best damn dramas of this century
to date. Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused
drama is an incredibly complex character study that has newcomer Miles
Teller and veteran J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this
brilliant effort, 'Whiplash' is arguably the most riveting and
sensational drama from 2014.J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at
as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal
portrayal. From his profanity-clad embodiment of evil to the
ever-hopeful light at the end of the film, we go through stages of
loving, hating and even fearing him, a character who despite his
occasional moments of sympathy, cares solely about the outcome of his
orchestra, and shuns away anyone who tries to destroy that. Simmons's
performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement,
and one of the most Oscar-deserving performances of recent years.The gold and black colour palette, fast-paced editing, fluent and
claustrophobic cinematography - every single component adds a fresh
face to 21st century cinema and independent films as a whole, further
supporting my conclusion that indie films have overtaken blockbusters
for the provision of unique visions and entertainment. Chazelle's
effort pays off as he creates not only one of the greatest villains of
the 21st century in the form of Fletcher, but also one of the greatest
movies of the 21st century, if not of all time, through which he
rekindled the dying flame that is jazz.The fusion of emotions throughout make this a film that thrusts the
audience into a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation, thus
ensuing a tale of inspiration, a man and his dreams of becoming a
"somebody", and to conclude, let's just note that final drum solo and
sense of rebellion Andrew feels, it is utter gold, truly perfect. This
movie is powerful, it is intense, it is unique, it is a stunning
masterpiece!
