Ouch! Please stop hiring Skip Woods...

It takes a lot for me to crap on a movie. Knowing what it takes and the
work involved, I try hard to overlook certain things that aren't
important in bringing a movie down.But then you have something like Sabotage, that has been delivered from
the mind and pen of a certain Skip Woods. And then you question how
such a person can sell scripts to Hollywood!Looking back at his writers filmography, I can honestly say I haven't
enjoyed any of his work. They seem to get worse, so god only knows how
he keeps getting more...That said, I thought I would give Sabotage a go as a fan of Arnie.Holy hell what a waste of my life. Even at 20 minutes in, we are
subjected to some god awful acting, ridiculously poor script writing
which seems to be appealing to most trailer trash folk that like
shooting guns, an abundance of shaky cam nonsense, and hack job in
editing!Just a big old NO. Ridiculous. Stupid. Pointless. Wasted.
