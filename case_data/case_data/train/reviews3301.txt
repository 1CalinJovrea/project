Waste of time and money

That was one of the worst war movies I have ever seen. And I have seen
A LOT. Sincerely, I can't understand why Hollywood, that has proved
again and again that can create true masterpieces in the war movies
sector, continues from time to time to produce such unrealistic scum.The scene with the US tank in the final part of the movie, with the
elite, battle-hardened SS troops acting like brainless goblins in the
LOTR and Hobbit movies and are simply used like cannon fodder in order
to have Brad Pit and his crew appear like a combination of Rambo,
Superman and Aragorn is one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever
watched in the cinema. Jesus, are there still people in the US that feel some kind of national
pride in watching movies where their soldiers act like almost
invincible superheroes and their enemies like the legionnaires in the
Asterix movies? Apart from pathetic sight, I believe such movies are an
insult for the (true) heroic sacrifices the men of the US Army made
during World War II in order to make the Nazis kneel. Kind of hard to
imagine another reason for which Hollywood continues to produce such
bullshit from time to time. A great disappointment, if you are a fan of
war movies, DEFINITELY stay away. As for the rest, there are far more
entertaining ways to spend two hours from your life.
