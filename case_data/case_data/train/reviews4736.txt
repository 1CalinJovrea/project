This film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be

I wanna start this off by saying I did not enjoy the first movie. This
was probably due to wrongful marketing. Like many hopeful ladies I was
expecting a comedy with playful strip routines and hot men and was
served up something sad and serious.For the sequel it was pretty much the same except this film wasn't sad,
it was boring. For a film about "A group of male strippers going to a
stripper's convention" this film has very little stripping in it. In
stead it's filled with dialogue that is hard to follow and seems
completely unnecessary. The first stripping happens like 40 minutes
into the movie and it doesn't get better.If you were hoping for Pitch Perfect with male strippers you will be
disappointed. There are no elaborately choreographed synchronized strip
performances in this film. They do mostly solo performances where they
manhandle their female clients in a way that made me as an audience
member very uncomfortable. Overall I'm not sure what the target audience for this film is and I
don't think the filmmakers know either, though I'm sorry to say this.
