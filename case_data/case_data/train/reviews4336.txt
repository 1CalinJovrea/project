Why was this made?

Okay this movie sucks so so very much... two scenes stolen entirely
from other movies... and a script that makes absolutely no sense on any
level...Right now I'm finding it kind of stupid that there's this frail pretty
girl working around the criminally insane with no security around her,
it's completely out of control and unrealistic right off the bat. I
don't think the criminally insane would have such open access to
cigarettes and things that could be used as weapons... it's really
taking me out of the movie right now.Poorly written characters, script, damn... I was really hoping this
would be good. rofl OK OK this movie just made the biggest movie making mistake you
can make... holy crap... so a girl is running, gets her leg caught in a
bear trap... she doesn't even scream, she just looks back like... hey
why can't I run anymore? The original is genius... especially when he comes out in the morning
light at the end, when she thinks she's safe, cos it's daytime... that
was such a profound moment for horror, maybe the first time horror said
no, daytime does not mean safe anymore.... brilliant...
