A good romantic movie

As a fan of the original book "Where Rainbows End", I had been kind of
disappointed when people told me that there are many differences
between the novel and its adaption on the big screen. However, I
changed my prejudice when I finally saw it myself. The movie is
romantic, with beautiful-filmed scenes (I love the color throughout the
whole movie), and moving. The music sounds good (gotta buy the
soundtrack!) too. And I love Lily and Sam Claflin as Rosie and Alex, as
you can really feel the chemistry between them from the very first
minutes of the film. Perfect casting :) I don't care about how unreal
the plot is. It just feels good watching a slice-of-life movie like
this once in a while.
