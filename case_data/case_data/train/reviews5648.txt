A Entertaining Movie with Spunk and Blood

I too walked into the movie thinking it was some sort of twilight based
movie. However, I enjoyed the overall film for its outlandish humor and
lead actress. Some parts where a bit shocking but nothing too far from
crossing over a certain line. I have never read a single book of this series; although the movie does
a wonderful job explain exactly what is going on and who everyone is.
Vampire academy from times gave us teen angst and did over sexual most
of its cast in some scenes. So if they are planning a sequel please
don't shove sex right in our faces. It thought it was a movie that had
potential to be a bit darker than just being only surrounded by high
school problems. But the whimsically teen side didn't keep this movie
from the mild gore. I would rate this movie an 7/10. Would I watch if
there was a sequel? The answer is yes because this first movie attempt
wasn't as big of a letdown as I had anticipated. The next movies if any
have the possibility to break away from the usual "Teen Drama" and not
hold back on the blood and guts. If this franchise doesn't want to be compared to twilight I suggest you
not make it the usual storyline. Girl and two guys, the two guys want
her, she is mortal and they are supernatural, not blood all glitter. So
overall this movie had wit, spunky humor, mild gore, provocative
scenes, high school drama, and fangs. An overall good recipe so far for
the freshman vampire movie, word to the wise for the sequels if any,
just step it up and leave us wanting more.
