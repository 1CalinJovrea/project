Hollywood trash at it's best

What is wrong with the critics these days? Either they've been paid
well enough to keep their mouths shut of how lame this film is or they
are just a bunch of quacks. Honestly, I can't imagine how deceiving
Hollywood has become with flashy trailers. There's nothing there in the story. As you guessed from the trailer,
it's about a guy who is hit-man who kills random people(who are masked)
for money. So these random people are from the future apparently as
disposing bodies become impossible in the future, the criminals
transport these random folks from 2072 to 2042 where this guy kills
them and cremates them. The guys who kill these randoms are called
Loopers. And then there comes a time when his company wants to shut
down and wants to terminate all the loopers. So this is where he meets
his future self(older self) and has to kill. Of course he doesn't kill
him because the future self knows every move he could think of. Finally
after 118minutes of nonsense, this guy finally realizes, " oh wait, I
could just kill myself and the future self dies with me ". With a poor storyline such as this one, there was no way in hell the
producers would have agreed to invest, so the writers create a few more
characters, ( such as a 2year old kid and her mommy to prolong the
movie with some emotion/drama) some telekinesis disease(it's like HIV
of the 2040s) and more bla bla bla. This was the time I felt like walking out of the theatre if I hadn't
paid $16. Absolute rubbish.
