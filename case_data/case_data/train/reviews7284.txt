Subtle, beautiful

I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully
framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through
looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while
falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of
themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and
waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the
leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured
husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with
him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way.
Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even
felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really
beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while
I reflected on it. That's how I judge a movie. If you are the type that
loves character driven films, I'd very much recommend it. If you don't
handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you.
