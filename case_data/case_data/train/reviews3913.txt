about pain and other drugs

this film is a masterpiece. not only because the casting/the
performance and the directing are stunning. it's more than eye can
see/words can say. and definitely, it's not for judges. and not for
everybody. just a 'niche'. it is touching and comprehensible and human
and not "generaly". doing "what's good/normal/suitable" versus "the
feeling, the pure one/the moment in a short human life/ the truth".
it's about age? that age that touch, maybe, the body but not the
spirit. it's about the capacity of giving/loving without hope, without
counting...it's about the pain. somehow, loving without a future is like living well knowing that death
waits at the corner. painful enough. as life itself.I saw gentleness, delicacy, loyalty, generosity and suffering,
friendship and generosity again and human fail. and pain. who's fault
it is?don't know the answer. know only that friendship, love, loyalty and
pain, they do exists. tough destiny, after all.Not enough words to considerate the performance of Robin Wright, Naomi
Watts, Xavier Samuel and James Frecheville. Oscars were won for less.As for the director, such a softness of the regard...perfect
screenplay, perfect director cut. much deeper then the words of Doris
Lessing, far away of "current diagnostics".
