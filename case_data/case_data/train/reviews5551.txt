Incredibly fake nonsense

From the first scene, wherein a grown man crawls in the bushes to see
his ex-wife have sex with the blinds open, and his old dog barks at him
through the window, and then miraculously appears outside on the lawn
and chases him down the street without reason, viewers are "stuck" with
a movie so unreal each scene reeks of incongruity with the strength of
a dead skunk. This is the kind of movie where teens rip bongs on their
roofs, talk casually about sex and suicide with their parents, and make
out with obviously 28-year-old dudes in their high school hallway. And
of course things GET SERIOUS later on, as if anyone could possibly sit
through the duration without considering a post to ripoff report for
wasting everyone's time and money. Perchance if I were Shanghai-ed at
sea for weeks on end, I would not finish this movie due to the fact
that I would prefer to focus on my own nausea and stare at a puddle of
my own vomit.
