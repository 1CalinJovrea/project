Adorable Tale of Loyalty and Friendship

In New Holland, the boy Victor Frankenstien is a bright but outcast
student without any friend but his dog Sparky. When the newcomer
science teacher Mr. Rzykruski challenges the students to participate in
the science fair, Victor's father forces him to play baseball otherwise
he would not sign the necessary authorization for his son.During the game, Sparky chases the ball and is hit by a car. Victor
recalls Mr. Rzykruski's class about the effects of electricity and
successfully resuscitates Sparky using lightning. Victor hides Sparky
in the attic but the weird Edgar sees the dog on the garden and
blackmails Victor to learn how to bring the dead to life. Edgar does
not keep the secret and soon Victor's envious schoolmates revive
several creatures to win the science fair contest. When the town is
invaded by the monsters, Victor and Sparky are the last chance to
rescue the girl Elsa van Helsing from the claws of Mr. Whiskers."Frankenweenie" is another stop-motion animation by Tim Burton in black
and white with a great tribute to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein with a
happy ending. The story is actually an adorable tale of loyalty and
friendship and it is delightful to see the frolic of Sparky. My vote is
eight.Title (Brazil): "Frankenweenie"
