Ron Woodroff VS FDA

Dallas Buyers Club is a compelling and stunning watch. The films main
plot has to with the world of AIDS and HIV in the 80s. Ron Woodroff
gets infected with HIV, and is told he has 30 days to live, he then
takes things into his own hands and goes to Mexico. In Mexico he gets
introduced to new drugs that help with HIV and AIDS but they are not
FDA approved. Here starts the battle of Woodroff VS the FDA. He starts
his own club where he treats people with AIDS and HIV, thats the main
plot. Acting wise Matthew Mconganuey gives his career best performance,
he lost almost 100 pounds for his role, and he stuns with such a mature
and spellbinding performance. But Jared Leto steals the show, he
touches new heights with DBC, his performance is award worthy. The
films minuses are the slow pace and excessive length.Overall this film
is path breaking because the subject of AIDS has not been talked about
much in films, its a must watch for all cinema lovers.
