Disappears from your mind as soon as it's over

I really love the first "Now You See Me," like, a lot. It's just a
really light, breezy, nonstop fun movie, and it knows it. And the
trailer for this movie looked like it would be more of the same, which
I was completely fine with. Unfortunately, the trailer is infinitely
better than the actual film.Honestly, this movie was embarrassing to watch. From the childishly
annoying character that Lizzy Caplan plays, to the horrendously unfunny
identical twin that Woody Harrelson plays, I was cringing in my seat
and praying for deliverance. Now, one could argue that Lizzy Caplan's
character was intentionally annoying, and that Woody Harrelson's twin
character was intentionally unfunny, and while I would agree with that,
it still didn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience, especially
when these two characters had a significant amount of screen time.I can't deny that "Now You See Me 2" did have some very entertaining
sequences, with one particular scene involving an elaborate card trick
being the definite highlight of the film. However, these few scenes
couldn't save this forgettable mess of a film. I mean honestly, I'm
having a hard time writing this review because I can't even remember
what I disliked about this movie. It's just a completely forgettable
film in every way that will leave your mind as soon as the credits
start.Huh, come to think of it, maybe this film did do something right after
all: it disappears completely, just like a real magician would.
