A Funny Reunion!

The fourth installment in the American Pie theatrical series, 'American
Reunion' is indeed A Funny Reunion! High on laughs & gags, this 2012
Box-Office Blockbuster is surely worth watching!'American Reunion' Synopsis: Jim, Michelle, Stifler, and their friends
reunite in East Great Falls, Michigan for their high school reunion.'American Reunion' begins & ends, smoothly. Its got the attitude, the
rudeness & the vulgarity, the American Pie movies are known for. Even
the clever one-liners are damn good. Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg's
Screenplay is adult-rated & hard-core. Their Direction, on the
other-hand, is decent.Performance-Wise: Seann William Scott is awesome. Once again, he steals
the show! Jason Biggs is very much in the mood, while Chris Klein,
Eddie Kaye Thomas & Thomas Ian Nicholas are wild. Alyson Hannigan, Tara
Reid & Mena Suvari are efficient. Eugene Levy is fantastic. On the whole, 'American Reunion' is certainly a delight.
