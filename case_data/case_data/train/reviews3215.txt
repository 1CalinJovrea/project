So much talent, So little result

Beth (Rebecca Hall) is stripping in private homes to make ends meet. On
the advise of motel neighbor Holly (Laura Prepon), she goes to work for
bookie Dink (Bruce Willis) and finds that she's actually quite good at
it. She's good with numbers. People like dealing with her on the phone.
And Dink likes her a lot. The problem is Dink's wife Tulip (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) doesn't want him to like her so much. When Dink starts to
lose money, things blow up.When you consider the talents in front of and behind the camera, it's a
wonder how things could go so wrong. Award winning director Stephen
Frears is the biggest culprit. The script may need better jokes, but
it's mainly Frears who couldn't extract any laughs from this. In the
end, this is mostly his responsibility.Rebecca Hall is doing a squeaky-voice fast-talking bobble head doll.
It's completely fake, and leaves my head shaking. It doesn't fit her at
all. If her mannerisms are meant to be funny, it got no laughs from me.
Everybody else is doing a competent if not very impressive work.
Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bruce Willis could have been an explosive
couple but they're not. The only interesting acting comes from Vince
Vaughn who plays a wildman bookie.Not much goes right in this movie. It is absolutely not funny. It is
watchable, but afterward I wonder why I watched it.
