A lovely comedy drama

Greetings from Lithuania."Big Eyes" (2014) is more of good feel comedy drama then a serious
biography drama as it's genre indicates. Yes, it is based on a very
true story, but this is not a typical biopic by any means. It's a
"light" and easy movie, with some great performances by both leads,
tight pacing, very nice writing and directing. No wonder that it was
mentioned in an Comedy or Musical categories at Golden Globes and not
in motion picture drama.Overall, this is true very well made biography drama about some
painters and frauds. Won't going to spoil anything, just going to say
that i was very surprised by the ending when i find out that this
actually happen, well, probably not word by word but the outcome did
happen actually how it was portrait in the movie. This is a very fine
picture from legendary director Tim Burton, and safe to say that this
is his best movie in years simply by not being "a Tim Burton's" movie
as we know them. This small budget picture (in terms of other's
T.Burton's flicks) actually is much more lovely and intimate then his
recent works. I will go even so far and say that i haven't enjoy his
movie so much since 1999's "Sleepy Hollow".
