I'm sorry, but this movie is complete garbage!

I was looking very much forward to it, since I'm a fan of the original
(nostalgia based). 15 minutes into the movie I just knew it was going
to be bad.Made by the same director that made the movie 2012, it has the same
terrible drama and completely transparent storyline. I'm not even sure
if there even is a storyline to this movie.The worst part, aside from all the crying scenes based upon long
distance relationships, unresolved father issues and what not, was in
fact that the aliens are more primitive than us.You would think that a race with such insane technology have evolved
beyond petty and shortsighted impulse driven emotions. It's when you
realize that the Queen of the aliens suddenly gets a personal vendetta
against a yellow school bus while fighter planes are bombarding her,
that the manuscript was written in half an hour in a coffee shop.I really went into this with open eyes and was completely set for
loving it, but no. The movie is just pure garbage. I'm sorry...
