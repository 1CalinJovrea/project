Awful Garbage Trash of a Movie

I cannot remember the last time that I got up and walked out of the
movie theater but it's been decades. Well, that's exactly what I did
today after stomaching about 45 minutes of this very poorly written,
poorly directed, slow story of despair, desperation, and misery.I also can't believe people are actually giving this trash of a movie
good reviews.It was depressing from the start, but I gave the movie a chance because
I wanted to believe they were going somewhere with the story. I was
right, they were going somewhere with the story all right. It's a gay love story that seemed to have no purpose or meaning other
than someone wanting to make a movie about a dysfunctional, drug
addicted "mother/son relationship and how he grew up bullied and
confused about his life and sexuality.Both thumbs down. Horrible waste of time and money. First time I ever
asked the theater management for my money back. Booooooo!!
