Among the worst movies of the year

Plain and simple the movie is awful. I painfully watched it over 2 days
as my wife wanted to see it. The cinematography is all over the place
and the movie is like watching a cartoon with living characters. To add
insult to injury they added Rap music to a movie that takes place in
the 1920s. I think the producers were on drugs when they release this
piece of garbage. If you are among the twenty somethings that liked
Moulin Rouge, or enjoy the annoying Quentin Tarantino movies you may
like this. If you enjoy good movies this is not for you. Put it like
this, watching the laundry turn in a dryer is more interesting than
this movie, and the acting is just as good.
