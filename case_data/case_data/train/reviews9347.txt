Would have been great... if it was an hour shorter!

I think I know my issue with Judd Apatow's movies.They're always overdrawn. I think Apatow is a true Auteur, and has
intelligent, stylish ways of telling a story.Like almost all his flicks, this movie has laughs, heart and drama....
A LOT of drama.Apatow should either write, or direct his movies, not both. I have a
feeling if someone else took the directors chair/ producers chair, the
movie would be significantly shorter.I don't mind drama in movies, but when the extra hour of the movie is
filled up with only drama, then I become irritated.This is a movie you should rent/watch on Netflix. The writing and
direction are both good, but you need to pace yourself, take breaks,
come back later after getting some air, because 2.5 hours is to long
for a movie like this.This is all my opinion of course, so take it or leave it. Regardless of anything, enjoy your night out at the movies, you earned
it!
