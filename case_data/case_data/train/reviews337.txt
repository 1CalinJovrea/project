Not as good as it's rating - still good

NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! Honest opinionThis is the first time I've ever reviewed on IMDb, but this movies
rating is very in just. When the movie started, the first vibe went straight to Fargo, another
great movie. As it progresses, slowly steady you get as sense of what's
going on. The storytelling is solid, and the acting is only as good as
the script and the plot allows it to be, and if you have those in mind
the acting was on point. The reason for the title and this review is
that the plot is, and I have to emphasize it, VERY MEDIOCRE.I get the intentions of the movie, but I think for it to bear as little
plot, and as slow moving plot as it does, the characters need to be
written stronger, which they were not. I especially felt that Jeremy
Renners character and backstory could have been more impact full if the
script had given Jeremy a chance to explore the character some more. I
never say this ever, but maybe if they had added 15minutes of run time
for character exploration, it might had been a 9/10 from me. I didn't
come for action driven movie, I actually like character heavy movies,
but the script was just very mediocre.Anyways, if you're into a slow moving, well directed, acted and
perfectly scored movie you should go watch this movie.
