More of Frank Miller's tales brought to life.

I saw this film last night and I was not disappointed. Being a fan of
the first film I went in with high hopes for this film (as most people
did after watching the first) and it tells some other Frank Miller
stories well.If you enjoyed the violence, great dialogue and overall aesthetic of
the first one you'll love this film. One of the only parts that really bothered me was the recasting of
Dwight which threw me off slightly as I wasn't expecting it. It also
gets slightly confusing at times because some stories are set in the
present and some in the past which can be hard to keep up with, but if
you are paying attention properly you get the grasp of it after a bit. However overall I loved the film's over the top nature and comic book
style and if you enjoyed the first one then you'll enjoy this one.
