(I don't think I actually reveal a spoiler, but just in case)Highly gripping and something about the 70s visuals as incredibly real
looking (I imagine).I have a number of qualms with it, most notably the study leader. An
issue others point out. As well as a lack of development or explanation
on the guards, especially the 'quiet' ones.Perhaps some of it was due to the 60s just ending, or the selection of
the actual participants, but I can say without a doubt that I would
have acted very, very, very differently than those selected. For
various reasons (experience/knowledge of jail, law, individual rights),
mostly liability and that I've had the opportunity to be the only one
in large groups to not be brainwashed/convinced I'm wrong.That is really my biggest qualm, I find it very hard to imagine people
allowing themselves to be abused so easily and to not physically take
control of their lives over the captors. Guards/Warden, etc.I mean, it's 3 guys to a 'cell', which does not have anything besides a
cot. No water. No toilet. No tp, it seems. Something as simple as going
to the bathroom is not addressed until about 70% of the way through the
movie.Anyways, now to experience other media productions, and the real
footage!
