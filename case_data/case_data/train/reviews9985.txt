kinda cliché

You know those films where the hot guy is dating this super model type
of girl and out of nowhere he fell in love with Ms. Nobody? Well this
one is one of those films BUT I like the idea of where Bianca (Mae
Whitman) isn't the loner girl and doesn't go to parties just because
she rather stay at home and read Shakespeare's infamous Romeo and
Juliet. This film is somehow connected to the reality, to what actually
happen to some people around the globe or should I say to some "girls".
I know for a fact that there are these girls who wear baggy clothes and
always wear the same t shirt every 2 days and when they are being asked
"why are you wearing the same clothes everyday" she would respond with
"have you heard of washing machine before?" well Bianca is that kind of
girl because I could pretty much relate to her. I think after watching
this she has become one of my spirit animals, you know. She's just
funny and doesn't really make a big deal out of everything until
someone pointed it out to her which is I think no one could prevent
from really, You know when you're happy and contented someone will just
ruin it for you and you'll just think about it for the rest of your
life until one day you woke up and thought "only i could define
myself". Yeah I love this kinda cliché movie and highly recommend it to
my peers, ciao!
