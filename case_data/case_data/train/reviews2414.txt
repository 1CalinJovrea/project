You have already seen it and it was better the first time

I am a huge fan of Jason Sudeikis and I was confident that he would
choose material that was original so I decided to invest in this film
without researching it. What a disappointment. First of all, it is the
exact formulaic premise that we have all watched for the past 40 years.
You know the type..."I am in my 30's and life is so complex/Sex makes
everything so complicated/I just can't grow up/Nobody understands me".
Secondarily, in order to be plausible, you have to believe that Jason
Sudeikis can pull of being a womanizer. As I said, I am a huge fan but
I think it is too big of a stretch for him to pull that off. The actors
all did their jobs bringing mediocre material to almost watchable but
in the end, it's just another romantic comedy about a guy and girl who
love each other but aren't together for whatever implausible reason. I
am not sure how these mediocre scripts continue to get funded.
