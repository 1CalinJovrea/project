One of the best films of the year

There is a sense of nostalgia in the films of Paolo Sorrentino. The
nostalgia often comes across as a sense of regret for the loss of
innocent love experienced by the central characters during their youth.
Such a regret can easily fills one's heart with melancholy but
Sorrentino seems to have mastered the art of mixing gravity with
levity. His films can be both serious and farcical at the same time and
that's why they are more complex than what they prima facie appear.
Youthâ€¬ is no different.Here is a film about larger-than-life oldies pining for their long past
golden years of youth. We have a retired conductor (Michael Caine), a
self-indulgent filmmaker well past his prime (Harvey Keitel), an
insecure actor (Paul Dano), a mountaineer, a Miss Universe with brains,
and an overweight footballer (most probably based on Maradona). There
is a lively cameo from Jane Fonda who plays a legendary actress from
Hollywood and then there is Rachel Weisz who plays the conductor's
daughter.Among other things (which certainly include Sorrentino's brilliant
direction), it is the performances of Caine and Keitel that makes it a
treat to watch. While Keitel steals every scene that he is a part of,
Caine delivers a deeply nuanced performance around which the entire
movie revolves. Youth is nowhere near being Sorrentino's best but it is
certainly one of the best films of the year.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog "A Potpourri
