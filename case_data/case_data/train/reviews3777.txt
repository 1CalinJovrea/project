Inappropriate for kids. Painful waste of time for adults.

If you take a peek at the voting breakdown, half of all people who
voted for this gave it the lowest possible rating. Apparently I'm not
the only person who is just sickened by the massive marketing blitz.In short, this movie was a rather hellish experience to sit through. It
wasn't very funny, and the only part that made me gasp on cue was when
they brought out Alec Baldwin. The man truly scares me.Apparently Hollywood these days can't put out a film that isn't crude
and rude anymore, not even a kids film. Personally I found this film
offensive to women and the Arabic community. There were at least 2
scenes that I think they should never have put into this movie, both
involving loose toilet turds, and I cannot understand why they did or
why they even thought they would be funny. There were quite a few
scenes that were completely inappropriate for kids, especially one in
which Ted's "bear bottom" is shown several times.I found myself painfully enduring the movie while wishing that it would
hurry up and conclude.
