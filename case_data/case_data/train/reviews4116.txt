A faithful homage to a loved comedy group! Hilarious!

To go into this movie expecting the original stooges is ridiculous. The
Stooges are long gone. Go into this movie expecting a loving tribute to
the comedic powerhouse that was "The Three Stooges" and you will come
out totally satisfied. All three actors are faithful and accurate in
their imitation of the beloved characters. (I emphasize "IMITATION"
because no-one can ever truly replace or replicate the originals.) The
actors do a great job bringing the antics of the stooges into the
modern day and civilization, while still sticking to the classic roots
that made the stooges, "The Stooges". The director and everyone
involved in the production of this film are obviously huge fans for
working so hard to maintain the integrity of the franchise while
modernizing it as well. All in all, a fantastic homage to a classic
comedy routine.
