One of the worst horror movies I ever watched!

Wasted 1 hour 29 minutes of my life. No horror content. Misleading and
mismatched story. At one point she is afraid of the Babadook and at the
other she makes him her pet and feeds him! Ridiculous! Is Babadook even
a ghost? He got scared of the lady and ran for his life and kept hiding
in the store room in order to live by the mercy of the lady who
occasionally feeds him with worms. WTF!
