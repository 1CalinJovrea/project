Very good for its intended audience

This is not the sort of movie I would pay money to see, and probably
would skip it on TV or other media. I took a young guy with learning
difficulties to see this movie.Much to my surprise, I ended up enjoying it too! Usually I can take or
leave Adam Sandler, but I loved him in this role. Although the movie
doesn't have great appeal to adults, it certainly does have appeal for
its intended audience 12 - 15yr olds.I found it thoroughly entertaining, and the young man I took to see it
was very engaged.The humor was dry and good, and the visuals were very pleasing on the
eye. The storyline was totally ridiculous, but despite that, it worked
well! Normally I wouldn't bother rating or reviewing this type of
movie, but because I got a pleasant surprise, I thought I'd pass it on.It was entertaining and enjoyable - and that's all that matters! If the
theme of the movie appeals, then go and see it, if you aren't sure,
then watch it on your streaming choice on a miserable day - it will
cheer you up!!! It's a whole lot better than doing yard work!!!!
