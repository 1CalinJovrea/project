The good, the bad, and the worst...our modern Wizard of Oz

I will try to be simple:The good: Direction, original story, performance (especially the two
young actresses), FX. A real jewel, and not only without a glitch, but
with funny moments and action at every minute, or even, some of them,
very touching.The bad: ... It's supposed to need to write something? OK: nothing at
all.The worst: All the bad appreciation of critics which really have no
good taste for art. A lot of people does not understand that the movie
is not just about Tomorrowland, but about a journey inside the heart
and will of the people... and with this, as if that was a small
achievement, an odyssey.If you want to see a good exponent of the 7th art, don't hesitate to
see this movie. If not, just listen some critics. ;)Additional comments: Some people say the movie has technical failures,
but believe me, there are none, and the reason is because this movie
returns to the most pure essence of Sci-Fi. Maybe some people does not
liked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well
known message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to
promote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn't
diminish the quality of the movie. A little childish, OK, the movie was
intended for all the audience, and this is not a bad thing, in fact, is
an incredible and amazing way about how to show the essence of
something really beautiful. Finally, I see some comments about an
over-acted Britt Robertson, but if you have seen some of her works
before, maybe you can see that the little histrionism that she injected
in her character is very intentional, and then you will see the talent
of this great actress."In a world where values, commitment, common sense, courage, curiosity,
and thinking capacity are weakening, this movie is a beacon of hope for
children... and adults too".
