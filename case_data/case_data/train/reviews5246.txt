Spain rules

In the fifties,in Europa , France used to rule over the thriller.No
Longer so.Spain has been releasing great thrillers for almost two
decades now whereas my native land lost the good recipes a long time
ago.Why do I mention France?Because I think that ,much more than any
Hitchcock's masterpieces ,"El Cuerpo" reminds me of Henri-Georges
Clouzot's classic "Les Diaboliques" (1955),currently in IMDb top 250.A woman killed by diabolical lovers ,a woman whose body disappears and
thus might or might not be dead;the assassin's growing terror;the
wealthy wife's wickedness -Clouzot's characters are often pure evil-and
the murky atmosphere ,the morgue,the disturbing corridors of a police
station,the gruesome details;and like in Clouzot's (or Hitchcock's)
works,a firm screenplay which does not fall apart in the first
third,and grabs you till the final unexpected twist, as brilliant as
that of "Les Diaboliques" and which justifies the first pictures which
may puzzle the viewer.The hero is like a puppet- but who pulls the strings?- ,a brilliant
chemistry professor but a weak little boy under a matronly wife's
thumb.Her appearances in flashbacks (or in sequences in which the
husband is seeing things?) gives the jitters .Like in Clouzot's
film,the victim is more disturbing than his/her killers.A tense suspense which thrillers buffs must not miss!
