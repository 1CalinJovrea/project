Unexpected

Do not pay any attention to rating and description on IMDb, cause they
have nothing to do with reality. Although it uses well known horror
premise, this movie is completely different than what we are used to.
It last only 79 minutes and builds excellent atmosphere from the start,
and then maintains tension to the very end, end atypical for genre. In
my opinion, this is drama and thriller as much as it is horror. Story
is simple but vivid, characters are unusual but convincing, acting,
directing and camera are great, and music and sound effects are
perfectly fit. And it uses music by few of my favorite bands. I loved
it.8,5/10
