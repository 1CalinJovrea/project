9
Stunningly fun. Like playing a great video game without dying to get things just right.

I was definitely already a fan of the Biting Elbows music video that
gave rise, but was unprepared for the roller coaster of awesome that
doesn't let up for 90 minutes. I don't know if it was the 98 foot
Frank's FDX screen or just a more attached rig, but some of the action
was shaky and a little hard to follow, especially when Henry would get
moved or tossed around. Without a sense of motion, you can lose your
bearings. Being an avid FPS gamer will really help here. I'd recommend
not filling your vision to the periphery with the screen (like the
front 1/3rd point, where I sat) and choose a middle screen height
position, which will make it more like a computer monitor experience.
That said, I still found it easier to follow then the hand to hand
combat in the early Bourne films, and more enjoyable. The audio is a
blast with a good system, so don't wait until it gets to the crappy 30
seat theaters with the turned down speakers the megaplexes seem to tuck
away in unused corners. Sharlto Copley is extremely fun to watch in this film and did a great
job not being the same character in District 9, and Elysium, proving
far far from it (not a fan of Chappie, but he did well in that too).There are so many oo, ahh, wow, and shock moments in this film. I
really want to see a sequel and would definitely be happy to help fund
it if they go that route again. I think I will be seeing this again.tldr: if you grew up with or are a fan of FPS games, this movie is
amazingly fun.
