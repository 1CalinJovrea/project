Old School Actions But With Galgo Style Plot

Learning from the mistakes in The Expendables 2, the cast has reunited
in this sequel with a climax that really brings back or nearly close to
the old school action thriller just as in the original first film.
However, having the Galgo style of plot has dragged the entire film
into an unnecessary overlong of 2 hours. While the old cast still
brings a lot of fun and maintains the brother love across the trilogy,
the introduction of the young Expendables might seems a fresh strategy
to develop possible sequels but the poor performance, poor developed
screenplay and moderate quality of visual effects have ruined part of
the film. At least, it compensates audiences once again with amazing
scores from Brian Tyler which enhances the actions scenes but overall,
Barney's emotional feelings in this sequel seems to be similar to the
boring emotional Iron Man in Iron Man 2.
