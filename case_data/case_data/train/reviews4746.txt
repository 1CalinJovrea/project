Really decent action flick

Don't expect too much and take it for what it is - a high profile
summer action flick that's out there to bring you some light
entertainment and a bit of nostalgia. The story is simple and filled
with tropes but makes sense to a degree where you can buy it and focus
on the action sequences and one liners, which are pretty funny. I
especially liked that they went for classic action sequences, still
with lots of explosions and fight scenes but keeping it tidy enough to
not overload the audience - unlike other movies where action scenes
start to become just flickering images because they put so much in them
and so many dynamic camera movements that you almost start to feel
nauseous. Bottom line: If you like 2 hours of mindless entertainment to see the
action heroes of the past perform one more time then this is for you -
if you look for substance stay clear (but that should go without saying
since it's the third installment)
