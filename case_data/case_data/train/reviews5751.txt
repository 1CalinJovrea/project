I Invite You to Pass on You're Invitation

I have not written a review on here in quite sometime, but after
watching this film I felt the need to voice out a bit on some thoughts
I've had regarding it. First and foremost, I am a huge fan of how
horror films are being more legitimized in the last few years and look
forward to the merging of more art meaningful stories in creepy and
freak out narratives. So this is in no way written with a bias against
this genre of cinema, however, when I feel a film is being granted as
much praise as this one is and it isn't, in my opinion, quite deserving
of it... it's time for some criticism.The Invitation centers around a group of friends who have long since
gone their own ways, some due to a tragedy; others just life
happenings, meeting up for a reunion of sorts at the house of our main
Will and former wife Eden. Will brings his girlfriend Kira with him to
the gathering where said friends act all kinds of polite, while try to
reconnect and avoid addressing the elephant in the room. Will senses
something very off about his ex-wife's new man David and that elephant
begins to rear its head more and more as the film paves a path towards
it's climactic ending.Without giving too much away at this time, The Invitation is worth it
for about the last minute, if that is too much spoiler for you than I
apologize, but it almost feels like it is inviting you to a challenge
of sorts; a "how much of a slow burn can you tolerate" challenge. With
that being said, slow burn films can be amazing, especially in the
horror genre. Other horror films like The Witch, or artistic films like
Upstream Color, even Primer are perfect examples of low key slow burn
films that deliver on their concepts and stories. But The Invitation
just keep dragging you along for a ride that you know is going to go
south at some point, just at what point? This is so much so that
eventually you start thinking to yourself that whatever place it
arrives at cannot possibly satisfy enough due to how long it takes to
get there.**Potential spoilers** Further harm is done when the emotional pull of
the film, mostly regarding a tragic event in the former married life of
Will and Eden, is seemingly overshadowed and rendered practically moot
by the films third act. To some I guess it all can serve as a way to
bottom line the films theme of failure to cope with loss, but
everything that ultimately happens at this party will be a far worse
loss, with far worse memories gained for everyone involved. No one
wouldn't require a massive amount of therapy afterwards. **Actual spoilers** Also, David, again, that new boyfriend dude of
Eden, has never met any of these friends of hers beforehand. He is
sided with his own group of friends that also don't know anyone prior
to their meeting. Choosing their roles to be that of the outsiders
makes their involvement in the films big scene take everything to such
a clichéd old-school horror level that it bails completely on it's own
potential. What do I mean by this? How about it would've been so much
more gut-retching and gushing with emotion if this was friends against
friends with layered characters and multiple arcs. Histories and
agendas that have something to gain and lose from it all? It really
blows a chance at something revolutionary in horror cinema in favor of
a more accessible and clichéd final act all for the sake of sticking to
a much more grounded and less complicated set of themes. **end
spoilers**In closing, if you are okay with being dragged for a long ride that
pays off at the very very very very end, then by all means watch this
movie. It's not horrible, it just doesn't strike me as a film that
deserves a lot of the praise it is being given. You have better artsy
horror film choices out there in It Follows, The Conjuring, Beyond the
Black Rainbow, The Babadook, The Witch, even You're Next. Basically any
other well reviewed horror movie of the last few years was serve as a
better dish.
