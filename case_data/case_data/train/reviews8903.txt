Pure boredom

Note to self: be sure to check the default sort order for IMDb reviews.
I realize now that it was set to 'best' and combined with all the
glowing reviews and 8.5 stars I was going to enjoy my first night at
the movies since Christmas.So very wrong.I don't thank I'm revealing any spoilers, but just in case, i'll say it
now.The movie is about a linguist brought in to try and communicate with
aliens that have appeared around the globe. And that's it. You would
think that if she was successful there would be huge implications and
if she was not successful there would also be huge implications. In the
end, there were no implications - she wrote a book. And the book had no
impact on the world either. The end.This is why I'm such a happy Netflix customer. I can give the movie
half an hour to get going and when I realize that it's going to be a
stinker (aka Fury) I can stop it and move on to something else. In this
case, I was trapped in a sold out theatre. When it was done everyone
just quietly filed out. I'm pretty sure its because, like me they were
trying to figure out what the point was and how they got tricked into
watching it.I'll give it a star though for the music score.
