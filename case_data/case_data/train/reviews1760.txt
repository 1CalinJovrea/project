Blood & Gore No Substitute for Story & Suspense

This started out well, lost in the woods trying to get back to the
cabin and there is strange things lurking in the trees. Good initial
build up.But rapidly you realise the strange things lurking amongst the trees
are merely 'D' rate horror techniques and writers looking for ideas.You know a film is desperate when they just keep trying to make you
jump in the hope it will distract the audience from noticing the story
sucks. Don't waste your money 4/10
