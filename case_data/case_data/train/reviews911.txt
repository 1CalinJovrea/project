Nice Storyline and Great Special Effects

I really enjoyed the movie. I went into it without many expectations as
I was taking my 3 sons to see it (ages 5 to 11). I thought it would be
a kid's type of movie yet I found myself captivated by the story.It felt very much like Avatar in my opinion. The theater we went to
didn't have the special glasses that Avatar did so the quality wasn't
as good but the story was just as enjoyable.While Jack and the Princess acted well, I frankly did not think that
neither of them looked good enough. It always makes it tough for me to
watch a princess that is frankly not pretty.In my opinion the movie is worth the cost of watching in the theater in
3D. Exercise your judgment whether a child under 10 years old can handle
something that is a little scary. Humans do get eaten up by these
giants which is not for the faint of heart.
