Funny and Entertaining!

After seeing the previews, I had already been convinced that I wanted
to see This Means War - romantic comedy spy movie - right up my alley.
My hubby wasn't similarly convinced.After getting tickets to an advance screening, we both went - and ended
up pleasantly surprised. This Means War was funny, really funny -
Chelsea Handler was the hidden gem of the movie.The movie never took itself too seriously, which was refreshing - it
had a few heartfelt moments, but nothing too sappy. It stayed on the
side of comedy over romance, and wasn't overly predictable.There's certainly enough action to keep the guys interested, with
enough story to keep us gals entertained. And plenty of laughs for
everyone.
