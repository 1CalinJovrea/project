One of the most serious pacing problems ever...

... which ironically makes this film exceptionally difficult to review.Notes: 1. Needless to say, this reviewer is not of the demographic of this
very ambitious (some might perhaps use the word "arrogant") film.
Ordinarily this would be a handicap. However based on the reaction from
the intended demographic in the chat groups, which borders on outright
hatred, this may actually give me more objectivity.2. Running almost 2 hours with the last minute or so devoted to
advertising the sequel (a nasty habit that is now part of Hollywood's
DNA, with antecedents back to the 1930 cliff-hangers) this was intended
to be the first in a series. Whether that will ever happen is now in
doubt...?3. Some of the most astounding pacing problems I have ever seen in a
film, especially given the obvious availability of talent and budget. I
mean, you have names like Joely Richardson and Gabriel Byrne just
sitting around .. and this is the best you can do? The film does not
even start to resemble a proper film (with rhythm and pacing and
audience connection) until about 1 hour in, AND THAT IS MUCH TOO LATE.4. Another irony -- the "teen themes" about romance and BFFs and the
perils of zits and high school seem overly forced, and therefore less
likely to impress the intended audience. Which seems to be what
actually happened.5. The one redeeming factor is Zoey Deutch,a newcomer who appears to
have been unleashed by the director and simply allowed free rein to do
her thing. The only wise decision he made, it seems. This girl has
major potential, the camera loves her, I believe the audience connected
with her, and overall she comes across as a sassy Ellen Page -- and,
recall, Page was pretty darned sassy to start with. Best of luck in her
future career.
