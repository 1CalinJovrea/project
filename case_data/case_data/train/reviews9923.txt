Sad end of a so good start

I'm like many others a big fan of the LOTR movies, but the Hobbit
series started as a cheap wannabe and ended in a disaster.Warning for spoilers!Not only was the Orcs totally transformed from nice makeup actors to
bad animated cgi characters, they totally lost their souls as well. A
small rock thrown by dwarfs easily made them fell, and in other scenes
they are immortal and can breath under water. The movie felt like it
was made in a rush and I could even see the glue in Dwalin's face which
was suppose to hold the fake beard, I usually never pay attention to so
small details but this was awful! Was the make up artist even sober?I didn't like the acting of the major cast in this movie, the elves
felt like vampires, stiff and dull. And the mayors assistant came out
as a total Monty python joke, which did not fit in. The love between
the elf and the dwarf should have been cut out totally, the last scene
felt like it was going on forever, and it made me feel...nothing!What was good about this movie? Well, it was good it didn't last so
long as the previous ones.
