Though the movie does start out a bit slowly, it is never boring. Simon
Pegg plays his typical washed out loser, on a quest to reunite the "old
gang" from high school and relive the best night of his life, "The
golden mile", which is a pub crawl through twelve pubs in his sleepy
town. When they get there, they discover their town has been taken over
by robots filled with blue junk and their new quest is to survive the
night in order to leave in the morning. The chemistry between the
actors is pitch perfect and though the movie could run this risk of
becoming brainless and the characters flat, their personal traumas and
sometimes (very) deep flaws keep them grounded in reality. The ending,
though perhaps not expected, was amazing. If you already like Nick
Frost and Simon Pegg this is a definite must-see, but even if you
aren't a huge fan or haven't even heard of them, this movie is worth a
shot.
