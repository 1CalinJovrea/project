Does it's job well.

If you want a silly movie to watch. Forget yourself for a moment and
just giggle, or spend time watching something goofy. This movie is a
solid 8/10.However, if you are a cynical film critic that takes everything in the
universe including your own mother way to seriously. This movie is not
for you. Go watch interstellar or something indie and obscure.If you like silly fun on occasion, the this movie is on the recommended
list.
