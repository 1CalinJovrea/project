Dumb For The Whole Family!

Half way through this movie I stopped it and watched "Sharknado"...The
best actor in this movie was a giant ex-NBA player-and he was
horrible...Congress should preemptively pass a law forbidding the
making of 'Grown Ups 3"...This is the first non-horror film to cause me
to have nightmares...After watching this, I now hate the first "Grown
Ups"...Forced viewing of this movie should replace water boarding at
Guantanamo Bay...All who read this, it's too late for me, but please
save yourselves and don't watch this film...SERIUOSLY FOLKS: I DID NOT
LAUGH AT ONE JOKE THIS ENTIRE MOVIE. A disaster from the opening
credits reverting to cheap, bathroom humor throughout. Honestly, this
was the first movie I've ever watched with no storyline. I will be VERY
apprehensive about EVER watching anything with this cast again.
