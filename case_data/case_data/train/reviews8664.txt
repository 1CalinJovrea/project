Not nearly as good as the first two, but kind of fun

I thought Despicable Me 1 and 2 were great fun, movies that you could
watch over and over every few months or so and still laugh. Despicable
Me 3 I hardly laughed at all, and can't see myself watching it again
anytime soon. That's not to say it wasn't fun. The Minions were kind of
funny as usual but the overall plot and script wasn't as witty and
charming. Mr. Gru is not really a good guy or villain in this one. The
interaction between him and his new found brother provided a few
laughs. His new wife tries hard in her new role as mother to Gru's
kids, maybe that could have been played up more. I've heard another
reviewer say this was an unnecessary sequel, and that's hard to
disagree with.
