The best superhero movie I've ever seen

I know, I know. This will incontrovertibly attract a lot of hate from
die-hard Dark Knight fans, but guess what? I'm one of those who thinks
Nolan is the epitome of how to make a perfect superhero spectacle. Or at least, I was until tonight. This film will blow your mind. Quite literally, it is jam-packed with
edge-of-your-seat action thrills and pure comedic gold. Don't be
expecting a moody companion piece like that of Nolan's trilogy, or Man
of Steel. It keeps more in touch with Avengers, although it's a lot
funnier and really builds upon the upcoming Infinity Gauntlet arc. The actors are incredible, matching the character developments, the
dialogue and action sequences are spectacular and the visual effects
should surely earn a nod come Oscar time, as I'd personally put them on
par with those seen in the recent Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The
run length compliments the well-scripted pacing of the movie itself,
whilst plenty of interesting secondary characters litter Guardians with
an ensemble cast that has exceeded anything yet seen in the Marvel/DC
movie worlds. I don't pertain to the DC versus Marvel argument, but
this masterpiece alone has certainly put Marvel on the front foot in
terms of cinema outings, far surpassing the very enjoyable Man of Steel
and, I believe, edging out Nolan's trilogy and then some. I thoroughly recommend this for any with a borderline sci-fi/superhero
love, and advise you to remain for the tantalising post-credits scene,
although many of the non-comic fans might not get the references. Easily a perfect ten out of ten for me.
