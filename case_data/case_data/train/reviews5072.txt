Very funny, why bad reviews? C'mon critics!

I don't understand some of the critics of this site. 99% of them do not
know comedy at all. I had to be married to any of them, it'd be like
being married to a cat with no humor. This movie had many funny parts.
It even told you the whole movie in the conference with Agent Lacey at
the CIA headquarters (they go through a secret tunnel, Seal Team 6
rescues them and puts them on an inflatable boat). Overall it was a
great movie. Critics, you really don't understand what humor is at all.
Movies like Neighbors (Released as Bad Neighbours outside of the United
States) and This Is The End got very bad reviews yet all still funny.
People seriously need to find a sense of humor...
