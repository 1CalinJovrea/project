50/50 Chance to like or hate it

This film is about trolls who escaped from being eaten by these bigger
ugly trolls who believe the only way to be happy is to eat a troll.
Later on in the film Poppy (the Princess troll)l convinces their
enemy's that happiness is inside all of us but sometimes you need help
to bring it out; which leads to a happy ending. The themes in this film
are pretty great but the execution of the film not so much. From the
beginning to the end there are a number or sing and dance along's that
were only in the movie to pass time. There are a lot of good things in
the film and a lot of bad one's, however the number of bad ones are
heavier. Overall, this film tried to be for adults and kids but failed.
Instead, it's a kid film with singing and dancing. 5.2/10
