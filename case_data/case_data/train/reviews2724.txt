10
Charming and thought provoking

This is a movie that you can either love or hate, based on how you see
it.On one side, it is a fantasy movie with "Groundhog day" accents (no,
the day doesn't repeat again and again). On the other side, it is a beautiful metaphor which if you recognize,
it is impossible not to give it a 10. Not because it is perfect. It has
charm but it is a bit slow paced at times and the execution is not
amazing.But rather because ... it feels so familiar. It is one of those movies
describing what we've done, what we've felt, like it is our story. It
is a different setting, different people, different circumstances but
it is our personal story, at least for a large majority of people.This is why I like it and this is why I've decided to write this
review. It made me think. It made me feel. It made me remember some
parts of my life. It made me go over the plot holes and the "how the hell this can
happen" type of scenes but rather, just think ..."Would I do the same?" and most importantly ..."Have I've done the same?".That's why you should watch this movie.The plot is not that important. The underlying message of this movie
is. While I don't like romantic comedies so much, I can place it next
to two other movies "If I stay" and "Tres Metro El Cielo". And while
these two movies may seem as a "How to boost your estrogen level in 90
minutes" types of art, they also carry a very profound lesson.
