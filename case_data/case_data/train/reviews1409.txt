A film that packs a punch.....and then some. If you can stomach it you'll love it.

My advice is don't watch this before bed because you probably won't
sleep, but if you do sleep, expect nightmares! You think I'm joking,
I'm not!! After saying that you'd expect a bad review but to be honest
I thought this was a great film with a fantastic story, it's just very
hard to watch. What can I tell you other than you won't find it
enjoyable because it's deeply unsettling, disturbing, brutal and
savage, but it's still extraordinary and Dakota Fanning especially is
mesmerising. I didn't watch a trailer before embarking on this journey
into hell but I had read a couple of reviews but it still didn't
prepare me for what was to come so be warned. Saying that don't think
there is gore and brutality thrown about as a shock factor. It's all
very relative to the story and makes it so powerful. An excellently
made film , a gripping tale expertly told, incredibly acted out by a
great cast.
