A-Hunting We Will Go

Elmer Fudd sings this song in several cartoons, and he is referenced by
the grandfather in this grim story of survival in the unforgiving
Alaskan wilderness. That may be the only hint of humor to be found, as
a father and son track down moose until tragedy strikes. The second
half of the picture is as gritty and harrowing as any you will ever see
this side of a National Geographic special.Cal evidently gets custody of his son David every summer, but in the
mountain country where he lives it's always winter. David is not happy
with the arrangement and finds out right away he can't get a signal on
his iphone. He is a city kid and his dad is a hunter; they mix like oil
and water. They begin as polar opposites but in the end they are
bonded, in as gripping and unexpected a finale as you can find in a
slow starting movie. I disagree with a reviewer who felt the music background was
inappropriate. I felt it was just right - unobtrusive and
complementary. Never saw either of these actors before but they were
effective and had chemistry between them. "Walking Out" is an
underrated indie and deserves a bigger market. It starts like a
travelogue but is a very affecting film; amazing what the human spirit
can do when faced with severe adversity.N.B. The setting is similar to "Wind River", which has a more intricate
plot.
