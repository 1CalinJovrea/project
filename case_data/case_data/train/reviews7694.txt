Not bad

I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie and while I
agree on some points I found the movie pretty good! A lot of people
have pointed out that Ray (Dwyane Johnson) should have helped others
while searching for his daughter because that is his job. Yes... that
is his job however if that was your job and your daughter was in
horrible danger you would probably do the same thing! It's human nature
to protect your children and the ones you love first. and once in San
Francisco he did help others.Although I did find the acting a bit wooden and the near death scenes
totally unbelievable ( who the heck falls 6 stories and still survives
with only minor scrapes and bruises I dunno) I liked the storyline
though and the visual effects were awesome! Pretty typical disaster
movie.
