Bitter suite

SUITE FRANCAISE comes with a 'genesis' story, of which we are reminded
in the end credits. The Jewish author died in Auschwitz, having written
the first two novels of a planned quintet in notebooks which were only
rediscovered in 1998 and republished in 2004. This Anne Frank back
story is more poignant than the romance in the book and the movie.Matthias Schoenaerts is very believable as the Nazi with a soft centre,
and Kristin Scott Thomas is splendid as the flinty mother-in-law,
although her role somewhat runs out of steam. Michelle Williams' lead
performance is a bit under-powered: maybe it needed an actress of Cate
Blanchett's intensity to bring the character to life. Director Saul
Dibb appears to be aiming for a Thomas Hardy tragic 'pastorale', but
the end result has more the tone of a Mills & Boon novelette. And, at
my local Odeon, it was a very grainy print.I ended up feeling that I'd seen a heterosexual version of E.M.
Forster's MAURICE: a bitter-sweet love-story with lots of period charm
but not enough guts.
