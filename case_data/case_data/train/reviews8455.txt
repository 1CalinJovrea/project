We Walked Out

MINOR SPOILERS: I can't even remember the last time I walked out of a
movie. It's a rare occurrence. But we were so bored that, after about
an hour, we decided our evening could be better spent. I wanted to
leave after the scene in which the two characters are talking on a
drive home from the airport, but decided to wait a little longer. It
didn't get any better. We found the drama contrived, the characters
unlikeable, the relationships conveyed stereotypical and the dialog
lame. Blah blah blah about my book idea, blah blah blah about whether I
should take the job with the guy who's a jerk, blah blah blah about how
you keep a man (Answer: you let him win!). Not if that means moving to
Chicago. Honestly, isn't this the 21st century? What kind of people
have transnational relationships, visit their author friends in Greece
and then behave like stereotypes from the 1950s? It was like being
trapped in a car or on a peninsula with a bunch of people you can't
stand with no escape. Thank God there was a door.
