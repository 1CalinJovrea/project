Disappointingly low on laughs and scares

'Krampus' is a comedy horror film that isn't very funny or scary. The
scares are few and far between and the humour is almost entirely in the
last quarter of the film. So much so that, when I finally laughed, it
was a handy reminder that this is a comedy movie - I'd forgotten.This isn't a particularly bad film, it's okay as a mystery drama, which
is exactly what it is for the first three quarters. Then it takes a
humorous turn, but by then it's just too little too late. 'Krampus'
can't seem to decide what it wants to be. It had the potential to be a
scary and funny film, but falls short on both counts.Overall, not what I expected or had hoped for. 'Krampus' has too few
scares and not enough laughs.
