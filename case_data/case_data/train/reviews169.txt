Really twisted with no sense.

For those who would have watched all previous x-men movies, this movie
will make it all go waste(except x-men first class). Actually the whole
movie is based on humans capturing mystique in 1973, some years after
the time in x-men first class, and using her DNA to make powerful
sentinels to eliminate mutant race. Now here maybe some questions that
you might think after watching the movie: 1. If Mystique was captured
in 1973, how did she make an appearance in x-men 1,2,3? 2. How can
Magneto control the sentinels(robots) and really large objects (A
Football stadium) in 1973? 3. If the future is changed, then wolverine
would never get his adamantium claws as Mystique takes her in the end
of movie. So was there any sense watching x-men origins wolverine? 4.
Finally, if no-one dies, than is there any sense of watching x-men
1,2,3 where many characters(Silver Fox, Scott, Jean, Stryker, etc) gets
killed? Answer to all these questions is: The directors think the
public is stupid and they will earn no matter what crappy story based
x-men story they make.
