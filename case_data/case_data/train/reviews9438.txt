Awkward and misguided

If there was a more awkward movie than Pan released in the last few
years I'd certainly like to know about it as Joe Wright's big budgeted
wannabe franchise starter is a lavishly coloured and extravagant
picture that lacks knowledge of what it actually wants to be or who in
fact it's aimed at and judging by the films flopping at the box office
the world over, it seems as though audiences too struggled to figure
out who should be watching this revamping of J.M Barrie's classic
material or why they should be watching it.Tonally all over the place and with a story that seems to meander about
the motions until a highly lacking finale and lack of answers regarding
certain story questions (a glaring one being how Hook and Pan in fact
become enemies as they are adventures together here), for the first
time in his quietly impressive directing career Wright seems completely
lost within his narrative and fails to liven up proceedings despite
throwing every known colour onto the screen, plopping in Nirvana songs
and letting many of his actors ham it up to level 11 to try and cover
up the fact Pan's story is actually rather dull in a world that should
be anything but.Our Pan here is played by newcomer Levi Miller and the poor young
performer labours in his first major turn injecting Peter with neither
the charm, smarts nor emotion that was needed for the role. When you
consider however how his cast alongside a horribly miscast double act
of Garrett Hedlund (who continues to frustrate as a lead actor) and the
beyond bad Rooney Mara, the child performer didn't really stand much of
a chance. The films only saving grace acting wise is Hugh Jackman who
has a blast playing Blackbeard the fearsome pirate who will stop at
nothing to collect that sought after pixie dust but while he has fun it
still doesn't make a whole lot of sense having Blackbeard in this
beloved tale.Whilst normally it would not be something called out for by the masses
it would've actually been nice for Pan to stick more closely to the
original Peter Pan story that has enchanted readers and viewers for
decades upon decades and while its commendable for a big budget film to
take such a risk on a new take on a well-trod property, Pan is a
stinging reminder of what can go wrong when money is thrown all over
the place and scripts seem doctored to tick off as many set piece wish
lists as possible and for the first time in his career Joe Wright has
crafted an almost irredeemably bad piece of cinematic entertainment.All those seeking a Peter Pan fix are much better off seeking out a
copy of Disney's beloved animated take or even the similarly styled
Steven Spielberg event Hook.1 Â½ awkwardly used Nirvana song out of 5
