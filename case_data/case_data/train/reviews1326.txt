Wasn't expecting a parody

Seriously? I thought I was watching the wrong movie. It looked like
Kevin Kline was one of the first actors. With the smirks and feeble
attempts at humor it couldn't be the right movie. No offense to Kevin
Kline, but A Fish Called Wanda vibe isn't what I expected in this
movie. It felt as if I was seeing a play on film without editing out
the set changes.At Vronsky's first entrance (doing a good Gene Wilder impression) I'd
had enough of this spoof.Maybe this movie is okay if you haven't read the book, but having read
it & loved it, this film is a joke.
