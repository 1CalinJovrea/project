For The Love Of Movies

Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from
Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma
Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than
anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the
singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian
Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions.
I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like
Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like
Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling
talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young
artist will.
