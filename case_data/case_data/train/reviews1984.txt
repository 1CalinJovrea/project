A "Black Mirror" look at the future of the Social Silicon Valley

The main character acting isn't bad. Tom Hanks does a great job at
creating a lovable character with no obvious villainous undertones.
This goes a long way in expressing the movie's key concept that the
radical decay of individual privacy is harmless and well intentioned.
Basically, there's no obvious evil force driving the company to take
over the world. Emma Watson's character goes through some character changes that I
didn't expect. I thought she did a good job of transitioning through
the movie.John Boyega's character could have been played by anyone else. He
brought very little to the role. It's fair to say this is a
"time-filler" for him between Star Wars movies. I could imaging them
shooting his sequences in less than three days.Patton Oswalt's role was good. He was the more forceful presence at the
company, freeing up Tom Hanks to play the likable visionary.SPOILER ALERT: Knowing that the table is going to be turned and not
seeing the outcome isn't a great way to end a movie. I liked how Emma's
character turned the employees' culture of unbridled enthusiasm against
the C level executives, but this lacked punch as the only pay-off for
the movie.TAKEAWAY: Like a Black Mirror episode, this movie does a good job of
showing how privacy can be (and is being) eroded with the consent of
the population. I found the idea that "privacy is greed" to be
particularly interesting. The concept and message is loud and clear,
but it's a long time to sit for such a minimal payoff.
