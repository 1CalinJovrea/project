"The Witch" is horror for cinephiles, not as much horror genre fans

There's another version of "The Witch" that could've existed. A Puritan
family in New England gets terrified by a witch living in the woods,
who torments them with supernatural Satanism. If you're saying to
yourself, "wait, isn't that exactly what this movie is?" then you've
come to the right review.I'm not what you'd call a fan of horror movies. I don't gravitate
toward the genre and I almost never seek horror movies out in theaters.
That said, any movie that garners critical acclaim or positive buzz
piques my interest as a fan of cinema on the whole. "The Witch" lives
in that territory as a horror movie for cinephiles, not for audiences
who love the thrill of a good scare.That's not to say "The Witch" isn't scary; it is. It's just not scary
in the modern trend-driven, formulaic, "movie trailer that ends with a
jump-scare" kind of way. Writer and director Robert Eggers, who makes
his feature film debut, builds his terror with tension drama and
mystery, not by creating the pervasive sense that some creepy thing
will pop into the frame at any moment.Eggers, a production designer first and foremost, builds his "Puritan
nightmare" from the ground up, starting with all the tiniest
era-appropriate details in the set, costumes and even dialogue. It
doesn't take a historian to notice the immaculate craftsmanship and
consideration of time and place. Eggers' devotion to this realism pays
off in that the "The Witch" never loses its footing in reality even as
more supernatural elements creep into the story. Well, until the end,
but let's not go there except to say that by then, the realism matters
much less.The story follows a Puritan family that leaves its plantation and
village over religious differences and goes off to build a home near
the edge of the woods. Suddenly, the family infant, Sam, disappears
under the watch of the eldest child, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). The
incident devastates the mother (Kate Dickie) and father (Ralph Ineson),
who convince everyone it was a wolf that took Sam, but the tragedy
trickles down to the four children, Thomasin, pre-teen Caleb (Harvey
Scrimshaw) and young twins Jonas and Mercy. Of course, the audience is
privy to what actually happened to Sam, and we know things will only
get worse for the family.Considering the legitimate Puritan fear of Satan and witches, the
subsequent events begin to tear into the family dynamics, which adds to
the tension that already exists over what unnerving thing might happen
next. The story could definitely have gone deeper into distrust and
paranoia, but then it might have become too much of a "witch trial"
movie.The way the movie ends will draw no shortage of opinions, but without a
doubt, Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke have made an and
utterly engrossing film that would be just as effective had it just
been a period drama instead of a horror film Â– from a visual
standpoint. Blaschke works almost exclusively with available natural
light, which in addition to bolstering Eggers' emphasis on realism,
keeps the specter of darkness and evil hanging over the family. In
fact, had the film not marketed itself so overtly as a horror film, it
might have been given more awards consideration. Regardless, Eggers delivers a remarkable feature debut that's a
definite breakthrough candidate; he will certainly have a lot of eyes
on his future projects. His focus on detail and strong cinematic
instincts could work wonders on a more mainstream project, but if he
opts for more small-budget genre films, no complaints here.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more
