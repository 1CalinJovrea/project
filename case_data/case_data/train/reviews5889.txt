What just happened?

!MAJOR SPOILERS!I made a complete fool of myself when recommending this movie to my
wife on the basis that the other Underworld movies were very good. My
personal favourite being Rise of the Lycans. After about 15 minutes
into this movie I realised it was completely disconnected from the
other Underworld movies. The story is all over the place, I watched
with disillusion as the movie went from one moment to many years later
skipping all the sub plots that would have actually made a good movie,
such as the war between humans, Lycans and Vampires. We just jump
straight into a time when vampires are on the edge of extinction and
Lycans are all but gone from the world. But even this is contradicted,
if humans were so effective at wiping out Lycans and Vampires then how
come an ultra secret top of the government organisation is run by the
Lycans?!?! Then there's the action sequences which IMHO were only added to be
visually appealing, they didn't appear to move the story in any
direction. There are times when Kate B empty's two of three clips on
Lycans at close range and fails to even stop them approaching and then
other scenes where she pops off three rounds from vast distances while
sliding across the floor or jumping off walls and every single shot
hits the 3 bad guys in the head. These types of inconsistencies in both the action sequences and the
story is what makes this a stand alone Underworld movie not deserving
of the franchise. I was shocked by the 7.1 rating but I guess if you
like watching a movie while parking your brain in your popcorn then you
might enjoy it, if you've seen and enjoyed the other movies I suspect
you may well find it incredibly disappointing.
