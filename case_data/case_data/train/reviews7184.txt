Nowhere Near The Coen's Best

I was very disappointed in this movie and I really wanted to like it as
I am a fan of the Coen Brother's work. The character arc never occurred
and I patiently waited for it to happen, but alas, nothing. There was
no real character development and the film didn't go anywhere. Davis
was in the same sad, loser position at the end as in the beginning. The
usual cast of offbeat characters were here with John Goodman once again
in a role that lets him bring out his weird side. Oscar Issac did a
fine job and can sing but the music was not too my taste. Carey
Mulligan got to play an angry women and pretty well stayed that way
throughout the film. I don't see a great deal of growth in what the
Coen's are doing now from their start and like the older stuff better
as if was more offbeat and unusual. This was just boring. The cat was
the best thing about this picture and I'm a dog person.
