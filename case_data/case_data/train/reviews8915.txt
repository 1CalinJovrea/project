"I can't live without real music no longer."

After watching the haunting 2014 Nordic Western The Salvation,I started
looking online for other Westerns from the 2010's.With having found his
performance in the 2003 Western The Missing to be very memorable,I was
pleased to find co-writer/(along with Kieran Fitzgerald & Wesley A.
Oliver) lead actor/director Tommy Lee Jones latest Western,which led to
me getting ready to meet the Homesman.The plot-The Mid 1800's in the Mid-West:After suffering a long winter, Arabella Sours, Theoline Belknapp and
Gro Svendsen each start showing signs of suffering from mental
breakdowns.Meeting in the local church,the handful of locals decide
that the women should be taken eastward to a church which cares for the
mentally ill.Due to the church being 5-6 weeks of travelling away,all
of the men find excuses to not be given the task of delivering the
women to the church.Standing out from the crowd,Mary Bee Cuddy tells
the men that she will take the lead in taking the women to their new
home.Stealing a cowboys land, George Briggs is left to hang.Looking for a
helper,Cuddy finds Briggs and cuts him down to safety.Desperate for
help,Cuddy asks Briggs if he can join her on the journey,but he
stubbornly refuses.Suspecting that he has a weakness for cash,Cuddy
offers Briggs $300 in return for getting them to the location
safely.Accepting the deal,Cuddy and Briggs soon find themselves on a
journey to the harshest parts of the Wild West.View on the film:Opening the film by restraining Marco Beltrami's spidery score to show
child killing in a chilling matter of fact manner,director Tommy Lee
Jones & cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto crack the vast landscapes with
frosty yellows and blues,which stylishly clouds the film,as insanity
freezes over the village.Rolling out endless miles of beautifully
rugged land with nothing else in sight,Jones and Prieto puncture the
wilderness with outbreaks of violence and gallows humour,which cast an
engulfing shadow over Cuddy and Briggs road journey.For their lush adaptation of Glendon Swarthout's novel,the screenplay
by Fitzgerald/Oliver & Jones masterfully cross the wild Western with
the eerie atmosphere of a road movie and the delicacy of the "Women's
Picture." Sending Cuddy and Briggs out on their own with the 3 women in
a carriage,the writers give Cuddy a head- strong appearance which has
doubts and brittle desperation bubbling underneath ,whilst Briggs is a
rebellious cowboy not willing to take any responsibility.Reaching the
half-way point of their travels,the writer's strike Briggs and Cuddy's
relationship with an excellent,harrowing twist,which gets Briggs to
accept responsibility for the first time,and leads to a dark,richly
melancholy full circle. Directing all the pretty horses of the Western for the third time,Tommy
Lee Jones gives a splendid performance as Briggs,with Jones grinding a
world-weary atmosphere within Briggs,which fans the flames of his
rebellious outlaw streak.Holding her head high among all the male
cowboys, Hilary Swank gives an exquisite performance as Cuddy,thanks to
Swank perfectly balancing a strong,independent mind set with a fragile
loneliness of the Western,as the Homesman heads home.
