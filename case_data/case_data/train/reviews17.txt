It ruins the prequel

NYSM2 is no where near the prequel. Few wow factors and jaw dropping
scenes. Dialogues are dry and unnecessary. The new horseman tries too
hard to be liked. The most unbearable plot is turning Bradley to a good
man! So ridiculous! I so enjoyed the plot-twisted at the end of prequel
and now you are telling me that is not the truth?? I re-watched 1 after
getting home from theater. I am sure that when filming 1, Bradley was
set to be a villain without doubts. Filmmakers wanted to make more
money but ran out of ideas so they stupidly changed the character. I
regret to watch this movie because not only it's poor written and
acted, also it ruins my good memory of the prequel :(
