I would give it a B- or C+

I have read all of the Mitch Rapp books. This is basically the story,
although modernized. This book was written after probably 10 books of
Mitch Rapp. Yes, it could have been better, but I do not think it was
bad either. I enjoyed it. Probably less budget cutting would have
produced a better entry to the books, but still worth seeing. Do hope
they will produce more. Time & $$$ & we will see.
