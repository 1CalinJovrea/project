Ungodly boring

Without a doubt this should be at the top of the most overrated movies
of 2016. I cannot believe that I managed to stay awake during this
trite story that goes absolutely nowhere. Not sure what message the
director was trying to convey, but it utterly lost in the unbelievably
slow pace and sleep inducing dialogue. Evidently this is supposed to be
a story about a young, black man who is coming to terms with being gay
in the gang/drug culture of Miami. Maybe that's a good story line, but
it is impossible to relate to any of the characters due to the horribly
boring writing. Definitely a movie to be missed. Borderline unwatchable
and certainly not deserving of an Oscar nomination.
