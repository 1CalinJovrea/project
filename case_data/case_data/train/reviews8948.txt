Beautiful Looking Film

When her father unexpectedly passes away, young Ella finds herself at
the mercy of her cruel stepmother and her scheming step-sisters. Never
one to give up hope, Ella's fortunes begin to change after meeting a
dashing stranger. Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella live action remake is
very beautiful looking, realistic and Cate Blanchett as the stepmother
alongside Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother is what i call
perfect casting as for young Lily James who portrays Ella she owned the
part and the same goes for Richard Madden as the Prince so far Disney
is doing good with their live action films let's see if they can
continue streak.
