It's nothing about global!

Frankly speaking I was a little concerned that I didn't watch the last
(two?) episodes might have given me some trouble following the lines.
Nah, it turned out fine anyway... Huge thanks to the opening
"Previously on R.E." minutes, didn't expect to recall my shocked memory
one decade back (that scientist headed off by elevator, ouch!)Back to our new story, Milla stays the same strong, charming and loving
Alice as we knew she would be. Pretty new face (here in this movie) Li
presents another style of oriental sight which suits her just fine.That's all I have to talk about this movie, thanks for reading... No?
Oh, almost forgot about the "story". Well you know, they gave you the
map, weapons show up just before you finish your last bullet, monsters
never die easy, and so are the leading characters, talk to NPCs for
necessary help and keys to the next level then through them out of your
mind unless you need to use them later (yeah lady Ada in red I'm
talking about you). Baseline: watch it the way you play R.E. the game
without hitting your game pad and you won't be disappointed by the
childish storyline or pale dialogues and the way they read them.But don't get your pillow ready yet, I'm not saying this isn't worth
watching. Visual effects and 3D usage are cut and finely designed.
Throughout the movie you'll find it enjoyable and comfortable to watch,
well except when Barry (or is it him?) busted one head of strawberry
jam right on your face. And moreover, the backwards scene at beginning
is truly brilliant and sparkle of the movie.One last thing, for real now, what the hell do you mean by GLOBAL in
big font on your poster when the most global thing I see are the empty
theme parks 100 meters under the sea? Or next time you'll build a
planetarium and claim it universal?
