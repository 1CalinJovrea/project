Logan is everything you wanted it to be and more

Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great
trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to
characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a
surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its
violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23)
and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more
capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for
herself. Logan is old and a grizzled shadow of what he once was and by
going on this mission he unlocks some of the old wolverine inside of
him and we see bursts of that throughout the movie, Logan also begins
to realize things about himself through the vision of this little girl
because they have striking similarities.Every scene in this film feels necessary from the character development
to the humor and action nothing is forced everything comes off natural
which is a breath of fresh air and I was very pleased with it, I
believe that this movie will be very well received by fans as it treats
its characters with such care and embarks on an emotional and
satisfying conclusion to Hugh Jackmans Logan (Wolverine).
