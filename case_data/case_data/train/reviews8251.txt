drudgery

If you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all
means gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action
movie compared to Black Mass.There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent
acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices -
leading to predictable consequences.But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters
are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer
any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason
to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The
scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a
law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best
(including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to
an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture
what-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd
in their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards
given for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with
prosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far
exceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films
three or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good
scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good
thing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks
stylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with
apathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking!Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved.my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10.
