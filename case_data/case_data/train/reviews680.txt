pointless, boring and just plain bad.

If you like movies that have a very weak plot, many pointless scenes,
the addition of dream sequences that add nothing to the plot and only
confuse, characters that are not explained and which it is therefore
very hard to care about, and many shots of the characters looking into
the distance with little emotion on their face and seemingly little on
their mind then this is the film for you. I don't mind films that are
unique and don't fit the usual Hollywood format but there are things
that are essential to a good film such as interesting characters, a
plot of some sort and some clue as to what is going on being given but
those things are missing from this film. I was so confused and mainly
just bored throughout this film. I expected better things from Gosling.
And I have enjoyed Refn's other films so I am not just a mainstream
film lover only but this effort was just bad film making.
