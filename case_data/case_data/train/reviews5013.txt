Very disappointing.

(I'm not sure I give any spoilers in this review, so I checked the
alert button anyways) It is utterly incomprehensible to me how this
movie has received such positive reviews here. The first two movies in
this series were so charming and enjoyable. Getting through this one
though was a tough, tough slog. There are no redeeming qualities
whatsoever to either Jesse or Celine. Indeed, most of the movie is a
case study in passive-aggressive behaviour - awash in bitterness,
regrets and jealousies. The acting wasn't bad at all, but it is beyond
anybody's talent to make these people seem even remotely interesting or
enjoyable. Who wants to watch such a banal, petty, dysfunctional
relationship where absurd arguments meander on and on ad nauseam? I
kept fast forwarding in the hopes of finding a better movie - but, not
to be.Why would the writers do such a disservice to the beautiful Celine in
this third movie? They made her into an insufferable,sour,
foul-mouthed, bitch. (sigh)
