Great prequel; somewhat a spoiler but not much.

I generally hate prequels. The suspense isn't there because you know
the future and they are usually poorly made to boot.This is an exception. We already like the characters and they made it
exciting and somehow put in suspense. You really don't know how the
whole thing will unfold and the end is not what you expect.Generally, in this sort of movie, Mike and Sully would have triumphed,
won the competition and become the stars of the school but they didn't
follow this clich√© and I liked that.They showed that you can fail at one thing and still succeed. I enjoy
this much more than most kids' movies.
