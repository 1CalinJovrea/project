Would Have Been More Satisfying Had Both Stories Received Equal Attention

Nicholas Sparks' movies are almost always seemingly made to please the
hopeless romantics and the fairytale romance-loving audience, they're
expected to manipulate emotions, no matter how extremely recognizable
their set ups may be, and they often triumph. But in THE LONGEST RIDE,
the attempt barely mimics such success, primarily because of its
confusing and ever shifting narrative, whose backbone runs on two
romantic sagas spanning across different generations.THE LONGEST RIDE sprawls across two love stories set in the modern day
and seventy years ago. In modern day, it has Luke and Sophia, two
utterly good-looking people, who at first sight falls in love with each
other, they stumbles upon Ira, a World War II veteran, who himself, has
his own epic love story to tellthat one he shared with his wife, Ruth,
seventy years ago. More often, these two love stories bear no
difference from each other, as both couples go through similar
hardships to carry their relationships.The idea of crisscrossing time to present two supposedly compelling
love stories, perhaps, is to double the magnitude of emotions and
deliver a more poignant result, yet such very confusing structure is
what actually makes giving both the stories with equal level of
sentiment, difficult. Still, no matter how one appears to hold more
promise of an engaging love story than the other, the tedious and
confusing process of going back and forth across two different time
frames, and the fact that the narrative failed to establish concrete
connection between the two stories, renders less than satisfying
result. There's also this chemistry that Luke and Sophia seem to be
lacking, regardless of how incredibly beautiful they are as persons,
and that, may also be the reason why the other story, strikes as more
riveting than theirs. This makes the entirety of the movieits
interesting premise and structure yet often convoluted, and its thinly
drawn charactershard to appreciate and care about. Nevertheless, in
the eyes of a true Sparks' fan, and of anyone easily drawn to such
anthems, THE LONGEST RIDE easily serves its purpose.Spanning through generations and intertwining love affairs, THE
LONGESTh RIDE would have been more satisfying had it treated both the
stories with equal attention. That's not to say it has no small moments
of perfection, because it does, but as a whole, the movie just falls
below average.
