Worst movie ever!

Even though I had read a number of critical articles about Noah, I went
anyway on opening day. I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt.
Even giving it that benefit, it was one of the worst movies I have
seen. I was not expecting a completely Biblical account of the Noah
story, and knew that additions to the story would have to be added,
since the Bible version is quite brief. However, who would have thought
that would mean weird talking Rock creatures, which looked like they
came from a Transformer movie. And the area where Noah lived was
totally barren rock....until he planted the seed Methuzalah gave him,
and immediately an entire forest shoots up out of the ground, to supply
wood to build the ark. When the "flood" came, instead of it starting to
rain, huge columns of water were shooting up from the ground. What's
with that?I was especially looking forward to the animal scenes, since the Humane
Society commended the director for not using any real animals in the
filming. Well, that was more than obvious! Computer animation has come
a long way over the years, but this movie apparently used one of the
earliest versions of CG. It looked totally fake, and all occurred in
about a minute. The acting was terrible, including Russell Crowe. And the script was
even worse. After a very climactic scene, where he almost killed the
twin babies in a state of rage, he explains that "All I saw was love."
I almost left at that point!If one reads all the reader reviews, I think it will become apparent
that most of the viewers agree with my comments. At the end of the
movie, our audience spontaneously let out an audible groan. I have
never heard such negative comments as people were walking up the aisle.Save your money!
