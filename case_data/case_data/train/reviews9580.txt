Much better than most Hollywood fare

Reading the other reviews, I'm amused by the number of reviewers who
don't have a clue about how southern rural hill people behave (and esp.
behaved back in the 1920s). They accuse Hardy, and to some extent
LaBeouf, of bad acting because their characters are so laconic (that
means they don't run off at the mouth a lot) and inward and don't wear
every emotion on their sleeves. Then they mightily praise Oldman and
Pearce for great acting when they were, in fact, just playing northern
urban gangsters who like to behave over the top---the very thing that
disgusts southern sensibilities.The folks making those review comments have probably spent too much
time watching movies based on comic books and not enough time with
dramatic characters representing actual human beings. So don't pay
attention to their noise.Instead, watch the flick. It's good. I enjoyed it.
