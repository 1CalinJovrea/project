Very boring for a children's movie

I had high hopes of Inside Out before heading to the movie theater to
go see it. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel
where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre
near them. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in this movie. I have to admit that the idea of the story was great and very creative,
especially to young children. Other than that, the lack of character
development and no good plot development ruined the entire film for me.Almost the entire movie consists of Joy and Sadness walking around that
large area of Riley's memories, attempting to find their way back to
headquarters, while the other emotions nonchalantly mess everything up
(I don't get why Joy was the only emotion with some commonsense). Of
course, along the way, they met a spunky elephant (mixed with some
other animals) who managed to make situations worse more than making
them better, and of course, he had to die at the end because, reality
check, it's a Disney film. And their goal is to somehow make you cry
one way or another. I just didn't get how the elephant disappeared so
quickly, considering he hadn't been down the forgotten memory abyss
that long. If the memories died so quickly like he had, why were their
thousands of old grey memories still intact? Anyway, that's only a small screw-up compared to the rest of the movie.
I felt like I had been constantly waiting for more character
development for Riley but once again, I was let down. The entire movie
revolved more around the emotions more than Riley, who from the
trailer, seemed to be the star of the show. I could go on and on about
the huge flaws and plot holes but I only have a limit of a thousand
words. Do yourself a favor and spare the $7.50 and wasted hour that
you'll never get back. I wouldn't watch that movie again if my life
depended on it.
