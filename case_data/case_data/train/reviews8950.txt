Dark Shadows (2012)

I saw every Tim Burton film since Mars Attacks! at the cinema. Until
this came along. I had had enough of Burton's subpar efforts over the
years and Alice In Wonderland was his last chance as far as I was
concerned. Finally saw this and I'm glad I waited. This is simply
awful. Based on a soap opera, Burton doesn't seem to know what to do.
It changes tone dramatically from obvious humour involving Depp's
character waking up after 200 years of being buried and being confused
by things such as television. To grisly kills where he takes out
innocent victims. There are a whole cast of characters, each one is
given their own story, but none of them are given enough time to
develop. Miller, Carter, Heathcote are all wasted as are their stories.
I didn't even get the point of Miller, which is a shame because he was
great with what he had. Entire scenes have no place in the film, or are
needlessly long and repetitive. The main plot seems to have Eva Green
asking Depp to be hers and him rejecting her, over and over and over
again. It really does feel like snippets from a soap opera condensed
down. This is really just a clip show. By the end it starts pulling
things out of its backside. Couldn't care for anybody in this film and
think the original property should have just been left alone.
