The Survivalist: Certainly not the mainstream

The survivalist leaves a lot to the imagination, telling the story of
our lead a man who lives out in the wilderness paranoid and alone when
his world is disrupted by the appearance of two women.Does he risk his perfect though limited little world by allowing them
access to his home or should he turn them away? The Survivalist is a
dark gritty tale that pulls no punches, I found myself oddly
empathising and relating to the lead and yet at the same time was
frustrated by that distinct lack of entertainment value I found.This multi award winning effort simply didn't connect with me and
though I certainly appreciate what they were going for unfortunately
didn't see the appeal.Credit to the cast, credit to the film makers but for me this made for
uncomfortable viewing and a really lackluster finale.The Good: All round well made Strong performances Great concept The Bad: Uncomfortable stuff Certainly niche viewing Weak endingThings I Learnt From This Movie: The survivalist lifestyle isn't as glamorous as others may have you
believe Don't let women in your life, they'll ruin everything
