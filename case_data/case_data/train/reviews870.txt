Great cast, big disappointment

The film deals with a difficult family situation brought about by the
death of the patriarch. The fine cast assembles as in the stage play to
sort out different problems, some very long-standing. I regretted that
so many of the arguments were laced with four-letter invectives and
that only one of the family members (by marriage) showed respect and
dignity when speaking with different family members. The women in the
family bullied and belittled each other as though they were still
sorting out adolescent grievances.Surely, many families suffer the trauma of loss, but in this film the
family matriarch wears her resentments openly and spitefully stirs up
old tensions among her daughters to a degree that seems senseless. The
men in the family seem to be too passive and willing to obey the
matriarch as though she held a special power over them. This is evident
in the scene where the matriarch tells the men to put their suit
jackets back on at the dinner table in the hot August heat. They all
comply like Sunday School pupils. Meanwhile she continues her spiteful
comments. The film dragged in certain parts. There were loose ends that
were never resolved. There might have been more "back story" to fill
the audience in on the origins of some of the tensions. In the end
family members parted with tensions still festering and without really
resolving their misunderstandings. We found the film a waste of time.
