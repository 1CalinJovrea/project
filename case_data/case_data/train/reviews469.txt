Totally clich√©, though also totally inoffensive

A biopic of Stephen Hawking, mostly focused on his relationship with
his first wife, Jane (the film is based on her own autobiography). It
has little interest in what Stephen Hawking is about, except for very
cursorily. I guess that's not a huge problem, but, frankly, I don't
know that much about Hawking and wished I had gotten to learn more from
this movie. It does deal a lot with his disease and health struggles,
which I suppose many are more interested in. The film will surely be
most notable for its two lead performances. Eddie Redmayne certainly
nails the physical side of Hawking and projects a very clear character.
Felicity Jones, though, does better work as the woman who has to work
very hard to make their lives work. No one else really registers much
(though David Thewlis and Emma Watson, among many others, are
featured), but that doesn't really matter. The filmmaking is competent
but not notable. James Marsh, best known for his documentaries Man on
Wire and Project Nim, has done good work in feature filmmaking before
with the underrated The King. Here he doesn't get much to register. My
favorite thing besides the lead performances was the very pleasant
score, by Johan Johansson. Probably worth seeing on video, but don't go
out of your way.
