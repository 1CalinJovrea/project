Lame, Forced comedy fills this instantly forgettable sequel

Why is it that so many fun, inspired originals are followed by such
lame, poorly written (and juvenile) sequels? The first one was a hugely entertaining spy flick with some comedy in
it to be sure, but this one puts the accent on the comedy, and is
impossible to take seriously whatsoever. This would not have really
been an issue if it was genuinely funny; but instead of wit and clever
wordplay, we are 'treated' to an abundance of uninspired, vulgar and
childish humour. Elton John repeatedly dropping the F-Bomb (Please,
don't go on), a attractive woman asking someone to urinate on her (I
can't stop laughing), or an old man stating that he has just soiled
himself (Stop, my sides are hurting). Actually, my head hurt after
sitting through 141 minutes of this. (Well over half an hour too long).
I recommend waiting for Netflix.
