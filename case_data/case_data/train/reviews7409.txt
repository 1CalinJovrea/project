Excellent, but not Cliff Notes on Quantum Mechanics

I've read scientists are turned off by this film for its omissions,
simplifications, falsities, and other failures to explain Prof.
Hawking's theories. I can understand that, being a law specialist who
can't watch law dramas. But if you're not a cosmologist or a physicist
you should not be discouraged by the film's failure to give you enough
detail for a two credit course. It's a good drama of people, a bit
schmaltzy as befits the facts, and in that regard I understand it's
pretty accurate, and is definitely well acted and directed. Also a nice
glimpse of what Oxbridge life was like in the 1950s. As they say, the
male lead is Oscar bait.
