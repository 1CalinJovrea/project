Save time and money!

I typically don't write reviews on this website, but this movie was so
terrible (in my humble opinion), I decided this was the time to start
sharing. Albert's (played by Seth MacFarlane) rants in the first 30
minutes of the movie were not funny, as he so desperately tried to make
them. If this movie didn't have an R rating, all the farts and toilet
humor would be hilarious to a 12 year old but they wore really thin
after the first 2 or 3 attempts. Overall, the cast was great and I love
cameos from stars you wouldn't expect to see, but this movie could have
been A LOT better. When Albert gets high on peyote with the Indians,
that's when the movie totally goes off the rails. This is by far the
worst movie I've seen this year and one of the worst I've seen in the
last ten years, at least. Please don't waste your money on this like I
did.
