Mob reality

I never watched a lot of Italian movies but this one I will certainly
watch again in the future. If you like crime stories then Subbura is
for you. It has everything you can ask for. Corrupt politicians,
different mafia families, bloody violent scenes, drugs and sex,
religious scumbags, scandals and so on. The actors are all excellent
and play their roles with much conviction. If you didn't knew they were
actors you would really believe they are all mob related. The darkness
drips of this movie. One of the better Italian film noir I've seen in a
long time. If Stefano Sollima is planning on making more of those
movies I'm going to be a fan. It's a long movie but with all the
twists, violent scenes and great discussions you will never get bored.
