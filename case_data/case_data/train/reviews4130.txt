It is not bad

Seen a lot of negativity in the reviews. Here's an explanation. 1. It
is a 5th book from the Jo Nesb√∏, Harry Hole series.All the cool and fairly ,let's say important, characters you meet in
The Redbreast and so on. Those characters in the police force are in
all of the book series. You only meet Katrine Bratt, which is a new
character in the book also. There is no explanation on Rakel or her son
in the movie because it is explained in the previous books.Blame the directors of whoever thought it would pass as a good movie
when people who haven't read the book don't know who is who and what it
what. It looks like a mess, but it all has a story and explanation.
Every single characterIf it was made from the Redbreast, Nemesis and Devil's Star (trilogy),
Redeemer and the comes Snowman... Leopard, Phantom, Police, The Thirst.
Then you'd have a lot ot positive reviews.Before you watch the MOVIE read the books from the beginning (including
the Snowman) and you'll find the movie awesome. Because movie as a
movie looks like The Snowman movie is based on a poorly written novel.Meet the characters in the book and watch the movie. You'll see how
much better it becomes.I find the movie surprisingly awesome!!! But I know who is who and
what's their story. The beginning is done different than in the book.
In the book the kid from the movie is responsible for hia mothers
death. He pulled the steering wheel so they would crash and both die.
Bit the kid survives and hia mother dies...
