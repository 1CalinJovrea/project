Missing something

It was opening night, the theater was packed and I was expecting
greatness. After all, this story is right in Spielberg's wheelhouse.
The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will
start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted,
always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does
not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting
performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out
for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The
actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only
thing missing here but it's a biggie. If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you
could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit
sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer
gives license to the director to "Hollywood up" the story. So basically
there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with
great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that
potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out
of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this
intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him.
