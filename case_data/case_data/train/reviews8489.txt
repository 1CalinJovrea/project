Atmospheric and intriguing, if not especially moving or satisfying...

Trouble is stirred up in a stifling hot Australian desert town after
the two children of new arrivals Nicole Kidman and Joseph Fiennes go
missing...and everyone who came into contact with them becomes a
suspect in their disappearance. Well-acted study of stunted small town
lives, with Nicole Kidman particularly gripping as the sad, desperate
mother of the kids (a promiscuous teenage girl and her restless younger
brother). Some of the drama has a prickly edge, and the dialogue is
strong, however the supporting characters are not a terribly
interesting lot, while the simmering tempers in this dust bowl town are
not used to heighten the tension (director Kim Farrant treats it as
subtext, preferring to focus on the embattled married couple).
Repetitive aerial shots of the mountain terrain and surrounding desert
grow tiresome (arty yet unrevealing), but the complicated scenario is
enough of a draw for admirers of character studies. ** from ****
