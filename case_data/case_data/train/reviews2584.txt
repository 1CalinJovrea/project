Thoroughly enjoyable piece for a horror fan

I think a lot of the negative reviews of this movie are from people who
are just bored by scary movies. I can't honestly see what all the
naysayers are complaining about.With that being said, here's my review...What we have is a piece about a family in turmoil and a broken home.
Dad takes his kids to a yard sale, young girl is drawn to a box.
Without giving too much more away, once she opens the box, she releases
a demon, as is the way of these things.Other reviewers said there was no evidence of the possession until late
in the movie. I disagree, because it starts subtly and doesn't bash you
over the head with it, which I like. You can see the girl slowly losing
herself to this demon and it pulls at you. One thing I loved was that
even when the demon was taking over, she's always leaking tears. That's
a natural reaction for the body when it knows something is wrong, even
if the brain hasn't registered it.There's a lot of very clever cinematography, and some fresh exorcism
ideas. The father, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, will do ANYTHING to
help his daughter, and I love how even though the parents are divorced,
the mother isn't completely deplorable. She has good reasons to
distrust him when certain things happen and she comes through in the
end to trust him completely.Also, excellent bit of acting by Matisyahu. I'm familiar with his work
but he shone in his small role.If you find yourself burnt out on possession movies, give this one a
try. I loved it and was very entertained.
