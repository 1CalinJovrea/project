Looked forward to seeing this film - very disappointed

I went to this film with the expectation that I would be seeing a
'modern musical with a nostalgic twist'. This expectation was delivered but generally in a mediocre way. The much touted opening number was a technically accomplished
cinematographic feat but the setting and choreography was rather bland
and boring (I struggled to hear and care about the song for this
number).I found the 'repartee' between the two leads was a bit mumbled and not
particularly witty or fun. The dancing was very average and the songs and singing unmemorable (Mia
and Seb's theme was bland and not what you would expect a jazz
enthusiast to come up with). Apart from the two leads, there were no other memorable characters or
performances.There was never a moment when I felt joy watching any of the scenes,
which I suppose was the reason why I was most disappointed with the
film.A few interesting LA landmarks were showcased in the film but, again,
the interesting settings were not really exploited by the choreography.
For example, Mia and/or Seb could have danced on the round balcony at
the observatory (what you would have expected a Fred or Gene to have
done). If this was not allowed on the real balcony, the balcony could
have been re-created on a set.Ryan Gosling did not convey any great passion for either jazz or Mia,
most of his facial expressions made it seem that he was a martyr to
mild indigestion. He spoke a lot about his passions but you need to
show this cinematically.I enjoyed Emma Stone's performance much more. Some of her audition
scenes were good and her performance of her last audition song was good
(I thought the song itself was just OK).To summarize, one of the few films that I was tempted to walk out on
(but I was in the middle of a row), and one that I will never be
tempted to watch again.
