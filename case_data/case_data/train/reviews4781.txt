Dire

Truly dire movie. The first 10 mins are shocking and quite gripping,
but after that it loses the plot - only that there is no plot to lose.
Seriously, there is nothing in terms of a story. Instead, there are
aimless wonderings around the dessert by characters, and long, long
shots, and long scenes where very little actually happens. There is no
proper dialogue to speak of, and the one conversation that the film has
is about sh*t....literally it's about sh*t. How? Why? What was the
purpose of this movie? How did anyone actually think this would be a
good idea?The only good thing, is the main actress, who is quite cute and
watchable.
