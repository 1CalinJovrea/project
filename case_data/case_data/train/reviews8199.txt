About having 17 and those things

What seems to be the typical "teen" movie of young teenagers in high
school ends up being an unusual movie of its kind. I explain: although
it is true that the film is a teen movie (it does not deceive anyone),
it is also true that it is more complex and adult than it appears at
first glance.It is true that the film has the typical clich√©s of the genre, I will
not lie, but still breaks with the typical dynamics of these films, as
it shows a fragile girl and reveals all her fears. The viewer sees how
Nadine is with her problems and concerns.Mention aside its two protagonists: Haliee Steinfeld. She is the ideal
actress for the character of Nadine, is the queen of the film and
manages to make her character credible at all times, getting you to
empathize with her and make the film an extraordinary work into the
genre. Without she, the film probably would not have been just as good.
The other character is Woody Harrelson. Seriously, incredible, all the
scenes that come out are great. He does a very good role, and the
peculiar Nadine-professor couple with their conversations are the best.Highly recommended!
