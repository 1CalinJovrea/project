While 'Bachelorette' is likely to draw comparisons to last year's
comedy hit 'Bridesmaids', they're two different beasts. Produced by
Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, 'Bachelorette' is much blacker and isn't
afraid to offend by portraying openly messed-up female characters as
the leads and inserting them in familiar comic scenarios. The premise involves four high school friends Regan (Kirsten Dunst),
Becky (the brilliant Australian actress Rebel Wilson), Gena (Lizzy
Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher). The four girls  who were collectively
known as the B Faces as school  reunite for Becky's wedding. Despite
the happy facade, they're a fractured group.Regan is a cruel, controlling woman who's secretly upset that Becky got
married before her; Gena uses sex to cover her problems, even
explaining detailed sex acts to strangers and Katie  despite her
outward craziness and love of partying - has elements of depression.
Even Becky, who seems to be the most normal of the girls, is still
dealing with the fallout of being teased at high school.While the plot has been done a million times (and is similar to the
Hangover movies), it's the coarseness of the characters which make this
movie stand out. The girls are meant to be unlikeable and there's
plenty of coarse language to illustrate that point. While the plot
plays out conventionally, it doesn't drown in a sea of third act
sentimentality for the sake of neatly wrapping up the loose ends. While
things improve for the girls as the movie progresses, they're still the
same mean girls they were at the start. It's also refreshing to see a
movie with strong female characters. Probably the stand out is Rebel
Wilson, having graduated from Australian sketch comedy shows to
establish herself as the next great comedic actress.If you're after a slightly darker take of the rom-com formula,
'Bachelorette' is worth a look.
