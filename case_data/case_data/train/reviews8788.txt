Half by-the-book blockbuster, half hilarious armed forces love-in

Half of this film is what you'd expect from the title, lots of booms,
bangs and aliens. It's moronic but OK if you can turn your brain off.However, near the end it becomes hilariously bad with the introduction
of a series of obvious non-actors who are only there so people who love
the military can get all misty eyed and salute whatever flag while
overusing the word 'hero'. The scene where these characters are introduced standing at the various
points on the ship is one of the worst I can remember in a main-stream
blockbuster. Presumably we were supposed to be in awe but all I could
think of was how they A) Got up there and B) How they'd get back down
without breaking a hip.Oh and while I know it's pointless questioning these things in such a
film but it seemed to me that all the aliens really needed was a couple
of those spinny ball things. Job done.
