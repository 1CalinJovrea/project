The greatest musical ever

Hollywood has finally pulled off the greatest musical ever. The
director of the pitch perfect franchise introduced a new element that
is rarely found in movies. I would like to call this element 'the
sweetness gesture' and how beautiful it is !. This element elevated the
movie to the top by combining basic human feelings such as love, fear
and anger with unexpected reactions that seek to puzzle the audience
unless they become acquainted with the technique. This is embedded in
each and every character as they keep responding to ordeals with
humorous complexity. This makes defining each character's role partly
hard because they do not expose all their feelings to the audience. The
sweetness element is present between the hero and the heroin but by no
means do they act conventionally. The director here defies tradition
and creates a new bond between the main characters making them doubly
interesting to the audience. Along with the music , which is a sheer
genius, everything keeps getting interesting in the movie until the
end. In both movies I was moved to tears when I reached the ending. The
first time this has ever happened to me. I fell in love with the main
character Becca played by Anna Kendrick. I strongly recommend these two
movies 'equally' as they both present a new type of comedy and even
acting, which explains its immediate success.
