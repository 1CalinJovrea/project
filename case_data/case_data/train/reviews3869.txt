Woeful acting...but not bad if you are a Top Gear fanatic

Poor old Clunk Eastwood must be rolling in his grave...or would be if
he was pan but almost every actor in this is awful.Its probably notable that Karl Urban pulled out and many others so it
seems the roles went to those at the bottom of the barrel and I do hear
that old Clunk Eastwood gave the producers a back hander to get his son
into it.The English bloke Freddie just couldn't act - it was painful - I
actually feel sorry for the wee chap!Cant stand the London Idris Elba accent - he is another overrated actor
if you can call him that but i digress.Ana De Armas who i hear is in the new Bladerunner movie which i haven't
seen yet and now makes me think twice as she was another of the acting
eyebrows, bit of fluff on a stick style non-actress - I wonder which
directors casting couch she laid out on to get into acting - Harvey
maybe! ;p;So bad, bad is the acting but on the positive side - the cars were good
to look at and there were a few good explosions and bridges collapsing
and you get a half decent car chase or two but the story is nothing
spectacular - I don't really go for car movies much as in my opinion
the car chase in COLD SWEAT with Charles Bronson is one of the best
even though Steve McQueen fans may argue that one but this is nothing
in comparison.Could have been much better if they had found some actors who could
like .. welll .... act!
