No names. No badges. No mercy.

Glossy, slick, bloody, violent, dumb, crowd-pleasing, and undeniably
entertaining. Filled with every gangster genre clich√© rolled into one,
GANGSTER SQUAD ain't high art, nor is it aiming to be. It seemed as if
director Fleischer was trying to tell this story in the most fun
possible way, and he succeeds with flying colors. The film is at its
best when its loud and dumb but falters when it tries to be anything
more than that.The cast seems like they're having fun, especially Sean Penn who has a
field day with his role as the villain Mickey Cohen. The lines he's
given are pure gold. Josh Brolin does a great job as the lead and Ryan
Gosling is charming and charismatic as usual. However, Emma Stone is
underused with a thankless role, but it's nice that she's in the film
anyway. Overall, GANGSTER SQUAD is fun entertainment. No judgments,
little pretense.
