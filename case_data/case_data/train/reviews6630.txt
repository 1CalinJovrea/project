Alicia Vikander is superb

Because of the subject matter in The Danish Girl I wasn't sure this was
going to be a film that I would particularly like but I need not have
have worried because I thought this was a fascinating movie that
justified it's plaudits. This is the story of Danish artist Einar
Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) who realised that despite being born a man he
is really a woman and that woman is called Lile. Although Redmayne will
quite obviously get all the praise for his role as Lile but I think the
outstanding performance of this film comes from Alicia Vikander who
plays his wife. As an actor she is exposed unlike Redmayne who has the
make up to hide behind. Instead of being about Lile this film for me is
more about the love of his wife who will do anything to make her
husband happy. Even if that means losing him. in the process.
