Two immortal lovers reunite after years of separation.

Yes, Only Lovers Left Alive is another vampire movie. Yes, the
characters are very pale and old and romantic. Yes, it is very much
full of clich√©s and stereotypes. However, it is also wickedly smart,
beautifully shot, filled to the brim with talent and full of cultural
witticisms.Tom Hiddleston is Adam, Tilda Swinton is Eve and Jim Jarmusch is a
genius. This is a director that tells us all we need to know without
doubting our intelligence. He allows us to fall into the depths of the
film without worrying about a perfectly neat beginning, middle and end.
He even stops his characters from following tedious and predictable
patterns, because after all, they're too old for that.This is a movie for film lovers and pop culture enthusiasts. It is a
vampire film that takes advantage of its time span; cultural references
dating back hundreds of years can be found at every corner. Only Lovers
Left Alive does not focus on blood and gore, it is not a thriller nor a
horror, it doesn't even truly focus on the world of vampires. Instead,
Jarmusch studies the eternal, he explores the quiet, perhaps boring,
every day life of a modern, intelligent and ancient being who has,
quite literally, seen it all. - Sinann Fetherston.You can find a full review at MoviefiedNYC.
