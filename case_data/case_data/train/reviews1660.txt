Entertaining, but in no way a masterpiece.

Coming out of the theatres following my viewing of this film, I was
confused. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.The ending was rushed, clich√©d and quite cheesy, that I was sure about.
But I had enjoyed the film, more or less. The visuals are stunning. The
cinematography was truly impressive and I think it is these
Prometheus-esque visuals (in terms of quality) that successfully manage
to distract you from what is actually quite an appalling film.The storyline is shallow and the large majority of characters
undeveloped (I honestly don't see much point in Morgan Freeman's
character). Even after the real human faction is revealed and a group
of drones rampage around massacring everyone, you just don't feel
anywhere near the amount of sympathy as you should do.When the super villain is finally revealed, anyone who has seen 2001: A
Space Odyssey will have immediately recognised a blown up version of
Hal. The (fairly predictable) clone twist is reminiscent of Moon
although it is accepted by the characters after only a couple of
seconds of conflict.The first twenty minutes however, were very good (minus the lightning
scene). The setting of the post apocalyptic time frame was laid out
beautifully with a collection of scenes which almost reminded me of a
futuristic version of I Am Legend.Yes underneath the film is a very generic amalgamation of various
sci-fis that came before and it is definitely not a masterpiece in
itself, but to the open minded viewer it provides more than enough to
give you an easy two hours of mild entertainment and pretty landscapes.(Does anyone else question Tom Cruise's morals in stranding his wife
alone in a valley for three years, thus forcing her to give birth by
herself? Oh yeah and when did that happen? Hours after she was shot?
Wait how did she recover?)
