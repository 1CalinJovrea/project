Please give me back my 119 minutes

Usually I don't write reviews. But this movie is so bad that I couldn't
help but writing this. This is the worst movie I've watched in 2015. First of all, I've to mention the graphics of this movie.The graphics
were visually stunning. But I don't consider graphics as a scale to
judge movies. The story was terrible, full of clich√©s. Anyone could
guess what will happen 5 minutes later in this movie. The acting was
awful. Specially I hated the main character. She tried to deliver some
good performances but I don't think she was perfect for her role. The
side characters were not so great either. If you consider yourself a person with brain, please don't watch
Insurgent. Save your precious 119 minutes and thank me later .
