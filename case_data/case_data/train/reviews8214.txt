Creepy, Atmospheric Chiller

The Blackcoat's Daughter is one of those really polarizing horror
films: either you love it or you turn it off after watching for 30
minutes with no gore or jump scares. It's definitely a slow burn, but
rewards attention with its gorgeous cinematography, excellent
performances and chilling final moments: there is definitely a body
count near the end. I can't tell much about the plot without giving out spoilers, but the
story follows three young women as their lives converge in a
near-deserted Catholic girls school in upstate New York during winter.
I really like the way the possible supernatural element is handled: it
could be all in the fevered imagination of one of the characters.
There's no distracting CGI monster, just a terrifying shadow glimpsed
in the corner of a dorm room or in the reflection of bathroom tiles.
Extra props are due to the unnerving sound design and austere,
perfectly framed cinematography. If you like atmospheric, chilling
horror that makes you think, the Blackcoat's Daughter is well worth the
time.
