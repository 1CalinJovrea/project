Enjoyable Horror With Replay Value.

''Tales of Halloween'' isn't just another horror anthology - what's the
difference? It's as good as advertised.Most anthology films, even the bad ones, do manage to throw out a
couple decent short films, but 'Tales of Halloween' is consistently
good from start to finish. The length of each film is perfect, not too
long, not too short. Something most anthology films can't seem to get
right, either. You get ten entertaining/scary/funny short films within
a 90 minute period. There isn't really a bad story in the bunch
(although Tiffany Shepis can ruin a film of any length, without really
trying.) But I've come to the conclusion that she's at least tolerable,
in person and on screen for about five minutes. She's an aging, low
budget scream queen, who continues to believe that her big break is
coming.Which brings me to the acting. The acting isn't nearly as consistent -
you get your good, bad, and ugly (Tiffany Shepis.) Most of these
actors/actresses are recycled from bad horror films throughout the
years, but they look like they're having fun, and giving it their best
Halloween effort. That's really all you can ask. It'll probably be
years before we get another anthology film as good as 'Tales of
Halloween,' so find it, and enjoy it.Random Ramblings of a Madman: I won't spoil anything by breaking down
any of the short films, but let me just say - "The Ransom Of Rusty Rex"
provides more laughs than most comedies. Loved it. Not every short is
perfect, by any means, and I probably could have done without two of
them - but even those manage to be somewhat entertaining.RIP, Ben Woolf/Rusty Rex.
