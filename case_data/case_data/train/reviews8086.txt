This was literally the worst movie I have seen in a while

I liked the original show. I knew that this movie wouldn't be as good.
I wasn't prepared for how horrible it was. If I had my own car with me
I would have walked out. They took what was good about the show and
threw it away. The movie is set in present day, over 20 years after the
original show aired. It has Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go undercover
in a school to stop the flow of a new type of drug.The cops break every law there is. At one point they teabag a criminal.
They also break into the evidence room and steal some weed, give
alcohol to minors, and consume drugs. There were very few female characters, most didn't have names. The cast
was almost completely white-washed. They used the word bitch way too
often and I felt offended. Even the cameos from Johnny Depp, Holly
Robinson Peete, and Peter DeLuise fell flat. I wish I had those two hours of my life back.
