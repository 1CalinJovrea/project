Disappointing

I like comedies, and was looking forward to an experience in the same
alley as the "Hangover"-movies. But "Bad Neighbours" was probably an
all time low for me. This film probably sets a new record in using the
words sh*t, fu*k and d*ck. Together with other kinds of swearing.
Normally swearing doesn't bother me at all, but this time it just gets
boring. The whole movie is a repeat of itself. Parties and "can you
keep it down, please?" If that sounds fun, go ahead and watch it! What
is the punchline? Is there really a punchline? I couldn't fine any.
Zach Efron is, as always, quite handsome and a quite talented actor.
Unfortunately that doesn't help much. The storyline is too thin. A
total waste of money for me.
