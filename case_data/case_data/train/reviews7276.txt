Get off the fence

This film suffers from the fact that the three main characters are
selfish, cruel, mean- spirited, self-pitying, shallow and hateful, plus
they have nothing even remotely funny to say. They're so obnoxious, it
kind of raises the question: is it even remotely likely that the bride,
who appears to be relatively decent and wholly sane, would invite them
to be bridesmaids at her wedding? It's not enough to say that people are like that in the real world. In
the real world I would never choose to spend time with people this
dull, humourless and unkind. Even the key insult that sets in motion
events - pig face - is totally witless. Symptomatic of entire movie:
witless, pointless, lacking in intelligence, humour or likability. Save
your money and time. I wouldn't spend five minutes in the same room as
these obnoxious creeps, so why should I pay to watch them wallow in
spite and stupidity at the movies? Didn't raise a single smile let
alone a laugh. More like revulsion - and peeve that I'd paid good money
to see it.Unwatchably boring, couldn't even get to the end. Zero stars if they'd
let me. As it is will have to give it one.
