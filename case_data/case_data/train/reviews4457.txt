One of the best (funniest) animations I've seen in years!

I went to see Hotel Transylvania last night in a small group of adults
aged 24-30 and I LMAO as did the others. The theater was packed with
little children who mostly laughed at not really funny parts and adults
who laughed when the children were quite silent. The story is about
Count Dracule trying to raise his only child safe and sound away from
terrifying humans and invites all the monsters to his hotel to relax
and celebrate his very young daughter's 118th birthday which is
accompanied by a surprise visitor! This is a really funny movie with a simple predictable story line and
tons of characters that you will love. My favorites were the zombies
who were the hotel staff and it took them forever to finish a task. I
recommend this movie to anyone who like monsters ( so afraid of a
little boy licking ice-cream)and want to have a good laugh and take a
break from Disney.
