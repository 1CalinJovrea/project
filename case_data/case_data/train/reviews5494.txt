I kept waiting for this to get better....

It took me two nights of sheer will power to get through this piece.
Masterpiece? I don't think so. I had a lot of hope for this movie,
given the stars. And I don't need a lot of action or special effects...
but a good storyline will win me over every time. Sad to say this
lacked in all categories, even the acting was not believable. Even the
so called super hero Birdman is laughable. I guess judging by the
reviews, you are either going to love this or hate this. My advice to
you, if you like the first 15 minutes, then keep watching, you might
even consider this a masterpiece. However, if after 5 minutes, you
think it's going to get better? You best turn it off and don't waste
your time.
