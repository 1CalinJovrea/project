18 minutes is all I could take...

And with just 18 minutes, I have come to appreciate the shitness
rom-coms are, to miss lame penis jokes and started to think if my 4/10
rating for the movie "The Interview (2014)" was bit overreacted,
because that would mean the difference from it to this was only 3
digits from the possible 9. Maybe it was the feeling that this was made for generic tumblr users.
Or the nature that fatso and her horse-looking friend were somehow the
kings (get trickered) of earth while being the worst-written comedic
devices since the word objectification. Which is spectacularly
noteworthy and funny since this is supposed to be a story about strong
independent women. But let's not notice that due target intelligence. I
take this movie as a personal insult and I do not plan on forgiving.
