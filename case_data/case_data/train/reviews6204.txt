Oscar Season has begun

The Judge stars Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall. Hank Palmer returns
to his childhood home where his father who is the towns judge is
suspected of murder. As hank tries to discover the truth he tries to
reconnect with his family. Duvall and Jr have great chemistry on
screen. By the trailer you would think you would get a intense trial
and that would be the entire movie. Sure you get the segments in court
but the meat of this movie is Hank trying to reconnect with his family.
The family scenes are really what makes this movie with so much emotion
that that builds into the trial segments. It was nice to see Robert
Downey Jr come out of iron man for a bit and get his hands dirty. The
man can bring it. The only issues were the court scenes could have been
more. There is also one very unnecessary subplot between Henry and am
ex-girlfriend and those scenes took me out of the movie a little bit
until it would pick back up in court or with Hank's family.Overall I
really enjoyed this movie and i encouraged you to go check it out in
theater's and I am going to give The Judge an 8 out of 10
