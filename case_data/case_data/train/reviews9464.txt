Amazing must-see film

This film hits so many themes and is so moving and kept me engaged the
whole time. It does a great job of shedding light to this time in
history and has a great story line and actors.Shot with a beautiful
backdrop and vibrant characters, it was both very entertaining and
emotional to watch. Would 100% recommend. Bravo to the director and
producer, truly an amazing piece of work!
