Faithful yet lovingly enhanced story

This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play:
Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many
genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this
film is the charactersevery day people like ourselvesseeing
themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there
are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The
elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is
respected beautifullybut hats off to the directors for expanding it
into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only
uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in
ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers
viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in
that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never
would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all
of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You
will benefit from seeing this film.
