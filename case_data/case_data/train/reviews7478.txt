A disappointing cash-grab movie, loaded with fan service

Hey do you guys remember Storm Troopers? AT walkers? Blue Milk? Boy do
we have a movie for you!Rogue One is sadly full of uninteresting characters and references to
the original trilogy, and SW Rebels. From random costumes (one rebel
was wearing Leia's visor/mask from Ep6) to sudden changes in their
demeanor. There was obviously LOTS of footage that didn't make the
final cut. Almost half the trailer we saw isn't in the movies,
including Forest Whitaker's entire monologue about fighting.Remember how you cared about Rey? They showed you what her life was
like and who she was? Jyn is just an angry child and you never really
learn anything about her except that she's "a rebel." (That "I rebel"
line isn't in the final cut either!)What you're left with is a soulless movie, that whisks you from planet
to planet in hopes that you'll forget that you already know what is
going to happen to these characters. Spoiler alert: This is a suicide
mission and they all die. Thankfully, you won't care about any of them.Okay, maybe you'll care about the robot dying. K-2 was funny.
