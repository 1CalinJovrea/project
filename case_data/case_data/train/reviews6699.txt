Not a plot twist, but definitely cute!

I am shocked to see the negative feedback! I just got back from seeing
the movie with three of my girlfriends and we loved it! It may be no
Oscar winning film, however it was one I was sad to watch end. You get
to watch Alice's, (Witherspoon) life transform from an unlikely
encounter. Although the films plot is rooted from the idea of one
woman's unsuccessful marriage, I found the film to be ironically
uplifting and was hopeful till the very end. For me, it deemed
realistic in the aspect that not all movies will be two lovers riding
off in a sunset together. Alice finds happiness, just not how the
audience is originally interpreting it to be. If you're thinking of
seeing it, I recommend judging the film for yourself.
