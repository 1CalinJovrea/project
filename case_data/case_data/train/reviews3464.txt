Am I the only one who hated this film?

My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superhero
movies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan of
action but I prefer a little action in stories.This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self.
She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what
she's supposed to be doing.I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things
this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain
to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard
to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people
in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this
movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I
walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a
therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying
a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general
public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain
for her to hate it like other people do. But it was also not that good
of a movie anyway so I could kind of understand why people don't like
it.
