Near Perfect Thriller with Praiseworthy performances and a Nice Twisted Ending

First of all I have not watched the original so this is completely new
for me and it is very good .I don't know why it got mixed and negative
reviews even though its so much good movie. Firstly Performances are
very good as you can expect from Past Oscar winners and Nominees
Especially Julia Robert is phenomenal. The film is Based on
Jess(Robert) Daughter's rape and murder case which has to be solved.She
gets help from her friends and even it after so many years 13 to be
exact they didn't find him.When finally they have a clue , the film
gets really intriguing to watch . To watch this game of cat and mouse
is really tense.As the events proceed we get more clues which gives a
perfect edge of seat experience. All the way till the end it is tense
but being a mystery film , the ending changes it all making you to
reconsider whatever happened before. The Final twist is great and it's
really well executed and it lives to the title secret in their
eyes.Direction is somewhat messed up but still with a good script a ,
the film is in fact a good thriller that will occupy you for two hours
before blowing you away with its twist.
