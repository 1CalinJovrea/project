The story of the bond between humans & animals....

My husband and I were fortunate to attend a premier of this movie last
night and we really enjoyed it much more than expected. Although it was
meaningful in that my own daughter was a Marine and of course the
scenes at graduation ceremony in Parris Island brought back so many
memories...but it was her loyalty to this dog and the way they were
able to capture it on film that endured me. Despite all the odds
against her, she was NOT going to let this dog perish in the system. He
deserved better and she fought to make sure he got better. THAT is a
beautiful thing! <3
