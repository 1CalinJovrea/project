Outstanding Thriller that much of Hollywood could learn from

Stylish, with a very twisty plot that treats the viewer with respect.
Excellently paced with some great scenes of tension. Clever plotting that a lot of Hollywood productions should learn from.
It treats its viewers as intelligent and can follow a plot without the
typical Hollywood 'quick reminder' via an inserted flashback of
something the viewer saw just 10 minutes or so ago and the preview
audiences couldn't grasp. Sigh.Beautifully understated camera work that allows the story to be told
without flashy excess whilst still looking superb.Highly recommended for viewers that like their thrillers well told and
complexly structured.
