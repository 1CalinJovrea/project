Violent but great acting

The combination of "The Untouchables" meets "Tombstone" meets "Winter's
Bone" results in a violent involving Prohibition Era Western style
thriller. A crooked law enforcement agent (Guy Pearce) tries to muscle
in on the bootlegging activities in a Virginia hill town but some
residents are not willing to let him take over. The war the follows is
both thrilling and believable. It's also very scary because the movie
makes you care about the characters - something that not many movies
like this can achieve.First a warning - the violence is memorable and shocking. So it's not
for younger audiences. It may be a bit excessive for some adults too.The acting and casting is perfect. Who knew an Englishman Tom Hardy
could play a West Viriginian in such a convincing way. He even has a
hillbilly figure to boot. Shia is just right as the headstrong and
naive and his accent isn't too bad either. The chameleon like Jessica
Chastain can act beautiful and her strength is just moving. It was a
bit unnecessary for her to display nudity for the role though. Mia is
quite good and has an Amish kind of look so it's quite perfect. Guy
Pearce sans eyebrows shows his versatility as a menacing villain.Overall this is a well acted and slightly over violent action drama
with a good story.
