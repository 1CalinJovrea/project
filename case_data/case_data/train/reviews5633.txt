Fangtastic Fun!

The comedy horror is so hard to get right. Then using the Vampire genre
and the equally overused mockumentary style you are pushing a boulder
up hill. So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me
wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the
right direction. Great performances by all, apparently a lot of it is
improvised but the script is well versed in vampire lore and flatting
mannerism, nicely produced and well paced. New Zealand seems to have a
talent for comedy horror. Peter Jackson's Brain Dead is perhaps the
pinnacle and this from Taika Waititi and Jermane Clement is close on it
heels. Gags and gore in equal abundance with a beating heart at its
center, entrails to the left. Check it out!
