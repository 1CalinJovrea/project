Can't people enjoy movies any more?

Listen, I'm not a movie guru, I don't study arts, I'm just your average
Joe that loves movies. I've seen lots of movies, I don't discriminate,
terror, drama, action, animated you name it, I can perfectly
differentiate between a bad from a good movie, I don't need the biased
comments of the so called movie critics on IMDb. Thanks God I didn't
pay attention to all the misguided comments about this movie, Nocturnal
Animals is a beautiful & stylish movie, great photography, solid acting
and a solid plot that will stay with you long after you finish it. I
don't understand why there's so much envy and hate in the film
industry, the wannabe movie critics can't take that a guy who came from
the fashion world actually can created a pretty good movie. My fellow
reader, please don't miss the chance to see this movie.
