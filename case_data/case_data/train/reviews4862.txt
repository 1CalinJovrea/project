Critics will hate it, but it is better than most

It is an Action pic, so good action, fun one-liners, and you are
pulling for the good bad guys instead of the bad bad guys all the way.I've wasted so many hours watching movies that cost so much more to
make and came with gushing reviews and were garbage, so when this one
turned out to be unassuming, likable and fun, I was happily surprised.Also, silky and sexy performance from Emma Booth, and Lopez is
fantastic in her role too. Statham does his thing, but it is the actors
around him that have to give what he does credibility.One of those films that when you think back on it, might not be as
shallow as you first thought.
