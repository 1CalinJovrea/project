Very enjoyable movie that doesn't do justice to the book

As a fan of the book, I really wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie.
Great books hardly ever adapt into good films. But my friend wanted to
see it, so I agreed to tag along on opening night. I have to say, as a movie, it is genuinely enjoyable. The visuals are
starkly entrancing without being distracting. The casting is
pitch-perfect - Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield, in particular, do a
great job. The ending is particularly well done (don't worry - it
wasn't really spoiled by the trailer). The problem is, it's really just a caricature of the book. The drama in
Battle School moves too quickly, the characters of Peter and Valentine
are almost completely absent, and even Ender's video game is sadly
underdone. I'm not usually a fan of splitting books into multiple
movies, but this is one where two films would have done it justice.
Also, the kids are just too old - there's an ironic moment in the movie
where two officers talk about how conscripting kids under 15 "used to
be illegal", yet all the actors playing the kids look 15 or older!Still, it's a fun ride, and if you hadn't read the book these flaws
really wouldn't be apparent. Definitely see it in the theater if you
can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen.
