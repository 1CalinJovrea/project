Don't Understand the Bad Reviews from Fans of The Books

For the fans of the books who didn't like the variance from the movies
did you not read or look in to the movie at all before you went? There
are a lot of interviews with the cast and King that tell you this is a
total retelling of Roland's next trip through the door not just a line
by line script made of the books. I think it lays out very nicely a
groundwork for what is yet to come. I would much rather see a new
journey than the one I have read and listened to so many times before.
These are great characters and they deserve a new journey and I can't
wait to see what it brings this time. So many great references to what
is yet to come.Please make the miniseries and I can't wait for the next movie!
