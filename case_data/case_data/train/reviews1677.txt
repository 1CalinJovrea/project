CONTAINS SPOILERS: I want my money back

This movie was absolutely awful. The story line unfolds as an ever
ending cycle of worst case scenarios. Literally. If at any given point
in the movie ONE THING would have went right, the movie would have
ended. Instead its just non stop b.s. even leading onto the next one. I would highly suggest not watching this if you are easily triggered by
absolutely non realistic decision making processes, mistakes in
continuity, or just completely mind blowing stupidity.1/10, would not watch EVER again.
