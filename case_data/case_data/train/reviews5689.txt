Boxing Clever

This my first IMDb review after years of reading them, upon leaving the
cinema though I thought this deserved it. Full marks for this movie,
Miles Teller for his performance but most of all for Vinny Paz (
Pazienza ) who this biography is about. I saw this on a good size screen tonight with an enthusiastic audience,
and we loved it. There were a lot of laughs throughout and a tension in
the room, I really felt for this guy! Great performances from the whole
cast and Miles Teller was on top form looking extremely buff. Nice to
see Katey Segal looking fantastic as she always has . I wouldn't want
to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it, although if you are a
boxing fan you already know the story, just to say at the end of the
film there was a round of applause, the Italians being the most vocal
ha haI only wish there had been more ~ now I want to watch all this boxer's
fightsRecommended!
