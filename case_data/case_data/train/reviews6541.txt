A big disappointment

After watching the trailers for this film I was super-excited to see
it. The cast is brilliant, the director is brilliant, but unfortunately
the storyline was poorer than I could even imagine. At first, I thought we'd see an interesting story about a carny' turned
bank robber but Ryan Gosling dies about half-way through without making
any sort of impact on the viewers or even the story-line as a whole.Secondly Bradly Cooper is introduced and remains the protagonist for
the remainder of the film but, similarly to Gosling, doesn't earn the
viewers sympathy or even attention as we see a stereotypical 'cop
catching bad guy' routine. Finally we see the paths of both Gosling and Coopers sons cross to
finish the film on a poor low. The only non-clich√©'d surprise is that in the end *Spoiler* one son
didn't actually kill the other as we were led to believe. I literally
cared so much towards the end that I can't even remember who's son done
what. Had I not been on a date, I would have left roughly about an hour
and a half in. Overall a disappointing film that had all the makings of a masterpiece
but falls, incredulously, short. I wouldn't recommend watching this film. I'd put the 'let-down'
somewhere below that of Gangster Squad (2012, Gosling).
