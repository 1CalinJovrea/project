Molotov of Druggery and Mazel-Tovely Awesome good time

When I was a teen I warned everyone I knew to look after their
relationships: parents, siblings, children, lovers, and especially
friends. Nothing in this life lasts forever. The only constant - is
CHANGE. Blah blah blah.People move on with their own agendas and perceived roles in their
lives and this puts a great strain on previous interactions that we
often take for granted after our formative educational years.
Friendships are usually the most likely things to suffer, fade, and
disappear once people grow up. This movie is a fun , veiled tale of
what we ALL must go through with regards to those changes ,and I
sympathize with it, fore tis a central part of the human condition.There's laughs, spills, not too many thrills, or chills, though for a
xmas movie, thats just mein penchant for terrible har har making. But
some people do these types of things, no gender analysis needed to ruin
a good time. HOWEVER...The film will of course appeal a tad more to the male perspective, but
honestly when you look beyond Seth Rogan's ever intentionally placed
molotov of druggery and mazel tovly awesome beard, and the strangely
balding J G Levitt and their mysterious drug dealer associate, we
remember that we all go through the same things, regardless of our
individual attitudes, perspectives and the colors they take on. A good
"holy" season watch when your bored and want some entertainment.
Seasons Greetings and keep your heat beating. Pe@ce ^~^
