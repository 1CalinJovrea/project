A Pile of Lint

This is probably the worst film I ever rented Its just too seminal for
me and my midget mind. I always thought "Natural Born Killers" was the
worst, but this rates as bad or worse, I know both were meant to have
really deep meanings, but not to me.I don't see movies for deep and
"profoundity" of understanding only entertainment, history and clarity.
I love science fiction, but this is was pretentious garbage. Alternate
Universe, akin to a Twilight Zone episode, bah humbug, pure waste of my
eyeball energy. If I could rate this a minus 10 I would. Just a bunch
of verbal pseudo intellectuality. There were no actors of note. The
atmospherics were abominable, the dialogue lame. In summation I
recommend this picture to nobody.
