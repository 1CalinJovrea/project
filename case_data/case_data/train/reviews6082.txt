SING!...some more

This movie was equally exciting for both adults and children and
honestly, I couldn't tell you which of whom had more in the audience.
By the trailer alone, I could tell that this was going to be
captivating due to the fact that it was not animals singing but
familiar voices as well! They also sang current songs and some older
songs during the audition portion but I believe that was truly them
catering to their audience and they hit the nail on the head with that
one. Each actor/actress delivered for their character immensely and I
was shocked to see that a few of them knew how to sing! The beginning
was...interesting. It caught my attention (the voice and not so much
the sheep) but I was glued once the main character began to speak about
his present life. The most exciting part of the movie was the lessons
in it which was people will do what they want to do when they want to
do it and never be afraid of doing what you are good at! I hope a
sequel comes out soon!
