SAVE YOUR MONEY! Horrible!

First, I am a HUGE sci-fi fan and love most sci-fi movies but this was
just wrong on so many levels. Bad acting.... No plot.... Story was all
overthe place...you couldn't get a good understanding of what was going
on in the movie. Graphics & visuals were so,so. I would wait for
DVD/Blu Ray and even then I would avoid this movie. I feel like they
made a movie just so Will Smith's son could star in it. Save your
money. Trust me, you will thank me! I almost walked out of the theater
at one point because it just wasn't worth sitting through anymore of
its. ..... ..... ..... Nothing else to say. Just save your money! Why
Will Smith? You had a pretty good rep on movies now you're starting the
Tom Cruise slide into just making a movie cause you think you should.
