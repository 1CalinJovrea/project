Strange movie.....

It is not quite appropriate for grown ups(too childish,) yet not
appropriate for children either. 1 out of 10 from me. I don't mind
goofy comedies even if they are geared towards children but this
doesn't seem to know what it wants as its audience. I would have
enjoyed it much more if they kept the foul language out...it just felt
weird to watch. Not because I can't take harsh language but it left me
thinking..."this is for children....really?" And of course it is too
childish to be directed towards adults.I need 10 lines I need 10 lines to post I need 10 lines to postThere...that should be enough.
