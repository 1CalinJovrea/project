Amanda Seyfried battles inimical cops as she seeks out a serial killer who has snatched her sister

"Gone" is a well-written and well-acted thriller noir. Ms. Seyfried
carries the entire movie smoothly and believably.She plays Jill, a young lady who was kidnapped and terrorized months
earlier by a serial killer. She managed to escape from his designs and
from a big hole he had put her in out somewhere in the very large
Forest Park in Portland, Oregon. Now he's after her again, and he is
luring her to his lair.After the first episode, the police for various reasons didn't believe
her story and the authorities actually committed her and made her take
drugs, which didn't help. So, when her sister goes missing and clues
point to the work of the killer, the police do not believe her. They
are very indifferent and very ready to devise other explanations for
what she is telling them.Jill's very smart and realizes that the police not only are useless but
actually are thwarting her attempt to locate her missing sister. She
sets out to follow his trail and save her sister.With the police after her as she chases the killer, we have a situation
much like "The Fugitive". It makes for a neat suspense thriller.The movie is much deeper than a mere thriller, however, because the
screenplay is literate. The thematic material in the story is rich, and
this is where the neo-noir character enters, as well as in the ways in
which the events are shown, that is, the colors, shooting styles, and
use of the camera.The themes explored include the ignoring of violence toward women, a
dismissive attitude toward women, police indifference, police
incompetence, the use of drugs, psychiatry and psychiatric institutions
to repress people, the disarming of people in their own defense, and
the isolation of people in what should be communities but are not.
Basically, certain contemporary societal and political sicknesses and
weaknesses are shown.
