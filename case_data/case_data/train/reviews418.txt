I laughed my ass off while watching this movie. I had no expectations
to what I was about to experience and I'm so glad because I did enjoy
it. The last crazy zombie movie I watched was 'Cooties' which is truly
an off-the-wall delight and 'Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' is
right up there with it. Good show!The synopsis states three scouts attempt to save their town from a
zombie outbreak. But that's really not the plot. Their motive is to
save their fellow classmates and one of the scouts sister at a rave
party to which the three scouts were not invited. The scouts were given
an erroneous address and they must find the real address before the
zombie get to the rave first. What they go through to get the address
is a laugh riot of grotesque zombie horror that is funny and goofy and
perfectly timed.Casting, acting, dialog are spot on with the spirit of the movie! Light
hearted crazy zombie fun done to perfection!
