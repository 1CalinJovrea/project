There Is Something About Marion

What a remarkable performance! Marion Cotillard as an actress, as an
artist goes as far here as very few actresses have gone before - Total
and utter truth no matter how wrenching - Maria Falconetti in The
Passion Of Joan Of Arc, Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, Anna Magnani
in Bellissima and very few others, now, for me, Marion Cotillard in
Rust And Bone belongs right up there among the sublime. Here I should
be commenting on the film and my comment is all about her because Rust
And Bone is her, Marion Cotillard. Her co-star, totally new to me,
Matthias Schoenaerts, is superb as the handsome, unwitting agent
provocateur. Not to be missed.
