Overall a good fantasy storyline mixing genres quite well.

Unlike the other reviews I actually liked this movie. I didn't go into
the cinema thinking I would like it either. The storyline is good,
quite in depth for a fantasy 12A rated movie. The special effects are
great, especially towards to end. The cast are decent, some giving of
great performances, Alice Englert is an example. Yes the story is 'corny' at times and it does kind of remind me of a
Twilight movie, but it worked and in a way mixed the fantasy genre with
a Rom Com style. I've heard the book has lots more characters and a
better ending, and I honestly don't know how they will turn this into a
sequel (if they do) but for me it was good. Summary: If you like Twilight (even just slightly), Rom Coms and
fantasy movies then you will most likely like this movie. I found it
overall decent and would watch it again if it was be shown on TV a
later time in the year.
