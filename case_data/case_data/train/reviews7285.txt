Enjoyable,funny but weak villain yet again.

In the beginning when i was growing up i knew of Ant man and was never
really sold on the character and him able to shrink wasn't something i
liked as a power. Thirty years on and the trailer hits and for some
reason i got interested so interested i went to my local comic shop and
bought some comics and I am so glad i did because I realised that he
really cool.Now on to the movie I found really enjoyable and very funny the
chemistry worked really well with all the cast involved, I will say
though that the villain of the piece was a big let down it went down
the lines of same old story.The effects where pretty cool to and all the ants was awesome.I will say also that I would of loved to have seen what Edger Wright
version would been like but it is also good that he wrote this.Overall the movie is great fun and a great laugh.
