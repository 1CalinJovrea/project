Christmas is crap! And so is this movie!

A real piece of crap. When you step into crap do you laugh? No! And
that is what you step into if you watch this piece of crap movie. So
scrape this one off your list.Here's the lameacide plot - three half-wits get together every xmas eve
to 'party' and seek the ultimate xmas eve party the Nutkrackers Balls
party! After years of failed attempts this elusive party falls into
their hands. Then they have to get there! Sounds like fun doesn't it?
It's not.To enjoy this sorry hot mess you have to have taken every
hallucinogenic pill, eaten every mushroom, and smoked all the weed the
Seth Rogen character 'Isaac' consumes throughout this entire movie.
He's not funny! Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his elf costume isn't funny,
and Anthony Mackie isn't funny (I never did understand the needle in
his butt thing). Their adventure is lame, dialog forced, and the James
Franco dick pics joke was just juvenile at best.Fair warning --- this crappy movie looks like fun on the ad - and
that's the only place it's fun.
