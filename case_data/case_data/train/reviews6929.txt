Uninspired popcorn flick.

The Gene Roddenberry's legacy is nowhere to find in this film. This
Star Trek movie feels more as a Marvel Comics flick than a Star Trek
movie. One- dimensional characters, a whirlwind of imagery, a meager
story and over the top villains and hero's. A true Star Trek movie for me is one with a nice story, sound science,
a spec of humor, real characters, and last but not least; always in
search of the human condition. Star trek is more than the sum of
episodes and movies, its a way of thinking, and inspired millions of
people -personal and professional- to make the world a better place.
The brightest people off all humanity, like Stephen Hawking, NASA
scientists, all love Star Trek. If Director Justin Lin had seen all of the Star Trek series and movies,
he would never made such a terrible -for me- horrible movie.
