One for the oldies

Jane Fonda and Robert Redford both aged 80 in a 2017 movie, what a
treat! The acting is superb as you would expect. To find love again at
this age is the dream of many elderly widows and widowers. Life is
still complicated even at this age and both have family to consider. It
is not fast paced with a lot of action but it is a good script for
these two actors in their twilight years. The atmosphere created by
their very presence and experience is beautiful. They are a joy to
watch. This movie may be wasted on some young viewers but there will be
some who can appreciate perfection when they see it. For older people
who know these two from previous movies just sit back and know we are
lucky to have this movie from them. It is probably worth more than 8
but the lack of action and intrigue makes it a bit tame for some
viewers. The acting is worth 10 though!
