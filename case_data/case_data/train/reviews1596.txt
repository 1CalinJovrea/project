This summer's hit horror flick

This turned out to be the most enjoyable kind of horror movie - a
clever story with some humor that links things together. It's not gory
either and doesn't rely on cheap shock tactics. A poor tomboyish girl who isn't popular and picked upon by the high
school bitch gets a present of a Chinese wish box that her dad found in
a dumpster. It turns out to grant wishes but there is a price to pay
for each wish granted. It's fun when she initially gets her wishes like
fixing the school bitch and getting money and the guy she likes. There
is a gleeful anticipation to see how things will play out even when you
can guess what's coming. The likable cast is headed by Joey King - you can see her grow up in
horror movies is the right kind of actress for this role - cute and
likable. Ryan Phillippe plays her dumpster diving Dad. Nice to see
Sherilyn Fenn again as a neighbor.A notch above the Final Destination series. This should be this
summer's hit horror flick.
