Cold Moon: Interesting but flawed

The nice thing about Cold Moon is that it near immediately gripped me,
this is a movie that got my attention early on.Set during the late 80's the tale is told of a young murdered girl and
her family seeking justice while the killer is besieged by terrifying
apparitions.The film looks beautiful with a decent cast including the living legend
that is Christopher (Doc Brown, Uncle fester) Lloyd.It delivers and is a very riveting interesting piece of cinema that
thoroughly fell under the radar.Sadly it gradually loses steam and when the vague and open to
interpretation ending happens and the credits roll I was left finding
myself sad that a few lose endings still remained.Cold Moon is a decent enough film, I think it could have benefited from
another 30 minutes to flesh it out but kudos to all involved for a damn
fine effort.The Good: Very impressive cinematography Christopher Lloyd Great sfxGenuinely creepy The Bad: Feels a bit incomplete Inconsistent in its quality Things I Learnt From This Movie: Christopher Lloyd can simply do no wrong Leather bondage gear is the thing to wear when murdering people because
reasons
