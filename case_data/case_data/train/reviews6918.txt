Not a trivial costume drama... Well directed and played

Within the last decades, Denmark has become the leading film country
around the Baltic Sea, several films have been praised in major
festivals around the globe. En kongelig affære is a pleasant supplement
to the succession. Based on real events and persons, the film focuses
on broader issues than a simple love between 2 powerful persons.
Despite some not-so-good characteristic features of the doctor
Struensee, his appearance in the Danish royal and executive circles
changed the country thoroughly. And today, Denmark is one of the most
progressive countries in the whole world.The cast is evenly strong - not the leading roles only, but supporting
performances as well. Mads Mikkelsen is great as usual, irrespective of
the role, but the biggest surprise to me was Mikkel Følsgaard (as
Christian VII) - I had never heard about him before; as he managed to
win the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin Film Festival, I am
sure he will be used often both in Denmark and internationally. Well, the total length could have been less, 2 hour 15 minutes included
some protracted scenes. Nevertheless, the film is recommended to all
those fond of historical palace dramas.
