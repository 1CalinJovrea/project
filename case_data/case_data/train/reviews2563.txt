leaves you wanting more...and maybe a little frustrated

As a period piece, I loved the nostalgic Vietnam War setting and the
panoramic nights scenes of Saigon that they managed to weave into the
film. The plot was pretty formula and characters predictable down to
the frustrated Army Lt with nothing to return home to longing for one
more battle. The one thing I wasn't expecting was a colder, more
emotionally uninvolved "Fay Rae" who neither falls in love with the big
ape or seems too concerned overt what happens to him one way or the
other. And then finally, when he saves her life for the last time, we
watch the lonely beast slowly lumber away back to his isolated oblivion
while our beautiful little ingrate turns and hugs her boyfriend. Sorry
but that last scene was begging to be re-shot. All in all, it's still a
good flick.
