8
Good, but not great.

Greetings from Lithuania.I read some reviews about "Lone Survivor" where it was mentioned
alongside to a "Saving Private Ryan" - you can throw a rock at me if
this comes close to "Saving Private Ryan" which is beyond many moons
and seas compared to "Lone Survivor". "Lone Survivor" is good action movie, with some heroic stuff (they
definitely couldn't avoid that...), and i know that it's based on real
events, thats why i'm giving it 8, because many of things displayed in
picture were sadly true, many, but definitely not all. When someone is
being killed in this movie (exept for bad guys from Taliban), it's
shown in a similar way as Jim Caviezel aka.Jesus was suffering in "The
Passion of the Christ" - only true American heroes die like that, not
afghans who are more or less just a meat between bullets and Americans
in this movie.Overall, i liked this action picture, the sound design and sound
editing were really top notch (no wonder it got 2 Oscar nominations) -
you can hear every detail in the forest, every breaking bone (ye, the
fall from cliffs scene was gripping). Actors were just OK, nothing
special. The gunfight was terrific at least in the beginning of battle,
truly terrific sound design and camera work. Later, well, when bad guys
were shooting with RPG's every 2 min to our heroes, and they were
suffering real good but still were able to do some heroic stuff, the
tension was kinda lost.Overall, 8/10 for me because of good production values and for that it
is based on real events.
