What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.

Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly
different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word
"city" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town
far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow,
they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help
each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery
of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation,
but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this
movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so
divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of
what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to
lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the
movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one
scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible
applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score
fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that
predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are
some usage of stock characters and several clich√©s throughout,
something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud
their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and
well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more
trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.
