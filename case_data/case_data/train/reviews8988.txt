Monsters University pleasantly defines its title with a great story

With Animation industries overproducing computer-animated films for
either sequels or prequels, expectations from critiques and longtime
cartoon lovers who grew up with classic Disney movies are pretty high.
For this reason, It has been a while since I get to be surrounded by
parents who like to bring their kids to let them enjoy bright and
comical scenes. After coming to the theater with low excitement, not only does this
movie exceed my expectation but it also proves that Pixar is not a sort
of company that tries to take audience's wherewithal by making a
mediocre prequel based on the reputation of an original one. As usual, Pixar consistently unleashes intriguing, unique, and
appealing characters with flexible movements and simplified traits that
attract a wide range of audiences. Especially when it comes to
presenting different breeds of monsters with extraordinary looks and
abilities, followed by an absolute storytelling skill that moves
everyone's emotion. As the setting takes place in the old days before Mike and Sullivan get
to work together in Monsters, inc., you get to find out how they meet
and grow their friendship. The story consists of both internal and
external conflicts that college students can unanimously relate to.
Pixar does an amazing job on capitalizing as much college-related
elements as possible to emphasize the importance of corroborations,
personal identity, and working hard to achieve your goal. There are
also tons of humors that make you laugh periodically. In a nutshell, this is a sincere and endeavored film that sends us
various messages to help us progress in many different ways. I strongly
recommend this to all the students out there who are struggling with
their school life. It is such an inspirational movie and Pixar still
rocks!
