Hot pecs, hot rocks, and a horse whisperer

How to waste a 100 million dollar budget:1. Ignore history completely because you're sure your audience is
stupid and won't notice. 2. Make sure all the gladiators look like
steroid refugees from a West Hollywood gym. Amp up the homo-eroticism
with lots of oiled pectorals and a weird "bromance" between not only
two gladiators but the evil Roman senator and his faithful-unto-death
boyfriend / bodyguard. 3. Create a paper-thin romance between a slave
and a noble lady that's laughably unconvincing because they have about
twenty lines of dialog between them. 4. Give the slave killer abs and
the ability to whisper sweet nothings to horses so that they'll calm
down while a volcano explodes. 5. Include every freaking clich√© from
every disaster movie ever made. Make sure the noble black slave runs
back to save that child who fell down and is being trampled. 7. Throw
giant hot rocks at the audience via 3D. 8. Include a tidal wave! 9.
Make the audience wonder where all the Pompeiians went during the last
twenty minutes of the movie. Suddenly they all vanish. 10. Give Kiefer
Sutherland lots of close-ups of his false teeth. 11. Burn up everyone
as prettily as possible. 12. Run away from lawsuits and copyright
infringement because your screenwriters ripped off "Gladiator" and
"Titanic".Luckily, Vesuvius only destroyed Pompeii once, so there can't be a
sequel...but don't count on it. Hollywood is probably doing
post-production on "Return to Pompeii" right now.
