Awful Crap That You Can't Unsee

How do you make a hit film? It's simple. Cast some of the biggest stars
in the industry and you are halfway through, add a lot of mindless
action, do some promotional stunts (like Vin wearing a Lungi and
dancing on a Hindi song) and you are done. Audiences are bound to go
crazy.I have never been a fan of any of the XXX films but this one I watched
for Deepika. But Oh My God, what was I thinking? This film is awful
beyond measure. There is nothing to watch. I mean it's the same thing
you must have seen at least a hundred times by now. Same clich√©d story,
same mindless action sequences and people reading their lines like they
are mannequins who have been brought to life my some magic. Even the
origami did a way better job in Kubo and the two strings and they are
made out of paper, mind you.People are saying Deepika was good and I completely disagree. I can say
that she did a good job with action sequences but her acting was
pathetic. In fact there were only one or two people who actually tried
to act.So, don't waste your money on this awful experience. If you are
watching it for Deepika then drop your plans. The screen time she gets
is longer than I anticipated but nothing good comes out of it. It is
another of those meaningless action films that you forget the moment
you walk out of the Cinema. There are better movies playing in theaters
that deserve your money instead of this crap. Do something meaningful
with your money.
