Great film

I really have so many to wrap up this film with such a great words. At
the beginning I want to mention I am 16 year old boy and I definitely
will watch it second time or even more.Film was great from the first time and I really want to say thanks to
the authors and actors. Britt Robertson played a great roll and she is
so cute and wonderful through the hole film. From the beginning they
were all at a party and they were in the back alley. Dylan O'Brien was
practicing his speech for the girl she liked a lot from childhood. But
when he met girl called Aubrey and she was struck away from her. I do
not want to spoil but one thing I have to say is that it is great film
to watch and it has a really good idea behind all this.In conclusion I want to say that The First Time went really to my heart
and it is really good movie. Actor work was brilliant and I hope that
you love this film as much as I am.
