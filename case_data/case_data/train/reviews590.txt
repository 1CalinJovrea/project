Excellent Scifi Action movie

My first reaction: Arnold's 'Total Recall' meets Dayworld (by Philip
Jos√© Farmer).This movie has the pace and scifi feel of the best Arnold
Schwarzenegger movies of the 90's. It's a Dystopian World movie where
the streets are clean and the government is evil.Noomi Rapace is marvelous as seven very different sisters. I loved her
in the original, subtitled 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' and I loved
her just as much in this movie. (She's not an native English speaking
actress, but nevertheless, has NO ACCENT at all.) Granted, as other
reviewers have said, nothing is mindblowingly different from other
futuristic, dystopian film worlds, but it's done very well.And it's a Netflix movie! Kudos to them!
