Utterly disappointing , stick to the cartoon

I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this movie , I don't even
know where to start. First the mowgli kid is so annoying , he's too cheesy, too
americanised. This is supposed to be a kid that's lived his life on the
jungle , yet he acts nothing like that . They could have made the
accent more neutral, made his walking more animal like , and made him
less annoying. Again in the cartoon Baloo is so fun and lovable , he
just isn't likable in the movie , I'm not drawn to him, and he doesn't
have the connection with mowgli that he has in the cartoon, there's no
emotion in the movie and no emotional connection between the
characters, other than the cheesy wolf line " you'll always be my son"I was really expecting the movie to relive my childhood , to be quite
magical but Instead it was just like a soulless cgi show with annoying
characters and annoying voices , too americanised with blue coming out
with things like " my bad". Kipling will be turning in his grave.The movie is totally soulless and to add to the total lack of emotion
in the film it doesn't even end with mowgli going back to the village.
It just ends with them all sat up a tree living happily ever after.The very worse thing about the movie is the music and the songs. I
can't believe how bad and soulless they are , the bare necessity's
sounds like some drunken old man on his death bed is singing it and the
background music is poor , and the other song " I want to be like you "
was totally ruined too. No rhythm , no melody , just dull. It was like
the film makers were scared to have fun with the movie , they were
scared to bring any emotion or sense of childhood into the movie and
instead just concentrated on cgi. I will never watch the movie again and will always stick to the
cartoon. A very painful watch .
