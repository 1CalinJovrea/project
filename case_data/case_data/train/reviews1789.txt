A lack of Art and a Lot of Quasi-porn

The film had a chance to be a thoughtful satire on the societal impact
of money on politics and issues such as the outsourcing of American
jobs, not to mention the growing separation between the political class
and the public. It settled for a host of clich√©s. Instead, it contented itself in pandering to elite prejudices.
Christians and Southerners are ignorant, and they are hypocrites. Their
children, are even more ignorant and more perverse. MSNBC and CNN make cameo appearances lending their support to these
notions. The language is unnecessarily crude,lewd and indecent. I am no prude,
but this film often seemed just a lot of tasteless potty talk
masquerading as humor.Too bad. There are one or two clever skits. Net Net: Don't waste your
money. I was once a Democrat. Later a Republican, still conservative
with a small "c." I am a registered independent.
