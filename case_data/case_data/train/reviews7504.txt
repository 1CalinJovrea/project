Pure Entertainment

Mavis and Johnny get married to each other and are happily living in
Hotel Transylvania. Soon Mavis is pregnant and gives birth to the boy
Dennis. When he is five years old, his fangs have not grown and Mavis
thinks to move to California with Johnny and Dennis to give a chance to
the boy to be raised among humans. Dracula asks Johnny to travel with
Mavis to the house of his parents in California and convinces her to
stay at the hotel. Meanwhile Dracula joins his friends Frank, Wayne,
Griffin, Murray and Blobby the Blob and they travel with Dennis to a
vampire camp to teach the boy to turn into a vampire so that Mavis and
Johnny stay at the hotel. However neither the boy transforms nor his
fangs grew. Meanwhile Mavis is delighted with the facilities in
supermarket in California and she is sure that moving to California
would be the best for her son. What will be Mavis' final decision? "Hotel Transylvania 2" is pure entertainment for families, children and
adults. The plot has many hilarious gags and most of the situations are
very funny. Most of the characters are adorable and even the villain
Vlad changes his behavior in the end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Hotel Transilv√¢nia 2" ("Hotel Transylvania 2")
