Super special effects, weak story and dialog

In segments, Gravity has marvelous special effects--truly a remarkable
achievement. The weak parts of the movie are the contrivances that link
these segments together, along with unbelievably bad dialog. (Maybe
someone will be brave enough to register the contrivances formally as
"goofs" here on IMDb?)No way could astronauts from the shuttle ever reach the International
Space Station, but Gravity asks us to believe both this could happen
and that an astronaut could then go on to reach a Chinese space
station, too. These objects just don't orbit
anywhere--ANYWHERE!!!!--near close enough to each other to make these
events even remotely possible. Not only are their orbits vastly
different in altitude and trajectory, it would be highly unlikely for
them all to be near each other in the same orbit. Oh, I almost forgot
to mention that Gravity also asks us to believe that the orbit of the
space debris intersected with that of the shuttle and was synchronized
with it.No way could Ryan Stone figure out how to operate a Soyuz capsule in a
few seconds of reading the manuals. No way could Ryan Stone figure out
how to operate the Chinese capsule just by poking around.Of lesser failures: Space debris traveling 20,000 miles an hour
relative to an observer is not going to be visible except *possibly* as
an indistinct cloud that passes by so fast the "observer" won't know
what hit them.For all of the CGI effort, I had hoped the Earth would look more
realistic and (naturally) beautiful.In closing, the special effects were great but the weak story relied on
too many absurd contrivances and the script contained no redeeming
dialog (sorry, George). On balance: 7 stars.
