Rekall here i come

It's truly awful and you will need a trip to Rekall after watching it
to wipe this horribly dull film from your mind after you have seen it.Arnie's version is now a classic this is rubbish and Philip K. Dick
will be spinning in his grave.There were some good moments up until the end of the car chase scene,
but after that this is a floater with one stupid, brain-numbing scene
after another.Without putting spoilers in this review lets just say in the future the
world is populated by too many stupid people and robot cops that can't
shoot to save themselves.Also no Johnny cabs :(
