8
very good and entertaining thriller

I felt like rating it as a ten simply to fight back against the haters,
but felt that it would be hypocritical to do exactly the opposite of
those who so easily award 1 or 2 stars when the movie is patently far
better than that.The action took a while to build up steam but was worth the wait. The
role of Jack did feel a bit contrived but this is a bloody thriller
after all. Strange that Blooms role as Jack should be criticized by
many as unbelievable but his biggest role, the one that launched his
career and made him famous, was that of an elf.The reason why I actually enjoy most movies, is because I can easily
suspend belief in what is (excluding documentaries, of course) after
all, a story made up to entertain people.The chief criteria for my enjoyment of a movie is, was I entertained by
it? Good writing, good acting and good production values all help
create the impression that I watched something worthwhile. If I am
entertained by the movie, I am far more forgiving of it's minor flaws.My wife and I discussed the reason for so much negative criticism and
considered it might well be because many of the Muslims were shown to
be human, an idea obviously anathema to many viewers. I myself lived in
Saudi Arabia for close to 10 years and understand that good and bad
reside almost equally in most humans and that it takes an act of will
to force oneself to rise above bigotry, greed and selfishness. I met
many Muslims who were good people by choice in my time in Saudi and
also many others I hope never to meet on this or any plane of existence
they might believe in. My wife and I agree on a score of 8.
