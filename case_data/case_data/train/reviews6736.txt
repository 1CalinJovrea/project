Very immersive disaster movie.

This is the true story of two different expeditions in 1996 who attempt
to scale Everest but encounter massive storms on the descent down the
mountain. Everest is a stunning looking film that you come away from ,
feeling totally exhausted. Because it is so realistic you do feel you
are with the climbers at times. Sure , it's a stock disaster movie but
because of the nature of the true story behind it , you feel more
connected. The special affects are amazing and the performances from
Jason Clarke and Keira Knightley are great too. I watched this in 3D
but ended up taking the glasses off because it was so annoyingly dark
so i recommend watching it in 2D instead. It's a staggering statistic
that 1 in 4 people who attempt to get get to the summit of Everest ,
dies. Why do people do it? that question is asked in this film but
apart from the stock answer of " Because it's there" it is never really
answered . Perhaps there isn't one?
