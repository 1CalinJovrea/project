It Worked...

shooting a whole movie form a pov perspective is something that doesn't
even work in theory.The Diving Bell and the Butterfly tried this and it
didn't work at least for me.it was impossible to shoot the whole movie
form pov and at the middle of it they start using other kinds of
shots.so i wasn't really excited for this movie but to my disbelieve it
worked really good.being an entertaining action movie and actually
entertaining you as an audience member.the characters are completely
goofy and over the top but believable enough that makes you accept
them.the plot is really simple but like mad max it works for the visual
fun and pleasure and the story throws twists and turns enough to keep
you interested in the main characters.the movie works like a video game
without the interaction which may make some people to prefer the video
games.but if your'e that type of person that actually likes the cut
aways in the video games and the plot of video games and isn't only
interested in shooting anyone in the video games this movie is made for
you.so buy the blu-ray,gather some friends and get entertained for a
hour and half of your life.
