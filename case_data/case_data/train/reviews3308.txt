A well-made film, an engrossing climax...

Although a little slow at times, El Cuerpo gradually unfolds to reveal
a dramatic plot. Then it culminates in a spellbinding climax. One might
still argue that the script produces way too many twists in the end. I
however don't think that fails to impress in any way. If anything,
playing with the viewers' mind only increases the anticipation for
suspense.The direction doesn't do much to the good, but the principal
characters(Alex and Jaime, played by Hugo Silva and Jose Coronado) do
compensate for these flaws. But the tension is kept reasonably high
thanks to the claustrophobia of the central setting (the morgue) and
the well written and acted clashes between Álex and Jaime. It's these
confrontations between the two men which are the highlight of the
movie. The very-in- control Jaime forcing the increasingly rebellious
Álex against the lockers near the beginning is genuinely exciting, and
sets a fine precedent for their encounters to come. Definitely worth
the watch.
