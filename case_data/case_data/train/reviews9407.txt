What a waste of time

I sat down and got all ready for a good horror movie. Too bad I chose
this one. With in 15 minutes I should have shut it down, but I didn't,
with the constant hope that it would turn around. It didn't. For those who want to see this, the basic premise is decent (young
people looking for a good underground-type Halloween haunted house) and
it could have been a great movie had it gone in a different direction.
But the acting, the writing, and ending fall short of anything less
than awful. (SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH) Let's discuss the ending. I do this in
hopes of deterring people from wasting their time. It's terrible. I
guess they thought being buried alive would make for a good ending. And
it happens in an instant. No real lead up or reason given as to why.
One minute they are in a haunted house, and at this point I thought it
was going to turn into a Hostel type movie, but no, they just end up in
coffins being buried alive. In my book, this sucks. For a better time go see your dentist.
