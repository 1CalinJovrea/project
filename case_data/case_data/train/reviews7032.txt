Incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large haystack

I've seen 104 movies so far in cinemas this year and I was wondering
all year long if I will ever see a movie which will truly deserve a
10-star rating. There were movies like Room, Hacksaw Ridge, Me Before
You, Sully or Arrival which are all great and therefore received 8 or
9-stars from me. But today I can safely say that I found my 10-star TOP
OF THE YEAR movie.Lion. An incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large
haystack. So powerful. Deeply moving. It's sad yet uplifting. Not going
to tell you the plot but you should definitely find a way to watch this
one. There are many strong moments in the movie but for me it was the
part when you realize what happened to main characters brother and what
impact it must have had in real life on their mothers life. As already
said: This is a movie based on real events.This will definitely be an awards contender. I also have to mention the
young Sunny Pawar. You will love him. His acting is phenomenal.
