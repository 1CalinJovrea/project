Terrible Propaganda

The watches' salesmen Billy "Billy" McMahon (Vince Vaughn) and Nick
Campbell (Owen Wilson) lose their jobs when the company where they work
is sold for losing market for the cellular. Billy and Nick do not have
skills but Billy fills the application for a summer internship at
Google. The candidates are divided into groups and Billy and Nick join
the team of outcast. Now they need to win the tough competition against
brilliant college students to be definitely hired by the company. "The Internship" is a terrible propaganda of Google, with a lame story
that uses clichés. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are great comedians but
this wrong marketing is too silly, absurd, long, illogic and annoying.
My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Os Estagiários" ("The Interns")
