Hopefully this is not the future of American cinema

I've given this my harshest rating yet. One wonders how something like
this abomination gets greenlighted. Although the overall concept of
focusing on Jackie in the immediate aftermath of the assassination
isn't a poor concept in theory (although one wonders what greater
understanding of the public would result, or of what value that would
actually be), in practice the film fails to convey much more than to
purport a great deal of alternating anger and helplessness (but not
grief) by JFK's widow.It uses a device throughout the film, that of showing Jackie's
performance in a televised tour of the White House, juxtaposed with
those feelings I have mentioned. The intent may be to show that Jackie
was just a phony, a hard bitch that chainsmoked and stomped around
ranting when she wasn't alone, walking zombielike around the West Wing
(but was not so self-absorbed that she didn't completely ignore her
children). If this is indeed the intent, it's an especially
mean-spirited way of doing it, as we are given only brief glimpses of a
living JFK.But what makes this a truly awful film is the script and the directing.
It's difficult to direct from a bad script, of course, but the
protracted use of extreme closeups with an accompanying ominous,
repetitious, pounding musical score makes the bad dialogue
cringeworthy. The most egregious examples of this occur in the scenes
with RFK and the priest. The words written for Bobby are particularly
unbelievable and out of character, and both Peter Sarsgaard and Natalie
Portman deliver their poorly-written lines with the effort one would
expect in a film that just represents a payday for everyone involved.It's unclear if any of the events and conversations depicted are
factual; but I have some real suspicions that the film makers just made
this stuff up. It's a soulless film that doesn't get or seem to want
any emotional investment from the audience, and once it's over with,
you just think, why spend all this time and effort on such a dismal
project?
