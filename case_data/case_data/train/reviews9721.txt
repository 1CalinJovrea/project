The heart is just a muscle.

PLOT SPOILERS Alex (Kate Winslet) is a photojournalist on her way to
her wedding. Ben (Idris Elba) is a neurosurgeon. That and being black
qualifies him to be an incompassionate HUD secretary. Make a review
short: Plane crash remote Rockies in winter. Don't eat dead pilot or
dog. What could have been a decent cannibal film (Where is Crispin
Glover?) is turned into a mediocre chick flick. They examine their
lives, their relationships, yadda yadda yadda, some more chick flick
stuff. Mila Kunis told us how they all have the same clich√© ending in
"Friends with Benefits." I really tried not to barf.Guide: F-word, sex. No nudity.
