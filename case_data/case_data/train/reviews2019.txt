A touching journey of a man who does feel like the man everybody thinks he is

I went into this movie with the only expectation that Jake Gyllenhaal
will give another fantastic performance, you now the usual with Jake.
What I wasn't expecting was the incredible performances from everybody
else. I thought that everybody in this movie did a fantastic job,
especially the girlfriend played by Tatiana Maslany. The story is about
Jeff Bauman ( Gyllenhaal) who lost both of his legs from the bombings,
and the films revolves around him coping with the aftermath. This movie
is about his struggles with having no legs and not about the actual
bombings like Peter Bergs " Patriots Day" starring Mark Wahlberg.
Stronger is a movie that I highly recommend to any fan of Gyllenhaal.
He is easily the best part of the movie and definitely deserve an Oscar
nomination for his performance.
