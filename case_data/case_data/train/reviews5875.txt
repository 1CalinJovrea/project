Well done, even though the title of the film suggests otherwise.

Burnt tells the story of a chef named, Adam Jones(Bradley Cooper).
During his youth, Adam Jones reached the pinnacle of his cooking
career. However, he ruins his career, due to his arrogant behavior &
addiction to alcohol & drugs. Adam Jones gets his act together &
returns to London. Here, he is determined to redeem himself by taking
over a top restaurant & earning three Michelin stars. Burnt is a great film. The professional kitchen environment has been
depicted accurately. All the food in the movie looks delicious. The
meticulous preparation & presentation of all the dishes make them look
mouth watering. After watching this film, you will feel like eating at
a fine dining restaurant. This film is very similar to Chef(2014) but,
I like Burnt better. There are a few elements of comedy in the movie
but, it is primarily a drama. Bradley Cooper is outstanding as Adam
Jones. Cooper portrays the chef's vulnerability, aggression & attention
to detail, flawlessly. Sienna Miller is brilliant as Helene. Daniel
Bruhl is superb as Tony. Riccardo Scamarcio is effective as Max. Omar
Sy is great as Michel. Sam Keeley is good as David. Matthew Rhys is
awesome as Reece. Emma Thompson is spectacular as Dr. Rosshilde. Alicia
Vikander is impressive as Anne Marie. Burnt is a must watch for all
foodies & aspiring chefs. Go feast your eyes on some delectable food!
