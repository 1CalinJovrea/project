Pure Garbage

People giving this film a 8 or 10 or even 7 amazing me to no end. They
must have an IQ of less than 50 for them to love a film where a filthy
mouth "teddy bear" is supposed to funny?If you think this film is great, and you think repeating the F word
over and over again is brilliant writing, with a paper thin plot, than
that speaks volumes of where you come from. Come to think of it. It you live in the sewers all your life, the smell
will not bother you anymore...since you are used to smelling the filth
that you have absorbed - then this film would be "great".. Just like
the places you have been dwelling most of your life...
