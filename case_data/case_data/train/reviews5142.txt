Poe-Faced

I'm only guessing but it seems that movie critics are getting 1)
younger and 2)less well educated than earlier generations. Certainly
the hack writing in the London Evening Standard seems to qualify on
both counts and reinforced my theory when she stated categorically that
Crimson Peak is not based on a classic novel. Maybe not but it is
definitely a rip-off of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall Of The House Of
Usher, albeit del Toro allows the house itself to remain standing but
does mimic Poe's classic in featuring a crumbling mansion inhabited by
a brother and sister who enjoy an incestuous relationship. Even the
period is close - within sixty or seventy years of Poe - so it might
have been titled The Serious Tilt Of The House of Usher. Apparently
it's had mixed reviews which means more or less than a percentage of
critics are happy to swallow del Toro's bulls**t.
