Vince Vaughn is great as the straight talking tough guy forced into an impossible position

Vince Vaughn does a great job of portraying a no-nonsense tough guy who
doesn't mince his words in this prison drama. I was surprised how much
i enjoyed this movie. His character brings to mind characters similar
to what Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood and the like have played. There
is a real intensity about this movie and his performance that is
lacking in many action films these days. The supporting cast were good
also but i thought Vince Vaughn totally carried this movie, which could
have been way worse but for what he brought to it. Highly recommended
for fans of old school movies of this genre.
