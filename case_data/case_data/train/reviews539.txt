Maybe a bit childish but enjoyable sci-fi tale none the less.

A bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to
really kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring
out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's
not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be.
Brad Bird doesn't disappoint.I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even
its message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science
should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being
annoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and
despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and
entertaining.I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to
fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to
save the world from the direction we're going in. I usually feel
there's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to
convince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive.
