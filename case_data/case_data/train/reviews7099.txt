Colossal Misfire

Wanted to like it, swear I did. Great concept (Anne Hathaway? Goofy
monster in Seoul? Cool, I'll check it out). I mean, IMDb called it SF
and Comedy. But, ah...no. It was as if the makers could never decide what this film
was? Was it a parable about how drinking can ruin your life?Nope. Okay, was it something about the monsters that live inside us?No so much. Good, dependable actors, doing their best in service to a
misbegotten idea. Who thought "Hey, we can make a comedy about a
relationship that turns abusive...and we get to punch Ann Hathaway a
couple of times!" The tone shifts were jarring and poorly thought out...and just made it
a waste of not only the viewer's time, but the actors', as well. Skip
it.
