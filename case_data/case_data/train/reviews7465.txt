Touching father son winter thriller

Directors Andrew J. Smith and Alex Smith (both of "The Slaughter Rule"
and "Winter in the Blood") have a sleeper of a thriller on their hands
that could gain Oscar momentum for them, stars Matt Bomer "Cal" (Magic
Mike XXL), relative new comer Josh Wiggins "David" (Lost in the Sun -
2016), and the Visual Effects team. While the story starts off
extremely slow, painting a picture of an estranged father son
relationship, the momentum changes when the reclusive dad and reluctant
city boy take off for a winter hunt in the snowy mountains of Montana.
It's at this point that Bomer's good looks and memorizing blue eyes,
and Wiggins "silent treatment" against his estranged parental figure,
fad away to reveal two individuals who must now bond together for
survival. Tied into this story is Cal's dad Clyde (quietly played by
the living Bill Pulman), who's story (told in grainy flashbacks) helps
provide the discussion that keeps Cal and David focused. Cinematography
by Todd McMullen ("The Leftovers" TV series) captures the beauty and
danger of their surrounds, while Visual Effects (by a number of
contributors) brings natures four legged creatures up close and
personal. Don't let the slow start of this film make you bored.
"Walking Out" is a quality thriller with a touching conclusion.
