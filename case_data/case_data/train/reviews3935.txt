Entertaining! But that's it.

Let me just begin by saying, this movie was worth the price of my
ticket. But that might just be because I got my ticket at 50% off.The world has seen millions of movies where USA comes under attack.
This was probably just a rehash of every single one of those movies.
There was nothing fresh, or new; there was no wow factor. Simply put,
the producers probably just took a bunch of pre-molded "Lego blocks"
that had already been overused in every other action movie, threw them
all together, made a new movie, and called it "White House Down".But that's not to say this movie was all bad. The undeniable chemistry
between Tatum and Foxx was like a consolation for a 99.9% cliché
storyline. The light humor between the two might have just given the
audience a couple of time-outs from the heart-thumping moments during
the movie's intense sequences, making the somewhat draggy, long-winded
two-hour film a little easier to sit through. But as mentioned, a
million clichés thrown together made the storyline absolutely
predictable, so don't expect any twists.In a nutshell, it's just a mashup of a whole series of music hits, in
movie form. But oh well, at least the mashup was decently done.
