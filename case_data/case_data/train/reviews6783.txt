Take These Broken Wings and Learn to Fly

I was several minutes into this film before I realized that it was
taken from the play 'Blackbird', which I saw some years back. Unlike so
many films adapted from plays, this one translates well, opening up
locations and characters not in the play. It works.The setup is intense. A young woman confronts the man, a grown neighbor
who seduced her when she was but 12 years old. They even planned to run
away together when things fell apart and he was sent to prison. Now he
has changed his name and put his life back together. But she is a mess,
understandably.And that's just the initial setup....The acting is solid. The writing and directing are first rate. If you
are OK with a movie about the emotional aftermath of child molestation,
this is a film worth seeing.
