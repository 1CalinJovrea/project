Beautiful film!

This is a step up from your usual horror NetFlix productions and
especially from other Stephen King translations. I mean it was a bomb!
And in the good way.So the movie itself has that 127 Hours touch, but far, far better than
expected. And without spoiling it to you, I have to say Gerald's Game
makes the most of everything. Not one detail is left untouched, the
usage of the entire environment, memories makes for a terrific viewing
experience. You'll be fed tension, scares, confusion, hope and denial, a beautiful
game indeed that you just have to be part of. And let me say one more
thing, the ending, that was just brilliant. The cherry on the cake. The
cold beer after a long hard day. Simply put: RECOMMENDED!Cheers!
