Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie should tickle your funny bone!

When I decided to watch this with my movie theatre-working friend, I
didn't really know much of what it was about other than it was based on
some books I never read and that it had a satirical bent concerning
superheros and kids' imagination in creating them. George and Harold
are a couple of pre-teen boys who love comics to the point of creating
the title character mentioned above. But the principal at their school
has had enough of their pranks and resolves to separate them by having
them in different classes. I'll stop there and just say this was quite
funny and maybe a bit touching in how some things get resolved. But the
fact the fourth wall is often broken seems a sure sign that nothing is
meant to be taken seriously. My friend had seen this before and liked
it enough to let me watch it with him. It really tickled my funny bone,
that's for sure! So on that note, I-and he-highly recommend Captain
Underpants: The First Epic Movie.
