Violent... and monotonous!

Don't get me wrong, i love Denzel Washington. I love every action flick
he plays in 'cause he brought such charisma on the big screen. This one
is an exception. I was ready to get pumped up by all the gore galore
and crazy fight choreographs... and it's not what i am expecting, at
all! The story is about a man named Bob McCall, a mysterious man i might
add, who stumbles upon the world of Russian gangster. He met a girl
named Teri, who is one of their prostitute, that one day got beaten.
Bob got furious and goes for vengeance against them.The movie got me all right, but i've never been so bored in my life.
Let's start from the action. It didn't work. It supposed to give me any
impact, yet i felt nothing. Blood are spurting everywhere, all right.
But, why do they have to make it so bland?The actors done all their things the script requires... nothing evoked
emotions from me. I blame the screenwriters for giving no depth and not
a single twist. Bad move!Although, there are several things i'm going to highlight, like the
camera-work. I loved Antoine Fuqua's style and it gives the movie more
dignity than it was. And some scene involving Chl√∂e Grace Moretz with
Denzel gave me a little bit interest for the dynamic they showed. I know Denzel Washington fans are going to love it, but just a fair
warning; it's not really fun to watch even if the violence pushes your
button. In the end, it's a bit of a dud.
