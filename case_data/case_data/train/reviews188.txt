Plain and simple....a good old fashioned ghost story!

The film did not disappoint! In a day and age where a scary movie is
about "how much blood and squirt out of a body and how far can it go",
it is refreshing to see this good old fashioned romp around a haunted
house.Things jump out at the right moments, the imagery is creepy and
disturbing. All the right makings to have people of all ages pulling
their hoodies down over their faces.The ending was Hollywoodized, but the move holds onto it's simple scary
imaginative fun....and the house is spectacular!...as is it's location.
