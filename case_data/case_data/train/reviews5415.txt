A beautifully filmed adaptation

Told from the rarely seen or heard from perspective of a female in the
times of war, U.K author Vera Brittain's memoir Testament of Youth
first published in 1933, has in the succeeding years become one of
literature's most renowned memoirs and arguably the quintessential
voice to the youth that found themselves in the midst of the world's
first all-encompassing war. Such a renowned piece of history, so loved
and well known by many, is a daunting prospect to adapt but first time
feature film director James Kent has crafted an elegant and quietly
devastating project that's acts as a touching tribute to Brittan's
memory and her touching writings.Filmed at a languid pace, now mostly foreign in modern day period
adaptations, Kent and cinematographer Rob Hardy have crafted an
artistic vision of Youth, perfectly encapsulating the wonders of
walking a college ground, life on an old English manor or the sadness
of a make shift medical ground that harbors the aftermath of life on
the front line in World War 1. It's a beautifully filmed movie, every
scene could be a painting and despite Youth's obvious budget
constraints, there's never a moment here that makes one feel as though
they're watching a film that is anything but high class. It's a credit
to Kent, Hardy and also screenwriter Juliette Towhidi that they manage
such a loaded and intelligent tale in the way they do and with a young,
talented cast, Youth shines a light on some growing acting up and
comers that will one day likely be members of the A-list.I for one have not been quiet in my growing praise for young Swedish
actress Alicia Vikander, and on the strength shown here by her as a
leading lady, there is now another reason to suggest Vikander is likely
to become one of our generation's greatest big screen talents. Imbuing
Vera with a grace, vulnerability and a stern determination (much like
the real life author), Vikander makes Vera her own, so much so it's
hard to imagine anyone else taking on the role. Everyone's favourite
GOT hero Jon Snow (Kit Harrington in real life) shows up here as Vera's
first love Roland and while he shows glimmers, Harrington feels a
little miscast here although against Vikander on such form, many would
pale in comparison. Another impressive member of the cast is young
actor Taron Egerton last seen as the Kingsman: Secret Service lead as
Vera's brother Edward and after the strength shown by him in Kingsman,
it's nice to see him back up that performance here.A harrowing Â– without ever being manipulative look at the horrors of
war, Testament of Youth is a considered and thoughtful examination of
Vera Brittain's revered words and while the film does fail in certain
instances (pacing sometimes an issue, fluidity also) the film is a
handsomely crafted drama with some fantastic lead turns that will
likely make it a new favourite to all those that prefer their BBC over
the E Network or HBO.4 unwanted pianos out of 5
