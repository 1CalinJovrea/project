Unbearable "mistakes" by movie characters

I was highly annoyed by the unprofessional and error-prone behaviour of
the movie characters. Throughout the movie, you will ask yourself: How
can he be so stupid? Why is she not doing the obvious? Why are the
astronauts emphasising proper procedures, then five seconds later
breaking their own rules? How come a former soldier is breaking the
chain of command? There is nothing realistic about the behaviour of
these characters. In the end, I just hated them. I do not believe that
there is a demographic that likes movies like this. Either the script
was written by an incompetent author, or the directors are ignorant of
what makes a good movie.
