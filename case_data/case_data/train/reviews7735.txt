Not a Ridley Scott Classic

I can't really believe that I just finished watching a Ridley Scott
science fiction movie and feeling this low, this one never felt like
anywhere close to any of his classics. This is just nothing but a
typical Hollywood s***. Matt did a poor performance as a character who
is caught in a life and death situation. He is not scared or emotional
but instead he keeps throwing Hollywood typical punch dialogues on your
face like an Avenger hero when you are expecting Science. A make-up
artist or a sound engineer from the set of "Big bang theory" would have
written better science script and dialogues. For me there are plenty of
"WTF" or "Seriously?" moments in this movie and I wonder what happened
to one of the favorite directors of all time. Also repetitive high
five/triumph scenes where we don't feel anything. To brief: Drag, bad
drama, insensitive emotional scenes, poor acting, very less science,
predictable and not at all funny punch dialogues! Just YIFY it, don't
buy!
