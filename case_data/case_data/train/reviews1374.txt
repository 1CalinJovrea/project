What the heck did I just watch?

As a die-hard fan of the Beautiful Creatures series, this movie was
completely and totally horrible, and almost painful to watch. The movie
was basically a Twilight-ified version of the books I loved. From the
complete absence of key characters (Marian, the Sisters, Reece, Mr.
Wate) to the ridiculous additions to the plot line (Ethan forgetting
Lena) and the major events and character aspects left out (Ridleys
lollipop, Larkin being Light, Macon being a Caster, Link killing Ethan,
and don't get me started about Genevieve killing Ethan!), this movie
was horrible. I understand that the director and the screenwriter were
allowed to take some liberties with the script, and some parts of the
book were just impossible to adapt into a movie, but this
'interpretation' was awful. I would not recommend this movie to anyone,
even someone I deeply disliked. I was close to getting up and leaving
the theater.
