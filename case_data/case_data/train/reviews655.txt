High Freakin Art, This Is...

This film is ridiculous. The story, the acting, the photography, the
editing, the music; it's all just ridiculously good. The most outstanding features are the acting and the writing. Out of
those, Jake's (I can't spell his last name) performance ranks up there
with the most memorable screen characters ever, characters like Travis
Bickle, Henry Chinasky (Barfly), Jeff Lebowski and Anthony Perkins'
Norman Bates. And there are absolutely no weak links in the film's
cast. Bill Paxton must be the safest bet in Hollywood, and for this
film he's a necessity. All the acting is on par with Paxton's, which
means it is all absolutely perfect, and inspired. Rene Russo is perfect
as well, and Riz Ahmed is so good that this one film will make him a
household name.The writing seems too good to be true. The dialogue is as memorable as
any movie's, and the story is so authentic that I thought this was
based on a book. Apparently, this story was written by the director, a
first timer. Watch the movie and I'm sure you'll ask yourself how
that's possible. Unless there was a deal with the devil involved, I
can't understand how such a great and developed story could come from
thin air. Maybe we're witnessing the debut of a game-changing director,
I don't know. What I do know is that Nightcrawler is one of my favorite
films ever, and nobody should have needed to read this much before
deciding to go see it.
