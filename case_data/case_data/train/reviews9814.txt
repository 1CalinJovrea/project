Well Executed Horror/Thriller *May contain light spoilers*

I've been watching every title I can on Netflix to find hidden gems for
a podcast I am putting together with another filmmaker buddy of mine. When he recommended this title to me, I was a bit skeptical. It had one
star on Netflix and less than a 6 on IMDb, which sets off red flags to
me. But I gave it a shot anyway and I am glad I did.First off, the acting was top-notch. Kudos to the actors Rose Leslie
and Harry Treadaway. They kept me engaged from the first act when the
story was getting set up and they really endeared me to their
characters. Very strong acting, I was impressed. The story is a mystery unfolding. You experience this mysterious shift
in this relationship that is previously established one way and we
cannot put a finger on why it is different now - and so I empathized
with Paul (the male lead) greatly, because I felt I was experiencing
this strange shift with him and neither of us could tell why. For me, the way the story resolves in the third act was great. It was
done in a way that not too many filmmakers dare embrace - vague, eerie,
dreadful. Without giving anything away, we see some really weird stuff
that solidifies the assumption that something is terribly wrong and
then we get an ending that I can understand others criticizing but
that, to me personally, I really appreciated. Honestly, I wish more filmmakers took this approach to the
horror/thriller genre. I hate how dumbed down things are sometimes and
how every little thing is spelled out in a lot of movies. Leave some
mystery, keep us guessing. Make it horrible in ways we aren't used to
and make it uncomfortable. The real horror is in never fully
understanding. Big props to writer/director Leigh Janiak and the other writer Phil
Graziadei on this one. I'll be watching them for future projects for
sure.
