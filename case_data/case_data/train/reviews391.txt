Bad

This movie is like a lot of similar type of movies; meaning movies that
aims to challenge preconceived notions of "what a lady should and
should't be like". It quickly becomes banal, predictable and
irritating. There's no depth of character here, because you sort of get
the gist of the jokes before they're halfway delivered. Having said
that; these kinds of movies can and have been saved by good
performances. Unfortunately Amy Schumer doesn't deliver that. I don't
know why scriptwriters and directors hit the same creative pitfalls
every time a movie like this is to be made. We get it: here's an urban
girl with a modern outlook on life who does what she wants, sleeps with
whom she wants and doesn't apologize for it, etc etc.. good, but then
what? A movie needs more than just a clich√© of a character, predictable
jokes and bad acting.
