When the Sequel is Better and Better

Perseus (Sam Worthington) and his son Helius live as fishermen in a
small village. One night, Zeus (Liam Neeson) visits Perseus and tells
that the gods are weaker since the humans do not pray for them anymore.
He tells that the walls of Tartarus are falling down in the underworld
and all the demons will be released on Earth and Kronos will escape
from his imprisonment. Zeus goes to the underworld with Poseidon (Danny Huston) to join forces
with Ares (Édgar Ramírez) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) but they are
betrayed and Zeus is captured. Poseidon escapes deadly wounded and
encounters Perseus in the Zeus' Temple. He gives his trident to Perseus
and advises him to meet his son and also demigod Agenor (Toby Kebbell)
in the kingdom of Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and ask him to guide
Perseus to find the fallen one. Together with Andromeda, they begin
their saga to release Zeus and avoid that Ares and Hades unleash the
ancient Titan Kronos. "Wrath of the Titans" is a sequel of "Clash of Titans" that is better
and better than the first film. The story is engaging and full of
action, with a great cast and magnificent CGI. "Wrath of the Titans" is
not a masterpiece but fans of the genre will certainly not be
disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Fúria de Titãs 2" ("Wrath of Titans 2")
