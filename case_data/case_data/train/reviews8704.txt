Literally, this movie made me purge

So, from where shall I begin? When I saw, for the first time, the
trailer, I had big expectations from this movie. The idea seemed to be
original, the trailer looked good, 2 great actors were in there. what
more could you ask for? But, apparently, even after I saw its rating on
IMDb and most of the critics categorized this movie as one of the worst
ones in this year, I still had a little hope that they might be wrong
and I'll enjoy this flick Nope, that wasn't true at all. After first 30
minutes, with a slow pacing acting and flawed situations,with
unbelievable plot holes, I just gave up. I was convinced that this
movie is one of the biggest failures of this year, standing next to
After Earth. The acting, which is one of the main things in a movie,
was so unconvincing and stupid, with pretty much lame dialogs.. oh god,
I can't even talk about it. Plus, the situations the characters were
involved into, were so illogically dumb and mediocre, which would make
you feel like throwing up. And, of course, the "purgers". HAHA. nothing
scary, nothing creepy, just some bunch of kids wearing masks, acting
like they just got out of circus and making all those goofy jumps.
C'mon, let's be serious. Even a 5 y/o kid wouldn't consider this movie,
in any way, creepy, whether, scary. To conclude this, The Purge sucks
BIG A**
