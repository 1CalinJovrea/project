Will surely scare the daylight out of you // instagram: moviesmaniax

If The Sixth Sense scared the sh*t out of you when going to toilet at
night, or Paranormal Activity made you afraid to stay at home alone, It
Follows will definitely creep you out when walking back alone at night.
After I saw this film, I would definitely run my ass off if I see
anyone walking slowly behind me late at night. This film is a truly
modern classic with its original and brilliant concept, all of which is
put together nicely with its expertly directing and thought-provoking
scares. The SCARES here are effective throughout thanks largely to its
excellent soundtrack and intense sound effects that even though you can
tell something is coming from its increasing volume of the music, but
it will still effectively shock and gives you the chill down your
spines when it happens. There are not many GORY scenes here but once it
happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It
Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one
of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing,
concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works
perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the
scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare
the daylight out of you.>>A-<<
