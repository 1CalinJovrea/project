Beyond bad! Whether it was the material that defeated him or simply
working in English from a script that was never that good in the first
place, Pablo Larrain's "Jackie" is a classic example of how not to
attempt a biopic but then, of course, this isn't really a biopic at all
but an account of the Kennedy assassination and the events immediately
following it as told to a journalist by Jackie herself.In the title role Natalie Portman does bear some physical resemblance
to her character but she, too, is defeated by the demands of the part;
this isn't acting but mimicry and other fine actors follow suit. People
who really ought to know better approach their roles as if this were
sacred text and as if to compound the miserableness we have to endure a
ponderous, yet Oscar-nominated by Mica Levi. Avoid at all costs.
