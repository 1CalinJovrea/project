A Bit Thin

Interesting enough as time travel with aliens movie but not really
enough good ideas and does not contain much novel material. What a film
that is supposed to be about CGI spectacle and strange aliens has to be
fancy ar**ed about sixties cultural references - lord only knows. The
plot revolves around 'The Terminator', eg Will Smith has to go back in
time to prevent the Tommy Lee Jones characte being killed by his arch
nemesis Boris, who has escaped top security jail on the Moon! The Boris
character is not played by Tim Curry but nevertheless is way over the
top but not truly original or menacing enough. Most of it is a
conventional 'Let's save the Earth from a Napoleon-complex mega
baddie.' And it is terribly thin on spectacle as it arcs its way to the
final showdown at Cape Canaveral. Good jokes for adults and an
excellent lookalike and soundalike performance by Josh Brolin as the
young Tommy Lee Jones, but film wastes 3D - and the price at the Odeon
Putney was a total rip off - Â£10!!!!!! Not good enough by half.
