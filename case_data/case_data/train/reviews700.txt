Don't think of it as a movie, its more of a vacation- their vacation

Frank Sinatra pioneered the idea of having a great Vegas Vacation-at
someone else's expense. George Clooney perfected it. First you get some
of your big-name friends, Dino, Sammy, Joey and Peter and make a movie
in Vegas. It has to be a comedy-drama. Not a true comedy because that
requires work on timing and getting the comedy just right. Not a true
drama because it requires intensity and effort. More of a light drama.
With these guys (Freeman, Douglas, Klein, Steinbergen and DeNiro,
Academy Award winners all) they can effortlessly shoot every scene in
one take, two at the most. The result is mediocrity at its worst. It is
neither funny nor dramatic. Everyone is walking through the motions, so
they can continue their vacation. Atyour expense. People will pay to
see it because of these fine actors' history of fine work. This is not
fine work. They are on vacation and you're paying for it.
