Absolutely Horrible!

I watched this movie last night on my TV cable. Thank god I don't have
to wasted money on it, since it is the worst romantic comedy movie
ever. I turned off the channel after half of the movie because cant
stand the sexism of the writing. It is so bad its gives me headache.
And I already know how it will end, with the girl leaving her bf for
this man. The lead characters has no chemistry, and many characters are
there for their name only without any contribution for the story. From
the first scene, the story depicts a low life main character who views
women as sex object, I hate him. Then he met this gorgeous girl who has
a bf and fall in love. How clich√© is that? Chris Evan an Monica has no
chemistry at all, I fell no sympathy at all for his character, and I
don't feel sympathy at all for the girl either. They are both cheating
snobs who deserve each other. A sexual predator and a cheating girl.
What romantic about that at all? For real? If it is a real world, we
can imagine that the next thing will happened is a 911 call for
domestic violence. Since the man only view woman as sexual object of
course. This movie is sexism and describe the reason why you should
stay away from guys like the main character. They are sociopath and
only cared about themselves. Avoid it and skip it whenever it pops in
your TV cable.
