Terrible!

I can't understand how so many people loved this movie. I was really
looking forward to a funny, over the top action film, but Kingsman left
a lot to be desired. For starters the women in this movie are all
portrayed as being completely helpless. (Eggsy's useless mother, his
friend in the Kingsman who can't seem to get anything done without
reassurance from Eggsy and obviously the very dignified princess who
happily offers Eggsy anal in exchange for him saving the world...fml).
I was actually freaked out by the number of teenagers who thought the
multiple scenes of mass murder of innocent people for absolutely no
reason were hilarious. Of course the fact that those people's heads
exploded into colorful fireworks probably helped. Lastly, what's a
comedy without a little vomit humor and mocking individuals with speech
impediments. I lost a lot of respect for Colin Firth for this one.
