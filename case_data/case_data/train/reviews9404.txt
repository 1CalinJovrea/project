I'm at a loss as to how to describe this movie.

I went to see this movie with my friend. I would consider that we both
have a good sense of humor and are open to all sorts of jokes. I have
seen other movies by Sacha Baron Cohen, like Bruno and Borat. I found
Borat to be hilarious, but Bruno was a bit over the top for me. This
movie strikes a balance between the two, but leans more towards (my
personally favored) Borat side.The comedy in this movie is both hilarious and uncomfortable at times.
It has the same LOL- quality as it did in Borat, but there are scenes
where the comedy is so crude that it is almost uncomfortable
watching/listening to it. The movie is definitely funny, but you will
not enjoy it if you do not find jokes about racism and stereotypes
funny.The plot is your typical Sacha Baron Cohen plot; a person from an
entirely different culture travels to America and you watch how
incompatible the two cultures are. Also, just like most of Sacha Baron
Cohen movies, there is a love story intertwined. It's not the dramatic
and sensitive kind of love story though. The plot itself is not very
immersive, and I believe that its only purpose is to lead you to the
funny parts.I will say this though, the ending speech of this movie given by 'The
Dictator' really impressed me. It made me realize how well Sacha Baron
Cohen understands politics and stereotypes. You have to hear it for
yourself.If you're looking for a movie with consistent but crude laugh-out-loud
comedy, but do not look for a serious and powerful plot, then you will
enjoy this film. On the other hand, if you cringe at racist and
stereotype jokes, you will be covering your ears virtually the entire
movie.Approach with an open mind.
