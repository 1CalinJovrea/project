Mama has flaws, but great concept

I really liked this movie and the concept for it was original. I think
this film makes the viewer think about what the characteristics are of
being a mother. What sort of instincts we as woman can display and what
kind of connections can be made with a child, even if you're a
terrifying ghost.Del Toro will always put his name on a good thriller surrounding small
children. This movie had all the thrills of a scary movie and the
elements fright used in the film had everyone in my theater on the edge
of the seat. The movie waist no time getting into the meat of the
story.There are flaws in the film and it does have to do with plot holes. The
director could have worked these holes out with other writers......like
Del Toro perhaps. The back story had the hugest gap of all.Regardless, it was better than 'Don't be Afraid of the Dark', and I
will be seeing this film again.
