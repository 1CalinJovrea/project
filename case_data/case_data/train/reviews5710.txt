Just plain awful

This was easily one of the worst movies I have ever been to. What else
can be said. Everything about it was just awful. And I went in knowing
it was going to be a terrible story, but maybe I would enjoy the
special effects and action scenes. Unfortunately, a man-dog wearing
eyeliner roller skating in the air fighting bad guys looks as
ridiculous and dumb as it sounds. Mila Kunis felt completely miscast
and had no chemistry with Channing Tatum, who was playing the same
boring dumb hero he always does. The action sequences were a mess...
impossible to tell what was going on.I watch a lot of movies and have only walked out on a handful in my
life, but I could not make it through more than 70 minutes of this
ridiculous film. Don't waste your time. It's awful.It boggles my mind how a movie like this gets made. Someone please stop
these two from making any more!
