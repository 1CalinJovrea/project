Atmosphere or hot air?

I see that some of the reviews say the film has great atmosphere. I
guess that's what you call taking very long pauses before delivering
lines and taking long camera strolls down steps and hallways. If an
ominous soundtrack is added behind that, you're given the feeling that
something scary is happening when really, most of the time, nothing is
happening. The acting was quite good with lead character, Shipka, doing
a smashing job of playing someone who isn't quite all there. The ending
leaves one scratching the head. Is it a response to loneliness or
regret or awareness? Unsatisfying. While better than your average
slasher flick, it is not the "horror masterpiece" that was promised on
the cover of the DVD case.
