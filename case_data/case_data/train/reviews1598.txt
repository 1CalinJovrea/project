Funny perfect follow up to the original

Pitch Perfect 2 is just as much fun as the first one. Kudos to
Elizabeth Banks for her first directing role. This time our favourite
Capella band are performing in front of the president and his wife. A
wardrobe malfunction see's them banned from competing in the US there
only hope a competition taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark.What can I say about this film? I thought it was just as much fun as
the original, the story plays out at just the right pace, all our
favourite characters return for another outing, including Elizabeth
Banks herself as the TV Presenter Gail.If you liked the first film you will like this one also.
