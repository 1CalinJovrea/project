THE Film of the year

This is one of the few films that has held me in my seat from beginning
to very end even when half way through I desperately needed to visit
the bathroom . The storyline, script, filming and acting combine into
the perfect storm of a brilliant film. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a
character, on what I can only describe as at the higher end of the
autistic spectrum and deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. His
character is perfectly matched by Rene Russo playing the role of her
career as the success seeking ageing news editor. And a shout too for
Riz Ahmed as Rick, Gyllenhaal's assistant. What a contrast to "The
Judge" which I saw last week, "Nightcrawler" is superior on every
level, go see !
