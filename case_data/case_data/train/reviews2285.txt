Really funny if you love this this type of humor and are a fan of the vacation series

MINOR SPOILERS I love the Vacation movies. In fact, "National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation" is one of my favorite Christmas movies. And this
movie did not disappoint me.This movie was really funny. It was classic Vacation humor and
conflict. The movie still reminded you of the Vacation that came out
many years ago. The jokes were funny and you laughed quite a bit. And
the trouble and all the stuff that went wrong just reminded you even
more of the original Vacation films. This movie was very raunchy and it
was also rated R unlike the other Vacation films which made the movie
even funnier with the inappropriate sexual humor and the coarse
language.The cameos were awesome in this film. Chevy Chase, Charlie Day, Norman
Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key, and Michael Pena were all very funny
(especially Day) and were great cameos to have in the film.Besides the cameos, the film had some good acting too. Ed Helms,
Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, and Chris Hemsworth all did great
and were funny. But the actor who stole the show was Steele Stebbins.
He was hilarious and I laughed at nearly everything he said. He was a
great and hysterical child actor and I hope to see him in more films to
come.I loved in this film how they gave you little flashbacks of the past
Vacation movies because it gave you a good feeling of when you were
watching the originals and how much you laughed. It was a great
addition to the movie and made the film have that touch of the past
that everyone loves.If you love raunchy and dirty humor and you loved the original Vacation
movies, then you will love and enjoy this comedy film.
