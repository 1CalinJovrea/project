Disappointing

I saw this movie last night with my girlfriend and we were expecting a
romantic comedy but what we saw did not have much romance or comedy.This movie is about an unappealing and dull surgeon that (for some
reason that I never understood) fell in "love" with a completely
unappealing, dull, dumb free-spirited woman that doesn't seemed to have
absolutely nothing in common with. That's the main problem with this movie. Amy Schumer's character is
completely unlikeable the whole movie and I keep trying to figure out
what the men that went out with her saw in her!! There was absolutely
nothing attractive, cute, charming, spunky and/or wise about her
personality. To make things worse she is not physically attractive. I
know her character is supposed to be unlikeable, but dammit not the
whole movie!!The second problem with the movie is fails as a romantic one. I did not
feel anything for the characters. They did not have anything in common
and I am still trying figuring out how the hell they clicked. For this
I blame the script. The are not enough situations in the movie showing
how their connection grow. They had nothing in common!! They just had
dinner and sex and they love each other. Did I mention that there was
absolutely nothing attractive, cute, charming, spunky and/or wise about
Amy's personality and to make things worse she is not physically
attractive. When the doctor told Amy "I love you" I rolled up my eyes
in disbelief.The movie is also way too long and in many parts slow and boring. We
laugh about four times during the whole movie. Many people left the
cinema half way through.I did enjoy Tilda Swinton's Dianna.While watching this movie I kept thinking about "When Harry met Sally"
a far superior film.
