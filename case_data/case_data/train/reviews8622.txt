Poor outcome with dreadful script

As many others I played the Assassins Creed games and was looking
forward to this film however it is safe to say that I was extremely
disappointed. No matter if you have played the games or not this film
was awful. First things first the script is poor. If I hadn't played
the games I would have struggled to understand many of the references.
The script is vague and confusing in parts which led to a man who sat
in front of me leaving half way through (I wish I did the same).
Although I am a fan of Michael Fassbender the quality of the writing
meant he was wasted in this film. When it comes to the special effects
the use of CGI was average. The fighting sequences weren't as good as I
expected as it wasn't clear what was happening. The overall story was
disappointing and the fact that there will be a sequel made it even
more disappointing. I hate to compare but the games were good and the
film was rubbish. I would not advise wasting time watching this.
Please. For your sake.
