Loved this Movie

Loved Loved Loved this movie!Great tongue in cheek movie. Viago was a great character trying to keep
his flatmates in check. All the actors did a great job. Petyr was my
favourite 8000 year old vampire. Bringing references to Twilight was
funny.Wasn't too sure about it at first but watching it again was enjoyable.
Will be one movie to watch over and over again.Throw some werewolves and zombies into the mix. The werewolves are
funny by asking why they didn't wear large track pants and combo locks.
All in a day.
