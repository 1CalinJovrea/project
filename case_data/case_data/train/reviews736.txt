"Your sweat smells like cinnamon . . . "

. . . may be stereotypical L Words, but PITCH PERFECT 2 tops its
predecessor as the most harmonious A Cappella flick ever. The Germans
shape up so well in the early going that their eventual showdown with
the Barden Belles seems sure to be a David versus Goliath affair,
fought entirely on a totally sandy shore this time. Put another way,
it's the Nazi Blitzkrieg against France. At my showing, film goers were
on the edge of their seats, fearing that the Na--oops, that the Germans
would win, or, worse, that the Belles would be called the winners on
some sort of technicality, when they had been clearly out-classed.
However, due to clever writing and innovative thinking, this sequel
produces a crowd-pleasing climax that seems not only plausible but
well-earned. Though the life of these Belles beyond their competitions
still seems a little too pat and Tinsel Townish, their Hollywood ending
on the World Stage is 100% satisfying.
