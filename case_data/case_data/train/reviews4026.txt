Awful

Sorry but this movie misses the mark big time. Compared to the 2005
Movie which was perfect, this one is just really bad.The story is OK but not executed well. The characters are not as
portrayed in Marvel. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, why? Political
correctness gone mad. Johnny Storm was not a black man.Kate Mara compared to Jessica Alba? Well there is no comparison really.
And Ben Grimm is really just some overdone cgi, nothing compared to
Michael Chiklis brilliant portrayal in the earlier movies.The biggest question about this movie for me is why? Why was it made
when the 2005 version got it so right?
