Slapstick at its best

To remove all doubts, this is no masterpiece, no one making it pretends
it is. This is simply a good fun movie that doesn't insult its viewers
intellect. About 90 minutes of shameless slapstick, that's both clever
and never resorts to vulgarity, even though some fart jokes do squeeze
in. As far as I'm concerned this is as good as directing animation can
get, considering the fact that one of the two directors does the
minion's voices this means more than just technical knowhow and good
control over the movie's pace. This is good comedy, and comedy as we
all know "is hard". So don't underestimate some plain good fun and the
absence of pretension is in my book one more big plus. Bottom line, for
me, this is the best animation movie I've seen this year, tied with Big
Hero 6, though it's considered 2014. I simply count the last 12 months.
