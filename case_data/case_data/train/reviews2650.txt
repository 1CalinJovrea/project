Jack Reacher is an entertaining throwback

There was a timelet's call it "The 80s"when action movies didn't need
CGI cheats, shaky-cam and ADD-editing to entertain us. They also didn't
have to destroy ten city blocks, have a "clever" hook or feel the need
to tack on a social message to justify their carnage. No, all they
needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a
star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in
spades.Maybe this won't appeal to the eGeneration who need to have their
senses constantly bombarded, but for the rest of us, Jack Reacher is a
solid bit of retro-refreshment.
