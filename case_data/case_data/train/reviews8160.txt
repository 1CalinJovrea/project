Stay Away At All Costs

Do Not See This Film. I know the storyline looks somewhat interesting,
but if you do not get into movies for free you will hate yourself then
the movie for doing so. I only saw this because I am an employee at a
movie theater and saw it at an employee showing for Free and I still
was taken over by a rush of hatred and stupidity on my part that
thinking the Purge could somehow be a decent film. So many ideas that
are wrong in the first place. 1) the idea of 12 hours of legalized
crime is absurd. 2) Runtime is way to short. Cannot make the viewer
believe or a better word relate to the concept of legalized crime in
that small amount of time. 3) killing people is not going to release
the anger that is inside of you. I can say more but I shouldn't have to
so I won't. This is my WARNING to stay away and wait for DVD. Save
money, actually enjoy yourself, and whatever you do, do not purge!!
