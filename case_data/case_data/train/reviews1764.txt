Big Hero Big Family Fun

Having the opportunity to view this film twice really helped me get a
perspective of the film that many may not have right now. This film is
not FROZEN... it is not filled with songs or magical snowmen.But this film has something else, it has family, friends, action ,
drama, and most of all a big robot named Baymax who will examine your
funny bone and sense of humor . The film shows what kind of magic
Disney can do with super hero's . The story is fast paced for the most
part and the laughs and entertainment are high flying, that is if you
like heights , but if you don't its OK because this movie knows how to
get down also. The characters work well with each other, kinda like the scooby doo
crowd but twist that with a bit of incredibles and you have a fun
filled, action packed movie that will delight boys and girls of all
ages and keep parents happy that they took their child to see this. I
know my family and I enjoyed it twice and will be back for multiple
viewings.
