A very worthy remake.

We should all know the rundown by now...Carrie is the remake of the 

1976 cult classic flick by the same name, which was based on the famous 

Stephen King novel. In the '76 movie, Sissy Spacek plays the outcast 

teen-aged girl, abused by her classmates in school and by her mother at 

home, until she discovers her psychic powers...then all hell breaks 

loose. It's a classic revenge tale, and the original movie was good 

enough to earn Spacek an Oscar. 



Know this: the 2013 version isn't a direct remake of the '76 movie. 

While it does feel like a loving homage to the older flick, it actually 

stays closer to the book in terms of plot, with some modern touches 

perfectly sprinkled in, allowing Carrie White to feel right at home in 

2013. 



Now know this: This movie is good. Very good.



Julianne Moore takes us to a very creepy place as Margaret White, and 

ChloÃ« Grace Moretz SHINES as Carrie, proving that she's got more up her 

acting sleeves than Hit-Girl. By the time you get to the end of this 

movie, even though you know damn well what's going to happen...you WANT 

the prom to go smoothly. You WANT Carrie to be happy, and you HOPE that 

none of those terrible things actually happen. You're in Carrie's 

corner the whole way.



And when revenge time comes along, it's done with a purpose. Special 

effects get dabbed in here and there, but never overdone. (Slo-mo makes 

one scene sooo much more deliciously satisfying...) Although I'll say 

that it feels like there may have been a scene or two that didn't make 

the final edit, and you can really tell where that scene was...a bit 

sloppy on that editing there...



Carrie does the source material justice. Welcome to our generation, Ms. 

Carrie White.



4 out of 5 on the BDBOS.
