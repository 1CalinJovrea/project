The most beautiful looking film of 2013

I saw this movie on a special sneak preview event. I admit being
utterly mesmerized by some of the trailers. I did really enjoy the
film. It has a nice message and is definitely a feel good movie. There
is nothing wrong with that. For me, this is the most beautifully
looking film I've seen this year. The cinematography and camera shots
were fantastic - right up there with Life of Pi and Gravity. It's
definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I personally enjoyed Ben
Stiller in a more serious role. The film has comedic elements but
everything is a bit more subtle and reflective of a man trying to find
his inner courage and voice.
