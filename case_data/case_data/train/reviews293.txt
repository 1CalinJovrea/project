The usual, typical, and clich√© teen flick but the character is worth watching.

No doubt the plot was more or less the same story of a not hot girl (a
DUFF in 2015) try to change herself then lose her friend but finally
discover that this isn't herself and end up with the guy who she did
not target in the first place. You can figure all this out from the
first 5 minutes of the movie.However, the real charm and entertaining is within the 2 main character
Bianca and Wesly (the only two character that actually have a role).
Bianca was awkwardly funny and smart while Wesly was cheeky, idiot and
cutest. Together they are amusing, charming, and realistic probably one
of the best couple in my list right now. I think what really attract people to the movies was the insider that
it is damn true about a DUFF (apparently I am one). It is another
entertaining teen flick movie but just don't expect anything new from
it then you will ended the movie with pleasure and a little blush.
