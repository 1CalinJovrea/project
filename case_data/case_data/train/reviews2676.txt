This movie is a bad joke

This was the last time I watched a movie based on IMDb ratings.
Seriously. If you are 15 years old , you may watch this pile of...
otherwise... Acting sucks, gangsters are brainless idiots, plot is
terrible. "Russian" language? Hollywood, can you at least once hire OK
Russian-speaking people? Hellooo??!! Just "a few" notable moments:John Wick is a killer, ghost man, he can kill three man armed only with
a pencil, but somehow manages to overlook a couple of brainless thugs
hack into his house, lets them beat the crap out of himself, kill his
dog and steal his car, wow...John Wick is so famous that even the policeman, the bartenders, the
mafia, all the town knew him, but the son of a mafia boss for some
reason did not even hear about him! John Wick is very skillful , he managed to do impossible task, he can
head shot everyone in the dark, but then he somehow manages to miss
five times in a row at Iosef, incredible...John Wick is a ruthless killer, he wants to kill everyone, but when he
encounters a female assassin, he decides to leave her alive. How
touching.Viggo, mafia boss, hires most professional killers and puts 4 million
bounty on John's head, but when he captures him, he decides to play a
little bit and leaves him with only two imbecile guards, seriously? If you have more than a couple of brain cells, do yourself a favor and
do not waste time and money on this garbage.
