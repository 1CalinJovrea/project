Just more superhero garbage...

Now I'm not a huge fan of superhero flicks, so maybe there's something
I'm missing here. But walking out of the theater, all I felt was that I
had seen 2.5 hours of nothing but action and drama. Maybe that's its
purpose? Maybe it's just not my cup of tea? For whatever reason, I was
not invested. This is hardly an interesting or exciting film, and I see
no reason for the rave reviews or exceptional $$ it is making.I suppose it has something to do with being a "fan"; as I said earlier,
I am in no way a "fan" of hero movies but this one got such good
reviews that I had to check it out. I was disappointed because,
surprise surprise, it felt EXACTLY like every other superhero movie
that had ever been made. Even more so since its a combination of all of
the previous heroes into one film. So really, it's not original, or
different, or exciting, or moving, or anything. It just IS.
