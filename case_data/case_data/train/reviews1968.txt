why are there so many bad reviews?

This film was genuinely funny. What's the problem? That the film
questions religious beliefs? Or that it makes references to previous
and modern-day conflicts? Or was it the profanity? I like to think that
well-placed swear words only add substance and make us feel alive. I
abhor films that use "gosh darn it" or "friggin'" or some other
avoidables. Say it like you mean it. I was thoroughly impressed by how
the film managed to assign a backstory to each product, in line with
their country/region of origin. There are so many details I am sure I
overlooked that I will definitely have see it at least a couple of more
times.Good job, guys.
