A contrary view to the popular acclaim

The box office takings and the almost universal acclaim from the
critics for this movie - see eg
http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/gravity-m100091079 would suggest that
this is a must see - well here is a contrary view.This may be from an age perspective (I was at school watching TV when
that Armstrong guy sang 'I was walking on the moon one day' in July
1969) - and for the first 20 minutes we have a similar light hearted
banter from G. Clooney, who while being highly space savvy is, unlike
that original space larrikin, just plain annoying as he tries to
emulate past heroes as he calms and guides S.Bullock through a
predictable and ongoing series of high impact incidents. A handsome
show off, with a serious penchant for rescuing damsels in distress,
sits naturally with our George, whatever the state of his pulse.But the movie is really about Bullock's character, and she is an actor
capable of both great comedy and feeling (often within the same work)
but here she is just not believable with the exception of the initial
panic scenes that do get everyone's heart racing for a short time. In
dealing with loss she has suffered on earth and in facing eternity in
space, neither portrayal is credible. Weaver in Aliens or Hanks in Apollo 13 - those were stories that really
got to you (well, me anyway) but at the end of this its all a bit so
what?A very honorable exception for the cinematography, especially if you
see it in the IMAX or 3D versions which really do give you a new
perspective on space - but well deployed technology alone does not a
movie make.I give it 4 out of 10 - slightly disappointed at something that could
have been so much better. I appreciate most of the world seems to
disagree with my view.
