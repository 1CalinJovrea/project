Funny and Sweet, like Wall-E mixed with a zombie movie

And they said you couldn't have a zombie romance story. Take that
vampires! The zombie R was surprisingly strong, but sensitive, sweet, loving, and
protective. He wanted to talk to the pretty girl but had trouble
finding the words, or at least vocalizing them. His determination and
frantic antics were endearing.Julie was not some wussy victim or brainless babe. It made me happy to
see she was tough and could take care of herself. She had a rebellious
streak that made her entertaining to watch and a softer affectionate
side that showed itself with R.I can honestly say I liked both characters and wanted to see them
succeed. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where R eats the brains and we saw
more of Julie, her old boyfriend, her father, and how they all fit
together. It was heart felt and well-done. The relationships and the
complexity of them was less evident in the movie than in the book but I
could still feel it. If you liked the movie I highly suggest reading
the book, by the way.Warm Bodies was well paced and acted, and one of the better zombie
movies I have seen. Watch it, and provided you aren't dead inside, be
overcome by it's cuteness! I can't say enough times - read the book!
Read the book! Read the book! Okay I'm done.
