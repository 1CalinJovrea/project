Complicated

The Gambler was a difficult film to rate. It was a movie that not
everyone is going to like because not everyone is going to relate to
Mark Wahlberg's character. It was a hard movie to understand. After
seeing this movie you will either love it or hate it. There is really
no in between. You really had to connect with the main character and
his personality, and that's not possible for everyone. I really enjoyed
the film because i really connected with it, but that is not going to
be the case for everyone. I would highly recommend seeing it just to
take the chance of loving it. Just like the gambling theme of the
movie, seeing the movie will be a gamble for you.
