Great Movie, emotional tribute to Paul, overall excellent action sequences

The opening scene in the movie showed Jason Statham who should be the
main villain but his character was not shown much power after the
terrorist showed up. Like always Vin diesel's entry was good. The
digital face making of Paul was an excellent job. The action sequence
from the Ehthiad towers was mind blowing. For me it was the best scene.
The ending part was too long nd at some point it was like when is this
gonna end. But the way they ended the movie with a Paul Walker tribute
was epic. Many of them cried at his short video...Me too. I I hope
there will be a continuation to this movie because till now Jason
Statham is not killed he is just prisoned and the way they showed his
character i think there will be and 8 part waiting for Fast and Furious
