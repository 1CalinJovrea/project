Hard to consider this a drama

I'm torn. I think I got maybe some deep thoughts and themes out of this
movie, but on the other hand I'm disturbed and disgusted. If I have to
rate it as a drama then maybe a 3 or 4. As porn.... I don't know. Don't
watch porn so don't know if it was a good one or not. Yes, it can be
arousing at some moments, but then something happens that changes the
direction of the story. I guess it's hard for people like Joe. If I
would be a nymphomaniac I would be a bad one because of my shy
personality. I would die just because I couldn't get sex and that would
drive me mad, probably. In the ending she could have just hit the old
man to knock him out and run away, don 't think that there was a need
to shoot him. But maybe he deserved it.
