Surprisingly good

Wasn't expecting to enjoy this film but I was rapt soon in, fabulous
acting and brilliant images, what a feast for the eyes and an adventure
that dragged you along, (so not my normally my kind of thing) but
amazing and recommended to everyone, the visuals are amazing, very
stunning film
