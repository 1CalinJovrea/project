Great story, good effort, but poor result

The story could have been very dramatic and deeply touching, as it is a
true story of both the internal conflicts of a man and the deep love of
a woman to her partner. Unfortunately the meticulous attention to image
rather than screenplay (to me) resulted in a quite cold and un-
engaging movie, where beautiful costumes, interiors and landscapes are
the only highlights. I found that even the acting of the brilliant
young Eddie Redmayne was not that good, as his constant smiles and shy
blinking eyes after a while seem to be the only stratagem he has to
portray such a complex character (and after the first dozen of them I
couldn't stand it anymore). A more sophisticated psychological portrait
of the main character and a more dramatic rendition of his/her troubled
soul would have given more solidity to a movie which seems too
superficial.
