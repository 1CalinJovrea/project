Relatable and Entertaining

Project X is a film that, on paper, does not appeal to me at all. I
predicted it to be a low budget film with some unmemorable gags and a
poor plot. I was wrong. It was a surprisingly good film. The plot did,
as anticipated, contain several holes and you couldn't help thinking
"surely that wouldn't have happened" but after all it was based on a
true story.The film is based on some unpopular high school students, (Thomas,
Costa and JB) who throw a party when one of their parents goes away for
the weekend and it quickly escalates out of control. The film is
seemingly shot by their friend Dex on a portable camera and some other
videos in a documentary style sequence. There is a good balance of
dialogue, montages of general party mayhem and Thomas completely
stressing out and the films great for watching with a few of the lads.The three of us who watched it were laughing consistently throughout
the film and many of the characters were very relatable. Overall
(despite being extremely far-fetched) the film was relatable, although
I was hoping for a bit more development on the morning after the party.Don't watch this film if you're looking for artistic credit, watch it
to be entertained. This wouldn't have been a film I would have picked
out myself but after watching it I would recommend it, although not one
to watch with the family.
