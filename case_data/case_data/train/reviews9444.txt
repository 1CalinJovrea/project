Forced, Awkward, Underwhelming, Disappointed

First off, let me start by saying that I loved the first film and it is
my favorite movie...........EVER! I had such high hopes after seeing
the first one. Once I saw the trailer a few months ago I lowered them
due to some of the characters no longer resembling themselves (with
aging considered). I should have lowered my expectations even more.
This was just a mediocre clich√© kids film. nothing else. Everything
that made the first amazing, enjoyable, original,lovable and different
was gone. Everything seemed forced; the plot was all over the place.
Hiccup's mother shows up after 20 years and after 5 minutes he's OK
with it. There was a really awkward song that his father sang to his
mother that was just painful to watch. I feel like there should have
been some kind of recap also since everything was included from the
cartoon series on cartoon network and i'm sure not many people going to
see this movie have seen both seasons. There was a stereotypical
villain, when the movie never needed a villain in the first place. It
tried to hard to be too many things and to please too many people.
Also, the score was very underwhelming. The volume of it was so low;
unlike the first film where it was tied into different scenes, it was
just thrown into the background carelessly at a low volume. There was
some weird singing in it too.Just watch the first one again.
