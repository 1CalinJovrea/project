American Mary - freaky, enticing, bloody brilliance.

Whilst I may not be a pro at reviewing films by any stretch of the
imagination, I feel compelled to give American Mary by the Soska
sisters the highest praising review I can muster.My expectations for the film were high, having been caught up in the
hype around the critically acclaimed body-mod horror - thankfully I was
pleasantly surprised. There was a lot of room for error in making the
film, but Jen and Sylvia approached the gory side of the film
perfectly, letting the viewer see just enough to be grossed out but not
enough to warrant a sick bag. Whilst I was expecting fake blood and
guts galore, the story and themes within the film were strong enough
not to need the usual cheap thrills one might expect in a horror film,
in fact I think the film wouldn't have been as good were there more
gore. On top of this, the characters were interesting/well developed
and thanks to a couple of good casting calls and better performances
(namely Katharine Isabelle and Tristan Risk) I found it easy to connect
to them in the 103 minutes I watched them on screen.As many others have commented, it's rare to find female horror
directors that manage to hit the nail on the head quite as well as the
Twisted Twins have manged to here, fingers crossed for a next project
equally as exciting.
