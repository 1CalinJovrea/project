Unnecessary Remake

This movie is hardly a scene-by-scene account of Brian De Palma
brilliantly 'Carrie'. Yes, it impossible not to compare any remake to
its original version, especially when the original is considered a
classic. It is sad that with these days' shortage of originality, even
a seemingly talented director such as Kimberly Peirce, succumbs to the
commercial appeal of movie-making in the sole interest of monetary gain
resulting in watered-down quality. Well, I'm not even sure if this
movie will make its money back, given the mediocrity in all aspects of
its quality. But then again, there are a lot of junks out there that
make tons of money. All the efforts for the reimagining, whether it be
an attempt to create a franchise or sequel or to modernize the
narrative has totally undermined the essence of this otherwise
compelling story. The destructiveness of social isolation, religious
fanaticism, BULLYING, to name a few, underlined in Stephen King's novel
were in no way conveyed effectively in this movie. There is a lack of
connection in Moretz's performance and  she is unconvincing as a
socially deprived and awkward girl. Julianna Moore as always delivers a
competent performance.  But she can only carry the movie so far. As
talented as Moretz is, she is a miscast for this movie.  As such, the
movie is moderately entertaining at best.
