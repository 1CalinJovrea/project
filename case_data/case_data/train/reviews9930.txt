It's just a mess

This movie tries to be so much but ends up being a real mess.Where do I begin? Character introduction runs for almost 40 minutes and
I still don't end up giving a damn about anyone.Jokes are often very misplaced and feels extremely forced. Many scenes
feels like they were made solely for sake of the trailer and also the
trailer resembles nothing of what the actual movie is like.CGI is so off that I divide the movie into 2 teams, CGI-team and real
team, and I keep ending up thinking how the ***k is human team going to
beat world consuming superman-like characters.However I do like the look of the Villains, especially Enchantress.Maybe this film is the best thing for DC Universe superfans, but for
the casual viewer it's very hard to get a grip of this movie, at least
for me it was.
