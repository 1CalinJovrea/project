There are a lot of movies with very unlikable heroes, and heroins, this is one of the good ones!

'BURNT': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another movie about an amazing chef; this one stars Bradley Cooper, as
an arrogant has-been, trying to have a comeback in the cooking world.
It was directed by John Wells (who also helmed 2013's outstanding
'AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY' and 2010's 'THE COMPANY MEN') and it was written
by Michael Kalesniko and Steven Knight (who also wrote the 2014 chef
flick 'THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY'). The film also stars Sienna Miller
(who also costarred with Cooper in last year's 'AMERICAN SNIPER'),
Daniel Br√ºhl, Omar Sy, Matthew Rhys, Sam Keeley, Alicia Vikander, Lily
James, Uma Thurman and Emma Thompson. The movie is flawed, but very
entertaining! Cooper plays Adam Jones, a very successful chef, who lost it all; due
to drugs, sex and alcohol (of course). After disappearing for three
years, he decides to make a comeback; by opening his own restaurant.
He's now sober, from drugs and women, and enlists all of his old
friends to help him; including several he betrayed. His dream is to
dazzle his customers, with tastes they've never experienced before, and
gain his third Michelin star! The cast is amazing, the directing is top-notch and the screenplay is
clever and witty! There's not a lot to dislike about this movie, except
it's main character; he's just too immoral and unlikable. He does grow,
and learn compassion, throughout the film (of course); and Cooper is
spectacular in the role. There are a lot of movies with very unlikable
heroes, and heroins ('STEVE JOBS' to name one recently), this is one of
the good ones; despite what the critics say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
