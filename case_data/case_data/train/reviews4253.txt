Quite honest from everything I have read and seen about the real man

I have never felt compelled to write a film review in my life before,
but after seeing such a low rating for a film that does try hard to
tell such a complex story, I just had to give it a go.Firstly, I can't say that I have ever been, or not been a fan of Ashton
Kutcher so my opinion is solely based on his performance in Jobs. At
times, his portrayal seems a little clunky as he tries to master the
walk of Steve Jobs he has an awkward kind of stoop which doesn't
translate well on film. However, there are other times when AK's
performance is incredible, his voice is near perfect pitch, his body
language, mannerisms and words are so in-tuned to Steve he could be
channeling him.One reason that the film has lower ratings is, in my eyes, that most
people who see it won't have a great knowledge of the intense man that
was SJ. He was a brute, a tyrant and at times appeared crazy. If you
read the biography by Walter Isaacson you will probably get a clearer
picture. Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that it cuts off
just before all the really good stuff came along, the iPod, iTunes,
iPhone and iPad. The film also does not deal with Jobs' cancer or
death, which just leads to a feeling that it is incomplete.I personally liked the film and I don't think that it tarnishes Jobs'
memory, like I said he wasn't a saint (oh BTW, he is also a hero of
mine) it is just a complicated, sometimes haphazard, chronicle of an
even more complicated man.
