Yes, This was a great movie for this day and age, and you WILL enjoy it. DO NOT READ REVIEWS BEFORE YOU SEE A MOVIE.

OK movie lovers, this is the review you need to see.Personally, I loved it. The Action is intense, and the storyline is
great. The orchestration by Michael Giacchino was VERY well done as
opposed to John Williams, and the actors and actresses fit their roles
very well too. Now, I constantly go to Movie's, and in MY opinion, this was one of the
best I have seen in the last 5 years, due to the storyline and the
incredibly well done CGI. If you love Dinosaurs, you're going to enjoy
this movie, regardless of what you think about the rest of the movie.
Trust me. If you love action, this one is pretty action packed, so
you'll have a great time too.HOWEVER, if you read the rest of the reviews, you'll most likely see
title's following the words, "This Movie Sucked" or "I'm gonna go on a
rant here". DO NOT READ THEMLook, everyone has their own opinions, likes and dislikes. My opinion
is 10 out of 10 across the board easily. Yours might be different, but
before you judge this movie because of all the reviews you've just
read, I strongly suggest seeing it first. You're not going to regret
it, even if you don't like the entire thing, because this movie is full
of likable scenes.My rating is 10 out of 10, and I hope to see people take my advice and
see it themselves before they decide what they're going to think about
it.
