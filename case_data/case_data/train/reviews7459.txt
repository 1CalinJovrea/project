Bravo, Reese Witherspoon !

We loved this film...and this is NOT a "chick flick"...it's for ALL of
us and it's about our search for our individual and authentic selves -
male or female... so don't miss it! I think Reese Witherspoon has created an incredible film with her team.
Kudos ...one of your best ever films and we are looking for more from
your production company in the future. An Oscar nomination is so well
deserved and we will be looking for you on TV that night. I Love how you portrayed the essence of a silent retreat and all the
riches and gifts and stresses of doing one. WILD does an amazing job of
illustrating this worthwhile experience in an individual's life.
