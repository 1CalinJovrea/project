Great for those who realize what this movie is

First, the biggest problem is everyone thinks this is the start of the
Dark Tower series of novels, it isn't and never was. The writer and
director have always said this is a sequel to the books (and those who
read the last book in the series and read the section King warned you
not to understand that this take place after it). That being said and
once understood the movie becomes fantastic. They aren't retelling the
story from the novels they are simply continuing spinning the wheel.Now as for the acting Idris Elba is fantastic as Roland, the man in
Black's motivating factors and why it differs from the books as it does
is very well conceived. The world is well thought out and as the novels
often did relate back to other of King's work in a logical way (The
Shining, Dead Zone, etc). All in all it is a great movie. I just wish
the reviewers and critics understood better what it was so it could
have gotten a better shake.
