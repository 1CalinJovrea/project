Typically flawed and over hyped but enjoyable nonetheless.

So I saw the long awaited "Prometheus" tonight. Overall, rather good,
but the characters annoyingly and jarringly flaunted so many basic
health and safety regulations regarding potential contamination,
infection, quarantine and exposure to physical injury from not wearing
adequate safety equipment in an unfamiliar extra-terrestrial
environment etc. Maybe we're just supposed to be careless or stupid in
about 80 years' time. Tsk! Also, while not being pro-god or creationist
as such, it did kind of take a dump on Darwinism and the role of
evolution in our existence.Being in 3D was fairly pointless. I even had to check that it was by
taking the glasses off. It was, but barely noticeable.Gorgeous sets and imagery, but I wasn't too happy about what the
Engineers or "Space Jockeys" look like under their bio-mechanical
suits.It was plagued by thoroughly unbelievable and rather unprofessional
characters as well. Dumb scientists and ship crew lacking the
professional integrity you'd expect from a trillion dollar mission. Oh,
and the old Weyland guy was a bit rubbish. Just Guy Pearce with lame
prosthetic wrinkles. How about using an actual old man actor with an
actual old bone structure? He stuck out like a sore thumb. Anyway, I
have to pick fault, but it's very much worth a watch and most people
aren't as picky as me I guess.I still wish they'd stop making films as if we're all dumb 15 yr old
kids without any real intelligence though. And it should have been
purposely made to be an 18 certificate (in the UK at least).
