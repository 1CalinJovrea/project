Couldn't stop crying

This is such a beautiful film, with a simple story line, without any
frills.A young Indian boy leaves their village with his older brother to do
some "jobs", in one of these jobs he gets lost and cannot find his way
back home. Pass some years and he's adopted by a family from Australia,
and when that boy becomes an adult, he starts wondering where he's
actually from.It deals with aspects of origin and identity, and that we cannot escape
from who we really are.Superb, superb acting from everyone, from the little Indian boys,
specially Sunny Pawar that plays the young Sarro, to Dev Patel who has
clearly matured into a top class act and is endearing and touching
playing the older Saroo.I'm certainly watching it again.
