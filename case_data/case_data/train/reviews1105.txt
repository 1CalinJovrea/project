bad, terrible, waste of time, who funded this anyways?

If I could I would give this movie a 0. This is a terrible movie. Its
an hour and 30 minutes i watched a whole hour and didn't see one good
thing happen, nothing scary happened at all and there was absolutely
nothing that grabbed my attention. Not even a slightly thrilling thing
happened and there was way too much just talking about random things,
it might as well be a documentary about these peoples lives because
nothing interesting happens.
