After another operation breaking the protocol, CIA Director Alan Hunley
(Alec Baldwin) decides to shutdown the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is
trying to prove the existence of the evil organization The Syndicate
but he captured by his agents. However he succeeds to escape with the
help of mysterious Syndicate agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).
Trapped in London, Ethan requests support from William Brandt (Jeremy
Renner) that tells him that can not do anything to help him since the
IMF does not exist anymore. The lonely Ethan decides to follow his only
lead, the rogue Syndicate agent Lane (Sean Harris). A couple of months
later, Ethan summons his friend and former colleague Benji Dunn (Simon
Pegg) to go to Austria to help him since he believes the Syndicate will
try to assassin the Austrian Chancellor during the opera Turandot.
Ethan saves the Chancellor from three snipers but he is killed by a
bomb in his car. One of the snipers is Ilsa that gives a lead of Lane's
scheme to Ethan. Who is the agent Ilsa Faust? Will Ethan be capable to
prove that the Syndicate does exist? "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" is a highly entertaining action
film. The fast-paced development of the plot does not give time to
think and the viewer sees a very enjoyable film. The unknown Rebecca
Ferguson has a beautiful face and performs a key character that will be
on the next movie of this franchise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Missão: Impossível - Nação Secreta" ("Mission:
Impossible - Secret Nation")
