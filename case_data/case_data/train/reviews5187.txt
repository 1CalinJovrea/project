a very disappointing movie..over rated!

What the hell is going on..! Let's just be honest..First we were so excited to see the movie then we realized that we just
waste our money and time!The Plot is just not well written!The first 20 mints of the movie were good and would raise your hope..
But then you will lose you internist and attention as the events pass
by separably and boringly.. Sophie Turner just screw it up with her
unauthentic act..Conclusion: Over dramatic,cheesy,very over rated and the plot is very
disappointing!
