Thank "god" the Japanese Won

Every so often the Christian movie makers try and take this subject on
and every effort is a failure. Quite simply put, the Japanese wanted
their own culture more than they wanted the Western one, and most
importantly, they were willing to fight for it tooth and claw. I know
I'm suppose to feel great sympathy for the poor priests struggling
against the heathens, but I don't and I don't want to. I'm quite happy
that Japan has a great culture of its own design and evolution and so
all the movie slander promoted by even a great director like Martin
Scorsese seems just wasted talent. Oh, there is plenty of "talent" in
the film; director, camera, actors, but the script and the of course
the "idea" can never succeed. I know that "christian hardship porn" is
satisfying for many believers, but unless you are one, you should let
this movie go away.
