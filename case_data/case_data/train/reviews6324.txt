Worth it

I must say, when I first heard the news that there was going to be a
Snow White live-action film, I had a good laugh. When I heard that
Kristen Stewart was going to play Snow White, I had an even bigger
laugh. But when I saw the trailer, I stopped laughing. And then I
watched the movie, and knew I had to write a review. This film is not
going to win many(if any) awards, nor will it be a favorite this year,
but it is entirely a good movie. Stunning visual effects, many great
landscape shots, good acting, great action, and a believable storyline.
This is not the Disney film you are used to, but a much grittier and
more mature take on the original tale. You should not take your
children to this film, nor should the intense nature of the film scare
you off. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and I think many people
will too.
