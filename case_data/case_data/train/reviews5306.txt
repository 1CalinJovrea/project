Typical Sacha Baron Cohen

Ali G, Borat, Bruno. If you've seen any of them, then you probably know
what to expect from Sacha Baron Cohen. Vulgar, crude, politically
INcorrect are just some of the terms you could use - depending on your
opinion.Basically, if you're easily offended, you probably won't want to watch
the tale of an evil Middle Eastern Dictator who finds himself lost in
America amidst a plot to oust him from power.However, there are still plenty of people who find this sort of humour
funny (and I'm one of them). Personally, I didn't think it was as good
as Borat or Bruno as the second half seemed a bit forced. The film
lasted just under the typical hour and a half mark, but probably could
have got away with being an hour long. It would probably have been a
pretty funny hour - if you like that sort of thing.The major criticisms being thrown at The Dictator is claims of racism
(just like Borat and Ali G, not to mention claims of homophobia at
Bruno) and whether the film mocks Middle Eastern stereotypes, or
whether it actually attacks those who impose the stereotypes. The film
has also come under fire for being too 'pro-Jew' too anti-American and
generally too liberal. Maybe that's true, maybe it's not. It's one of
those arguments where if you're looking to use this film to support or
challenge your own political viewpoint or religious beliefs there are
arguments for and against.The bottom line is that it's quite funny. Quite. Not as good as Borat
or Bruno, but still there are plenty of silly and vulgar (and I should
emphasis the words 'silly' and 'vulgar' because they're the backbone of
this film) moments to make you laugh out loud. Probably not a classic,
but entertaining nonetheless.
