Feces at Best

What a dung heap. Usually I love Mr. Cumberbatch, and even think his Bostonian accent in
Black Mass was passable. Lord, this movie, though... Bad American accent, bad lines, dodgy acting by the entire cast
(McAdams was the only thing I liked about True Detective II), lame
villains, kindergarten costumes, unoriginal special effects (which
may've been the one redeemable aspect), poor plot exposition, and at no
time did it encourage me to suspend disbelief. At times, when fighting out-of-body in a hospital, they inexplicably
bump into something things while passing right through others. Sitting
with a friend, we both finished several predictable lines of dialogue
prior to the character parroting it out. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends.
