Not hard to keep up with, it's a very OK.

It's a pretty good comedy. The average Suburban family gets a new neighbors, who are more than
what they seem. Nothing out of the ordinary.Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher made a cute couple in the movie. very
good comedy duo in an mediocre film.Jon Hamm is a fantastic straight man for the comedy that Galifianakis
was dishing out. Gal Gadot is impressive. She's the one who has to keep up with the
other three and she does a good job. i don't think I've seen her do
anything outside the Fast and Furious movies so it was nice to see that
she can do something else.I know i'm sitting here writing about the film, but for the most part
there is really is not anything to write about. It gives you enough
laughs so I feel like I did not waste my cash, but it's definitely not
a movie you'll remember down the road. Nothing spectacular.
