You have been warned

Casey Affleck decided to make a joke. He joint forces with David Lowery
to create something much worse than Upstream Color. They created a mega
- boring 90 minutes of long scenes about nothing. However, there was a
scene in the movie, which fully expressed my feelings. It is a scene,
where main character vomits. I am sure, that if I eat for some reason
too much, it will be enough to recall this movie to achieve same
reaction.
