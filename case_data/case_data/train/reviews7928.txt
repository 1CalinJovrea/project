Good, but Too Long and Tiresome Film

In the Seventeenth Century, in Portugal, the Portuguese Jesuit priests
Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe[ (Adam
Driver) ask permission to Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) to
travel to Japan to investigate the rumors that their mentor Father
Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had committed apostasy abandoning his
Catholic faith after being tortured by the shogunate. They meet the
alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) that agrees to guide
them to Japan. When they arrive at a small village, they learn that the
Christians residents live hidden in caves since the Inquisitor kills
any villager suspect to be Christian. Along the days, Rodrigues and
Garupel propagate Catholicism among the villagers and try to find a
lead to Ferreira. But when the Inquisitor arrives in the village with
his men, the live of the residents and the priests will change."Silence" is a film directed by Martin Scorcese that shows how cruel a
man can be. Based on historical facts, "Silence" show the powerful
Shogunate defending their religion and culture against the European
Catholicism that promises easy paradise to the suffered Japanese
workers that has to work lot to pay the taxes and survive. The result
is a good, but too long and tiresome film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Silêncio" ("Silence")
