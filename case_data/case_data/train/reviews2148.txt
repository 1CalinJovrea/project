Amazing

I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the
book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was
just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real
life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes,
the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every
single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very
emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to
play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and
the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts
from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still
amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is
amazing as well.
