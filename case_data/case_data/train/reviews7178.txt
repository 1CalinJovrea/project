"The lawnmower man"  from 1992 remake??

Okay this movie is a comedy right? Okay I know that it's says here on
IMDb that it is a drama, Mystery sci- Fi. But it must be a comedy,
because the movie is totally laughable. The script is totally laughable
or worse it's a kind of "The lawnmower man" from 1992 remake.Which was
also laughable, but you can forgive "The lawnmower man" for being a bad
movie, but this one you can't This movie is just like if someone gave a scientist 20 millions dollars
so he could invent a technology that could turn cheese back too milk
again. A total waste of money. I sincerely hope that Mr Depp and Mr.
Freeman has donated most off their money that they earned from this, to
doctors without borders or a children cancer foundation. I once saw an
interview with Mr. Deep saying that he never goes to any premiere, now
I know why!
