This movie is seriously underrated

From the very beginning, this movie is something different. We get the
girlfriend who finds out she's a mistress, and then we think we can
predict what's gonna happen because movies like this are always the
same, but instead we're surprised over and over again.You might think that Katy is stupid at first, but she surprises with
insight and brilliance that we rarely get to see from women in movies.
Instead of pitching women against each other, we get to see them form a
strong friendship and help each other through the emotional pain that
Mark is putting them all through.And their triumph in the end is as sweet as only revenge can be! I
really enjoyed this movie and I'd definitely watch it again :)
