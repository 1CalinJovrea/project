Excellent representation of the 60's

A well told story of the 60's - fashion, seriousness of the space
competition, but more importantly the contributions of 3 women in a
time where they were not even given the credit of having a brain. Why
this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state.
Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the
credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the
black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took
front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and
eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I
grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not
let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected
results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting
is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank
you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And
Pharrell for the music.
