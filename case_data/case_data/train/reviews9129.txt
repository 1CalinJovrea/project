Rise of The Guardians is a great animated film for the whole family to see

I seen this in the cinemas 3 years ago with my cousin and I thoroughly
enjoyed it.I happened to be watching it last night on TV as it was on
so on to the review.Rise Of The Guardians is a Dreamworks Animation movie that tells the
tale of Jack Frost(voiced by Into The Woods star Chris Pine)who isn't
believed in with the kids as they don't know him as much as the other
guardians. One day however and he happens to be chosen by the guardians
and he teams up with Santa Clause(voiced by Alec Baldwin with a Russian
Accent who is from 30 Rock),Tooth Fairy(voiced by The Great Gatsby's
Isla Fisher),the Sandman who doesn't talk,and an Aussie Easter
Bunny(voiced by X-Men star and Aussie Actor Hugh Jackman). Together
they try and defeat the evil bogeyman named Pitch Black(voiced by The
Holiday's Jude Law) who like Jack isn't believed in either and wants
the rest of the guardians to suffer just like him. So can the guardians
make the kids believe in them and stop Pitch Black from ruining the
children's dreams and imaginations forever?Bottom line I enjoyed it the first time I watched it and again last
night after 3 years watching it last. The story was very well done,the
voice acting is great(it was nice to hear Hugh Jackman use his own
accent and not to be putting on another accent as he doesn't use his
own accent that much in his films)but the real surprise was Alec
Baldwin as Santa Clause with a Russian accent. He really nailed it as
his charcther in the movie. Chris Pine sounded very old for Jack Frost
but he did a good job since this was his first animated debut.If you love animation like me and want a feel-good movie to watch then
check it out. Roll on ROTG II.
