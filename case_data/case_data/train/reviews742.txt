The dog was good

**Spoiler**The dog was the best actor in the film. Had all the best lines but
never hogged the scenes. He delivered his lines with style, feeling and
perfect diction. His role demanded a harmonious interaction with the
other actors. Everybody else? You've got to be kidding. Their lines came right off a
cereal box, their characters were despicable. Setting a family of
illiterate gangsters in rural France where all the French people speak
near-perfect English -- even in school -- was insulting. The audience
is supposed to buy into this bull? I've come to the conclusion that certain 'actors' are rotated thru on a
cycle, repeating their signature performances for audiences more
interested in killing time than in being entertained. The audiences are
as typecast as the actors. The dog was good.
