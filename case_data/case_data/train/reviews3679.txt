One of those small movies that deserve much more than what will ever be given

This is a movie I saw because it was nominated for the Oscars. I had to
see the one to make the bet. Thank God I make the bet, I have come to
see this great movie. Although I think that it has several shortcomings
of script, that will explain in zone spoiler, still I think that it
knows them to surpass more and goes ahead. Also hooks and you want to
continue watching.The actors are great. If I'm not mistaken they are all unknown but that
does not stop them from being great. Even the child and it is not easy
to do.The picture is not very good outdoors, but to make a credible film is
enough.Even if you do not have nice blueprints or composites. The director, if
he knows how to take the film forward. When the thread is finished, it
knows how to change and move on and that is very difficult.Spoiler:For me the problem with the script is that I think that the idea of
​​the room ends quickly and then it has to continue somewhere. You are
watching it and you do not know what happens until you discover it, but
when you discover it, you do not know where it is going to go, but it
is still on one side and still very well. At the second turning point,
the same thing happens exactly as well.Another great thing about the movie, which plays the script is that of
acceptance. Will the grandparents accept their grandchild born of rape?
It is a pleasure to meet these jewels that the world of cinema offers
us.
