What do you get when political correctness takes precedent over good movie making? (If telling you why this move is terrible qualifies as a spoiler then beware)

This movie can be summed up with one word... vapid. As if Matt Damon's
inherently vapid acting weren't bad enough, the makers of this film
were so overtly focused on presenting an idyllic reality where no
character behaves in any offensive way, to anybody, they produced an
un-suspenseful, uninteresting, boring, vapid turd of a story. They fall
over themselves to be so certain that no minority demographic is
stereotyped that all characters have the sane vapid personality. And in
what seems to be some sort of perverse effort to recompense reality, a
very transparent hierarchy is followed to be certain that: the Black
people are the most clever; the Hispanic people are next most clever;
the Asian people are next most clever(carefully not portrayed as
exceptionally smart), and of course the women are more clever than the
men. Of course the only flawed demographic were older white male
authority figures. To me this liberal, philosophical portrayal of what
an ideal reality is reveals that they are the true bigots, the haters.
They hate the differences that make people interesting. Ethnicity,
femininity / masculinity, and their different traits should be loved
and celebrated, not shamed, muted, or eliminated. It is the interaction
of those differences that create an interesting story, not a vapid one.
