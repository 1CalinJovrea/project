Stalled in pit lane....

As a huge supporter and fan of the first CARS film, and not caring at
all for the 2nd, this one was phoned in, lacked the "SOUL" and interest
of the original. The parts are there, the deep drama and personal
problems but it failed to flow. Just plodded along from thing to thing
until the big climax ending. The ending was fine, but I have zero
desire to ever watch this again, and won't be buying the disc, and WILL
be watching the original again to re-feel everything that was missing
here. And it is almost too deep for kids. Lots of talk about life and
retiring from it, and not lots of kid style hijinks.It looked great and had a story, but felt like a cash grab --- or that
all the original PIXAR writers were not involved.
