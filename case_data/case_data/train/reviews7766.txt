Very well made "B" movie with cliché plot

The spoiler is about the story arc rather than details but stop reading
if you don't want to know.This must be one of the best MADE "B" movies I've ever watched. Though
it is NOT a pot-boiler like so many movies on the SciFi Channel, it
still ends up devolving into a "last man standing" movie where the only
suspense after a certain point is to see which character will be bumped
off next.Iconic themes like the rise of multi-planet giant companies and
terra-forming are raised and left by the wayside in the rush to build
suspense for... which character will be bumped off next.With a less clichéd plot this movie could have been "A" material.I liked Kellan Lutz, who reminds me of Karl Urban.
