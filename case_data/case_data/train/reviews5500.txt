Quite a Good Secret

Having read all the negative and Luke warm reviews, it was with some
trepidation that I we went to see this film, now I haven't seen the
Argentine original, but I did enjoy this one! Kept my interest the
whole time, all the leads were strong and believable, never a big Julia
Roberts fan, she was outstanding in this, I certainly don't agree with
the reviewers that said Nicole Kidman was miscast, I thought she was
excellent, you don't get to be an A grade Academy Award winner by being
a bad actress! Perhaps it's not as good as the original are they ever?
But it stands on it's own, and would be in my top ten for this year
,not that it has a lot to beat? Far as I could tell, everyone in the
theater enjoyed it! Hey! It's a movie, not brain surgery!
