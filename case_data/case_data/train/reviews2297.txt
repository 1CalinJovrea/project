So not funny......

Really disappointing sequel to the very amusing Horrible Bosses, which
I enjoyed a lot a few years ago.The three main characters, Nick, Dale and Curt, having got rid of their
bosses in different ways are now planning to own their business.
Unfortunately, an unscrupulous business man and his son take advantage
of their naivety (actually, plain stupidity) and they must come up with
a plan to save some money.In recurring parts from the first movie are also the two surviving
bosses and the "criminal" specialist who assisted the trio in a rather
unprofessional way.
