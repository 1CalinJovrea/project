Surprisingly endearing

My wife and I attended a preview screening last night with no
preconceived ideas about the movie, not having even seen a trailer.We were immediately drawn in and pleasantly surprised by the story,
even though we thought it may have been a little far fetched. Until we
found that it is a biography and mostly fact. That made the story even
sweeter.Dame Judy Dench's acting was peerless as usual, but by far the biggest
revelation was Ali Fazal, who put in a wonderful performance from
comedic through emotionally intense.There was so much I didn't know about Queen Victoria's twilight years
that this movie put into perspective, in a way that was consistently
entertaining. We laughed and cried. Highly recommended.
