I can boldly embrace both

As someone who has grown up with the franchise, watched every show and
every movie (I've watched the entire DS9 series at least twice!),
suffered through characters/actors who I didn't care for (Tasha Yar,
seriously?), I realize we all have opinions about what makes Gene
Roddenberry's vision so lasting. That being said? I LOVED this movie. I even capitalized it I loved it
so much. The play between the characters, the more human version of
Spock, the absolutely delightful "Scotty" (although his sidekick is one
of those throwaway characters I dislike) as well as a much better
crafted plot this time made for a completely enjoyable movie. The
action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the
twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is
reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the
next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this
movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line,
deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some
of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be
oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of
friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with
subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the
climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured
out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about,
respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.So yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not
embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the
'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what
it used to be'!!!! I, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a
continued reverence for the old. This movie makes it possible to love
both.
