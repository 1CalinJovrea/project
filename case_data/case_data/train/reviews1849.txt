NAIVE scenes, never existing in real prison life.

Pretty naive prison stories. he comes in the jail, and fights
immediately when stepping into prison yard, with a black dude!!! How
predictable... But overall a watchable movie for evening fun. A movie
to forget. Good for young gangster jail wannabees only. Cheap lines.
Story started as possible, and then ended in strange finale...
Mediocre.
