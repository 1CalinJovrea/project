Unimaginably Boring for so much Potential

This story line had so much potential with domestic abuse, redemption,
love, family, but the screen writers TOTALLY missed the mark - Josh
Duhamel does a decent job - not the vacuous role he is usually placed
in and pulls off more than a pretty face here - David Lyons as the
alcoholic Detective Tiernny and abusive husband of Hough shined - he
seems made for bad guy roles - Julianne Hough - I think the girl has
some potential as actor given a more meaty role but as stated this was
painfully drawn out with idyllic lazy southern settings where
IMPOSSIBLY in a town of 2000 no one questions the appearance of a
newcomer and in fact embraces her without question (being from the
south - that "ain't" how we operate - if you are in town for more than
48 hours we know everything about you if we have to pry it out with a
velvet crowbar), impossible circumstances, clich√©s enough to fill a NY
phone book. Oh how I wish they'd made the most of this story line.All of this being said - the last 40 minutes was great and the ending?
TOTALLY unexpected - right out of left field - loved it - knowing what
I know now I would watch the first 20 minutes to get the lay of the
land and characters, then skip to 108 and watch to the end. Sadly I
cannot give this more than a 3 thanks to an awful job by the screen
writers.
