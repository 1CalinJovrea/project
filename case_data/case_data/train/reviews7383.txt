Just boring

I love movies, good movies with great pacing that thrust you through
the experience, I saw this with my girlfriend and all we were doing is
looking at each other every 10-15 minutes with puzzled looks on our
faces. It dragged on and on, nothing really linking the story and
pushing it onwards.The first 10 minutes were interesting and enthralling. The shots were
okay and locations were cool. I'm also someone that really likes the
use of silence in films that I watch, it just seemed here often like it
was being used without a reason. When the characters finally did talk
it was just plain bland.Maybe its just me, but this film is in my opinion highly overrated.
