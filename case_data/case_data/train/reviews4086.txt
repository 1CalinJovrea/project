Amazing role for Geoffrey Rush

Another great role for Geoffrey Rush, possibly his greatest acting
performance, up to today. I dare to call it "another" just because his
performance in the King's Speech was quite impressive... The movie
offers not only an interesting script, somehow near to Agatha's
Christie novels, but also fine images and an inspired music. If you
like fine paintings and antique furniture, you will enjoy watching this
movie, even without paying to much attention to the criminal skeleton
that leads the story...there is no place for useless sequences,
everything goes smoothly and natural, the drama is well tempered until
the very final peak, the whole is well balanced and wonderful. I do not
know anything about the director of this movie, Mr.Giuseppe Tornatore,
but, I am pretty sure that he has many other things to say in his
future career...be sure to not miss this film, you will highly enjoy
the time spent watching it!
