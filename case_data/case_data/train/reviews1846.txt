A turd in your Christmas stocking.

This is one of those movies where all the characters have single digit
IQs in order for the plot to proceed. Starts off well enough but soon
descends into some of the most stupid and contrived scenarios and
decisions, where adults apparently lose all common sense and motor
control so that a 12 yr old can kill them. Could have been a worthy
premise, but it's so poorly written, you feel nothing for anybody and
the end comes as a welcome relief. Watch a Home Alone rerun instead.
