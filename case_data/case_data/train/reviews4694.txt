Lucy  is  a  ridiculous but  very  entertaining  film

Lucy is a spectacularly ridiculous but very entertaining film which is
the best one Luc Besson has directed in a long time... even though,
considering all the missteps he has had since he returned from
"retirement" 9 years ago, that isn't a big compliment. For better or
for worse, Lucy employs Besson's habitual style, combining abundant
action, a creative visual style and an accelerated rhythm which, in
this case, distract us from the parade of nonsense and inconsistencies
from the screenplay (Hasn't the "we only use 10% of our brain" myth
already been discarded?). Fortunately, this film counts with solid
performances from the whole cast, starting by Scarlett Johansson, who
brings charisma and credibility. Morgan Freeman brings his usual
conviction, serene presence and persuasive voice, while Choi Min-sik
and Nicolas Phongpheth bring quite a personality to their villain
roles. Besides, with only 89 minutes of running time, Lucy ends as
quickly as it began, it never gets boring at all and it leaves us with
some philosophical reflections I found interesting. Lucy is not a great
film, but it entertained me very much, and I recommend it as a pleasant
distraction which doesn't require us to pay too much attention. And
besides of that, I like to see Besson back on the right track in his
career as a director.
