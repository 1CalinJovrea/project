Had Potential

The crux of the story had potential, but the science of renewing life
for thousands of life cycles was really weak (e.g. sex, injections,
rabbit kills, ancient incantations). The script had a poor flow, both
explanations as to what is going on as well as the subsequent
encounters between the two leads. Our female lead, Nadia Hilker,
metamorphosing into a variety of ancient evolutionary forms had a good
CGI effect, but was more just laughable scary. Also, not believable,
was the life story behind the second lead character, American, Lou
Pucci, and how he's adrift in Italy where events take place. The farm
scenes, where he's employed, seemed pointless and the connection to the
death of the farmer's wife was, again, seemed to be an afterthought
injection. Finally, the ending and alternate ending seemed too sweetly
predictable - not creative.
