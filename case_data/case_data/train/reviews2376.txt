Don't get conned by the hype.

I could not wait for this movie to end. It was a complete atrocity. The
overly-indulgent, sloppy chaos amounted to nothing in terms of
character or story. A vague lesson spoon-fed to the audience during the
first 20 minutes is I'm guessing what is supposed to excuse the
senseless and bumbling bore of a circus for the next 100.I absolutely do not understand the praise of the acting in this film. I
never bought into the actors as their roles, though, honestly, there
was not much else holding it together for me. Was there a script? Was
there a director??? The entire sad excuse for a film seemed to be the
improvised work of the actors themselves contrived in a garage
somewhere after a long night of drinking.I never was really motivated to read into the movie, and I was never
really fully engaged or entertained by the shallow antics, long-hanging
scenes that go on way too long, or 70's retro-obsession. I'm not sure
if I'm supposed to be mesmerized by watching makeup applied to
Christian Bale's head or how cool walking into a 70's themed wardrobe
would be. It seemed none of the actors could keep their accents. I
would never label this as a comedy-- I did laugh from time to time
because of how badly I wanted it to be over.For a respectable story about individuals trying to reinvent themselves
please see The Great Gatsby, The Departed, or The Town (and I'm sure
there are many more).
