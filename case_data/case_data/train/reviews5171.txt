Great tribute to Walt

Saving Mr Banks tells the story of Walt Disney's battle to get the
rights to make Mary Poppins into a movie. I wasn't expecting to like
this but was completely blown away. It is beautifully put together, is hilarious in parts and very touching
and emotional at other stages, but is not overly sappy or cheesy. There are some outstanding performances here. Emma Thompson plays Mrs
Travers beautifully - a cantankerous and stubborn lady, yet you can't
dislike her. Tom Hanks does a good job of playing Walt Disney - a tough
role for anyone but he seems to suit it, so long as you can get past
the terrible fake southern accent which is worse than Dick Van Dyke's
attempts at an English accent in Mary Poppins. However the stand-out performance is, surprisingly, delivered by Colin
Farrell as Mrs Travers' father. He brings amazing range and emotion to
a character that is simultaneously a loving, sweet father and a man
caged in by life and personal demons. Go see it for yourself when it comes out at the end of November. I'm
looking forward to watching it again.
