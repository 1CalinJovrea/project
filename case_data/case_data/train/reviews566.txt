I did not have high hopes coming into this movie, yet I am still
disappointed with the lack of passion that went into the creative side
of this movie.First with the positives of this movie. For me, the idea of the dance
fighting I found new and pretty fun. Also the positives of this movie
include Steve Carell and the animation, which was done really well.
Also the minions character go to unexpectedly dark new heights, which I
thought was a risky but worthwhile choice by the writers.Now onto the negatives, and there are a few. First I have to get this
out of the way. The character of the wife of Gru is undoubtedly the
most annoying character as well as being a very belittling character
towards women. This character annoyed me greatly and made the audience
feel like idiots. Next is the introduction of the character Dru, which
could have gone two ways but did not work and did not add any comedic
purpose and seemed just to serve as a massive clich√© of two different
characters having to work together. But in my opinion the biggest
problem with this movie is the incredible lack of jokes that hit
throughout the run time. This was a huge fault in my opinion with the
screenplay of this movie. For any adults that have to attend this movie I feel sorry for and will
most likely take away from the movie experience that we all love. At
best this is a fun movie that some kids who will stare at the screen
blankly for an hour and a half while the parents consider whether they
will be taking their kids to see another movie again.
