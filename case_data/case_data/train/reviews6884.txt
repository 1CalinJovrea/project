a must see. everyone in the theater applauded in the end

Very touching story. These people are real heroes. They are brave not
only on fighting fires but also fighting drugs. It's amazing that
Brendon picked up his life. That is responsibility! That is MAN! Keep
up Brendon! I really appreciate that director Joseph have given
everyone a chance to know those heroes.
