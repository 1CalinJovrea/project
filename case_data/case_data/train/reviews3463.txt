Girls Trip

I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard at a film as I did
with this one. It was great the whole cinema was crazy with laughter.
They all worked well together none out shining the other. It was a
great cast.I hope they really do another together. They got everything
right the laughs the sadness and back to laughs. Great Film
