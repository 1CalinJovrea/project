Very good, but requires connection with main character

I found this movie to be very gripping, but like others have said it
requires some connection with the main character. For me it was there
and I thoroughly enjoyed it (as did my wife who insisted we watch it
again a week later). I really enjoyed the brief table dialogues, one of my favorite succinct
quotes being something along the lines of:Walhberg: (Pushes a 10k stack onto the blackjack table) Dealer: That is
$10,000 dollars, are you sure... Walhberg: Are you a financial adviser
or a dealer?Walhbergs character is pretty unique, and borders on unbelievable, but
it very consistent and represents very real emotions.
