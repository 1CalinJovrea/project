Waste of money

I was under the impression this was a completely different film when my
husband and I decided to try to see it. However, it wasn't long before
my husband and I knew it was time to go home before the movie was over.
I'd say we left at the half-way point and don't regret it one bit. Our
only regret was wasting our money seeing this in the first place. Never
in my life have I left a film before it was fully over (aside from the
quick trip to the restroom.) Not only was this film predictable, it was
horrid. It started off like what I was expecting, then turned into an
ongoing Skype chat between the cast. I don't have anything against
horror stories or ghost stories, but this was neither. No suspense. No
build up. Just stupid. I have warned my friends to not see this film as
it's truly a waste of time, film, and money.
