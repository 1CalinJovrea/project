I'm so disappointed

I've been waiting for the release of this movie for years. I thought
all this time they had been working on the film but from what I saw, it
seems to me like they worked on it recently and for a short amount of
time because it was really bad and I'm a fan of the films. I loved the
first two movies. It really gave me chills and I can always go back and
watch it again. This movie didn't scare a bit. There were just a few
pop ups that made me jump. The creeper is supposed to be a creature but
in this film it looked more like a man in a mask. Also, originally, the
creeper wears all black but this creeper was wearing a red shirt and it
not scary. It makes it seem like the creeper has a wardrobe. The makeup
was terrible. Everyone was laughing. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY.
The point of a horror film is that it is supposed to be scary. With all
the horror films nowadays, I feel like that's what their doing and
that's why it's not successful. M. Night knows what scary is.There was some parts that were okay but overall it was just a waste of
time. I had high expectations. I'm so disappointed.
