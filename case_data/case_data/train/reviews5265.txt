Don't Follow The Sheep On Here

OK, I've signed up to IMDb just to comment on this Movie. First Off I'm
not A Seth McFarlane Fan. I don't like Family Guy and I Thought Ted was
Childish.( But I am over 40) So when I read the reviews on here I had
to go and see this movie for myself. Nothing could be that bad (I
thought): And I was right. There is nothing wrong with this Movie. Its
never going to win an award but I don't imagine they thought it would.
Its funny, the characters are likable and the actors are excellent.It would appear that somebody wrote a bad review on here and as usual,
The Sheep jumped on The band Wagon.This is as good a comedy as any I've seen in the last few years and
better than a lot I've seen in the last ten years. The story was good
and kept me entertained throughout the Movie. It was crude in places
but its Seth McFarlane Folks ! What did you expect?.I was glad I went to see this and came out with a smile on my face. I
understand that maybe Ted was aimed at an age group a lot younger than
me, but I just didn't like it. However, I did like this movie. As I
said at the start, don't follow The Sheep. Give this a go and you wont
be disappointed.
