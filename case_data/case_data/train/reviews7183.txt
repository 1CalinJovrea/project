Knock knock most ridiculous movie of 2015

Such a pathetic movie. Watched the movie 'knock knock' because of Keanu
Reeves and am so disappointed with the story line and there is nothing
thrilling about the movie. What really irritated was Keanu Reeves was
like a helpless moron who just couldn't do anything against two teenage
girls who go to his home and take him for a ride throughout the movie.
Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a
teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when
you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the
so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his
neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and
two hours of precious time.
