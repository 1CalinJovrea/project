Well Extinction is right

This movie has to be the last nail in the coffin for Micheal Bay's
Transformers franchise , the over use of lens flare is super annoying
in 3d and gets old very fast , the random explosions that go off time
and time again get old very fast , the use of particle effects is very
cool in this movie and certain points it works very well but ... there
is times in the movie where the particles kinda take over the screen
and just distract you from the movie.The amount of random chase scenes is insane and in my opinion their not
done well at all , the tracking on them is done so bad that you get the
feeling that the characters can teleport from one place to another.Im not one to right reviews to movies but in the case the movie made me
so angry I had to .
