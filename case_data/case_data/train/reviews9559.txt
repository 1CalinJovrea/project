Bad....... just plain bad!

I am an avid film goer, I like mindless comedies...... Rarely have I
watched a "comedy" movie and not laughed through it's entirety....
Congratulations Bad Mom's you have made one of my rarer lists! It is a horrible example to set for anyone young actual mothers. It is
unfunny to the point of being over the top trying too hard! The entire
party scene has been done and beaten to death! The whole penis thing
was unfunny and borderline sexist in it's own right. Some of the actresses have done very well in other parts, but here they
all just sort of fall flat. It's a shameful movie and one I hope they
are ashamed to have their names attached to.
