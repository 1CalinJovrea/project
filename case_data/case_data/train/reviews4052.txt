Neither The Best Nor The Worst

Tyler Perry is something of an American phenomenona one-man motion
picture industry. As a director, writer, or producerand frequently all
threePerry since 2005 has been responsible for some twenty remarkably
successful motion pictures. And that's in addition to the pictures of
other filmmakers in which Perry has appeared only as an actorpopular
films such as "Star Trek," "Alex Cross," and "Gone Girl."To date, nine of Tyler Perry's twenty pictures as a producer, writer,
or director have featured the character Madea, a plain-spoken and
tough- loving elderly woman with a nurturing heart, a highly-acute
antenna for the difference between right and wrong, and a penchant for
involving herself in the troubles of other people. Madea, who's played in elaborate makeup and costuming by Perry himself,
is based in equal measures upon the filmmaker's mother and aunt, and is
partially inspired by the characterizations and performances by comic
Eddie Murphy in the 2000 comedy "The Nutty Professor II."Tyler Perry's comedies are remarkably accessible to filmgoing
audiences. While the motion pictures of other filmmaking multi-taskers
often appeal to an especially exclusive and rarefied demographicWoody
Allen springs to mindPerry's movies are popular entertainment for
anyone who loves to laugh.Unfortunately, "Boo 2!" is not among Perry's best picturesor even
among his best Madea pictures. While the laughs are there, especially
for Perry's legions of fans and Madea aficionados, they're more sparse
than usual, and less frequent. Both the filmmaker and the character he
created seem to be going through the motions by rote, and without
heart."Boo 2!" is enjoyable enough. But audiences unfamiliar with Tyler Perry
or Madea might find themselves wondering what all the fuss is about.
