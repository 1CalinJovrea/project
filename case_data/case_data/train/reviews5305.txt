Well-written thriller

This movie is almost a masterpiece. It deserves a solid 8/10. Just when
you think you understand it, the movie reminds you of the complexity of
the situation and throws another mystery at you.the acting is
outstanding, especially from the actress who portrays the lawyer. There are few unexplained plot holes that didn't bother me that much.
The viewer experience is amazing, so if you're not familiar with
Spanish movies, you should definitely start with this one !
