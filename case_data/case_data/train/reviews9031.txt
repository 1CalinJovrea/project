Enjoyable if considered comedy mystery thriller

If you are going to watch it keep in mind this is not a pure mystery
thriller it will disappoint you if you're expecting that. But as a
comedy slasher mystery thriller it becomes watchable if you don't have
anything else to see but it still has flaws. It's predictable and
changes between suspense and comedy seemed dumb. Some things just
didn't make sense and certain situations felt unnecessary. Still you
can enjoy it but it's not a good movie nor bad just something to see in
your free time.
