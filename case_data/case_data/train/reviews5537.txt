Downgraded version of The Fast and The Furious

The best parts of the FF franchise are the effects and action scenes
which require a massive budget.Take away the budget and you get this movie which is a boring,
clique'd, uninspiring mess that should have not been made.Not absolutely horrendous but you will forget that this movie existed
after walking from the theater.
