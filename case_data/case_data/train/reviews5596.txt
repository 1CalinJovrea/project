beautiful

Don't agree with the 1-star reviewer. It's a beautiful film, with 2
great actors acting their AGE. No doddering, just honest raw emotion.
The initial premise seemed odd, but after getting caught up in the
storyline-I loved it! It's just a simple beautiful story. Like real
life, no "hollywood" ending. Just real life.
