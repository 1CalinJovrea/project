Emotional Hijack!

If you haven't watched this Piece of Art, you are wasting your time
here! Those who had seen, I am sure you can't express the feeling in
words.I started watching with skepticism, but turned out to be the Best of
2013 on par with The Hunt, better than Hunt in terms of the emotions
displayed by Adele at her age. Journey from cute high school girl to
heart broken woman is just soul twisting and I don't know how I
couldn't cry to see her fate and life came to a stand still. I am now
obsessed with this movie and Adele, she is French Jennifer Lawrence; I
must say. If nominated for Oscars, it should be her's. The brilliance
of Steven Spielberg is in awarding Palme D'Or to Actresses along with
the Director! And this movie EARNED IT.What are you waiting for? Go and watch again :D
