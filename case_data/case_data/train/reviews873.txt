Excellent Movie ,Unbelievable Why It Is  Underrated And Hated!.

Me and my son Muhammad were shocked how this great and funny 3D movie
whose budget is 50 million dollars is so underrated and hated. The film centers on Gene, a multi-expressional emoji who lives in a
teenager's phone, and who sets out on a journey to become a normal meh
emoji like his parents.My son Muhammad and I laughed and saw this movie too entertaining for
kids and adults and the thing that convinces us to see despite the
unstoppable attack on it is that it has already reached number 1 in the
US Box Office and that many open-minded people did not believe the
malicious hatred against a quality movie like this.
