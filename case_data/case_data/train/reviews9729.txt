Not as bad as everyone is saying it is

The acting is good, it's competently shot, and has a nice location. The
real problems are with this movie is it's tone and the adult
characters. At first feels like a fun family movie but then turns into
a dark, depressing Jason Bourne style thriller next. And all the adults
are morons, especially the mom. Not a gigantic load of garbage but not
amazing either.
