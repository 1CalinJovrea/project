This cut of meat isn't nearly as raw as it believes, nor is it well done.

Lame meat puns aside, my issue with Raw doesn't stem from the meat and
bones of the story (last one I promise), but from the absurdly over the
top "hazing" of the new students.I was in the Greek system in college, and yes, there are initiations
and hazing. We've all heard horror stories of injury or death related
cases resulting from hazing. However, the way this was handled in Raw
makes it seem like these students are getting their education in
hazing, whereas classes and professors are treated as extra-curricular.
These scenes are drawn out in what seems to be an attempt at stylistic
cinematography, but with no pay off or plot development, it grows to be
mundane and repetitive. I really wanted to like Raw, and enjoyed it's bizarre coloring and
cinematography. It delivers a few powerful, fleeting moments of a
grotesque and terrifying cannibal story trying to find it's legs in a
sea of screaming frat-boys and music video montages.
