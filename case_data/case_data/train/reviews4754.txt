Hard to Watch

This is a movie of wasted potential. Modern-day pirates, crew playing
hide-and-seek to stay alive, dramatic rescue. It's all there: all the
ingredients for a great movie. So why is this such a flop? Perhaps it's
not such a good idea to make the aggressors so realistic that they have
no connection whatsoever with the audience. It was like watching actual
Somali pirates, and therefore there was no emotional tension--I just
wanted them all slotted. That they didn't get slotted, but managed to
hijack a vast ship with basically a spear was so frustrating that I
lost patience with the whole proceeding. It was...worthy. It was PC. It
was just...boring.
