Stack of Lies

It is a shame this movie is a stack of lies.First time polish broke
enigma it was in 1932, 1933 they created first working example of
Enigma, and first anti-enigma device, narrowing settings combination to
105 456. In 1936 Germans changed the design, and Polish answered with
Rejewsky bomb, machine with 6 enigma connected together,breaking new
daily code in 2 hours.Another German changes required building 54
different machine designs, and Poland didn't have enough money so they
asked allies to help.July 1939 Uk and French representatives visited
Warsaw and got all documentation how to break ENIGMA.After beginning of
the war, polish encoders moved to Paris, and British started Bletchley
Park operation. Unfortunately, Polish people are always forgotten,
because they are not part of US/UK/France/Germany nation.Shame on you
Britain.
