Loved it!

Yes, the characters are over the top. But it didn't bother me at all!
This film actually needs those over the top characters to fit the plot.
And I do think the acting women pulled it off! Unfortunately I do agree
with reviewers which mentioned bad acting from the male character. But
it didn't bother me that much to make the movie less enjoyable. This is a typical chick flick, and the kind you want to watch on a lazy
Sunday. Because I love that kind of movie from time to time, and I
think this one is just the wright fit, I gave it a high rating. But I can understand this movie is not for anyone. When you're going to
watch this, just don't take everything too serious! Just have a laugh..
