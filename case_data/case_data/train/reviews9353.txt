Missed something...

Sorry...was I supposed to like any of these characters? was I supposed
to feel my heart warming at the points where the string music started
up in the background? I don't write reviews. This was so awful that I
persevered through the incomprehensible validation words to register an
account on here.All the characters (bar the ones that are barely in it) are truly
hateable. Seriously. No redeeming qualities.So you kind of hate yourself and you're really sad?...so you stick your
fingers down your throat to make yourself beautiful?...so you had an
abortion? Does that actually mean you have to be a total bitch to your
'friend'?Fatties are fair game and there's loads of easy stereotypical fun to
get your teeth into. Brilliant. A film where the men are assholes and
the women are worse. What a waste of 2 hours of my life. Only watched
to the end in the vain hope that there would be some kind of
'Melancholia' (another dire film, but, unbelievably - better than this)
ending where everyone was wiped out. No such luck. Truly life
unaffirming. Enjoy.
