Detachment is needed whilst writing a review for The Host, and this
film makes it hard to do that.The opening act of film deals with our main character Melanie
sacrificing her life to hide knowledge of the whereabouts of her family
from alien lifeforms who inhabit human bodies.Unfortunately Melanie is unsuccessful in her attempts at suicide and
her body is implanted with an alien life-form who calls herself
'Wanderer' (which gets shortened to Wanda later in the film) by the
lead Aliens who now control all life on Earth.Side-stepping the 'how/what/when/where' issues of an alien race taking
over all 6 billion humans and the hoover-dam size plot-holes this
conjures up after we see what the aliens look like, the actual feel of
the movie is very good in these opening stages; with lots of great
camera angles and wonderful blocking of the scenes with effortless
pace. All of the sci-fi 'stuff' is really great to see and has a
clinical-whiteness to it which is appealing to the eye. Only downside
to this is some of the vehicles, which are a little too plain as they
are recognisably current cars and motor bikes, just with a metallic
paint-job. It is forgivable, as the vehicles are not relevant to the
plot and are really just placeholders to explain/denote distance
covered, but as they are so shiny it warrants a mention, if only to
convey the attempt at continuation of style regarding the Aliens.After the establishing act, the story moves speedily into the hub of
the conflict; the Alien inside Melanie finds the soul of Melanie and
her memories are still just below the surface and have partial control
over the actions and inactions of the body. Melanie can also
communicate with Wanderer and although initially tries to control her,
finds the diplomatic approach easier and together they find common
ground to help each other in their goals.So...good sci-fi elements, good sci-fi premise (but not original) and
good direction - where is the problem? It's the love story.Never before have two characters (Wanda/Ian) been thrown together and
fallen in love in such a short period of time. It was baffling to watch
and completely disconnected me, because everything else in the film has
a certain logical construct to it (contextually) which is paced out and
built to a satisfactory conclusion, regardless of whether it is
enjoyable to watch or not.The star of the film is really Melanie/Wanda actress, Saoirse Ronan.
She is one of those rare actresses who can really hold the attention of
an audience, and is adept at being able to convey emotional states with
the slightest change in her facial expressions. She also I believe is
perfectly cast for this role as it required someone who could play a
character which has another person's emotions deep inside her and can
manage to display this subtly to the audience, but in just the right
quantities.I think Andrew did a great job with the film and the material, but it
is flawed and it's hard to point fingers at anything but the script and
the way it handled the whole Wanda/Ian moments, because when they
confess their love for each other, it truly is hard to watch. If they
had more scenes and more film-time to have their love grow organically,
it would have worked much better.Nice score by Antonio Pinto that really raises some of the scenes
higher than most films would do given the same material.I can recommend it as a sci-fi movie, in the classical sense of the
genre - but find it hard to recommend it as a love story for the
reasons given.Watch it, but be prepared to have some form of detachment in some
places, but not all and not for long.
