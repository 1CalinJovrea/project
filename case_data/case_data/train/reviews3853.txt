Perfectly Prepared & Plated

It is a good thing to sometimes ignore the ratings (6.7 at the time
that I went) and go see a film because you know it will be great, or at
least great for you. For me, Burnt was such a film, and was the best I
have seen in the theater in a while.The first two things I saw about this film when I discovered it on IMDb
were: 1) Cooper, 2) Film about cooking & fine dining. Then I read the
synopsis and also saw 3) Self-destruction and 4) Redemption. This was
more than enough for me to take the chance.As a person who has been through the arduous process of razing my life
to the ground then attempting to rebuild it, I found Burnt to strike at
the very core of my being. This is not something that we humans
typically do by choice, but something we do nonetheless because of
factors that we do not control. Cooper finds a way to embody this
concept very shortly after having staged an immense character
recreation in American Sniper, a feat that is not to be underestimated.The supporting cast is also phenomenal and helps carry us quite
realistically through a story that teaches about the rigors on the back
stages of the great kitchens in the world. The end result for me was
the truth that attempting a second path to greatness will almost
certainly not follow the same route as the first. Many of us never get
a second chance, but this film tells us why there is merit in the
effort.For those that are younger or have yet to experience a fall from grace,
this story may ring for you in a different way, or if nothing else,
explain why the culinary arts are a vehicle for passage through both
heaven and hell simultaneously. Enjoy it with a fine wine and open
mind. Salut!
