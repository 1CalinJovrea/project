In the words of Kristian Harloff, its "GAAAARBAGE"!!!!!

Same plot as the first, just bigger monsters, extreme CGI and bad
acting... Why does Liam Hemsworth have a career??? Only positive thing
in this epic t u r d is Jeff Goldblum. He just rocks!To sum up... Its a disaster and I have never had the urge to consider
demanding a refund, until now. This is just pure cash cow, because they
know is box office due to the franchise.The thing that is even more terrific is that they cliff hanged it, so
if its a financial success, then rest assure, there will be a third...
God Help Us. God Help Hollywood.have a nice day!
