Excellent addition to the series

Watched it at the one day only release on Sept 26th. A really fun
addition to series, more in the lines of Part 2 rather than the dark
and scary tone of Part 1. One of the first positives that come to mind
are the production values and the cinematography. Some of the camera
angles are pretty awesome. Very hard to review this without giving
things away. Another positive is some(attempt at) character development
similar to Part 1. More screen time for creeper than probably both
movies put together, which is awesome. Not every thing is rosy
though...acting, especially that of the lead actress was wooden at
best. Some claims which Salva made about the movie were not true, which
was a huge disappointment for me. To summarize, don't miss it at any
cost if you are a JC fan. Oh and there is a surprise cameo as well :)
