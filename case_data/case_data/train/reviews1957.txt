James P. "Sully" Sullivan, who belongs to a family of famous "scarers",
breaks in his room, they start a competition in class. Their dispute
ends when they accidentally break the pride and of joy of Dean Abigail
Hardscrabble, a cylinder with her greatest achievement Â– a powerful
scream of a boy. They both are expelled from the scare classes by
Hardscrambble that tells that Sully is lazy and Mike is not scary, and
they become enemies. When Mike recalls the Scare Games, he sees his only chance to return to
the scare course. He makes the application to participate, but he
learns that he needs a fraternity. Mike joins the Oozma Kappa that is
the only fraternity available with four losers, but he is informed that
the fraternity needs to have six members. Sully offers to complete the
team and Mike has no other alternative but accept Sully in his team.
Then he bets with Hardscrambble that if he wins the games, she will
accept them in the scare classes. Soon the game begins..."Monsters University" is a pleasant story of friendship and a prequel
of "Monsters Inc.". The plot is based on the American college life and
despite the lack of any identification with my country, with
fraternities and silly parties of American college students, the plot
is funny and entertaining. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Universidade Monstros" ("Monsters University")
