waste of time...Keanu Reeves we didn't expect this from you

Keanu Reeves , I am huge fan of Him, but he disappointed me and all his
fans by signing this senseless script. All team of this movie are sick ..you guys need some serious
treatment.No message, no story, no suspense, no climax..only irritating
madness of two stupid girls are shown in this movie.There should be a
penalty charged to director and script writer of this movie. Keanu
Reeves..what has happened to you...U gave us Point Break..and now you
doing this ???Such a pathetic movie. Watched the movie 'knock knock' because of Keanu
Reeves and am so disappointed with the story and there is nothing
thrilling about the movie. What really irritated was Keanu Reeves was
like a helpless moron who just couldn't do anything against two teenage
girls who go to his home and take him for a ride throughout the movie.
Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a
teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when
you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the
so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his
neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and
two hours of precious time.Keanu Reeves ..next time please sign a better script.Do Not spoil your
name.
