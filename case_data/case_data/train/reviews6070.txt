Great movie! James McAvoy is awesome.

This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming
out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance
of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing
in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give
anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the
actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of
downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that
and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!
