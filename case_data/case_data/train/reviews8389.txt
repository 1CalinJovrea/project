100%  Trailer Movie

Trailer Movie {Definition}: Any motion picture, video or film whereby
the movie's funniest, scariest and/or most dramatic/action scene(s), is
included, coupled w both plot & overall-message in less than a 3:00
minute 'trailer', rendering the actual full-length film a complete &
utter waste of time. There are hoards of bad 'trailer movies'; however,
'Neighbors' is arguably the quintessential trailer movie of all time.
It's as though the creators of this flick, were attempting to force a
square peg (e.g. a 2x4), into a round hole (a mouse's rectum). Perhaps
one day, rating movie-trailers will become as mainstream, as rating the
actual movie itself..., and should that day ever arrive, this trailer
will well deserve a strong '8', because like a high-dollar Vegas call
girl, sipping on champagne at the Mirage, I ultimately paid for the
night's rental.
