Three stars is generous

"The Babadook" is one of those movies that starts off really well, and
then plummets into predictability. By the last third of this movie, I
was looking for the exit, and I was feeling sad that I had just spent
$8.00 US to see it. Please AVOID this letdown of a horror movie. The
plot is just so weak, that it is pathetic. If people on here awarded
this a 1-star, I can understand that. I will never again see "The
Babadook".
