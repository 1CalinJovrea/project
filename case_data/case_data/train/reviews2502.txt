From start to finish, this movie was out of sorts. It couldn't build up
a head of steam and thus in the process failed to deliver any sort of
impact. Javier Bardem was on point in his brief cameo, and even Sean
Penn managed to pull off the traditionally burly action hero enigma,
but everything else was frail and flavorless. I usually watch my movies
with concentration, but this one was hard to pay attention to, thus I
allowed myself some shut eye in between. The protagonist's motive to
fight was not strong, and things were happening too conveniently for my
liking. The action sequences were somewhat realistic, and the
cinematography was nice. But that's almost it. Pretty disappointing.
