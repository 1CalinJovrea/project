Joy-less

It's not hard to see why this movie divides people. Some will always
find a tale of an under-dog's trial over adversity compelling, no
matter how clumsily it's told. And some will find a story about the
manufacture of a mop dull, no matter how charismatic the characters or
inspirational the telling of the tale. The problem here is that
charisma and inspiration are in short supply. David O. Russell doesn't
make much of the real strengths of the story. And he can't resist
imposing his trademark style on characters and a story that really
don't either warrant or suit it. So the characters are more than a
little grotesque around the edges; the situations are all heightened,
even given an absurdist spin; and the facts are never allowed to get in
the way, even when they might actually strengthen the story. So much of
Joy is desperately predictable, which makes for dispiriting viewing.
And the real moments of surprise or pathos are just so much grist to
the Russell mill. Jennifer Lawrence somehow shines through in the lead,
and Isabella Rossellini does her best to enliven her scenes, but that's
about where the positives end. For the most part, Joy is a tedious
mess. While it's a story that would probably never have been told
without David O. Russell wanting to enhance it with his schtick, it's a
story I wish they'd entrusted to anyone other than David O. Russell.
