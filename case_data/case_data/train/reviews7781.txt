Hard to know at what age this is pitched

I went with my five year old daughter and she was obviously getting
bored by about two thirds of the way through.Some of the humour was a little beneath her but at the same time, there
were sections I thought a tad scary.The story was a bit loose and everything was rather too hectic. But I'm
not a five year old I suppose.In summary, I've sat through many children's films, most of which were
better in terms of plot, nuance, implementation, etc.Five year old's dad (aged 50).
