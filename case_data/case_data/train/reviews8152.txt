A Once-in-a-lifetime experience

By some miracle, the run time of this movie has proved to be the exact
same length as that of the forth installment of the Transformers
franchise. Having slogged through nearly three hours of robots hitting
robots shot from a camera permanently fixed between the thighs of our
lead female protagonist a week earlier, Richard Linklater's latest
contribution to modern cinema was a more than welcome reminder that
visionary filmmakers still exist, and that the actual run time compared
to how long the run time feels speaks much of film quality. Boyhood documents the early life of a boy called Mason, beginning at
six, then continuing all the way through middle-school, high school and
eventually his move to college at eighteen years of age. Although the
story line is fairly simplistic and one might argue, unadventurous, the
sheer ambition of the director is reason enough to hand your money
over; shot over twelve years with the same group of actors, audiences
can experience the true evolution of a character like never before.However as Linklater said himself, if the audience see this merely as
an experiment, then he has failed at his task. The movie has its own
story to tell. The aforementioned criticism of an overly simplistic
plot is what makes the story so identifiable not just for young people,
but for adults as well; the film could easily be called 'adulthood' or
'parenthood' or even take a more generalised title of 'Life' -
Linklater understands people, and is therefore one of the few modern
filmmakers who understands the importance of well-rounded, interesting
and relatable characters to tell a story.When watching Boyhood, you don't think of the ramifications, the
possible pitfalls and how difficult it must have been to make. You
instead choose to enjoy it at surface level, only truly appreciating
the sheer brilliance of what has been achieved after the film. This
really is a once-in-a-lifetime film and therefore a once-in-a-lifetime
experience for anyone watching it. Soon to be a modern classic, this is
a picture that will be looked back on as one of the greatest ever made.
