Exhilarating and fun, with a great performance from Dylan O'Brien, but needs a more-shaped world.

American Assassin was not made to be "new". The movie does what it
needs to do. It provides a satisfying story full of action at every
turn. While the story is, as I said, satisfying, it is not without its
faults. Some of the one-dimensional side characters should have had
more backstory. For those who worried about how Dylan O'Brien would do
in the role of Mitch Rapp, I think it is safe to say that he absolutely
nailed it. In fact, Dylan, Michael Keaton, and Taylor Kitsch all turned
in great performances. If there is a sequel, and I really hope there is
one, I look forward to seeing the world around the main characters
fleshed out.
