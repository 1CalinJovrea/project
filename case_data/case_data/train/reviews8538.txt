Don't waste your money or your time.

What else can I say that hasn't been said by other reviewers? Yes, this
movie is boring, pretentious, stupid, with pseudo-intellectual dialogs,
etc. The first two minutes were interesting...but then the "dialogue"
started. It was downhill from there on. At first I thought, "oh, the
problem is that this movie is obviously dubbed and it would sound
better in its original language," but then I saw Christian Slater
appear so I realized that was not the problem. Then the main character
says her first sexual encounter was comprised of three thrusts through
her vagina and five through the back door, and the old man that is
listening to her says "Ah, Fibonacci numbers!" Hell, I am a physicist
and I deal with math everyday, and when I hear the numbers 3 and 5
strung together I don't think about a far-fetched Fibonacci sequence,
but prime numbers instead. I cannot tell you about what happens during
the rest of the movie because I was only able to endure about half an
hour more.Let me sum it up this way: Remember that episode of "Seinfeld" when
they all go to see an "art" film, "Rochelle, Rochelle! A young woman's
erotic journey from Milan to Minsk," and it is so boring and
pretentious that they leave the movie theater? Well, there you go. This
movie makes Rochelle, Rochelle! look like "Citizen Kane" in comparison.
