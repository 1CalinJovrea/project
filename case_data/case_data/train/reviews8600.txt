If you are a Stooges fan, go see this movie!

As a Three Stooges fan, I was a little biased to not like this movie.
It still bothers me that others made millions from the reruns, and
Stooges themselves got little or nothing. I know that the Farrelly
Brothers hope to profit from this film, and they deserve it. The
reverence that they must have for the Stooges comes through very
clearly. From the structure of the film, to the script, and to to
performances, everything was perfect. The actors nailed their parts -
in voice, mannerisms, and heart. I truly was as if the original Moe,
Larry, and Curly were on the screen.All of that aside, the movie was funny. I cannot remember a time when I
was in a theater where there was so much laughter coming from the
audience. Even my teenage daughter and her two friends laughed out
loud. One scene had me laughing so hard that tears came to my eyes.So, if you are a Three Stooges fan, this is a must see movie.P.S. Be sure to sit through the credits. It is a Farrelly Brothers
movie after all.
