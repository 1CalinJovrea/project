Oddly common story, Tim lost his touch.

Making the animation different in a common story was not at all
beneficial but instead it became dull and boring. From the title itself
it is already predictable and Tim was stuck with the same common story
rather than exploring it. Contrary to the story of giving life, the
film looks dead in a grave. The idea of making a new animation film in an old black & white format
was a good one but not for this this kind of story. I would rather see
Nightmare Before Christmas in full black and white because of its
complex and different storyline. Great animation comes from great imagination. Tim Burton was indeed
among those greats but not in this film of copydog or copycat or copy
frankie!
