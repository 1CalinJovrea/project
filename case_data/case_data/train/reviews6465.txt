Despite the controversy, quite dull and pointless.A movie that relies largely on the shock value of its subject matter
and of some of its scenes. Take these away and it is largely empty.There are some interesting themes that appear - fidelity (and
infidelity), addiction, control - but these are just touched upon. In
the end it is the usual Lars von Trier exercise in pretentious
navel-gazing. Even the erotic scenes are hardly erotic, seeming just
ho-hum and a chore.Performances are like the characters: dull. Charlotte Gainsburg only
does pretentious roles (which explains why she tends to appear in von
Trier movies) and this is no exception. Stellan Sarsgaard is
particularly boring. Shia Lebeouf seems out of his depth in a serious
movie. His accent is particularly appalling and laughable, ending up
somewhere between English, South African and Australian.About the only performance that I found riveting was that of Uma
Thurman, but unfortunately her screen time is very limited.
