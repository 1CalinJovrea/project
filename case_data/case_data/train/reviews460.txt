Fans of The Untouchables Will Certainly Enjoy this Gangster Movie

In 1949, in Los Angeles, the ambitious and ruthless kingpin Mickey
Cohen (Sean Penn) controls drugs, prostitution and gambling and has the
local judge and police department in his pocket. When Sergeant John
O'Mara (Josh Brolin) busts Mickey's brothel to rescue a naive newcomer
in town, Police Chief Parker (Nick Nolte) summons him and offers to
O'Mara to form an unofficial unit to destroy Mickey's facilities and
shipments to take him down. O'Mara and his wife select four incorruptible cops to work with him.
Then a fifth police officer joins the team in the beginning of a war
against Mickey's empire of crime."Gangster Squad" is an entertaining movie based on the biography of the
powerful and violent gangster Meyer Harris "Mickey" Cohen. This
criminal indeed ended his days in Alcatraz but years later, sentenced
twice for tax evasion and not for murder. Unfortunately the true story
was not written this way.The cast is magnificent, with names such as Sean Penn, Josh Brolin,
Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Robert Patrick, Giovanni Ribisi among many
others and the art direction and costumes is also excellent. The plot
has many clichés and works like a cartoon, with the bullets
occasionally hitting the heroes, but all of that is part of the
entertainment. Fans of "The Untouchables" will certainly enjoy this
effective gangster movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Caça aos Gângsteres" ("Hunting Down the Gangsters")
