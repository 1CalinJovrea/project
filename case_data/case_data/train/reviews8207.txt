Old guys, getting older and fighting it every step of the way.

With this "A" list of actors how can you go wrong in plunking down a
couple bucks and forget about life for awhile. All the crap that is
being put in movie theaters and being pushed off as movies -- this is a
movie you can feel good about and laugh at. Baby Boomers will like this
movie. It pushes a lot of memory buttons. Good actors pull it off
without a hitch. They take you by the hand and show you that growing
older is not an option but growing old is -- there is nothing as
comforting to the soul as old friends -- and new love cannot replace
mature love. This movie also gives women a glimpse into struggles men
have in getting older. Watch with a discerning eye and enjoy
storytelling that makes you laugh and appreciate life all the more. Way
to go Hollywood-- you finally got one right.
