Gorgeous & Stunning, A Total Blast

The Great Wall, from director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying
Daggers) comes this big and beautiful epic that is told to the audience
as being legend, not fact (as the trailers were terrible at telling
us). When William and Tovar are taken hostage by the Nameless Order who
patrol the Great Wall of China, they are unwillingly pulled into a
centuries-old fight between humanity and something much older that
threatens all of civilization.The movie is an astounding and thrilling ride from beginning to end,
never letting up on the action or the beautifully constructed
production that weaves seamlessly with the brilliant visual effects.
The cast is incredible, "becoming" their roles wholly, with the banter
between Damon and Pascal hysterical, while the determination and
steadfastness of Jing Tian's Commander Lin and the other leaders is
very believable. But, what I find to be the best thing about the film
is how it's not entirely serious, as there's always a certain
"playfulness" to the action sequences (save for the final siege).Everything about the movie was top-notch, from the production design to
the emotionally-charged musical score from Ramin Djawadi (Game of
Thrones, Person of Interest). If you want a big, stunning spectacle, go
see The Great Wall. It's a solid blend of action, adventure, warfare
and terrifying monster-driven fun.
