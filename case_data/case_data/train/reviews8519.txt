Plot as thin as the air at 30,000 feet

Terrible, headache-inducing film full of clich√©s and plot holes. For
example, how did the masterminds know that the second air marshal would
pull a gun on Bill and that Bill would have no choice but to kill him?
Maybe the guy would've just broken down and cried, or maybe it would've
taken 35 minutes instead of 20.It's also just lazy film making. For instance, the passenger who
appears to be Muslim WASN'T the terrorist after all! Wow, such
inventive mis-direction totally blew me away. And he turned out be a
doctor who HELPS people... Yawn (by the way, his profession sounds like
someone who has a PhD, not an MD, but anyway...). The co-pilot had to bring the plane down to 8,000 feet so the bomb
could explode without de-pressurizing the cabin. But the jets would
shoot down the plane if he did that because he would be endangering
civilians. So why didn't the co-pilot just keep the plane flying over
the open ocean, radio that that he was going to descend so a bomb could
explode, and NOT RISK being shot down? Such a frustrating film to
endure.But there were many smaller issues, too. Such as in one scene we see
the phone's screen says January, but when they land in Iceland it
appears to be a comfortable 70 degrees out (the January average high
temp. is 35 F).
