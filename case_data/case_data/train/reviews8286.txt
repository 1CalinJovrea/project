Take one cup of "Fear and Lothing in Las Vegas", one slice of "American Psycho" and add a bit of "Fightclub"

If you are a friend of funny, thrilling and bizarre movies, you're
gonna love this one! First of all, this movie manages to surprise you
again and again till the end. It switches between funny, dramatic and
thrilling elements. James McAvoy gives an amazing performance (by far
the best I've seen from him) as the funny, manipulative, sick,
drug-addicted, broken, Cop and manages to portrait every aspect of the
character. Another piece of awesome acting is delivered by Jim
Broadbent who plays his psychologist. The dialogues between him and
James McAvoy are just amazing! The rest of the cast is also decent and
the characters are all very special in a refreshing way. The only bad
thing i can mention about this movie is, that it has some (but small)
longueurs. I can recommend it to everyone who likes movies of this kind
and has no problem with movies containing a lot of sex, drugs and
f*cked up moments :)
