This movie sucks

The only spoiler in this review is that this movie sucks. I wish I had
that spoiler before I wasted my night on it. It's basically some douche
watched Trick R Treat and thought, "Hey, that doesn't look too hard,"
and then made a ***crud*** movie. Trick R Treat is an 8. This is a 2 at
best. I wouldn't ever stoop to padding my comment to reach the minimum
length, but this trashpile is lucky I've wasted 6 lines and 48 seconds
even mentioning it. Ugh.
