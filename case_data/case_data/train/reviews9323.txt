Good premise, terrible execution

The premise of the movie, two ordinary people managing to survive in
the Rockies in the middle of winter, seemed to be an engaging,
potentially intriguing movie. Right from the start, however, the "what
the heck" moments began to come at you faster than you could deal with
them.To begin with, you are at a large airport that is shutdown for weather,
when the sky is still blue and the sun is out. Yes, a storm is
approaching, but still. I've flown out of airports in much worse
weather conditions before. Nevertheless, a twin engine private plane is
allowed to take off with no flight plan, explained away by Beau Bridges
since they were flying "VFR", meaning the skies were clear enough to
navigate with no help. Huh??? Luckily for him, Beau Bridges' character
dies in the crash so he's mercifully out of this hot mess at this
point.Once they crash on the mountain, the lead characters trudge through
snow, ice and whatever in winter gear that magically appeared in the
downed plane. They did this, apparently over a number of weeks, yet
when they took off their coats, his hair and beard always appeared as
well groomed as the day they left, and her hair always looked like it
had been freshly washed and coiffed.At this point, I kinda just went along for the ride, just to see who
survived. That, and the dog, who was the real star of the show!Can't recommend this movie. I don't know if the director of this had
much (or any) previous experience, but the attention to detail is so
bad I almost found myself laughing at the incongruities.
