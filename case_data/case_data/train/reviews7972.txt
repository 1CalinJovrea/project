Its about time the truth is coming out of the Armenian Genocide

Very proud there is a movie coming out about the Armenian genocide. My
great grandparents survived this genocide and went through hell. It is
a shame that the Turks are brain washed and in denial about something
so cruel their people did. I also noticed a lot of those in denial are
making horrible reviews to sway people's opinions to see the movie.
Just horrible. Go see the movie for yourself to see the TRUTH!
