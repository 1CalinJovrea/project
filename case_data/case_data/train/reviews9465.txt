God-awful, boring , stretched out 105 minute long drama.

I am simply gonna list the pros and cons about this movie. Pros:
-Acting is fine, the main character (Henry) is pretty good. -Direction
of photography is pretty good. -The locations used are great. -Smart
symbolism. -Music is fine. -Movie gets minutely better by the end.Cons: -Little cheesy, clunky dialogue. -Shameless product placement
thrice in the movie. -Pretty predictable plot. -Some characters don't
have good chemistry, feels kinda forced. -Really slow paced. -They kill
off their most interesting character too early. -Unlikeable mother for
the whole film. -Misleading marketing. -They ruin the tone at the end
by crappy humour. -Its stupid that NO ONE in the town arrests Glenn
after so much evidence, it is convenient writing, No investigations?
Really? Who wrote this movie, its boring as hell and it would never
happen in real life.
