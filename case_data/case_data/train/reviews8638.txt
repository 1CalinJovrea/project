Very Personal Movie

Your life will most likely determine whether or not you like this film,
whether or not it moves you.I read the book and was not sure how they were going to make such an
introspective novel into a movie but they did a pretty good job. My
group of friends had mixed reactions, some of us were deeply moved
(myself included) some where wondering why we were...I felt the way her story was portrayed in flashbacks was very effective
and about the only way to tell this story. It can never be as deep as
the emotions in the book and it had to skim over a lot but still, for
me and others I was with it was very powerful.On a superficial side note... I wish she had looked dirtier. Her hair
and clothes always looked too clean for what she was doing with very
minimal hygiene.
