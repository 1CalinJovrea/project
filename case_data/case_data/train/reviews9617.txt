2
Just really, really bad...

While the first "Journey..." movie with Hutcherson and Brandon Fraser
had a very slight whiff of entertainment value and was even vaguely
believable, this second installment, this time with Hutcherson and with
"The Rock" subbing for Fraser, this time as a concerned step-father. Hutcherson is continuing on his path as a young "Verneian" - i.e.,
someone who subscribes to Jules Verne's novels as though they were
factual documents describing real places and experiences - and within 5
minutes manages to convince his step-father to fly him far away to the
middle of the South Pacific to an island - sorry, a "mysterious island"
- that is not known to actually exist. Within the next 5 minutes they manage to convince a helicopter pilot (a
pretty silly Luis Guzman) to do something that no pilot would ever do -
i.e., fly into the middle of a thunderstorm - and then, of course, run
across the "mysterious island." The subsequent plot lines are basically superfluous. The story is a
slap-dash bit of feeble CGI patchwork construction that almost never
engages your attention. In fact, if you watch the credits you'll see no
less than 10 different "visual effects" companies were contracted to
make this movie. Lots of ridiculous and unbelievable monsters and
insects and spiders. The pilot's young daughter - Vanessa Hudgens, who
is there primarily to relieve the otherwise stupefying plot by wearing
a sweat-soaked wife beater heaving with her cleavage - exists as the
love interest for Hutcherson. "Journey 2" basically feels like eating a bunch of Halloween candy - a
quick rush here and there but at the end very little fulfillment. Skip
it.
