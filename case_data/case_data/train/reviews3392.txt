A genre-breaking classic

There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that
will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like
its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many
questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments
during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and
I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in
front of the screen.It is easy to criticize this movie as some have done for being overly
ambitious, pandering to low taste, being too simple or too complex,
with too few actors or too many, or even for celebrating revenge
violence against professional critics who write negative reviews. They
may all be correct, but these critics will still put themselves in the
same category as those that warned audiences against 2001 or Blade
Runner. The truth is that Cloud Atlas is profound in its reach, its
visual and acoustic impact, its mesmerizing flow and its completely
ground-breaking storytelling, and movie goers will see it and feel it
in their guts. It is a movie that is a product of our age of internet-driven universal
knowledge and vision, and the freedom we have to travel the world and
jump between ages, genres, images and identities at our will. It
reminds us that we are human and that we can still hear our heart beat,
if we listen.
