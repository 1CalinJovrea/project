Shame on critics and the whole ACADEMY

When you see the metascores and the reviews and THE WORST ACTORS
ALTOGETHER "award", i have only seen opposite of that...From all the choices of movies and actors in this year Oscar AA this
should have won in at least half of that...I mean - MOONLIGHT - total stupidity and waste of precious time...
wining combination for academy is: GAY/RACISM/DRUGS wow...Conclusion: I suggest you see this touching and emotional movie... Will
Smith rules...
