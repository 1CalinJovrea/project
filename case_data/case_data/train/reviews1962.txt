Nothing great.

This movie is about 5 friends - 4 guys, 1 girl - who go on a roadtrip
to various Halloween haunted houses. Along the way, they discover some
rather weird people. Still, they're not satisfied with the "Mickey
Mouse" halloween houses, so they opt for those of a darker, more
realistic nature, which they soon find. Some of them chase the group of
out the houses with chainsaws. That leads the group to wonder just how
far some people will go not just to scare the guests, but to also a
thrill for themselves, which is the message of the movie: How far will
people go for a thrill.The acting was good enough for what this was. Brandy Schaefer - the
lead actress - is hot She reminded me a lot of Danielle Harris :D It's
filmed through camcorders, which is an overused and rather annoying
leftover gimmick from The Blair Witchcraft days. The movie finally
starts moving along about 20 minutes before it ends; it's running time
is 91 minutes, so yeah it's a bit boring up until then. I've heard
there was an underworld of drugs, sex, and other dark vises, but I
guess this movie is trying to say there's an underworld of Halloween
houses, too. lol There is some nudity in this. The group goes to a
strip club, and there are topless dancers with some of the fakest
breasts I've ever seen.I gave this a 4-star rating. The storyline about visiting haunted
houses was original, and as I said, the acting was pretty good for a
low-budget indie. I love Halloween; it's probably my favorite holiday,
but this movie did very little to keep me interested. Most of it had
the group traveling from one haunted house to another. It wasn't very
enthralling. But if you're a fan of found-footage films, you might
enjoy this more than I did. I would not watch this again because of the
bore-factor.
