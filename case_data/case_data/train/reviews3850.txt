'The Diary of a Teenage Girl' Review: Refreshing Take on Coming-of-Age, Bel Powley a Rising Star - 8ish

Only so often are we treated with a refreshing new look with a
different angle of a movie. This time Marielle Heller hands us a
hilarious, heartfelt coming-of-age film starring the talented Bel
Powley. She uses drawings and creativity in describing what's going on
in a young woman's head when she first has sex, and well, an affair,
and the feelings that come along with those experiences.Minnie (Bel Powley) starts the movie with saying she just had sex for
the first time and how incredible it was. She has these moments with
herself and records them on cassette to get all the feelings and
thoughts out, as a form of a diary. She shares with her friends and her
mom Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), but keeps a secret. Minnie continues to
have sex and doesn't want to stop. Feelings spiral. She decides to have
questionable experiences with her friends, and even regrets some. She
eventually comes to terms with her relationship and learns, just like
everyone does.Bel Powley is the next rising star in Hollywood. She is an incredible
talent and amusing, while sometimes delirious. For a character who's
comical, sarcastic and emotional, she nailed it. I really enjoyed this
movie, way more than I expected. It reminded me of "The Perks of Being
a Wallflower" in a lot of ways. It's a very easy watch and a great way
to laugh at the humorous writing."The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a wonderful watch and can be enjoyed
by people of both genders. If it's somewhat of a true depiction of what
a female feels after having sex for the first time, it's an interesting
look inside those feelings for a male. It's lovely all the way through,
and a perfect date-night movie.Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!
