Surprisingly decent

Here's me, thinking I'd have to go through this horrible movie just to
see Victoria Justice in it but I was totally wrong. It was quite the
opposite actually, I had to go through Victoria Justice so I can watch
these interesting characters fall in love.Yeah, it has its typical teenage moments; parties and stuff but it's a
decent love story. Perhaps the movie is too much concentrated on the
lead characters but it is forgivable since I enjoyed every moment of
them discussing (their) life.Both of the lead actors are beautiful, charismatic and especially the
female lead, interesting personality. She doesn't believe in facebook
and twitter and stuff, she wants the old-fashioned way, meeting a boy
in a bar or perhaps a dark alley ;)
