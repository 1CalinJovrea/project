Vaughn is Let Loose

People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew
Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with
this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an
emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. There are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it.
It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly,
as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and
comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys,
but it will throw some off. The film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being
a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an
odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with
the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad
guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a
different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly
suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton,
handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good
actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are
sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone,
but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's
best work.8.75
