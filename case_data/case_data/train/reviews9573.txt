Logical Errors

I Liked the movie but they should know more details about Turkey! Even
my girlfriend she is from Russia, she told the city doesn't seem like
Istanbul . Albania doesn't have border between Turkey.Budget is
$45,000,000 How come did you find 80's police cars , Even those cars
not driving anymore for 20 years! I never seen before Covered Women in
Turkey like a Arabian Countries. In the movie every women have black
cover.Mostly people in USA drive Automatic cars and the girl didn't
pass driving test 2 times but The girl drives a manual car perfectly in
Turkey. How come ? If you didn't go Istanbul before you won't go to
Istanbul after this movie.It is not fair!I think Taken 1 was better
