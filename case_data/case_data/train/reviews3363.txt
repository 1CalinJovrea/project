I'ts awesome!

The movie is a perfect FPS shooing game where you're just seat. You
know you're win, you know the plot is not that complicated, you see the
picture is awesome! And that's 90 mins of a pure joy. You just have
your beer and relax. That's it. Just a perfect rainy day evening I had.My point is that the movie is a perfect sample of what you would expect
form the action movie.
