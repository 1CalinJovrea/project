Wonderful truthful retelling of Benghazi

I feel compelled to review this and say what a wonderful and truthful
retelling of the Benghazi battle this movie is. BIG props to Michael
Bay and his team, especially having the real men as close consultants
on the film. Well done the actors for a very realistic portrayal of
these heroes. This film answered all my questions about Benghazi and
has HUGE integrity. Was very violent- as were the real events but very
realistically done. It was so shocking watching the attack on
Ambassador Stevens and hearing him radioing for help- so hard to watch,
his poor family :( This film should be shown in to every politician and
every school kid around the world. Great film 10/10
