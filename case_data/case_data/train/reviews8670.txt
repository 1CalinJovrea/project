Crappy Die-Hard genre movie resting on a flawed gimmick

Do you know what would happen if you blew up every single U.S. ICBM as
it sat in its silo? No? Well neither do the bad guys in this movie who
plan to do just that to inflict suffering and famine on the U.S. Let me
tell you: You'd get a lot of damaged silos from the chemical reactions
and the kinetic effects of missile shrapnel.What you wouldn't get is a single nuclear detonation, because ICBM
missiles have to be armed with launch codes before they can go BOOM.
And since the terrorists in this movie never even asked for those
codes, the country was never in any danger, and everybody around the
command center table in that movie should go take remedial Missiles
101.
