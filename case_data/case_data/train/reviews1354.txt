Not bad but not good either...

I went to see HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET last night and didn't
enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. The story is dull and predictable
and the acting isn't rocksolid!Jennifer Lawrence played her role well
though, she "blows" everyone away in this movie BUT, on the other hand,
and I don't want to sound too negative, this flick wasn't a very hard
nut for her to crack!The story ;Elissa (Lawrence) moves into a new home together with her mom
Sarah(Elisabeth Shue) and finds out that the son of a murdered couple,
who lived next door, still lives in the house where his parents were
killed. The surrounding neigbours complain about him and tell Elissa
that the boy is bad news! She wants to find out herself though and
steps into his life...It's a not a very bad movie but skip the theatre and wait for it on
bluray/DVD.
