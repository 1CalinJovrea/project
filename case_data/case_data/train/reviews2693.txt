Vampires. But not as we know them!

I have just seen this film as part of the famous Bridport Film Festival
called "From page to screen". It features films that have been adapted
from books and are very often accompanied, either before or after the
screening, by a question and answer session with either the Director,
Producer or Author etc. Bridport is in the county of Dorsetshire in the
United Kingdom. This pre-release screening of Byzantium was enhanced by
a very informative Q&A with the Producer Stephen Woolley. If you are
expecting fangs, crucifixes, coffins and garlic prepare to be
surprised! These vampires are a new take on a familiar theme. Much of
the film is shot on location in the seaside town of Hastings which
gives it a fabulously grungy and stark atmosphere. I have to admit that
I didn't really want to go and see "another" vampire film. Believe me
when I say that this is not just "another" vampire film.
