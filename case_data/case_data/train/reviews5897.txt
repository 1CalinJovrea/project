Good entertainment

I like Cruise. He takes acting so seriously. He is always trying hard
to satisfy the cinema audience. The plot itself is not the best. But I
liked how it established a plot development in which Jack Reacher got
nearly convinced he might have a daughter. And how Cruise played this
character who is getting acquainted to the idea of having a child. I
was emotionally captured by the closing pictures, when the girl wants
to embrace him - her "might have been dad" - but Jack stays confined
and clueless before relaxing himself. All the believable emotion is
played in a way that only Cruise can do. It is a pity that Cruise still
gets underrated for his performances. He deserves that the critics take
him seriously. With Jack Reacher Cruise has established a clever
character. He might be able to come back to Reacher from time to time
without need to stay young forever.
