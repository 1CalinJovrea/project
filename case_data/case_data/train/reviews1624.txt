Beautiful story about gay love under the Italian sun

This movie has gotten very good reviews, and I was excited when I saw
it during a film festival in Oslo, even opening film. The story takes
place in Italy in 1983. A wealthy Italian family receives an American
male researcher who will live with them for 6 weeks. The meeting
between him and the family's teenage son is the foundation of the story
in this film. The film depicts the tension between the two, which
eventually evolve into a close friendship. A friendship that evolves
into a sexual relationship. The film is beautifully portrayed. The two
men unfold in a beautiful landscape. But film is slow and briefly
depicts how the contact between the two evolves. In my opinion, the
film could be have shorter, and would have benefited on that. It's a
too slow and somewhat tedious. The film's content is also not very new,
but it's beautifully filmed. It also reflects on a theme that shows
that we are not going back so many years back before gay relationships
were taboo and that such love had to be hidden. In addition, this is
also about an adult man initiating a relationship with a teenage boy.
There is solid craftsmanship in both filming, acting and role- playing.
But the direction could have been tighter, in my opinion, and the film
is too long. But I still enjoyed seeing it.
