A thriller whose basic plot is as bad as a B-Horror movie

I went to see this movie with a couple of friends at a special
screening, we are all fans of Lanthimos previous works, but when this
movie ended we looked at each other and chuckled nervously in
disappointment. A few people in the audience even left immediately
after the end and one man a few minutes later gave the movie an ironic
clap, people laughed. It was that bad.The movie starts out really strongly, with all the daily awkwardness in
human interactions Lanthimos can so easily portray and reshape. There's
mystery, intrigue, the characters develop as the movie progresses, it
delves into wider themes: the nuclear family, growing up, sexual
awakenings and revenge. It is obvious Lanthimos sought to portray a
"what if" situation in the movie that would make the viewer reflect on
this themes, but the plot construction and thriller-like soundtrack and
filming leaves the viewer demanding answers (like you normally get in
the end of a thriller) or a twist. Instead the movie goes bland, it's
extremely anticlimactic to the point of being comparable to bad horror
movies where the intrigue goes nowhere. A lack of answers to basic questions as to the function of Lanthimos
universes is usual in his movies, but here it doesn't work: this isn't
a dystopian family or society, the movie is set in a world that feels
like our own, yet we aren't given any explanations for the surreal
undertones this world can have.
