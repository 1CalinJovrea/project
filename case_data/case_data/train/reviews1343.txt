Blanche and Stella in Woodyland

What a treat! Cate Blanchett gives a stunning performance as a
Blanche-like character written and directed by the most prolific
American author of the last 40 years. Cate seems to be an actress
without emotional borders. Jasmine walks a very tight rope, her sense
of despair etched in her magnificent face vanishes ipso facto when she
meets Peter Sarsgaard. She realizes in a sort of disbelief
-extraordinary, heartbreaking and horribly funny moment - that he could
be the rescue raft in her own personal tsunami. Sally Hawkins, another
stroke of genius in the casting department, is a profoundly human
creature very much the Stella of the situation. This two sisters,
adopted both from different parents are also from different, if
immediately recognizable, universes. I could go on and on but I'm not
going to, I just wanted to urge you, in this times of 3D super extra
loud marvel sequels, to run and see it.
