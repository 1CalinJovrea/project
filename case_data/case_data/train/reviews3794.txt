Do you all work for Cannes???

I'm not sure what you wanted for this film, with the endless negative
reviews.I'm sure Doyle works to sell movies and get the cult following like he
has, the original Trainspotting was one of if not the best film of the
90's.What do you all want? A group of reckless teenagers taking heroin
having loose sex and drinking? Go watch the original again.So we have Sickboy/Simon, who's doing a decent job of blackmailing
folk, but from the original yeah that sounds about right.Spud, is still on heroin again sounds right, I read a review saying
after a run he was off it, who said? Just never seen him take it...Begby, prison for 20 years sounds spot on, the break out was far
fetched, but has happened in lesser programs.The interesting thing about Renton, is that he is clean, and throughout
the film never gets back on the skag...For me it's the perfect progression for all of the main characters, put
the nostalgia in and we have the perfect sequel, not as good as the
first but pretty damn close. Before people criticize me for 10 ratings
I don't hand em out regularly 3 so far 2 being Trainspotting and Pulp
Fiction.Remember guys, you're not doing what you did 20 years ago.
