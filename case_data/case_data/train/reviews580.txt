Would You Rather Watch Something Else?

A truly bad movie from start to finish. A movie about a rich family who
makes people hurt others to gain rewards. Usually movies with that type
of theme have people make choices to see who is good at their core, but
this one has nothing like that within it. This movie is just about a
sadistic family who makes people stab, shoot, etc. others for no
apparent reason.The only interesting character was Amy who was the coldest character at
the table. The rest of the cast was forgettable.The script (even the game) was beyond bad.Not worth watching.
