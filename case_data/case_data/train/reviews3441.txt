A seriously fun Cruise lead comedy/thriller

While we all eagerly await the release of the recently announced Top
Gun sequel, Tom Cruise's latest slice of polished Hollywood
entertainment American Made, allows us all to see what it's like when
Maverick becomes a little naughty in his retirement from flying fighter
jets, verbally sparring with Iceman and making out with Kelly McGillis.Re-teaming with his Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman, American Made
is a relentlessly energized and seriously fun examination of the true
life story of American Airlines pilot Barry Seal, who gave up his life
as an everyday pilot to not only become a CIA recruited pilot
delivering messages, guns and various other treats to South American
contacts, but a drug runner for the Pablo Escobar Columbian drug trade,
which makes for a wild ride that would be utterly unbelievable were it
not in fact based on truth.Fair warning to all, Liman and his leading man are totally uninterested
in giving a dry history lesson of Seal's exploits, as American Made
sees the two Hollywood heavy hitters instead turn their trajectory
towards delivering a heightened and often over the top examination of
these events and with Liman bringing his Bourne Identity and Edge of
Tomorrow expertise with him to the event and with Cruise seemingly
having the most fun his had in years, the risk to go for something
different other than an awards baiting or dialogue heavy expose has
paid off hugely, with American Made easily becoming one of the year's
most purely fun and enjoyable rides.At almost 60 years of age you'd be rightfully thinking it's about time
that Cruise take a seat back and enjoy a more quiet time in his career
but the unstoppable and enthusiastic leading man is having a blast here
bringing Seal to life.In almost every scene of the film, Cruise and Liman continue on with
their rapport that they built in Edge of Tomorrow and Liman should be
commended for bringing out Cruise's natural talents for comedy and when
mixed with his easy going charisma that has made him such a beloved
acting figure, Seal offers Cruise one of his best and most interesting
roles in his long and varied career, no small feat when you consider
the quality of his often underestimated C.V.American Made's frenetic and sometimes scattered focus may detract from
some viewers experiences and those looking for a more sombre take on a
no doubt very serious topic may be disappointed but Liman and his
cast's (that includes great bit turns from the likes of Sarah Wright as
Seal's wife Lucy and Caleb Landry Jones as Lucy's dim-witted brother
Bubba) ability to extract the absurdness and craziness of this whole
situation and turn it into such a fun piece of entertainment should be
a winner in the majority of cases, much like Scorsese's Wolf of Wall
Street did.Final Say Â– With Cruise on top form and Liman instilling his film with a
breathtaking amount of energy, American Made is a pure piece of
cinematic entertainment and an awesomely fun companion piece to
Cruise's other well-known plane centred star vehicle.4 future presidents out of 5
