Excellent

This is THE movie for anyone who wants to learn about the birth of all
modern computing and cryptography. It also provides a deep commentary
on the ignorance of people who hate those who do not fit in. I wish the
film could have gone into more detail about Alan Turing after the war
when his deepest personal struggles were in full force. However, for a
theatrical film it would have been far too long. This film illustrates
how far we have come as a society in terms of accepting gay and
lesbians and their contributions to society. I will not spoil the film
but for the cypherpunks out there you will be a little uneasy if you
compare the MI-6 tactics to those of today's NSA and other three letter
agencies that spy on our every digital move. All in all a brilliant
film with great actors that will move your hearts and minds.
