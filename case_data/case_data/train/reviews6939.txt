One of Mark's Best

From the very beginning to the dramatic end, the movie is thrilling.
There is not a scene in the movie which drags the story and every bit
is to a point. His acting is simple, on point and brilliant as usual
and this is one of the best smuggling films i would add to, after
Italian job and various others make to a good list. The fact that it
brings family, friendship, love, hate, betrayal and the usual bad guy
in the film may make it sound all ordinary as most of the films have
almost the same characters these days, but the reason i would ask you
guys to watch this film is because the touch it has unlike most of them
out these days.I don't think timing is any bit of a problem in this movie and the way
in which the scenes unfold is what i think keep you at the edge of your
seat through the movie. Anywhoo, A must watch! I loved it personally.
