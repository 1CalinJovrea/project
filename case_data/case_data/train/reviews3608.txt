Don't waste your time with this movie! Watch the original RoboCops!

I have watched the original RoboCop movies. This remake does not come
close to any of them! Many reviewers here comment to not compare it
with the original RoboCop movies. What kind of nonsense it that!!! This
is not a new and original story. It is a REMAKE!!!! Would you not
compare the next Titanic movie or the next Batman, Superman movies with
the previous versions?!!! Of course you will. You can't just copy
something and say it is not the same as original!! If it is supposed to
be similar to the original at least they could make this a better
movie. But they did not. The whole movie was just about how RoboCop
becomes RoboCop and gets his revenge. So much for the storyline. That
was just the first 5 minutes of the original RoboCop. Bad acting, bad
special effect. What a waste! A disgrace for RoboCop. It is a shame to
make a mockery of a classic movie!!!!
