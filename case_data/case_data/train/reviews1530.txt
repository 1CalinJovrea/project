Manchester by the Sea

My husband & I just watched this movie and I cannot believe how bad
this is. Characters are so unlikeable, the score is distracting and
awful, story is terrible. I was so disappointed since this is an Oscar
nominated movie for the film and for the actors. The acting was not
good. A total waste of time and not entertaining at all. The only
promising thing I can say about the movie is the scenery. The town is
right next to the ocean and is really pretty. The only likable
character is the brother who dies at the beginning. I usually don't
take the time to review a movie but this one is so bad, I just had to
put my thoughts on this site.
