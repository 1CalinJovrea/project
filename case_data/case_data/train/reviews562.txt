Tour de Force

The movie is not easy to watch. Right at the beginning you'll some
training "videos" (more like footage) from the real people that are
depicted in this movie. But it will be apparent a couple of moments
later, that there is a lot of Death to follow. It's almost a case of
what can go wrong will go wrong. And while there are a lot of other
outcomes that this could've taken, decisions had been made,
consequences had to be taken (upon).What really gets you though are not some clich√©s about soldiers (and I
think this stays as much as possible away from them), but the fact,
that this feels as real as it can be, without you actually being in a
war. Mark Wahlberg and the other actors have to go through a lot, when
... well you know what hits the fence. And it does hit pretty hard. Not
for anyone squeamish, this is fraught with tension ...
