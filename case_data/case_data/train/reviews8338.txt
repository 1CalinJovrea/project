A unique voice in a crowded genre

Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen following his
eight-year stint as the Governor of California was met with a
triumphant cheer from fans of the ridiculous, over-the-top action
movies that the Austrian actor helped popularize. Cranking out
testosterone-laced like The Expendables 2, Escape Plan and Sabotage, it
seemed like Arnold hadn't missed a step during his big- screen hiatus.But amid all the gunfire and explosions and catchphrases,
Schwarzenegger also managed to find time for some genuine acting. Set
against the backdrop of a small Midwestern town in the aftermath of a
deadly pandemic that produces zombie-like symptoms, Maggie opens with
quiet family man Wade (Schwarzenegger) driving into the city to pick up
his daughter (Abigail Breslin), who has just been diagnosed with the
virus.Unlike The Walking Dead, whose characters would resolve this problem
with a well-placed shot from a crossbow or pistol, the world of Maggie
is much more humane. There are numerous protocols in place for keeping
the virus contained, including setting aside a quarantine zone where
the infected are sent to live among each other until their condition
deteriorates to the point where they must be euthanized.Still in the early stages of infection, Maggie is allowed to return
home with Wade, with the admonishment that she be taken to the
quarantine zone once her symptoms become worse. Maggie's stepmother
(Joely Richardson) sends her own children to stay with relatives as a
precautionary measure, and the ramshackle farmhouse becomes a cradle of
tension and sorrow as the family bides their time waiting for the
inevitable.If you strip out the zombie-related elements, this could just as easily
have been any number of films about a teenager with a terminal illness
- the only real difference here is that Maggie's affliction leaves her
prone to grey skin, wounds that won't heal and a desire to consume raw
flesh. Downplaying the horror in favor of focusing on the familial
drama is a superb choice, and lends the film a distinct voice in the
cacophony of an already crowded genre.Maggie is easily the most emotional and melodramatic work of
Schwarzenegger's career, a somber and melancholy affair that showcases
a range we've never seen from the aging action superstar. His on screen
relationship with Breslin feels authentic and believable, and it's hard
not to sympathize with a loving father who knows his child is slipping
away.In his directorial debut, Henry Hobson knows just when to pull at the
audience's heartstrings. There's very little in the way of conventional
horror, which might disappoint some genre fans hoping for a few scares,
but this shouldn't be seen as a shortcoming. Maggie is an interesting
and unique approach to a subject that is often glossed over in other
zombie-related stories, and the quieter moments are the ones that
resonate the most.
