The Worst Movie I've ever seen!

This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. "Ted" is a foul mouthed
nasty rendition of what used to be a symbol of a sweet toy. You would
think that Hollywood get a clue about why all of their movies flop.
Either movies are redo's or trash like "Ted"! It amazes me that movies
like this can even be shown at a regular theater. My teenage daughter
asked to leave and this was the first movie she has ever done that to.
I think what is worse is that Mark Walberg the star of the show has
young children who will someday grow up and want to see movies their
dad has been in. He should be ashamed of himself and I won't be seeing
any of his movies in the future since he is going to stoop to this
level of worse than B movies.
