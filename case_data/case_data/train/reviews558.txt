Good movie, good actors and many critics

I don't know why so many people hated this movie. It is a good copy of
that genial comedy series. Everybody who saw the old The Three Stooges
knows that. The actors did a really good job, trying to be the most
similar possible. Of course the story is not brilliant but it were
enough to make me, at least, laugh a lot, like when Moe was on that TV
Show. I think the sense of humor of nowadays is completely wrong. People
think that if there is no sexual content or 'bad language' the movie is
bad. The three Stooges, the old or new, is the pure essence of humor. If
they started to make a new series of them with these actors would be
great.
