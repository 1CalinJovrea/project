One of the worst ...

I saw this at Sydney Film Festival. One of the worst movies I've ever
seen (and I see a lot!). I felt sorry for the actors - the script was
AWFUL. The direction, woeful. Holes all over the plot. The Director was
calling this a feminist movie - can't see that at all. Joseph Fiennes
had an Australian accent for the first scene and then reverted to his
normal English accent - lazy direction! Sex scenes that the audience
laughed out loud at. Awful. Director said it took 13 years to make this
movie. Sad. One of the finest Australian actors, Hugo Weaving, wasn't
even good in it. None of the main actors turned up for the Australian
premiere - no surprise there. I stayed for the Q&A after the film to
get some answers. The Director continued to talk it up without really
answering the questions. I'll never get those 2 hours of my life back!
