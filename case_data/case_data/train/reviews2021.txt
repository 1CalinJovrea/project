If you liked the first one, you'll like this

Just as raunchy and filthy as its predecessors, Horrible Bosses 2
feature the same three leads and follows them through their wild,
only-in-Hollywood adventures.Without spoiling any plot points from the first one, I'll just say that
the sequel's plot is slightly different. In this one, the three friends
decide to become their own bosses. Start-up businesses are hard, and
when two good-looking rich guys (Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine, in
case you were wondering) get in their way, the three idiots come up
with a plan that's, well, not a good or legal idea.If you didn't like the first one, you're not going to like the second
one. If you're over fifty or don't like raunchy, twenty-something
humor, you're not going to like either one. If you liked the first one,
chances are you'll think this one's funny, too.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.
However, due to sexual jokes and adult situations, I wouldn't let my
kids watch it.
