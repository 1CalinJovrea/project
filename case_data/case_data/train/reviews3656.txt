You'll Think You Spent Five Years Watching This Drivel

Rom-com C list drivel: predictable plot that takes its sweet time
getting to the painfully inevitable conclusion. A few funny moments,
but problems of both pacing and tone are fatal, as are the silly Brit
stereotypes, the silly Jewish stereotypes, the silly "clueless straight
guy" stereotypes. Jason Segal is, at times, so unbearably unattractive
 both physically and as a character  that the whole "love of her
life" angle turns into more disbelief than any normal person can
suspend without hydraulic help. In the end, what the film has to say
about relationships is a lot of galling treacle. That doesn't set it
apart from its appalling genre; rather, it simply reinforces how
utterly pointless that genre is.
