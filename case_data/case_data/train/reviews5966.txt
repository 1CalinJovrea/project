A waste of Money

It is going to be hard to make a review of this movie last 10 lines
because it is that bad. OK, some of the scenery of Mount Everest was
good. There were a few well known actors in the movie, but they were
given parts that were uninteresting in some cases. Some of the dialog
was either at low volume or spoken in another language, it was hard to
tell. I realize this was a true story, not a made up story. Another
couple of reviewers mentioned that one would be better off watching
"Vertical Limit." Unfortunately, they are correct. I love books and
movies about mountains, but not this one. Here is my final observation
of what I thought about this movie. After 30-45 minutes into the show,
I was hoping it would soon be over.
