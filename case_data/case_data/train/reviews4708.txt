A little adventure that will warmth your heart.

Chris Evans and Alice Eve played such emotional, brave, and lovely
characters in this movie. The movie is not the kind of romance that
shows to have a marriage of happily forever after, but instead it shows
the deepest life moments in such a few hours. Chris' acting was great
and Alice's was good, but not so great since she had to use her
American accent. The movie is also the first movie to be directed by
Chris Evans, which is pretty cool to see. But to be honest, Before We
Go is such a beautiful movie. It's very realistic to me, and it brought
a message for me that one can actually love more than one person in
this world. People of all ages are recommended to see this, and not
only girls, but also some of the guys who are into these kinds of
movies. Trust me guys, this little adventure will surely pleased the
money you spend to watch this movie and at the end of the day, you will
not be disappointed. This is my first time reviewing and I hope it helps people out. Thanks
for reading the review and Peace !
