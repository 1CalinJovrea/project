The Oscars ,What a joke

Just watched this unknown film and have to say, if this would have been
nominated and won over LaLa Land,or The winner Moonlight, I would have
danced for joy. What a well written, conceived, complicated thriller.
The surprise at the end is so unexpected but not in a ridiculous
Hollywood way.It can be at times confusing but that is what makes a
good film a good film. Wanting to see a film a second time to fully
understand the motivations of the story telling and the actors.
