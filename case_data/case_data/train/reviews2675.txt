5
It should have been a TV Series

An unfortunate missed opportunity. I didn't give this movie a 5 because it was different from the
original, i thought it wasn't different enough. I have read the Death
Note manga several times and i think that, for a Shonen Jump Manga, it
is a Masterpiece.Still, being a Manga made for a very specific demographic it is tied to
several silly Japanese teen archetypes. For example: Light Yagami being
a High School Student and Misa Amane being a Teen idol, both of them
being Japanese, that kind of thing. The Story of a NoteBook of Death that is used to "create a better
world" however, has a potential that far exceeds the original manga. I believe that, had this been done correctly, it could have been on par
with Breaking Bad. It could have been a master piece. They didn't even
have to use the names of the original characters, they could have
forgotten about the silly high school plot line and the Japanese
clich√©s.It should have been a TV Series and the characters should have been
Detectives. Its sad to see such missed potential. I honestly believe that, had this been done by good writers and on the
right format, it could have far surpassed the original.
