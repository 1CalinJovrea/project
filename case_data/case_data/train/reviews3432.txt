Hollywood loves pointless remakes AND sequels

I hated this movie almost as soon as it started. Everything was just
off. It tried way too hard to be funny forcing Rebel Wilson to have to
act extra weird and quirky as opposed to just naturally weird and
quirky. Becca's working at a lame recording studio while trying to tell
the Bellas she's going to quit. There's like two or three new girls
that I can't remember because they're not memorable.Then they go on this lame camping expedition where Audrey now works
having graduated. The group of German singers they're going up against
really suck and wouldn't even be hard to beat except that the Bellas
suck too. Their end performance was crap especially compared to the
first movie. Pitch Perfect was hilarious, charming, original, and had
great performances. Pitch Perfect 2 was strained and pointless.
