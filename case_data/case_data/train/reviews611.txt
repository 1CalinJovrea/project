Eater of children.....

Ethan Hawke and his family and cardigan, move into a new house, where
he can settle down and write his new book.The trouble is, the family who lived there before are the subject of
his new book, and they were all hanged in the back garden. But alls not lost, Hawke goes to the attic and finds that someone has
left some home movies, with the added bonus of seeing the families get
killed.Soon strange things start to happen, and someone dressing up as 'the
crow' starts to haunt Hawkes mind, and cardigan.........I remember when I first saw the trailer, and though this could be
something special. The reviews for this are pretty solid too from the
public, so my expectations were high.If you've seen the trailer, you have seen all the best bits from the
film, apart from the lawn owner scene.What I must say is that the soundtrack is excellent, and I've never
heard 'boards of Canada' used to such effect.But that's all the positive remarks I have about this drivel. Hawke is
okay, but the rest of his family are so mundane and unimportant, you
really couldn't care less about them.Trevor has night terrors, and nothing ever becomes of this (apart from
the fact that it explains why he has to keep his door shut) and his
wife just moans throughout the whole movie.Jump scares are the order of the day here, rather than creating an
atmosphere, we are treated to screeching violins and snakes under
boxes. Baghoul, or however you spell his name is a mixture, of the
crow, gene Simmons and Heath ledger in the dark night.Even the scene where Hawke realise that Baghoul is in every home movie
is ruined, thanks to the trailer. Deputy so and so pops up every now
and again to provide some sort of comic relief, but it feels like the
,Akers were trying to inject humour ala Insidious, and it just doesn't
work.Just when it gets too confusing for Hawke. Vincent D'onofrio skypes him
and tells him the secrets of the symbols and Baghoul.But hey, it's too late, his daughter double crosses him, in one of the
most boring plot twists I have ever seen.It's a huge disappointment, even usurping Taken 2 in disappointments of
the year.Many will disagree, but really, film makers must make sure, they leave
something out of the trailer, because it ruined the film.That and glow in the dark poison, and cardigans and the fact that when
Baghoul popped up at the end, I thought of Mortal Kombat 2 on the super
Nintendo and remembered how to activate reptile...
