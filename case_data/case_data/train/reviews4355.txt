Beyond dire

I came to this film on the back of the reviews which in retrospect must
surely have been written by people associated with it. It is that bad.
The basic premise is okay; hardly original and inspired but with the
right screen writer and an alternate leading lady (one with some
credibility and appeal) it might have been moderately entertaining. But
sadly it has neither. The storyline is way beyond predictable - I defy
anyone not to work out the ending by half way through. Keira Knightley
is hideously miscast and the others just limp along with a limp script.
The music is also incredibly lame. If you are looking for a film with
music as its backbone head for the wonderful Rudderless and give this
sorry mess a wide berth. One star is generous.
