A five minute sex tape would have been more enjoyable!

Why did we bother? I'm married with two rug rats and thought this movie
would be enjoyable, something we could identify with. This was not the
case at all! Within 10 minutes my better half had already worked out
what was going to happen and whispered that if you were married to
Annie(Diaz) then you'd make more of an effort, kids or no kids! We
spent most of the movie spotting flaws in Annie and Jays marriage, when
it dawned on us that this movie was purposely so bad it made you want
to leave the movies and get an early night if you know what I'm saying! By the end of the movie it was decided that Jay(Segel) had been
castrated secretly after the birth of their last child which explains
why he is a complete pussy.Avoid if you can, if you cant suggest having sex instead.
