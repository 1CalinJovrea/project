Cellouid Suicide. No value to life perspective.

As credits were running and Lobster viewers were exiting the theater,
an attendant was standing by the door. He asked the exiting audience
how the movie was. This proved to be the most beneficial moment in the
last 2 hours; as a collective we were able to vent our disgust.
Indeed,the film served to bind us as an audience with the common
denominator being our shared theatrical abuse.This is more than a poor movie, it is an in-your-face, full frontal
assault to any sense of moral and intellectual value. No compass
whatever. In a poor movie I can find redeeming value --- a comfortable
seat, some popcorn and maybe a little sleep. This was too terrible to
nap although I've never wanted to close my eyes so hard.Gratuitous violence with un-deeming value includes (CAUTION HERE):
Donkey getting shot. Dog kicked to death with image of dog's intestines
on floor. Person bound and dropped into open grave with dogs to devour
face (dogs have collars on?). Hand forced into toaster. Lips getting
sliced with razor blade. Forced (and optional?) blindness.A unique movie but only by way of its horrorableness.In the imagined words of Nurse Ratched this is "The perfect movie for
the cinemaly insane."
