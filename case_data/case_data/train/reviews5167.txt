A Different Education

What happens in a large manor & school for girls, of a range of ages,
that are isolated by war (American Civil War) when a wounded enemy
(Union) soldier is brought into the household to have his injuries
cared for? As he heals and becomes accepted into the daily routine a
discord begins to develop because of his presence. What this film
version does is present one likely scenario involving, of course, sex,
but from the pov of the females. A view not historically presented
either in film or in the telling of history itself. Yes, at times slow
which is expected given the entire movie takes place in a house, but
the story, acting, sets, props, costuming make it worth viewing.
