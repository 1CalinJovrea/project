Such a load of total clich√© BS

I do not know what a lot of you others are drinking before you watched
this attempt at a film but I will not be imbibing, that's for sure.
There are comments in some of the reviews here that this will be a new
cult film, that it is the best action film of the year etc etc etc.
Sorry but 'fail' is the only word that comes to mind. The gratuitous
and total violence is just pathetic and I might say a serious low point
in American culture. Keanu has returned! From what? He looks like a
very sad has been actor forced to not act so that the film maker can
get his rocks off on this masturbation or a movie. I hope that the
directors and producers of this garbage are duly banned from ever
making another attempt. Seriously people, if you liked this film then
you need to seriously look in the mirror. I mean really! If the mirror
don't crack then just be thankful. If I had to find just one redeeming
factor I would be very hard pressed. OK - I liked the little dog. YUK!
