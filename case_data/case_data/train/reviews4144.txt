I wanted to love this movie really I did!

I saw the trailer and immediately thought chick flick something good to
see with the girls or drag my boyfriend too. And sitting in the theater
as the credits are rolling the only thing going through my mind was
that I felt jipped. It's nothing like how it seems in the trailer. The
trailer makes it out that she's working with Leo to regain her memory
and eventually fall back in love with him. And it is like the last 20
minutes! The rest of the time you just want to punch her because she's
acting like a little brat unwilling to even consider the reasons or
facts about her being with Leo. She basically blows him off and acts
like he doesn't even matter. Redbox it is my suggestion.
