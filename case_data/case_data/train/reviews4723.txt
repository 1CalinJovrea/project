The Trailer is Better Than the Whole Film!

When they were just dating, Jay and Annie had the best sex anywhere and
anytime. Since they got married and had kids though, their sexual
activity dipped to below zero. One frustrating night when their
attempts for sex were going nowhere, Annie hits on the idea to take a
video of themselves having sex to make things more exciting. Aroused by
the camera, they had a three-hour sex marathon following all the
positions prescribed in the book "The Joy of Sex".In the morning, Annie reminds Jay to delete the video. However, Jay
inadvertently uploads the video onto the cloud and an app automatically
shared it with people to whom they had given their old iPads to,
including their kids, parents, friends, and even the mailman. Jay and
Annie scramble to get all of these iPads back and off the internet.All of that I had written in the synopsis you can also get from
watching the trailer. All the funny parts are already there in that
short clip. When you watch the whole film, there was nothing else worth
watching anymore. In fact, the trailer was even edited better than the
film itself, making it more hilarious than the film itself. After the initial funny premise had already been laid down, the rest of
the film was nothing more than prolonging the agony and beating an
already dead horse. That whole sequence in the house of Rob Lowe's
character (as the CEO of the company interested in buying Annie's mommy
blog) was unbearably unfunny.Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz are funny actors, but these are already
very familiar roles for them and they seem to just be sleepwalking
through them. Segel, in particular seems to be stereotyped already in
this type of role of a lovelorn loser. Diaz is a favorite actress of
mine, and I am able to find something positive in even her reviled
films, like "Bad Teacher" (which also starred Segel). There is still
her great-looking body to like here, but unfortunately, not much else.
