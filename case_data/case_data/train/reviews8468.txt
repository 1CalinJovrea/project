Disappointment for Cars' fan children

My son was born in 2006, we watched first movie maybe a hundred times,
and second one several times. Cars was like Star Wars for us. And 3rd
movie? At the end of the movie my 11 years old son was so upset to see
Mc Queen as a retiring loser car, he only said: "I'll never talk about
Mc Queen, this is the end". Bugs Bunny does not get old, why did you
have to retire Mc Queen so early? And we hate that yellow car, Cruz, it
can never replace Mc Queen. Mc Queen is red, how could you turn it to
blue?! This movie is a big disappointment, we'll try to forget it
