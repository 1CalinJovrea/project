At last a good sequel

Once again our favorite MIB agents Jay & Kay are battling it out for
earth. Quick action, colorful villains, beautifully designed settings
and CGI, comic relief in the face of imminent destruction, all those
made the first two movies great as well as successful in the box
office. Could they better the formula in the face of all the other bad
sequels we have been seeing for years? This is one of the reasons I had stepped into the cinema with
trepidation. (Good grief, was it 1997 when I saw the first and ten
years ago the second? How time flies). The other reason was the pitfall
of time travel.Time travel is one of the favorite themes in sci fi movies but it needs
to be handled carefully. My humble word of advice to the script
writers: Keep-It-Simple. Avoid overtly complicated jumps back and forth
and paradoxes that confuse the audience. Remember the eventual mess in
the Back To The Future trilogy? I was then so pleased to see that they
kept the time travel relatively simple and easy to follow. There was a
small part when they crossed the line juuust a tiny bit when young
agent Kay meets a certain father and son (don't want to spoil it). Even
if traveling back in time was possible, you wouldn't necessarily bump
into everyone you know in the present.Will Smith is in his usual good form in his character Jay which however
needs Kay to balance him. It is then fortunate that Brolin gives a
great performance as the young agent.Was it better than the 1997original? It was as good, without the
novelty value obviously. Was it as good as the MIB2? I would say that
it surpassed the second.
