Brilliant horror that never cheats

The biggest problem modern horror films seem to have is making the
audience care about their characters. Generally, they are so clich√©,
bland, dumb and unrealistic that within the first 10 minutes of the
film no one cares any longer about their fate. So when I saw early on
in 'The Devil's Candy' that the main characters were a family of hippy
bogans, I'll admit I was worried for the sake of the film. I make no
mistake about the fact that these are not people I can relate to in any
way, and have had almost universally negative experiences with them in
my life. On the contrary though, that turned out to be the strongest
element to the film. I loved this family. They were charming, caring,
relatable and down to Earth. I genuinely cared about their fate, and
that is a large part of what made 'The Devil's Candy' a very fine
horror film.The second thing I loved about this film is that is never cheats. No
scare is a false one. Nothing is suddenly revealed to be a dream
sequence. No super-natural elements were required simply to make the
story work. That is incredibly rare in the history of horror movies,
let alone modern ones. Writer/director Sean Byrne needs to be
absolutely commended on this. It is a brilliant effort on his part.There really isn't a lot of negatives I can come up with for this film.
The only thing holding it back from being a '10' was an unforgettable
ending. Other than that it is basically flawless. Fantastic acting, a
simple yet brilliant and effective story, genuine scares that never
cheat and characters that are both likable and relatable. In an
industry that is seemingly completely lost as to how to make a good
horror film, 'The Devil's Candy' needs to be studied by everyone in
Hollywood. It is a very good film.
