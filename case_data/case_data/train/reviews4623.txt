If you fall asleep you will have missed nothing.

At the end of this film someone shouted out "What a load of old pony"
and a cheer went up from a fair proportion of the audience - that part
that either hadn't left before the end or hadn't fallen asleep. To
continue the metaphor then this film is up there with the old nag that
Steptoe and Son keep in their back yard.The opening minutes are pretty indicative of what's to come. A
nonsensical light show that signifies what precisely? Throw in eerie
soundtrack music. And then extend it way beyond the powers of
concentration of the most devoted of viewers.Motor-bike man runs into a dark ditch and picks up a woman who looks
dead. Next, another woman strips the dead woman. Next, she is driving
around Glasgow in a white van. The combination of darkness/semi-light
and Glaswegian accents which are more or less indecipherable only
serves to make whatever's going on on-screen even more confusing.
Somewhere along the line the Elephant Man has escaped from another film
and gets picked up by Johanssen. He doesn't drown like the previous two
men that she seduces but runs off naked across the moors. Motor-bike
man catches him and puts into the boot of a car. He drives off. Don't
know what happens to the car or Elephant Man. By this time people were
leaving, my neighbour was sound asleep and I had two red-hot pins ready
to stick into my eyes.I can't even be bothered to run over the rest of this abysmal, tedious
story. Shots were held for ever in the mistaken belief, I presume, that
we gave a damn about we were seeing. Nothing happened.It's now the next morning and I'm still angry at forking out Â£10 and
wasting 2 hours of life to see this pile of dreck. Beany-hatted,
sandal-wearing academics will just love this film and will witter on
endlessly to their poor students about the "significance" of it all.
Believe me, there is none.
