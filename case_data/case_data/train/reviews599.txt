It's not that bad

Wow, the critics went to town on this film didn't they.Although this film wasn't close to perfect, it doesn't deserve such a
low score.My main negative critique was that the writing/screenplay was a little
sloppy, although still very entertaining. But either than that, the performances were decent, the
cinematography/sfx well done and the directing was good.An enjoyable film that I would see again maybe one more time, but
certainly not deserving of such a low score.
