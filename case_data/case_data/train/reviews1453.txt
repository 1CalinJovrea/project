I really wanted to like it

I wanted to like this movie so much, because I really think Jason
Statham has some serious acting skills and he deserves some good
scripts. Also the story is based on a book, so it should have been
good.Alas, it was not to be. And it has almost nothing to do with J-Lo being
in the movie. The characters are bland, illogical in almost everything
they do, even Parker, the Statham's character. Worst than that: they
are unsympathetic. You have a lot of greedy people, some of them evil,
some of them stupid, and apart from them is Parker, who is not greedy,
just stupid. He puts everybody at risk for his own principles, he gets
beat up and shot a few times and somehow he still walks. It's like
Crank, but without anything fun in it.I have to say I am a fan of Michael Chiklis, from Vegas, but his role
was small and two dimensional. One dimensional, really, but I was going
with the cardboard metaphor. You wanna know who was the most clear cut
character, the one that did the job and was consistent? Daniel
Bernhardt in the role of the Mafia killing machine.So, bottom line: a waste of time and of good actors.
