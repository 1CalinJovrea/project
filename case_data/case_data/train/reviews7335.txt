The actors don't care, the writers don't care, I certainly don't care.

I was absolutely disgusted with this film. It wasn't particularly
offensive to any particular group (although the film's depiction of
Muslims in one scene and the fact that every Asian character in the
movie is a Ninja will likely raise a few eyebrows) so much as it was to
its audience. The film expects the audience to believe outlandish
scenes so long as there are explosions. The film is "short"(although it
feels long) but even with the film's length about 1/2 of the scenes are
utterly pointless. The opening scene involves some event in a North
Korean factory...that event is never mentioned again.The acting in this film was dreadful. Every actor appears to be
sleeping their way through the film waiting for their next paycheck.
I've seen better acting in Super Bowl advertisements than I have in
this film. Granted, none of these actors are particularly talented in
the first place, but this movie makes them look even worse than before.
It is also painful to watch Bruce Willis lose another shred of his
dignity, which is now lesser than his hair.Even the special effects were sub-par. There are a few decent
explosions, but one scene in particular involving ninjas on a mountain
top looks more like a video game than a feature film. The problem with
the action scenes in this movie is that we don't care about the
characters; they're all identical in terms of personality. If I don't
care about your character, I don't care if your character lives or dies
or how your character lives or dies. And if the actors don't even care,
I certainly don't care.Overall, if you want a "popcorn flick," you can find something far
better than this.
