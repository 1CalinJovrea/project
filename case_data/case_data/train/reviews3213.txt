People started walking out after 30 minutes

I lasted 45............This was the Screen Unseen at the Odeon in the UK tonight. Sometimes
you get great stuff like Hidden Figures and Baby Driver........
Sometimes you get some real boring stuff like Manchester By The Sea,
Moonlight or this film.Now, I'm not saying this film is as bad as Moonlight, but it's not far
off.This may do well in the USA but does not engage a UK audience.The cast seemed very genuine but that was not enough to keep people
from leaving.
