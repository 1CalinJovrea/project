Can you make the 80s boring??? The answer is yes. WARNING SPOILERS

In 1987 I was 22. So I actually lived through this musical era. And it
was a lot more fun being there in person in the 80s than sitting
through this movie. First of all, there were filming glitches. In a
couple of places including the bus station early in the movie there
were things on screen that would not have existed in the 80s. That
threw me off right away because the attention to detail of the era was
lacking. But on to the acting and the music. The only real shining star
of the movie was Tom Cruise. And I don't even like him. But he was fun
to watch. Everyone else seemed air brushed and auto tuned. Russell
Brand and Alec Baldwin were also decent. But the entire movie just
didn't seem 80s enough to me. I'll put it this way. During the first
hour I was debating walking out. The second hour I was checking my
watch. I made it through but wish I had been more into it. On another note, what was 80s about the strip club? The outfits, the
interior....nothing said 80s to me. I feel like whoever was styling
this movie either wasn't alive during the 80s or doesn't remember how
everything, including outfits, looked. Anyway, I give it a 4 for Tom Cruise. Other than that, it's 2 hours of
my life gone forever.
