Pretty good but selective memory takes over

Yes, the film is overlong but generally entertaining. Would have given
it 7* but knocked off a star for the flagrant rewriting of history to
favour the producers (Dr.Dre, Ice Cube and Tomica) Performances are
generally good (esp. Ice Cube's son) Better editing and more honest
portrayal of facts would have improved the film. Btw ignore the 1*
reviews - don't watch a film about gangsta rap if it offends you so
much!!
