Was This Supposed to Be a Comedy

I honestly don't know what to say about this horrendous, terribly
unfunny movie except I wish I could get my money and time back for the
waste that was this movie. Here is a suggestion - watch the movie
before you release it. And, if it is supposed to be a comedy, make sure
the movie makes you laugh. I know for a fact that none of you rich
movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and
told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for
lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them
release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a
funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing. I
guess the other two people in the room didn't think it was very funny
either because I never heard one person laugh for more than a moment. I
think I laughed more while watching "Hannibal." Do not go to see this
pile of crap. It was awful.
