Let's make a new tagline for this movie

I'll start:1. 12 years of wasted time; 2. Literally nothing happens for 3 hours;
3. Scumbag stepfathers everywhere; 4. The transition from cute kid to
an emo kid; 5. I only write this, cuz IMDb requires 10 lines of text;
6. 12 years of indie rock bands; 7. Not sure if gay; 8. Most epic twist
in movie history lol jk; 9. Can't believe it's nominated for an Oscar;
10. Best movie to sleep on; 11. How to throw away $4,000,000; 12. The
boring life of a regular kid; 13. Unfortunately it didn't get more HD
each 20 minutes; 14. Desperate housewife; 15. Much feels wow; 16. This
is why you shouldn't trust IMDb ratings; 17. Shot in 12 years, lasts 12
years also.
