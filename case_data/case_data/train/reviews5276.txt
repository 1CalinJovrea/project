8
Good movie but I expected a greater deal from the ending

I gave it 8 out of 10. The movie had good jump scenes and a good story.
I liked the fact that it made references to the older movies to clarify
the plot. I expected more from the ending, I think I expected a twist
but , all in all, good horror movie to watch! The actor had a good
performance I recommend!
