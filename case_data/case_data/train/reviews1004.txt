A review on a decent movie.

Yes, there were really bad parts. But, the movie was amazing. The
opinions that include "Cringe" or "Cancer" make the review bad. The
only bad part I can think of was that stupid Just Dance scene. Also,
you have to watch the movie in order for your review to be good. So, if
you think that saying its Cringe or cancer, your review is bad,
however, not watching the movie just makes matters worse.
