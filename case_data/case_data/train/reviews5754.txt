So Disappointing

Let me start by saying that I love most of the cast of this movie,
but...I don't love them in this movie.The acting was terrible, the jokes were for simpletons. I found this to
be an excruciating movie to watch, and wish I could have that time
back.I couldn't find one redeeming quality (or even good joke) in the entire
movie.
