Not that good

Some performances were better than others, the ultimate goal of the
movie took forever to get off the ground (like the first half)... I
miss the old Sean Penn who took roles displaying his raw talent over
these emotionally enriched character development stories which quite
frankly come off as emotionally supercharged in my book.The film has some good shootout sequences and Javier Bardem is a joy to
watch but the story just isn't there for any kind of connection to the
rest of the characters, I'm kind of surprised this emo-fest wasn't the
brainchild of Clint Eastwood to begin with.What action sequences there are well done but there are far too few for
a movie called "The Gunman".
