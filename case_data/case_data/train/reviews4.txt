Cool little sci-fi flick, that gives you a little entertaining kick

When I saw the trailer, I was expecting a quiet little sci-fi drama
about an old billionaire played by Ben Kingsley who gets the
opportunity to live longer with the purchasing of a new body, played by
Ryan Reynolds, and discovers his new body had a prior soul in it.The movie gave me a little more than that thanks to who the prior soul
belong too and the large amount of trouble the creator of this body
switching technique called shredding goes through to keep his project
low key, when the billionaire freaks out about steeling another man's
life. It was an action packed drama helped out with an incredible musical
score. It kinda has the same vibe as a movie called Limitless starring
Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro. The Sci-Fi concept is different but
it's the same tone of coolness. Nothing in the movie is mind blowing, but it's very cool to watch and
very entertaining, so I'll recommend.
