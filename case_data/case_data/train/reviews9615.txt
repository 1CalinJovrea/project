NOT FUNNY at all, its a waste of time!

This movie was not funny at all, I guess it is the second movie i
couldn't finish watching in my entire life. The lines are so cheesy,
the story is so childish and it seems they wrote the scenario in a
week. If you are looking for some real comedy then you are in a wrong
place. You will never get back this 120 minutes of your life back. Such
a shame for Morgan Freeman's name to put on this film. The jokes are so
not funny and they wanna make fun out of F words all the time. You
might think the whole idea of the movie is unrealistic, that's right,
but you can use some real humor in the most unrealistic situations.
Conclusion, I WONT RECOMMEND THIS NOT-A-COMEDY-MOVIE, even for watching
once!!
