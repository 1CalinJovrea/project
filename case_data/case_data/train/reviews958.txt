One of the most pointless cash-in franchise movies ever

Firstly a few points1. A masterclass in how NOT to edit an action movie together, shaky cam
mixed with overly fast sequencing is enough to give you a headache or
at the very least go "wait whats happening right now?" it was just so
unnecessary and only went to further show the lack of directing ability
when it comes to actions scenes, if you cannot get a few second shot
during a fight and instead have to splice 100 half second shots
together just to get 50 seconds worth of a fight scene, then why even
bother?2. The whole plot with wesker "wesker you are fired" so now the red
queen can take you out.... is so ripped off from robocop and has been
done to death, lazy writing.3. And at the end... alice is told that they had to know she was
willing to give up her life for others, but honestly what a load of
nonsense, alice still could have released the antivirus to save others
whether she thought she would die or not, pointless plothole for the
sake of adding extra tension with the "oh but if alice does it, she
will die" then at the end "nope, you wont" its like the old "and they
woke up and lived happily ever after" ending so trivial.Honestly, I didn't mind the first movie, but since then it has just
dragged on and on limping along with more wounds with each new movie,
this new one was purely to make a bit of cash off of those die hard
fans that love trash movie franchises, those that don't care about 1000
plot holes and just want to see something explode unrealistically and
see the same actress do all the same stuff over and over again that has
already been seen and done in the previous films, I would put this
franchise now on par with Underworld, just pointless drivel scripted
out in about an hour without any care whatsoever, childlike almost,
what is worse is that this film adds nothing to the overall series, its
just there for the sake of dragging it out further, would love for it
to finally just die off and maybe reboot it, different, with better
writers and directors but most of all acting, the lead actress almost
acts now like she couldn't care less about being there despite it being
the only real franchise that keeps her in work. I can enjoy bad films,
good films, great films, but I just cannot enjoy movies that feel like
they where slapped together in a made for TV movie style for the sake
of making some cash.
