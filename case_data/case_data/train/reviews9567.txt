Seriously Dark

Just got back from seeing this film & have to say it's just epic!The film is about the death of Laura barns who committed suicide by
shooting herself in the park on the 12th of April 2013. A year later,
on the night of the anniversary of her death, a sinister force starts
hunting down those responsible: Blair & her friends via Video Chat
Network & picking them off 1 by 1 in vicious gruesome ways! The film's premise is pretty simple, but epic! I've seen a couple of
cyber-bullying films but are nothing in comparison to this! This was a
different cyber bullying themed film laced with a strong dose of
horror!The deaths in this film were dark & gruesome, like the blender death
scene which was vicious! Basically the 5 friends encounter an unknown
user under the name Billie227, the user which they think is a hacker,
but things rapidly spiral out of control & the spirit begins to start
turning the friends against themselves with dark games & revealing how
they were involved in her suicide!I also liked how the film was so close to home with the internet, like
me right now typing feels like how it was in the film! Despite the
annoying arguments in the film which dragged on a tad bit too much the
film was dark intense & very well executed! I dare you to watch it!The dark humour in the film also added to the atmosphere! It really
does scare the living hell out of you as this has actually happened to
people in real life & those who plan on cyber bullying better think
twice, especially if they watch this film! You never know, your deepest
darkest secrets could be used against you if you choose to cyber bully
& you'll pay with your lives!But overall, this film was dark & creepy in so many levels! And kicked
so much arse! You'll love it! I can't wait for the sequels!9/10
