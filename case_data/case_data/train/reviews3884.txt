McDonald's version of Sushi

If I had to do an analogy, I'd say this movie is to the original
whatwould happen if Mc Donalds tried to make sushi.Story wise, the movie is both a dumbed down version and has major plot
changes (it's about the same magnitude of difference as between the
book "I am legend" and the ending of the movie that shares the same
name. If you know what I mean, and are a fan of GITS, I just crushed
your hopes hard). Also visually, when I thought about GITS (1995 version, which I loved),
I picture something aesthetically pleasing and beautiful. For the live
action movie, aside from the restaurant scene, which looked great, I
didn't like the visuals much, felt kinda cheap (esp. the city). You can
tell the director tried a bit, but all in all, it's lacking a soul. On
a side note : The guy playing Batou was a good cast for the role , he
got the job done.PS : And what was this BS with Kitano's dialogues ?!? Either have his
dialogues in full Japanese, or in full English, but what they did here
screams "Takeshi did not want to speak English, and the cast didn't
want to learn 3 words of Japanese", it just felt plain awkward.
