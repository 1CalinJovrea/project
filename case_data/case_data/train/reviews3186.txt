Best Spider Man movie since Spider Man 2

I saw Spider-Man Homecoming on the opening night of the movie,and its
my favorite Spider Man movie since the 2nd Spider Man movie from the
original series.Tom Holland who plays as Spider Man in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe does a terrific job on being passed the mantle of
playing Spider Man.Michael Keaton also does a great job as playing as
the main bad guy of the movie Vulture.The new take on Spider Man of not
being dark and gritty its nice to see for a change.And I have a feeling
that Tom Holland will keep impressing me on his performance as Spider
Man in future Marvel movies.
