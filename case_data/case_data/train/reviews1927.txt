A grubby little movie with very little dancing

I love Channing Tatum and I'd go and watch anything with him in it. I
also liked the first Magic Mike movie for what it was - very
lightweight entertainment, some hot male bodies, a bit of humour, a bit
of a plot line and some great dancing.This sequel is just grubby, and, well boring. The dancing is minimal.
Most of the 'performances' at the end aren't dancing at all. The Andy
McDowell house scenes went on and on ... and on, with absolutely no
plot purpose and no dancing, so what was the point? And the scenes with
the women 'clients' at the Jade Pickett Smith establishment are pretty
demeaning to the women. The bumping and grinding on fat women in the
movie is clearly meant to show what great 'performers' these strippers
are, able to fake it with any desperate female. I'm absolutely no
prude, but it all became pretty sickening in the end, and I was just
BORED with the whole thing really. Channing, it's time to move on,
mate.
