A pretty good idea

This movie's story isn't actually a bad idea! I love the fact that it's
about a topic that isn't too clich√©, however, the small predictable
scenes kind of ruined the fun. Things that didn't need to happen that did: - Girlfriend didn't really
need to be accidentally axed to death, there was minimal reaction to
this and it was so unrealistic - Cat didn't need to be found mangled,
then within 2 seconds, receive a neck snap, no questions asked, again
with no realistic reaction from characters - Morgue bodies didn't
really need to start walking about again like zombies - Being trapped
in a storm without electricity or signal on the phone (obviously)Things that needed to happen that didn't: - More history on the witch -
More cool facts about the dates and possibilities of what happened to
the witch - Tie the loose ends about her links with the characters she
was involved withI loved the music, the unusual scenes, the CSI style findings and
whatnot, I wish there had been more story and less jump scares.
