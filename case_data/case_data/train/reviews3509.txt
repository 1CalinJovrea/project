Truly Excellent.

This was a magnificent film, with stunning performances by the star
cast and the supporting roles. I am not an unconditional fan of Mads Mikkelsen, but he really was
strong and convincing in this role.And one could easily forgive the good doctor for falling in love with
Queen Caroline, as portrayed by the lovely Alicia Vikander.And one even had sympathy for poor old Christian in the end. I was
beginning to wonder whether he was quite as insane as people thought
him to be. There seemed to be a genuine friendship between him and Dr
Struensee also. Had things gone slightly differently, one could have
imagined them forming a happy and successful ménage à trois, and living
happily ever after.And the villains were truly villainous :-)(I spotted a few familiar faces from Forbydelsen I and other places,
including Søren Malling (Jan Mayer ), and Bent Mejding who was the
standing mayor (playing a not dissimilar sort of character)A very interesting and surprising historical lesson as well.Highly recommended.
