Tearjerking; The Impossible

On vacation at an exotic resort in Thailand, a family of 5 are torn
apart by a large tsunami that rips the island apart. The mother, played
by Naomi Watts and oldest of the three sons do their best to survive
while the father, played by Ewan McGregor, juggles between the safety
of his two boys and the search for his wife and missing son.Director Juan Antonio Bayona vividly shares the shocking and yet,
miraculous story of the Alvarez family. The cinematography when the
tsunami sweeps in is nothing short of stunning and captivating. A
glimpse of the sheer force and destruction behind this natural disaster
will undoubtedly leave you breathless. Watts delivers a strong
performance as does McGregor but the stand out here, besides the
cinematography, is the brilliant and mature portrayal of the oldest son
by young, Tom Holland.An emotional tearjerker, The Impossible is a brilliant film, which will
have you glued to the screen as you root against the odds while
simultaneously fearing the worst. The fact that it's based on a true
story is a testament of the human spirit and the bond of a family. The Impossible is definitely one to watch.
