What Could Have Been....

I was pulled into this movie for its all-star cast and its premise.
Absolutely anything could happen. With Simon Pegg, Eddie Izzard, the
final cast role of Robin Williams, the Monty Python crew and Terry
Jones at the helm, what could go wrong? The answer: absolutely
everything. To begin, the casting of male/female actors makes the viewer feel as
though they are living in a world of attractive females and mediocre
looking men. I guess that's fine. It worked for Monty Python. Not to
suggest there is a better way to cast, however, it all felt pretty
glaringly unrealistic to me. About the comedic elements, although there were some unique laughs
brought on by the originality of the screenplay, the whole movie was
hard to watch. The lengths at which the CGI animation and set design
went to accommodate the silliness of the story was entertaining, but it
could hardly satiate the philosophical implications that the narrative
proposes. As a viewer, you feel as though you are watching a writer
getting away with settling on well-polished, sub-par ideas. Arguably,
the bar is set high with a movie featuring a protagonist that can do
anything, but still, blehhhhh..... This film calls to a thinking audience. Yet, any intelligent person
will soon find themselves bored with this movie for one reason or
another. Although it is very unique, like any over-budgeted action
movie, I was left wondering who gave them the money to make this crap
happen?The movie does brush on ethics, morality, the limitations of the human
condition and the ramifications of having power over others, but so
does Spiderman.... so watch that instead.
