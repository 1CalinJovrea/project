Too bad to even be funny.

Life is the kind of horror that relies on the viewer buying into the
idea that supposedly brilliant people will all suddenly choose to to
incredibly stupid things.The movie fails so spectacularly after trying so hard to be realistic
in it's portrayal of space travel that it fails to be anything more
than a comedy with a few gratuitous jump scares.At the core of this movie's failings is it's constant need to get it's
alien antagonist to places it shouldn't be.To make the point about brilliant people doing stupid things, barely
half an hour in, a supposedly highly trained astronaut decides it would
be a great idea to enter the lab containing an escaped and clearly
dangerous alien to try and rescue a trapped colleague. This, of course,
required opening the single door separating the dangerous alien which
just severely injured on crew member from the other 5 crew members. Really? I'm supposed to accept this as a reasonable decision?Worse, this isn't even how the alien escapes. This mind numbing
stupidity from a supposedly reasonable character is just the setup for
even more ridiculous antics. The decision to enter the room with a dangerous alien was merely the
excuse to get the station's engineer into the lab, where he would
proceed to use a flamethrower (really?) in a failed attempt to kill the
alien. The flamethrower then sets off some space sprinklers (which
wouldn't work due to the lack of gravity), allowing the alien to escape
into the space station's fire suppression plumbing (which the actual
ISS does not have, since, you know, it would't work).In scene after scene, the movie continues to obliterate any remnants of
it's plausibility, from the ISS's fuel being expended in 3 short burns
(The Zarya and Zvezda modules carry over 6000kg of fuel combined, which
the movie expends in about 30s), or the stations thrusters being
inexplicably connected to the station interior to allow the alien
inside (despite the fuel for the thrusters being extremely toxic to
humans on top of being explosively reactive - i.e., why it's used as
rocket fuel), to the crew not being informed of a final fail-safe
measure, resulting in a crew member accidentally interrupting it (We're
going to push you into deep space if containment fails is hardly some
kind of shocking revelation when just getting to the ISS risks fiery
death).The constant and brazen violations of realism (which, let's be honest,
could have been caught with 5 minutes on Google, or about 10 seconds of
applying some common sense), in a movie that tries so hard to be
serious in it's tone and presentation completely destroys any semblance
of being either horror or science fiction.I can not, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone who is
not inebriated to the point of passing out.
