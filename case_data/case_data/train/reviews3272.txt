Just About The Least Funny Comedy Of All Time

The Griswald's go on a road trip across America to Wally World in
California.OMG - How awful was this, a painfully dumb grind from start
to finish of one appalling mistimed gag followed by yet another, the
humour (Question Mark) is gross out or just vulgar and nasty or fudged
bad taste, this film is not even competent enough to pull off the
lowest of comedy. The opening credits were the best of this film after
that it was all, way down hill. I remember with some affection the
original but this remake is a travesty. The lead cast at least the
adults are hopeless comics and get the tone all wrong both are miscast,
the kids i'll be more generous given the material both provide the
movies highlights on the road trip especially Skyler Gisondo as the
older boy who manages to achieve some amazing depth in his nerdy
character.The movie has one high spot (pun) that of a well hung weather
man played by Chris Hemsworth, now this sketch was at least amusing, as
for the rest, save your cash for a better film, or stick to the far
superior original on DVD.
