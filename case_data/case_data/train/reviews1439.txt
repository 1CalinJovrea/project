Lot's of skills, but not much of a story

Of course Pirates is a great concept, with exact the right music. But
in this version 'Salazar's revenge' there is a lack of content, despite
a lot of very nice special effects. (I liked the safe-deposit-part very
much!) It is a pity, because there are such a great stories in
Caribbean history. The Amsterdam archives have enough to discover and
uncover. Of course, the makers have their own excuse 'dead men tell no
tales'. So how could we blame them?
