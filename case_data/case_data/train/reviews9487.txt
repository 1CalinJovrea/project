A stunningly shot and classically told story

This is a wonderful film that restores faith in the traditional art of
movie making. Richly shot on 35mm by DoP Darius Khondji, every frame
feels like an exquisite painting, carefully constructed by a filmmaker
at the top of his game in James Gray. The backdrops of England, the
Western Front and Amazonia all have interest on every inch of the
screen and yet for all this color and texture, it is the characters
that leave you thinking long after exiting the theater.Charlie Hunnam, as Col. Percy Fawcett, is adequate and measured, but it
is star turns from Sienna Miller (Percy's wife), Robert Pattinson
(companion Henry Costin), and a ruddy cheeked and opulent Angus
MacFadyen (wealthy explorer James Murray) that make the film. The
haunting struggle and draw of the jungle and the world Percy leaves
behind is revealed through committed portrayals of three dimensional
characters who are both authentic to their era and yet still relevant
in 2017. And that is the theme that is so skillfully woven throughout
the film by Gray, the conflict of portraying the "other" as whole and
independent in a world that simplifies and condescends. That Gray could
make a story about an early 20th Century British explorer resonate so
profoundly with the world we live in today, shows that this is his
finest work to date. All lovers of cinema should see it, but anyone able see it from a
beautiful 35mm print should definitely not miss the opportunity. This
is filmmaking as it is supposed to be.
