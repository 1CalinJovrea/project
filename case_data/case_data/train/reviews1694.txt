Boring and uncomfortable

The movie starts out with a semi-omniscient character, who really
fulfills no role other than to mark off the beginning and end of the
film. He sets the mood--a fictional New Englandish island camp where a
group of boys wearing Boy Scout-like uniforms cavort with their
buffoonish adult leader. Everything here is overacted, farcical,
and--if you ask me--pointless. We don't care a whit about the
characters. It's a series of diorama shots to pose characters in
implausible situations, with the coup de grace consisting of the boy
and girl, who for obscure reasons abscond into a the wilderness of this
island, to wander pointlessly towards a cove with some vaguely
Indian-lore connection, where they then--needlessly in my
opinion--undress to their underwear, despite being barely, if at all,
into puberty, and engage in "French" kissing. The camera lingers more
than a bit too long on the girl here. My date gasped in shock next to
me, and one sensed a squirming throughout the mass of theatergoers.
Don't see this movie. Save your money. Go for a walk to your own
nearest lake, stream, or beach.
