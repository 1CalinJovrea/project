This film is hysterically brilliant!

I laughed from beginning to end during this film! The characters were
consistently interesting and well cast, the plot was fresh and
entertaining, and the writing was just brilliant. I loved the subtle
jokes and the cameos, and Seth MacFarlane was exceptional as the lead.
He plays the leading man without any arrogance or clich√©' swagger;
instead, he comes off as genuine and easy to relate to. I really like
that. There are few films in which I laugh continuously from start to
finish. This is one of those. It never got dull or repetitive, never
felt forced, and was not at all predictable. Many kudos to Seth
MacFarlane and crew for an enjoyable, hilarious, and thoroughly
entertaining film! Hollywood needs more of this and less of the crap
that passes for cinema these days.
