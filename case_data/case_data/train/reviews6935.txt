Sad End to a Trilogy

I really liked the 1st movie and enjoyed the 2nd so figured the 3rd
would be a good ending except they forgot to write a story. This film
is 140 minutes long -- with at least 45 minutes too many of ape
closeups, or should I say CGI closeups. The sad thing is they could
have soared with the 3rd installment but instead made a $150 million
dud. Soldiers with modern lethal weapons against apes with spears -
just crazy. And the moral of the story, well there really wasn't one
except all the human soldiers good and bad got killed while a remnant
of apes survived along with a mysterious young girl who joined the
apes. I think I would have preferred something where the conflict rises
to a crescendo and then ends with a fragile peace with apes and humans
learning to live together, not separate. Alas, the "authors" decided
that apes and humans can't live together. Let's hope there is never
another plant of the apes, ever.
