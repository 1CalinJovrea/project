Not great, but totally fun

A prequel to one of Pixar's most beloved films, Monsters Inc. In all
honesty, I wasn't looking forward to this one too much. A sequel would
have been a better option. Like the Toy Story movies, it should take
place a long while later, and Mike and Sully should meet back up with a
teenage Boo or something. Boo was the soul of that movie, and, of
course, in a prequel, Boo can't exist. Instead, we get the story of how
Mike and Sully met in college. The story is made up of a ton of college
movie clich√©s in the Monsters world. And it's fine. Not great, nothing
really special, but it's very enjoyable and the animation is gorgeous.
The last time I revisited Monsters Inc., the animation seemed a little
primitive, but Pixar has more than perfected it now, and I loved seeing
the wonderful monster designs. Steve Buscemi, the villain from the
first film, is prominent in the cast again. Other famous cast members
include Nathan Fillion, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Aubrey
Plaza and Alfred Molina. The most memorable new character is Dean
Hardscrabble, played by Helen Mirren. The design, kind of a centipede
dragon, is extremely cool and actually pretty creepy.
