Well laid out movie.

It's a great Oliver stone movie, seems right up his alley to do a film
About a conspiracy and about questioning the government.It's weird when people do movies about such recent events but hey
that's how fast the media works these days.It's a great ensemble cast as Stone tells the story of Edward Snowden
who discovered that the government was spying on us weather we did
anything wrong or not and decides to let us all know.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Snowden as a very likable guy, even if he
was a Bush supporter, but most importantly he was a dude who loves his
country and felt what they were doing to its citizens was wrong.As Snowden, Levitt had the biggest chunk of screen time in a film
filled with well know actors taking small, but important roles, like
Zachary Quinto who played the guardian journalist chosen to tell
Snowden's story and Nicolas Cage who's character acted like a mentor
for Snowden's at the CIA.Stone's fairness to the whole situation is painting a lovely portrait
of the whistle blower himself
