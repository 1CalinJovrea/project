Don't compare with the original.

I love Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop from 1987 (which remains iconic) and I
usually don't like reboots. But watching the new one I never got rid of
the feeling, that the remake is worth it. It is a whole new
interpretation, that sets the focus on the topics of our time: robots,
drones, the human aspect behind the technology, media critics, war
propaganda. I felt, the movie has a mission to enlighten people and I
liked that. It became even more obvious how much the RoboCop story
exists within the topos of Frankenstein which is the story about the
human devilment and the lack of respect of life. That's why Padilha
gives Murphy more of a face, a life and feelings.Beside that the pictures, the sound, the music is pretty contemporary.
You probably have to make some compromises today to get the millions to
get the flick done. It won't become iconic, but it's the right time for
the right message in the right movie.
