Continues modern Burton trend

Miss Peregrine's home for Peculiar Children was easily my most
anticipated film of this Fall. I had read the book, and I think Tim
Burton was an excellent person to direct this film. I had no idea what
was in store.The first bit was good, as it was more like the book, except with the
character switching of Claire and Emma, though they actually made that
work. A lot of the photos were edited, which sucked, but we got a
classic Tim Burton stop motion scene. The second half was where it went
haywire. For some reason, they went to a carnival, which was pretty
stupid. Samuel L. Jackson's villain, was stupid, and never did anything
but kidnapping Miss. Peregrine, but mostly cracking jokes. Out of
nowhere there was a forced monkey woman, and other crap that had
nothing to do with anything. But, at least the twins actually did
something instead of just being there. And, for the whole movie, Asa
Butterfield does a terrible performance. He looks bored, as if he
absolutely despised the film. Maybe he read the Ransom Riggs book.
Luckily, he is surrounded by great performances, like Eva Green and
Samuel L. Jackson. This film is enjoyable if all the other theaters are
playing Pete's Dragon, but trust me, you would rather be watching
Suicide Squad.
