Boring beyond imagination.

Wolf is a waste unless you are a 19-year-old boy who thinks Napoleon
Dynamite was funny. Sex without passion. Drugs without end. Scenes
without points. Acting without entertainment. But let's go to the
board.1. Sex.....tons of it. This film is pretty well soft porn. But it is
also about as sexually exciting as watching a Zamboni polish an ice
rink....and about as cold. 2. Drugs.....tons of it. Think of Scarface
levels. Hey, drunks are funny, right? Think Cheech and Chong without
the laughs. 3. Vulgarity.....worse than Bridesmaids and much less
humorous. During WWII, the US 8th Air Force delivered nearly 700 thousand tons of
explosives. If each one of them had had the f-word painted on them, it
still would fall short of the f-bombing in this movie. But even if the pretty naked girls had been arousing, the drug
quantities smaller, and the vulgarity lighter, it still would be a
tremendously boring film.I am sure it will be touted as a great movie....a modern Gatsby tale. I
am sure there will be rewards. I am sure Tarrentino will rip it off and
be declared a genius. But none of that will change the fact that Wolf of Wall Street is a dog
on the screen.
