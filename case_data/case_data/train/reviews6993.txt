Disintegration!

This is a heist movie and smaller in scale than most superhero films,
which is why it works so well. The film is about a convict father who
is unknowing recruited to become the next Ant-man in order to pull off
a robbery and keep Ant-man technology out of the hands of the bad guys.
The film does an excellent job of mixing comedy and action. The gem of
the film is the final battle, it is one of the best fight scenes I have
seen from hero films in a while, excluding the Civil War airport fight.
However the film isn't perfect. The villain is underdeveloped. T.I. is
in this film and his acting drags on you. The lady playing the future
Wasp is a blank slate, nearly robotic. And some of the ant CGI is
outright awful. But now I'm just nitpicking. This is a very rewatchable
and I highly recommend it.
