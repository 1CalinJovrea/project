A pathetic movie

Probably it's because I've seen the Tobey-Man and this is the reason I
give this movie such a low score. I wanted to learn more about Peter's
parents, but did not. "They were scientists." So what? That's not even
5% of what I needed to find out. Tobey-Man was on par with emotions,
stunts and discovering the character. Here your uncle dies and what you
see is 2 mins of drama about him. They really did not expand the
characters and that led to my disappointment. This really isn't the spider-man I wanted to see (full of questioning,
thoughts and hardship). This guy was crying one minute and kissing the
girl in another. Did I even mention that the suit did not fully fit
him? Did I mention that Peter became a super scientists in 5 mins after
he start reading 2 books and a couple of documents that do not make
sense? Since when kids study genetics in school so deeply? Tobey-Man's story deeper and more interesting. You could see the bright
side of having super powers and the dark of constantly having the
responsibility to hide your identity and take care of the closest. The
new Spidey did little effort to hide his id. I could actually say that
he was waving his mask the entire movie...If you were happy with Tobey-man, stick with him!
