This film is a pile of hot garbage.

There was literally nothing to enjoy in this movie. Cheesy, hollow
writing is rarely delivered better by A-List actors. This is the first DARK Universe film, and there's nothing dark about
it. It's hokey without having classic charm.There is this thing about Dr Jekyll that is beyond hilarious, but not
to the film's benefit.The unintentional hilarity of this film is it's greatest aspect. But
will anyone say this was a great movie?? Not if they've ever seen the
Brandon Fraser films. Brandon was funny, even with bad lines. Tom can't
pull it off, it's just too bad and he's too.. A-list for it.Gonna have to re-watch the 2001 Mummy to push back the memories of Dark
Universe's The Mummy.If you're gonna brand yourselves as dark, make something EVIL. Jeez.
