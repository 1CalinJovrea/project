Easy to criticize, but done with great compassion

To bash this movie as a "Before Sunrise" knockoff is easy, and maybe
even somewhat true. But at the same time it would be missing the point.Yes Chris Evans' directorial debut is also about two characters who
experience a chance meeting and spend a night together. But "Before We
Go" is if anything about adult choices and confronting their
consequences. The exuberance of romantic love that is part of Richard
Linklater's 1995 masterpiece is merely the starting point here. Nick
(Chris Evans) and Brooke (Alice Eve) are beyond their college years and
try to make amends with elements of their past. The strolling poetry of "Before Sunrise" is turned into an odyssey that
throws the couple into various directions. Kismet is of course the
essence of the story and it has to be said that the screenplay
sometimes struggles with the very basic conceit of a night in New York.
But...there are a few scenes that are spellbindingly played by the two
wonderful leads and a few truths about love and heartbreak are uttered
that remain very real. It could also be said that the movie delves into certain elements of
"Before Midnight", even though it never reaches the depth of that movie
either.Yet "Before We Go" merits a viewing for those introspective souls who
put their faith in destiny while being sometimes at odds with their
journey.
