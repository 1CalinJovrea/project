Could've been better

It wasn't bad but if I wasn't so in love with the book I don't think I
would've liked it so much. I don't like how they changed the plot of
how Beth finds out about the photo, it was a lot better and would've
added more substance to the movie when he gives it to Ben and it keeps
him safe. I also think they should've had Zues be more prevalent in the
movie like in the book. Zues saves Ben pretty much in the book and
although it might be hard to train a dog to do that it would've been
pretty cool but also the beginning story about him training Zues on the
way would've added to it as well. There is just a lot more substance
missing from the movie that I saw a lot of other reviews saying they
didn't seem to see the character development. I understand a lot of the
time books are edited to be turned into movies but in this case it was
changed for the worse not the better unfortunately. Getting a few more
actors to be the girls on the beach would've cost some extra money and
training a dog to do the rescue scene would've cost a lot so I guess
they were kinda worried about the costs more than quality. The best
part is that Zac Efron is amazing in this and although for me his
character was already well developed from the book I think he did a
good job in the movie as well!
