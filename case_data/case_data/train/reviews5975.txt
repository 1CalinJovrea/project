Mediocre

To begin with, I believe the second part was 1 pct better than the
previous one. The acting was awful in this part too, same goes for the
story. Females find this movie kind of attractive, well some of them.
This may be a result of their hidden, unfulfilled desires or something,
something that we, mortals, can't understand...b*lls**t in one word.
When the expectations are so high, u don't come up with a movie like
this with such poverty regarding actors, scenes, intrigue etc. The
parody of the first part was better by far and that was a bad, very bad
movie. Can't wait for the second part parody, bad as the previous ofc
but better than FSD for sure.P.S. If a girl gets beaten hard, cruelly (regarding same methods shown
in this "masterpiece") by some ordinary dude, that is called violence
but if a girl gets beaten by a multimillionaire dude, that's love!I suppose I've said it all. Ta-daaaaa
