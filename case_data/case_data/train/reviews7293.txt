Fun for the whole family.

Although not regarded in the same league as the Pixar and Disney
output, the initial three Ice Age instalments collected over $2bn at
the worldwide box office. (Rather surprisingly, that's $100m more than
the Toy Story trilogy earned.) Posting figures as huge as that means we
get treated to another adventure with mammoth Manny (Ray Romano),
sabre-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and silly sloth Sid (John
Leguizamo); this time with pirates. Like each episode before it, Ice
Age 4 prides itself in offering up goofy laughs and goofier characters,
with the ragtag bunch of pirates  led by Peter Dinklage's droll
Captain Gutt and assisted by Nick Frost's uproarious elephant seal
Flynn  the source of much joy. The old gang don't dissatisfy either:
Sid is the standout as usual but Diego gets more laughs than normal and
Scrat's little journey is ever-amusing. The serious Manny is still,
well, the serious Manny, but you can't win them all. The bucket load of
action remains too, however nothing here tops the dinosaur rumbling in
part three. Continental Drift is gratifying escapism for the whole
family that, despite being the fourth outing for these prehistoric
creatures, shows few signs of letting up.
