The Nice Guys

I'll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black's original
works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look
at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better
cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull
moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or
getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film
seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish,
but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to
suddenly turn very basic, with things "falling" into place almost too
miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an
ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the
film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable.
