I really don't get all the hate!

I admit that I too didn't exactly get that excited when I heard that
this was in the making. The Sam Raimi trilogy was a fun ride, and the
idea of making another Spider-Man movie with a completely new cast
seemed strange and unnecessary. When the cast was announced, I got a
little bit curious, but nothing more.However, when I watched it, I got a whole other impression. I really
liked it. The atmosphere was great, and perhaps a little darker than
the Sam Raimi movies at times. I know many of you who read this will
hate me for saying this, but I actually think this movie was a LITTLE
bit better that the previous ones. Not much, but just a hint better.
One thing is the cast. I really didn't like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man
that much. I didn't have a huge problem with him back then, but now
when I saw this, I must say that I like Andrew Garfields "version"
better. He's a little more tougher, both physically and in personality.
Also, I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as
Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain, too, was
great. I won't say more about him, not wanting to spoil anything.When I read many of the reviews in here, I don't see much positivity
about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least, it's mediocre.
Giving this a 1/10 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you
wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance. Don't
let the bad reviews scare you away.
