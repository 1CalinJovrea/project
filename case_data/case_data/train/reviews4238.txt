"Final Destination" meets "Wishmaster" via "The Monkey's Paw",  but not as gory or inventive.

WISH UPON (2017) ** Joey King, Ryan Phillippe, Ki Hong Lee, Mitchell
Slaggert, Shannon Purser, Sydney Park, Elisabeth Rohm, Josephine
Lanford, Sherilynn Fenn, Jerry O'Connell. Better than expected yet
predictable supernatural thriller with King as a put-upon teen whose
father discovers a Chinese thingamajig which causes wishes to come true
but for a deadly price. Kind of "Final Destination" meets "Wishmaster"
via "The Monkey's Paw", but not as gory or inventive. (Dir: John R.
Leonetti)
