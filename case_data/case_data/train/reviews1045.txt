PK will definitely win your hearts.

You'll laugh your hearts out, you'll cry, you'll leave the theater
inspired, and with a sense of joy, that only a Rajkumar Hirani film can
give to you. Aamir was the heart and soul of the movie. You can't take
your eyes off of him. Anushka Sharma was brilliant too. She has evolved
as an actor over the years, and it clearly reflects in her role. Sanjay
Dutt and Sushant chipped in with some brilliant cameos. This movie is
definitely the best of 2014. In Rajkumar Hirani, we trust.P.S. There's a pleasant surprise right at the end. Enough said, go book
your date with PK.Sai Ram
