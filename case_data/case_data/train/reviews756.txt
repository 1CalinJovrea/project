Refreshing fantasy fiction!

Both my wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It is character and plot
driven. It does not rely on excessive violence, cheesy sex scenes, or
gratuitous skin to sell tickets.What you get is engaging performances from Diesel, Leslie, Wood, and
Caine, a murder mystery, and a compelling fantasy action-drama. The
effects and scenes are beautifully created and shot.As fans of the fantasy genre, we loved the sword and sorcery aspects of
the movie, blended with mystery, spiritualism, teamwork, and high
concept story telling.This is my first Vin Diesel movie. I liked the way he played the
character of Kaulder as a man with complex and layered emotions. I
expected bravado and machismo, but instead got a man of depth and
quality.I cannot say enough good things about the scenes with the Witch Queen,
both when she first curses Kaulder with immortality, and at the end
during the climactic battle with Kaulder. I really appreciated that the
movie villain was not completely evil, but rather had motives that
makes it clear why she acts as she does.I am looking forward to seeing it again on BluRay!
