A lesser spin-off, but still worthwhile

CREED is a spin-off from the ROCKY franchise, bringing in fresh blood
and taking it in a new direction. It feels a little like a remake of
the first ROCKY movie, with Sylvester Stallone now playing the role of
the aged trainer who helps a newcomer in the form of Michael B. Jordan
to train for a title fight against a Liverpudlian boxer (!). The twist
is that Jordan's playing Adonis Johnson, the son of the much-missed
Apollo Creed who met his maker in ROCKY III.The main problem I had with this movie is its familiarity. It's like
ROCKY but simply isn't as good. Jordan tries hard but as written his
character isn't as endearing as Stallone's, and the use of a hip hop
soundtrack wasn't to my taste either. The good news is that Stallone
gives a typically fine performance for his part, good enough to be
Oscar nominated for it. In addition, the boxing scenes are filmed with
a new kind of special camera which adds a real fluidity and force to
them.
