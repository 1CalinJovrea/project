Cringefest - Stupidity level 11

This was painful. Action? Yes, but we're talking Physics that Sharknado
would be ashamed of. Failure to understand or accept how reality works,
even at a basic level. If you know the basics of cars, computers or
physics, this will inflict pain to your brain.No part of this movie made sense, it makes all 7 prequels seem like a
real life documentary about cars. By far - Worst of the series. By
going so far off the deep end, it made it too improbable for me to
enjoy.
