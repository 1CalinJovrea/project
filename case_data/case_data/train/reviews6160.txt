7
Good production, albeit spoilt by dumb Hollywoodian values

I gave it 7 due to the quality look and fx. And only 7 because of the
poor script and dialogue worthy of a run-of-the-mill Hollywood sci-fi.
Being an Australian production I assume it had a relatively low budget
and I thought they did a pretty good job at making us believe the place
and story, though obviously made for the American market - with
American accents, moronic script and (over)acting. I find the latter to
be the downfall for many a scifi production and it baffles me why spend
zillions on a movie and write a poor script to accompany it.. Its as if
it was written specifically for a dumbed-down audience which can't
digest anything remotely intelligent. Anyway, could've been better but
it is what it is.. I hope they read my review and put a bit more effort
into writing a more intelligent script and dialogue for the next
project. Well done as far as the overall production is concerned.
Cheers.
