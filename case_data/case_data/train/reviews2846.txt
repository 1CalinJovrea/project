Terribly stupid and pointless

How could you mess up a sequel to 300? The story of the first movie was
simple and straight forward, yet jam packed with wit and beautiful
details...and came along with a look that was fresh and sexy, very self
assured and uncompromising. Rise of an Empire is a joke compared to the original and a huge let
down for anybody who appreciates good (or even visually appealing)
movies. The story is unnecessary complicated but doesn't make much
sense. While the visuals in the first movie seemed stylized and fresh,
ROAE seems cheap, the 3D never really impresses (enough to justify it's
use) and I had a hard time finishing the movie, partly because I
couldn't believe how they could do this to the franchise...and how Zack
Snyder is still part of this...I don't think he sleeps well these days.Typical Hollywood sell out of a creative original idea. Really
surprising to me are all those good reviews all over the place, but I
guess quality standards are just ridiculously low these days.Avoid if you can!!!!!
