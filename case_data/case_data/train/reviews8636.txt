Very bad.

The acting is bad, the movie is poorly written. The dialogue is cheesy
and there are clich√©s everywhere you look. The only reason I didn't
give it a 1 was because there were SOME funny parts in it. Zac Efron
cursed more than he needed to (I assume to try to distance himself from
his High School Musical days.) The characters are boring, the movie is
longer than it needed to be and it was just tale of guys who try to
have sex with attractive women and end up falling in love with them.
There's really nothing else in it and everything was SO PREDICTABLE. I
guess male teens will like it but I actually enjoyed the previews
before the movie started more than the movie itself.
