A Must See

This is a great movie and incredibly entertaining. Given the director's
past films (Traffic, Syriana) there is no question why he was brought
on to tell this incredibly complex story - and he did an amazing job.
if you are not familiar with the real story you are also in for a real
treat. And for all of you men that are feeling a little overweight
after too much alcohol over the holiday, leave it to McConaughey to
make us feel slim and sober again. But, for me Ramirez and Stoll stole
the show... wow! They were both great, you couldn't take your eyes off
of Ramirez, and every scene Stoll was in he made you feel like you were
there with him. Net, net, don't miss this one...
