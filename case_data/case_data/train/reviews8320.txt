Pornographic Sex Did Not Help The Movie From Inevitable Failure.

In Nymphomaniac Volume II, Lars Von Trier offers us a lot of explicit
porn,erect black penises, gratuitous nudity,bizarre flashbacks and
repetition.Despite the fact that Lars Von Trier deplores numerous explicit sexual
scenes,this sequel is a failure.The failure of this film is in boredom and bizarre images of animals
and sex as well as the total absence of tackling the issue of
nymphomania.The end of the movie will disappoint you just like the whole film.It is so scarce to find any drama in this movie.It is a very clear fact that Nymphomaniac Volume I and Volume II were
originally made as Porno Movies.So now you know the real truth!.
