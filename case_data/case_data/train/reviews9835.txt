I found collateral beauty in my river of tears

You know the feeling you have when you're just a second away from
bursting into tears and your throat aches? That's the feeling I had for
the entire duration of the movie. The plot itself is so original, the
screenplay is absolutely captivating and the performance shown and
given by each actor (especially Helen Mirren which I adore- to me, her
acting is beyond natural, she is the character, she no longer acts like
the best actress, she's beyond that, she's the god of all actors). I watched the movie with my mom sitting next to me, and I looked at her
whilst watching the movie and I saw a coat of tears in her eye, a
second away from dropping down her face. I felt as if her tear is held
hostage in her eye. Withholding itself, just from my mom's fear of god
forbid loosing any of us, her children. I cried (to be accurate- wept whilst kissing my mom on the cheek afraid
of loosing her), I felt joy, anger, fear, wanting to scream with the
empathy I felt towards each character, I was in an emotional storm like
a nine month's pregnant woman. It's brilliant.
