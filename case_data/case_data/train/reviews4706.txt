Touching Romantic Fantasy of Writer's Creation Come to Life

I liked the movie a lot. I felt very moved and intrigued both by the
premise and the complications to move the story along.Big but: The lead character, Calvin, is not believable as a "genius
novelist" nor even as a pretty good one. Why? He has no idea how to
make Ruby, whom he completely controls, subtle and complex the way any
good novelist would his characters.He paints her happy and sad, joyful and childishly clinging with such
broad brush strokes he is an incompetent "inventor" of a
character/person, let alone his dream girl. If you or I created an
automaton, WE might swing back and forth to the extremes while trying
to adjust his/her behavior. Calvin should be an expert not a tyro at
subtle shades of behavior. Granted, if he got her just right, we would
have no crisis to force the story to a resolution.And the resolution is Hollywood sugar. In Europe or Israel, the hero
would be left with the sad results of his failure. (He stares out to
sea on a deserted beach to ponder what happened and his bleak future?)
Here, the filmmakers insist we leave the theater feeling good about
Calvin and Ruby.
