It's not that bad!

'VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic monster tale
'Frankenstein'; this one is told from Igor's point of view. It stars
Daniel Radcliffe as Igor, and James McAvoy as Frankenstein. It also
costars Jessica Brown Findlay, Andrew Scott and Freddie Fox. The film
was directed by Paul McGuigan (who's also helmed movies like 'LUCKY
NUMBER SLEVIN' and 'WICKER PARK') and it was written by Max Landis (who
also wrote 'CHRONICLE' and 'AMERICAN ULTRA'). The movie received mostly
negative reviews from critics, and it horrifically bombed at the
Box-Office (as well); it's not that bad though!The film actually tells the origin story of Igor (Radcliffe), Victor
Frankenstein's (McAvoy) assistant. Igor was a hunchbacked circus clown,
when the aspiring medical student, Victor Frankenstein, found him.
Victor frees Igor, from his captors, and cures him of his giant cyst
(and bad posture, because of it). He then enlists the surprisingly
intelligent young man's help; in his extremely ambitious medical
experiments. At first Igor is very excited, to be apart of such
groundbreaking scientific work, but then he realizes Victor is insane;
and his experiments are extremely dangerous.The movie is pretty cheesy, but somewhat entertaining. Radcliffe and
McAvoy both give it their all, in their performances, and the directing
is adequate. Landis's script is rather disappointing though,
considering what a talented writer he's already proved to be; there's
been many more original, and entertaining, adaptations of Shelley's
classic work. Still, it's not nearly as bad as it's been made out to
be.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
