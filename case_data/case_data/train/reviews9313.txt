Not up to my expectations

I am probably in a minority when I say that I didn't enjoy this movie,
I wanted to like it, the idea seemed sound and the cast is a cavalcade
of top notch actors.I am still trying to work out what it was that made me dislike the
film, maybe it was the simple fact that there was no plot to speak of,
a tenuous vehicle to give the actors a chance to show their stuff.
Admittedly the sets were grand (as the name implies), the production
company went all out to create this world; and the acting was excellent
but there is a problem here too.The problem I found with the acting was that each member the ensemble
cast didn't get a fair crack of the whip when it came to showing their
stuff. Most of the actors/characters got just a few minutes of time
(apart from the leads of course), I wanted more interplay between these
actors, surely there was time for that rather than long rambling scenes
of inane dialogue.When the film ended I was left with a feeling of "so what", I didn't
care about the outcome of any of the characters. I am sure that some
people will enjoy this but I didn't.
