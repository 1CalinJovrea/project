Somewhere between Star Trek and Star Wars

Just went to see this last night and was very impressed. I was ready
for a let down after all the bad press by the American viewers who had
it released 3 weeks earlier, but I needn't have been concerned.It is as everyone states that the CGI and visuals brilliant. I really
liked the start of the movie as well as the music choice. It had a
wonderful positive feel reminiscent of Star Trek; it made you feel the
future will be all right. The story progressed well with a series of
vignettes that set the situation up well. They were all integral to the
plot. I also appreciated the great evil as it was all too real and
possible.Some people complained about the acting. I don't know why as Dane
DeHaan was exactly what the character should be, an arrogant boorish
prick who was too sure of himself. A bit of a rogue and Cara Delevingne
was hard to pin down as I've never read the comics, I'm not sure how
she should have portrayed the character, but she came across as a bit
sassy, but mostly straight and stand offish. If that's what the
character was supposed to be, then she nailed it. I don't need a big
named Hollywood actor to enjoy the story.Overall, a very good movie, though I did pick the baddie and his
henchmen quite early, though it is a very rare movie where I don't. The
run time was almost too short; the time really flew. I'll definitely
watch this movie again.
