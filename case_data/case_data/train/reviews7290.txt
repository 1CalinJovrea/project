A refreshing film ...without explosions?

I knew virtually nothing about this film - hadn't even seen the trailer
- when I drug my wife to see it last night, and we were both very
pleasantly surprised. The characters are drawn in such a way that they
are both like-able and relatable. In the end, the film builds emotion
with the audience not by means of incredible stretches of the
imagination, but through a gradually reinforced empathy. I have seen
all the summer blockbusters, and the single largest failure in most of
them is that they create shallow characters that the audience does not
care about. The dynamics used in this movie cause an engagement in the audience
that is necessary in ANY film for it to be great. This one is not to be
missed in the CGI-filled summer.
