Could've been great

I think Miles is the only one trying to act in this movie and not
pantomime his character like other's seem to do. I get the whole New
York/New Jersey thing but come on, not every girlfriend is slut and not
every Sister is a bully. If this was portrayed in any of the promos, I
wouldn't have watched it. I can't stand loud, bossy, bullying women or
the men who are around them. If Vinnie was like this in real life, then
he truly was and still is an inspiration but his family of women were
not entertaining to watch. My guess is that he had to placate them even
on film. Other than that, the movie is alright on it's own as his true
story of over-coming pain, disappointment and a strong need to feel
validated. I don't say vindicated because he was already before his
accident, he just couldn't stop until HE was ready.
