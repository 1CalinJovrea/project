They tried hard, they failed harder.

First time I've ever written a review after at least 10 years as a
member on IMDb. Yes, this movie is that bad. It's totally disjointed, filled with gibberish babytalk dialog, and
makes little sense at all. More of a mish-mash of poorly connected
movies than anything else.There were also some extremely odd, unnecessary and inappropriate
racial slurs. Who could have thought they were a good idea I cannot
begin to imagine. Yes, there are some visually stunning scenes - but the overall feel is
that of watching three hours of good commercials (but commercials no
less).Those involved with the film set out some grand goals and I'm sure they
thought they were achieving something immense, overarching and
wonderful. They didn't.
