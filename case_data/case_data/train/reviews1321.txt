Horror Worth Watching

Wow a great Horror Movie. I was slightly put off by the cover art of
this movie and almost missed this one thinking it was a slasher film,
it is not. I am not a fan of simple gore slasher movies and I visually
categorized this as something akin to "Devil's Rejects" which is the
type of movie I despise. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a good review of
this movie which made me pick it up. Anyway, this may be one of the
better horror movies of 2015. Pruitt Taylor Vince performance is very
memorable and disturbing. Everything from his demeanor to that dirty
red tracksuit. Ethan Embry (Late Phases, Incident on a Mountain Road)
is no stranger to horror films but I barely recognized due to his long
hair and grunge rock appearance, he gives an outstanding performance of
a disturbed painter and father who receives an overwhelming urge to
paint a sinister painting that is invading his mind. Interesting to
note, the voices that the antagonist and the protagonist are hearing
are NOT THE SAME. They are different which I think becomes apparent by
the end of the film. This movie is full of tension with strong
supernatural undertones. There is surprisingly little gore in this
movie though we see multiple scenes of bloody aftermaths.
