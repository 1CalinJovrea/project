What happened with logic, common sense and science fiction script writers?

Don't get me wrong , I gave it 1 star but it's not a C movie. NO it's a
A movie for intelligence challenged crowd , the once that think movies
are an art form and one movie can defy any logic just because it's
sci-fi rated .I have seen lots of B movies with better scripts than this,It is a
shame such films keep coming and there's no law against this.I was anxious,I love alien movies of all kinds and I'm not picky I can
get past a thing or two in the name of "art" but this movie is wrong on
so many levels it's not even funny.Just imagine the world resources(money) wasted on this joke !So here comes the spoil !The aliens are 5-pod squids that communicate squirting ink circles in a
tank ! OK, there must be something else ... sure there's the hero
translator chick and guess what,the squids know the future and they
came to ask for humanity help in some matter !That's IT this is the whole movie in a few words, oh and some gravity
manipulation in the beginning , THAT'S ALL FOLKS.So , you have an infinite more advanced alien species with
understanding of space-time the humanity may never have but they chose
to come to earth at the said date and just sit there till some chick
reads their squirted ink in the fish tank! no radio, no math ,no lights
, no no no , they just squirt ink and hope the inferior race that is
humanity will understand what they want. Well this is dumber than dumb&dumber 2 !
