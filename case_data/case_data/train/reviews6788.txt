Easily the weirdest film you'll see all year

There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this
whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a
completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and
more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly
unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and
surprisingly entertaining to watch.The story centres around one man, played by Colin Farrell, as he
attempts to find a partner as a part of this bizarre system. The first
act revolves around his time in 'The Hotel', and is not only hugely
odd, but both dramatic and unnerving as well as hilarious to watch,
featuring some of the best dark comedy written in years.The film takes its story as seriously as any drama, and you feel that
through the deeply disturbing atmosphere that emerges off the screen.
However, as the film is just so weird, it eases you into the oddness of
it all very impressively through the use of humour, something that more
pretentious art-house films fail to do, and are resultantly a lot
harder to really get into.So, you'll definitely be laughing a lot, if not in a more disturbed
than hugely entertained manner, throughout the first act, and by the
end of it, you'll surely be as used as you can be to the incredibly
weird feel of this whole film.Just to give you an idea of how unorthodox this film is, every scene is
full of awkward silences, the actors speak as if they're reading off of
cue cards with no emotion whatsoever, the imagery is very ugly and
unpleasant to look at right the way through, and the incredible slow
pace of it all means that the film feels like it goes on for about five
times as long as it actually does.And yet, I still can't get around the fact that this is a brilliant
film. Mainly, it's the fact that it's just so unique and almost
shockingly bizarre, but it's just filled with so many captivating ideas
that it's impossible not to be fully drawn into this insane story.So, the performances, the directing, the writing, and pretty much
everything is stunning, apart from one big issue that prevents this
from being a truly incredible film. Following the end of the first act,
the film does lose its way quite a lot, taking almost too big a leap
into an even stranger abyss than you ever imagined at the beginning,
and, with a little less humour in the latter stages, isn't as easy to
watch as the first act had been.However, it does pick up again towards a terrifying and as bizarre as
ever conclusion, and that's why I'm going to give The Lobster a 9 out
of 10, but I must warn you that if you feel you can't cope with this
film for longer than the first twenty minutes, then it's not for you.
This is definitely a cult film for the ages, but won't be a big hit
with general audiences.
