Pro Muslim Bleeding Heart Trainer

We're supposed to learn from this, with it's Pro Islam spin, that
they're really peaceful and just misunderstood. I'm sick of movies
pushing agendas and this one is no different. It's a technically
competent movie, but the Globalist Agenda ruins it. And the female
reporter subplot was completely unnecessary, except to serve the
females are powerful agenda. It never ends and is obvious is most every
movie except to the braindead sheep that have already been "thought
modified."
