Movie by numbers

This movie has it's entertaining moments but is generally pretty bad.
Totally lacking any tension the scenes are predictable and don't
connect well to each other. The script is awful, almost laughable. The
stereotypical British characters are embarrassing in a 4 weddings +
funeral kinda way. The lesbian couple are pointless and seem to be
thrown in there for PC reasons. Why does Brad Pitt turn into a
mannequin every time he is introduced to people? The plot is full of
holes...why did the German officer rush off to make a phone call
instead of arresting Max Vatan?...why would 2 dynamic and ruthless
killers be allowed to lounge around London for a couple of years?
Surely they could have been useful in North Africa or Italy!...How was
Beausejour allowed enter Britain, only for the British to later
discover she was dead? So much for their Gibraltar station!...why, upon
discovery, was she not used as a double agent, bearing in mind it was 2
months before D- Day? Now that could have been interesting!
