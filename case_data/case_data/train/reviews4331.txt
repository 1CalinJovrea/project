If you let it: Highly enjoyable.

First of all. You can't watch a movie that has the word "zombie" in its
title with high anticipation. With that said, P&P&Z exceeded my
expectations. The mix between sophisticated Empire England and
braincraving zombies was refreshing. As someone who read Seth Graham-Smiths Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
let me tell you that the first 30 Minutes were very accurate. The rest
of the story got hoolywood-ized. I guess that was a good choice because
you want to see some action and drama if you pay for a
"Just-for-entertainment-movie"The cast, expect Sam Rileys, was really fitting. The costumes and
setting were fun to look at and the music and fighting was well
performed. If you are familiar with former Movie adaptations, you can
be sure to have some special humorous moments.If you are not taking the story itself serious and are looking for some
simple amusement, I can highly recommend you this movie.
