An Amazingly Enjoyable Atrocity

What a disgusting way to spend an hour and a half. Raw is one of those
things that's disgusting and grotesque, but so intriguing that you
can't look away. All the acting seems good, and the characters are interesting enough.
The movie takes a bit of time to really pick up, and some scenes can
seem pointless (like a lot of the hazing rituals) but from there I had
my eyes glued to the screen. The themes this movie has about human
instinct is so terrifying and horrid, but is so entertaining because of
the way the main character turns from a normal girl into something much
different. A lot of people are critiquing the ending of this movie too,
but I loved it!Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch. It's not like a
masterpiece or breaking new grounds or anything, but it's so messed up
and so disgusting that it keeps you entertained it's whole runtime.
