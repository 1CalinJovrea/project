A powerful love story amid the atrocities of war

I had the fortune to attend the World Premiere of The Promise at TIFF
and let me tell you, if the sustained standing ovation was a clear sign
for the film's reception, then you can imagine how good the film is. With titles like Hotel Rwanda under his belt, Terry George is one of
the few directors with the right sensibilities to handle themes of
genocide with the right level of prudence and attention to detail
required. With The Promise, he absolutely does not disappoint. The whole cast is simply wonderful but wow I want to talk about Oscar
Isaac. I consider him to be a gift to film. He is perhaps one of the
only men in Hollywood who can play "ethnically ambiguous" characters
appropriately and gather attention. From what I've heard so far, the
Armenian people think he actually seems Armenian. Oscar's charm jumps
off the screen once more, but his performance also captures the
character's raw suffering. More than once I got chills from the anguish
presented, that's how good this guy is.I am curious to see the degree of backlash this film will receive,
given how the government of Turkey has not recognized the genocide;
although, I believe Turkish people should give this a chance. It also
shows how there were Turkish heroes and victims caught up in the
atrocities of war and they are not the real bad guys here: war is. The Promise may not reach Hotel Rwanda's level of emotional response
and the film's length may discourage some, but its historical
importance, remarkable performances and beautiful photography make it a
title worth watching.
