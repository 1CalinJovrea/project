Should have been better

Ant-Man promises much but doesn't deliver. Probably the weakest link of
every Marvel movie ever made... It depends too much on special effects
and there isn't the wit we are used to in other Marvel movies. A
likable next door neighbor kind of guy that is a hero in disguise is a
recipe that has been delivering for some time but the special 'X
factor' we look forward to in a hero just isn't there. And I'm not
blaming the actor's performance, I'm blaming the poor writing. Too much
time was spent around a computer making sure the special effects were
spot on but not that much time was spent writing a believable story
that every fan would like to watch.5 out of 10. This is a movie to forget by Marvel. Apparently there will
be a sequel, I just hope they improve what they have done here, as the
fans deserve it.
