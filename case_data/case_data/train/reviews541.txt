A slightly twisted, supernatural companion piece to Before Sunrise? maybe, maybe not.

This turned out to be much sweeter, much more touching than I had first
anticipated. Though the film takes a good half an hour to get into its
stride it really is worth the slight uneasy feeling you may have when
Evan first gets to Italy and you're wondering if it's going to turn
into something akin to the Hostel series, but thankfully this is as far
away from that kind of horror as possible.At it's core the film is a dark, fairy-tale like horror romance but it
keeps itself grounded in ways that are really satisfying and could only
be possible in the world of independent cinema because if someone else,
other than Benson & Moorhead, had made the film it could've easily
turned into one of those slick, Hollywood style fantasy movies with
lots of leather, low-key lighting, vivid colours and fast editing. The
film does have very dark moments, horrifying moments, but they're
handled with a certain amount of grace and elegance that I wasn't
expecting and you will enjoy this film more than you think you might.The lead actors are great. Lou Taylor Pucci's portrayal of Evan is
wholly convincing, his character could've run the risk of being
entirely forgettable but he's sweet and charming and highly likable.
Nadia Hilker has been working in German television for about 5 years,
this is her first feature film, and I have to say I'm a little bit in
love with her. The personality she gives to a character that could
easily have fallen into the realms of utter clich√© is really, really
refreshing.A slightly twisted, supernatural companion piece to Before Sunrise?
maybe, maybe not. But definitely something different, at least.
