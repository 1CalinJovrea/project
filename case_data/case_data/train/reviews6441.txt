Really?

Literally a waste of time, if the movie has any redeeming qualities it
would be the slight humour in the film. It's advertised as having a
crazy twist and 'you think you know the story' etc... Basically if
you've seen the advert you'll know what's going on.They are in a cabin in the woods, their actions are influenced by some
government people. But everyone got that from the advert when the two
guys in shirts said "Target acquired" right?(spoilers) The 'twist' which has nothing to do with the entire movie
until the very end and is shamelessly explained by a new character in
the last 5 minutes is that they're doing the whole thing to stop Gods
from destroying the whole world. Would never suggest this film to anyone (however it does have slight
elements of humour). Was embarrassed walking out of the cinema after
suggesting it.
