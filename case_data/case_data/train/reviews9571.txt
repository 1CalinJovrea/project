Very, very disappointing

This is actually my first review here. I just have to say something
about this movie. I was really excited to see it, because it sounded
like such a good story and I've been hearing people talk about it all
the time.First of all, I was bored to DEATH during this movie. The scenes seemed
so long sometimes and everything in this movie sort of got me annoyed.
Poor characters, lame and cheesy lines, stupid teenager love story -
that I could not believe until the end because I thought she liked the
other guy back in her town whatsoever - the cast was well- was
mediocre, battle scenes blurred, background of the plot was not
explained properly(I did not read the books). I only caught a glimpse
at why it's actually called 'hunger games'; however no one seemed to
starve  EVER.I was looking forward to the battle scenes but they made them so quick
and blurry and f*** up (sorry), that even those were boring and
annoying. Also annoying: the 'hero' does not even make use of her
'strength' the bow thing but instead hides in trees and only kills
people when she absolutely needs to - of course. It's a teenage movie
and why should she kills someone? You don't kill people, kids - even if
your life depends on it.I'm rambling because I am still so upset that I paid 10 euro to see
this crappy movie. I enjoyed absolutely nothing about this movie and I
don't understand why other people like it so much.So: do not go see this movie, if you haven't already. It's a waste of
time.
