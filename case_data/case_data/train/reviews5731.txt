Lousy

I read the other reviews here and am at a loss for words. When it
ended, my wife turned to me and said it was awful. I told her it was
very, very dull. A stranger in front of us also hated the film. There
was a blow-up of a review of the movie in the lobby, and about twenty
or thirty audience members were clustered in front of it, no doubt
trying to reconcile the review with the cinematic lobotomy we had just
endured. The only things I liked about the movie were seeing Dad's old
1961 Chrysler Newport on the street, and F. Murray Abraham. I respect
all other reviewers' opinions, but this is mine. And yes, I've seen
other Coen brothers films and liked them.
