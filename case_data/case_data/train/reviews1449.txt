A Wonderful Love Story with wonderful performances

I truly enjoyed this film that I saw at TIFF. Apparently a lot of
critics were expecting something grittier from Andy Serkis. Jonathan
and Diana Cavendish are 100% behind this film and I DO believe that
what is shown is true. Perhaps some critics wanted more darkness, but I
do believe with these peoples' zest for life, they didn't allow much
darkness to cloud their love and triumph.I believe that Robin, Diana, and Jonathan enjoyed their time together
as much as humanly possible. It is a love letter, a tale of triumph
over adversity, and most of all it is a wonderful love story. Sometimes
there IS more light than darkness. Especially when you have talent like
Andrew Garfield and Claire Foy. Both are excellent in their roles,
allowing me to completely immerse myself in this uplifting story.
