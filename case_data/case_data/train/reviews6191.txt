Hoped for a good movie .. got an amazing one instead (No Spoiler)

After watching the trailer i was really hyped about the movie because
of its theme and potential to be a really good movie. But on the other
side i knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended
up. I was scared that they screw it up and give us another Oblivion or
Ilisium with much cgi-effects and bad story and no real story and/or
characters. So i took my girlfriend and went in the movie with mixed feelings. But
then, right from the beginning, i knew this movie would be fantastic.
The first minutes really hooked me and i found myself in a funny,
filled with perfect action and intelligent movie. You had the feeling
like you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from
the beginning to the end. I don't like Tom Cruise in general but this
role just fits him. Nobody who sees this movie could deny this. From
minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted
to last forever. But eventually the movie ended and i was really
satisfied with everything. Two main characters who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told
and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i
watched in a while (and i watch pretty much movies). Even though i
don't like to recommend movies because of different tastes I really
want to do this with this movie. The story is well told and there are
no boring repeatings. Even my girlfriend who normally don't like movies
with much action liked it a lot and added Emily Blunt to one of her
favorite actresses of all time.Oh well, 10/10
