A nice surprise for this Stooges fan!

I was unsure whether I wanted to see this movie or not. Like many
Stooges fans, I was worried that the filmmakers were treading on
hallowed ground. When I saw a preview that seemed to make Curly look
like a little sissy, my fears only deepened.But through a string of coincidences one day, I found myself sitting in
the theater with about 30 other people. The flick had been out for a
while and the audiences had begun to dwindle.I was pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed this movie. It had plenty
of original material, as well as many gags that I (and I'm sure other
inveterate stooges fans) could recognize from the old movies.I was very happy with Moe and Curly's portrayals; Larry, less so,
unfortunately. The actor really didn't get Larry's voice and mannerisms
down that well. Curly was excellent, and Moe was uncanny! The movie was
so enjoyable that I didn't even mind the Farrelly's descent into toilet
humor a few times during the show. It's a shame that the final crises
had to be solved this way, but this is the 21st century and the
audience enjoyed it, so what the heck.Speaking of the audience, that's what made it truly fun. People were
laughing hysterically, and even though it was a small crowd, you
couldn't help but join in.The only real miscue I found in the movie was the under-use of the
sound effects. In the old movies, they were so important to getting the
laughs. The original crew knew this and would crank up the volume so
they actually became part of the show. But in this movie, the sound
effects are on the quiet and dainty side. Not good for a slapstick
movie!
