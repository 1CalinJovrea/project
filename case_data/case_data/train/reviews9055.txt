Much Too Slow Burn To Spark Complete Interest

Woody Harrelson's Harlan DeGroat is a bad ass, but more of a bad date
At the drive-in theater with his girl, he forces a hotdog into her
mouth and abuses her physically. After which, he beats up a man who
felt his chivalric duty to step in Harlan won't have none of that.Meanwhile, in a town close by yet worlds apart, Christian Bale is
Russell Baze, a factory worker with a sick dad; a mellow uncle; and a
little brother about to go to Iraq: A lean, wound-up Casey Affleck is
Rodney Baze, and like cinematic icons Charles Bronson and Clint
Eastwood, he takes part in illegal warehouse fights.These quick brawls are as good as things get, for a while. The film
skips around as Bale's Russell goes in and out of jail, loses his
girlfriend, and argues with his determined (war vet) brother in choppy
montage sequences not only seen in the prolonged theatrical trailer,
but still resembling one. The blue collar siblings do seem real,
extremely real, but they aren't that interesting. The best scenes in OUT OF THE FURNACE actually brings us closer to the
fire  this involves the return of Harrelson's sinister Harlan, who, it
turns out, is a redneck meth dealing/dope shooting psychopath and,
oddly enough, the most "fleshed-out" character on board He does very
bad things, one in particular, and this morphs our tough but tender
anti-hero into the kind of guy to finally root forWhen Russell decides to do something, he got his whole heart in the
matter. Too bad he wasn't pushed a lot sooner.
