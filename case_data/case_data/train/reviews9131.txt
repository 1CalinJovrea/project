This is Dredd.

This is the dredd film you've been waiting for. It will not disappoint
and it's close to the source material. If you're looking for a bad ass
action hero and want some entertainment, then this is it.You don't really care for much of the characters except for the villain
(MaMa) and hero (dredd). Dredd is the focus point and he is a bad ass.
The director did a great job on the city and you really feel like it is
a corrupt and decadent city where law enforcement officers can judge,
jury and execute criminals on the spot.As I watched the film I was being surprised again and again. They
really outdid themselves and it's a large improvement over the 1995
film with stallone. The plot is there, it fits in perfect and you won't
question the plot or the motives of what each character does in the
film. It is somewhat simple. I think this has a better plot than The
Expendables 2 so if you were thinking it might be the same, then the
plot is a bit better than that.The acting is average. It's good but there's nothing worth noting or
exciting nor is there any acting that is bad. It's just okay and the
only acting you need to care for is Dredd and Karl Urban nailed his
performance as Judge Dredd.The film has a good pace and the action length was on the spot. I never
felt bored while the action was going on or I didn't stop caring after
a while when the action becomes too long. But this film was perfect in
the action.The 3D affects were surprisingly good for once with the slow motion
affects and this is coming from someone who is not fond of 3D. If you
are a comic book fan of Judge Dredd and want to see a good judge dredd
movie then, this is it.
