Are we hitting a golden age of SF?

Amazing film. I didn't know what to expect, all I knew going in was
that two people woke up 90 years too soon, on their way to a distant
planet.I came out having seen well-developed characters faced with difficult
choices and having to come to term with those choices. To me, a very
realistic movie about human nature, ultimately. I guess Neil DeGrasse
Tyson or whoever will soon make a statement on the movie's accuracy,
but as far as I could see (being a closet nerd for interstellar
travel), it did it better than many films in the past have.The one minor nitpick I could find in the whole film, was when the ship
announces them passing a star close up - why did the ship have it
programmed to announce it, if they were not going to be awake for
another 90 years? But to me, this film had everything. Good pacing,
just enough action, emotion, suspense, and believable characters that I
ended up really feeling for, and like in another film I just watched
(Light between oceans), you see one of the main characters making a
terrible decision but you know that in the same situation, anyone would
have done the same thing.To those that down vote it or boycott it because "a man is taking
advantage of a woman" - get a life. Not everything has to be about your
political agenda, or gender or race. If the gender roles were reversed,
we wouldn't be hearing a peep from you. So sit down and enjoy an
amazing movie.
