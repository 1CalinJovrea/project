Great!

One of the funniest movies I know! There are so many good jokes based
on what's happening in the world. If you read the news on a daily basis
and know what's going on in the world you'll like this movie. Some
people may not like Cohen but I think he's a genius. It really takes
something to show the problems that we have in a funny way. However you
should really go and watch that movie, it's worth the money. I
personally watched it twice in theater. Now I really don't know what to
write anymore without giving away any jokes because the jokes come one
after another. I was already laughing out loud after one minute. It's
really cool if you watch a movie in theater and everyone in the room is
laughing. So my definitive final conclusion is that The Dictator is
more than a movie, it's an experience ;)
