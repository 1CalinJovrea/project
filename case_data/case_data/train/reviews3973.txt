Solid Family Entertainment

..took my family to see this one today, 6 year old son, 3 year old
daughter..Both of them really enjoyed the experience, though to be honest i think
my daughter connected with the movie more because of the plight of
Dracula's young daughter being the focal point of the story. That
really surprised me!Any horror fan with kids will get a real kick out of this one. And even
non-horror fans should find the story cute. Sandler and company really
pull it together for this one, after their last couple of films were
less then stellar.Definitely a pleasant surprise, and good fun for the whole family.
