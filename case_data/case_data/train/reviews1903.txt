Love story and science vs. religion

Love story and science vs. religion. Result: mehThe first part of the movie is the love story between a scientist and a
woman. Where does it all lead to, you ask yourself? The answer is in
the second part, which goes full retard and reveals what the
director/writer was aiming for: Trying to "prove" spirituality/religion
by means of science. If you take anything in this movie seriously,
you've been spiritually brainwashed and polluted by religion.Good acting, good atmosphere. Very slow paced (if you've seen the
director's previous movie, Another Earth, you should know what to
expect). Nothing amazing.4.5/10 Meh
