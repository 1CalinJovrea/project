An awesome movie which should not be missed!

I have already watched it 4 times, and I really want to write a review
for the film because this is a real Summer Blockbuster Movie which
should not be missed (as we want Hollywood to make such kind of movie)
This movie has very good script and does not have a single dull moment,
no unnecessary character development and enough background on
characters to know them. Not to mention awesome Sci-fi action. The
chemistry between Emily(Rita) and Tom(Cage) is simply great. And after
long time I got to see a strong Female character, we have seen many
strong female character in movie which eventually gets dominated at
end(by main star) but it does not happen's over here. I have given it
(10/10) for its refreshing script and acting.
