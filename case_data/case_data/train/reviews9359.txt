Shia versus Herr Flick

Most definitely the worst gangster movie since the terminally boring
Road To Perdition. Shia LaBoeuf concretes his position as the worst
actor of his generation. Hardy nails it as the most over rated mumbling
and grunting from start to finish. Oldman pops up for a cameo to show
the pretenders how its done.Slow paced, incoherent and boring summarises the plot for you.I
wondered if LaBoeufs character was somehow related to Gabriel Byrnes
character from Millers Crossing as he recovered remarkably quickly from
almost being beaten to death.Even the usually reliable Pearce plugs in
a hammy performance in his cod Gestapo officer garb. Pathetic.
