Disappointing and Overrated

I went to see this movie mainly because I had read rave reviews of
Natalie Portman's performance, which according to some, will certainly
win her her second Oscar.I cannot adequately express my disappointment in the movie and in
Portman's performance. The first thing that bothered me was the
horrible accent she had put on. I don't know if Jackie Kennedy really
spoke this way but it felt forced, artificial. She was good at
expressing grief, but I was unable to feel any sympathy. This is
shocking, considering how devastating the event - JFK assassination-
was to the whole country.In this movie Jackie came across as self centered, which can be
forgiven, considering the magnitude of her loss. Natalie Portman
couldn't touch me emotionally. The frequent close ups were annoying. We
know she was devastated, but it was unnecessary to show closeups if her
blood stained face, crying and tears again and again. The worst part of the movie was the interview which went into the past,
in segments, asking how she felt, and Portman's acting in those scenes
was way below her ability. Natalie Portman is a good actress, but in
thus movie she felt artificial. It was totally unnecessary to create
the interviews. If the point of the movie was to show Jackie Kennedy's
feelings and courage at the worst time of her life, a more direct
approach might have worked better. The screenplay, background score,
direction were all deficient in putting life into this tragic story. I
couldn't wait for the movie to end.The saving grace was the costumes and the White House interior at that
time. They were wonderful. Acting wise no one other than 'Jackie' had
much room. The screenplay certainly didn't help.The whole movie felt like someone wanted to create a movie that would
show Natalie Portman on the screen all the time. Sadly she remained
Natalie Portman to me. She never felt like Jackie Kennedy.
