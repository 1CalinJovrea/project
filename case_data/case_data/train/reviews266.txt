Loved it! Very Funny

If you just want to laugh, watch this movie. This movie is about having
fun and letting loose. Just enjoy it. Tiffany Haddish really made the
movie. She was lighthearted, innocent and raunchy at the same time.
Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, and Jada Pinkett had a great girlfriend
chemistry. I almost passed out when I saw Lorenz Tate, love him. To be
frank if you didn't get it, then it really wasn't for you.
