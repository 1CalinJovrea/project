Best animated film - a must see & a true masterpiece!

This movie was absolutely stunning and for many reasons - from the
characters, to the designs in their clothing, the different lands, the
gods, everything was just so pleasing to look at. I felt that the character development was immaculate. As I was
watching, I had become very attached to each character and it was so
easy to be fully immersed in the story. You went through all the
emotions and feelings with the cast, and the voice acting was just so
very believable. Diego Luna's singing was captivating as you didn't have to question if
his emotion was real. The music itself was gorgeous and deserves so
much recognition, I especially enjoyed the mariachi renditions, I found
them fun and catchy, some even better than the originals. There is a
modern mix of songs but I have to say it was complimentary to the plot
and was what I would consider a little something for the adults in the
audience. The story was something you would think Walt Disney himself would have
given a thumbs up for. The plot and overall story telling was
phenomenal. There was something for everyone - romance, comedy, heart
warming moments, and action as well as adventure all nestled into a
positive message you can take away from it.In summation, this movie deserves many awards as it embodies the whole
package. It was outstandingly well made and thought out, and the
casting was wonderful. I hope that it receives all the recognition it
deserves. I recommend this film to everyone and I will most definitely
be picking up my copy when it is released. I feel as though this movie
far surpasses any of the most recent Disney films, with Beauty and the
Beast being the only contender. I rate this movie 10/10
