Best movie, writer, director, and actor in 2018!!

I gave this movie a ten out of ten and believe it's one of the top 100
best movies ever made. I never cared for Vince Vaughn watching a few of
his comedy movies when he was a slightly overweight guy playing like
Will Farrel of some sorts but after watching the HBO mini series I
noticed that Vince had his 'acting chops' and played his criminal bad
guy character very well up against fellow actors Matthew Mcconaughey,
Colin Farrel, and Woody Harrelson. In this film Vaughn is not the 'bad
guy' that the Movie ad poster would make you think. This is a good
honest man that starts plunging into the depths of Hades with no way
out. I might be going out on a limb but I believe this entire movie is
an allegory of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm sure others caught that too.
Yes, it's very violent but almost in a 'cartoonish way' but drives it's
point home. I highly recommend this perfect winner and I believe Vince
Vaughn and this movie will destroy at next years Oscars. Kind of
unfortunate though since not really being a Tom Cruise fan especially
after his last bomb 'The Mummy' I totally loved his last movie
'American Made'until I saw this movie! Bad Timing Tom et al. Go see
Brawl on Cellblock 99 asap. You'll love it!! Not really a date movie
unless your significant other isn't bothered by this type of film.
