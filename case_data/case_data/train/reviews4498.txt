Fun time for the whole family!

I took my entire family to see this movie, and I was actually
pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Everything about this
screamed, remake of a property from the past, a washed up actor as one
of the lead, etc., 'terrible movie', but I'm really glad that they
actually made this quite well. I'd say if you need a movie for all ages
then Goosebumps is your best best this fall/winter besides Peanuts and
Good Dinosaur. I'm not going to say goosebumps is a perfect movie though, I mean a lot
of the main plot points are clich√©s, and while I liked Black's
performance because I thought it was over the top crazy (which he does
quite well), others might not find it as amusing. Overall definitely a
movie to check out! I watched the Goosebumps cartoon as a kid, and I'm
happy to say this is better than previous iterations of R.L. Stein's
Goosebumps
