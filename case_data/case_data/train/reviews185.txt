A good film with a lot of CGI!!

CGI. A source used to hide props or things in sets, not a good source
for characters. My mind is off that statement know changed thanks to
the work of Jon Favreau and cast/team. This movie FYI has fantastic
CGI, never in this movie I thought that those creatures were CGI. The
voice/real acting from all cast was fantastic, even from kid actor,
Neel Sethi. And also from the fearsome character, Shere Khan. Voiced by
Idris Elba. The story and directing runs smoothly with the visuals and
comedic acts animals and human do. This movie is an amazing one from
the visual acting and the acting, it deserves a lot of money from the
box office, see this movie in theaters or rent it if you can, almost
perfect.
