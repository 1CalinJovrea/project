Bigger Imaginations

It's been a decade since the last MIB film was released. We kind of
missed the series even though Men In Black 2 wasn't really that good.
In this sequel, it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the
charms and bright imagination. Great Performances and Solid Visuals. It
also has the same tone of the original Men In Black films. It's a
wonderful action, adventure movie with non-stop enjoyment.Thankfully, it does not follow the modern blockbuster roots and stay
loyal to its own. By the way, this is a comical action film. It may not
be a large one but what matters here is the fun characters. Will Smith
and Tommy Lee Jones still got it but who shines here is Josh Brolin. He
can perfectly imitate the facial expression and voice of Agent K and
it's a lot better when he's around.The plot sounds like a generic time traveling story, but there are
imaginative and wonderful sequences in these. The humor is still
clever. There is still a heart. The action is not quite appealing but
the time jump scene was spectacular. A lot of people will be rooting
for the design of the villain, Boris the Animal. At first glance, you
might think it's creepy but you'll realize how awesome he actually
looks.Blockbusters like this are now obsolete. Our usual modern blockbusters
are generic and bland cookie-cutters that are easy to be forgotten.
This actually stays to its own kind. It's comical, it has life, it
cares to the characters no matter how small and absurd the story is.
Yes, it's small, but there are so many merits that are worth seeing.
Either you're a fan of the series or not, you'll find it very
enjoyable. The Men in Black series is still imaginative and fun.
