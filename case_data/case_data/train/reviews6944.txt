The reason you go to the movies

Why do you go to the cinema? For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to
cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This
movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been
lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain
number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of
having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to
appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their
way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't
worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see
it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect -
it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But
the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant
others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you
go to the cinema.
