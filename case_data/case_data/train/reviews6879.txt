What is all the fuss about?

I heard absolutely glowing reviews of 'Nightcrawler'. Critics raved
about it. Friends recommended it. But one question remains: what is all
the fuss about? Nightcrawler is a decent movie. But there were some
scenes - and sequences for that matter - that dragged, and Jake
Gyllenhaal's character was creepy, unlikable and surprisingly
underdeveloped.Arguably, what prevented me from giving this movie a generous 6 is that
the movie culminated in an adrenaline-filled, high-octane chase
sequence at the end. It got me quite giddy, and provoking this type of
emotional response is more often than not indicative of a good
thriller.It's such a shame that it ended so vaguely and the plot was a bit weak.
For example, a great plot movement could have been if Gyllenhaal's
character started MAKING the news and then filming it. That would have
been more interesting.Anyway, this is my opinion. I went into this movie with high
expectations, which is always dangerous, and I was disappointed.
Nevertheless I'm glad I watched it, I've definitely seen worse.
