What could have been

Well the return of M. Night was... A long boring ride of over the river
and through the woods and can we just go somewhere else? This would
have been a great half hour Sci-fi flick! Unfortunately it lasted an
hour to long. The daughter was a long drawn out artistic bore. Watching
another movie where the cast films the movie is showing me just how
unoriginal And out of ideas M. Night really is. As far as a comedy
horror flick the funniest part is the 12 year old white kid rapping
like he's straight outta Maine. The daughter wants to create a film
about "the Visit " which she might as well got directing credits. I
don't think M Night actually showed up to work on this disaster we will
call a movie but at least it only cost 5 million dollars so which leads
the viewer to ask what happened to the other 4.9 million dollars. Just
a boring ride to Grammys house. Maybe the next M. Night movie will be
better.
