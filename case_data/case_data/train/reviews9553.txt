I enjoyed it!

When my friend asked me out to see this film, I reluctantly agreed. I
was very pleasantly surprised. My poor friend aged a lot over time, she
looked for all of her life for a true love. She never found it. This
film talks exactly about that. One of the lines mentioned is exactly
that. Some people find true love, some look for it for whole of their
lives and they never find it.Acting was OK for this type of film. Actors really tried their best to
make this film work. Congratulations to them.Plot was nothing special, it was based on a book. It was OK for a
romance film. I really liked it.I recommend this film, especially if you are looking for a romance
film.
