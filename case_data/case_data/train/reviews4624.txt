Oh dear.

They made the first film again, with a few more and bigger bangs,
unoriginal boring aliens you've seen the like of so many times before
and an even more cheesy script than the first movie. Most of the cast
just went through the motions, many of the younger ones ought to be
seeking other forms of employment. The CGI was epic in scale but not in
originality,the story hackneyed and clich√©d. OK it's not a film to be
taken with any sort of seriousness, but this was just poor.On the opening afternoon there were just 5 of us in a 200 seat theatre
- but it was a dull day and I guess most people were out voting in the
EU referendum (or working!), but maybe the mediocre press reviews had
an effect.They shouldn't bother to resurrect the aliens unless they can bring
something a bit more original to the screen. I wish I'd have joined the
rest of the family in the screen next door for The Jungle Book rehash,
which they said was very good.
