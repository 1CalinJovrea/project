ABC Family + Frat Boy Humor = Worst Possible Movie Ever

Wanted a silly comedy for a night out with my best friend. We knew the
movie would be bad, but this was so so so much worse. I find movies
funny when they contain some authenticity. When I can say, "Wow, this
is over-the-top, but there's a shred of truth here." Ummm, no. This had
the same sentiment as an ABC Family movie, but mixed with the worst
frat boy humor available. I doubt whether the writers have actually met
mothers. Do they even know their own mothers? I laughed because I was
EMBARRASSED. Like, wow, has the world come to this? Please make this
movie again but with actual characters and an actual premise. Make it
somewhat believable or at least make it funny.
