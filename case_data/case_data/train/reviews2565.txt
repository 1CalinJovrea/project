Must be seen in the theatres! (IMAX if possible)

I usually don't write reviews but saw mostly negative reviews on here
so far and that ain't right.It is not a perfect movie and it's not artsy, or profound. However it
is very entertaining, has wide appeal, will make you laugh, have you on
the edge of your seat and might even make you cry. It's a slow build at
the beginning but the tension soon rises and you will then be hooked.
The effects appear to be realistic and mostly practical made with a
production value that appears to be one of the most expensive films
ever made (which alone is impressive given it is not a sequel or
superhero movie).Mark Wahlberg works as an everyman lead, but it is Kurt Russel who
steals the show. Maybe the performance of his career, and the strongest
aspect of the film in my opinion. Malkovich is also amazing as the
villain, stealing every scene he is in. The two of them along with the
incredible story done with top notch sets, effects and sound is exactly
why you have to pay the money to see this on the biggest screen
possible.If you need a film to be a character study or you want senseless action
from start to finish then you might be one of the people who is
disappointed. But if you are looking for a gripping story with great
tension and action that can be enjoyed by a wide range then go see this
film.
