a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart

From the director of 'Love Actually', who is also the writer of 'Four
Weddings and a Funeral', 'Bean', 'Notting Hill' and the 'Bridget Jones'
films, it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy
romantic comedy drama film about time travel. Although it shares some similarities with 'The Time Traveler's Wife'
(the same female lead actress, Rachel McAdams) and 'Groundhog Day', but
rest assured, 'About Time' is a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet
film with surprising depth and heart. The script was well written, the
direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their
respective roles. The film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements
of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow
smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running
time.Despite the time-traveling plot device, the story focuses on the
father-son relationship of Tim and his dad and the lovely romantic
relationship between Tim and Mary, without being too sappy, too overly
lovey-dovey or too sentimental. The message or overall theme of the
film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not
too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was
appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The
on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough
for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the
other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is
felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories
when watching them together.It's one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer, better
than the disappointing 'Time Traveler's Wife'. It's a great date movie
that's not to be missed.
