Oh Master !

I don't remember when was the last time I got so engrossed in a film
that the ending felt like snapping out of a trance. Remarkable in every
detail but the detail I appreciate the most is the acting, if one can
call it that. Joaquin Phoenix introduced us to a character I had never
seen before on the screen. I was compelled, mesmerized. A sensation I
hadn't experience since Colin Firth gave us Adrian LeDuc in 1989's
"Apartment Zero". A total original but solidly planted in a reality
that is undeniable. Shattering. Love him or hate him, he's not asking
for sympathy on the contrary. He is defiant. Philip Seymour Hoffman
adds another spellbinding character to his already extraordinary
collection. And you, Mr. Anderson, who are you? Long Live The Cinema!
