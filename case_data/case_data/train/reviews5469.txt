A Fun Film, Particularly in 3D

The second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the
first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor.
The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the
"whitewater rafting" scene. That part and the whole movie has good
editing. In this one, two of the non-King dwarfs' presence is stronger
(Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her
works, adding some heart to the film. Besides Richard Armitage leading the way as the King under the Mountain
with his great chemistry with fellow castmates, there are three actors
who give specially noteworthy live-action performances. Lee Pace is one
of the true highlights as Thranduil, who is an Elf King that deals with
foreboding in a way that is different from Elrond. Ian McKellen's
acting is comparable to him in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as he
takes advantage of Gandalf getting his own storyline and heart-pounding
action scene. Martin Freeman is good once again as the brave titular
character, and actually slightly better. The confrontation with Smaug is very enjoyable. It is a long movie, but
the finale is the high point. Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent
job with the arrogant beast's voice, and the dragon looks really cool
in 3D. I personally think that they ended it at the perfect place. When
they divide a book up, it will inevitably result in a cliffhanger
feeling. But, I am satisfied with how they handled it.
