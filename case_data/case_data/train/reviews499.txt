Good one-liners and gags, zero plot.

If there was a 6.5, I would give it. Because there was a lot to like in
this movie. I like Mark Wahlberg. I like the bear. I like Amanda
Seyfried. And there were a lot of good laughs in this movie. Good
one-liners, and good recurring gags.However, it just wasn't enough to make up for a horrible plot. The plot
is lifted from "Miracle on 43rd Street." But it is not Christmas, Ted
is not Santa. Somehow Ted does not rise to the mythical level of Santa,
this is not a movie for kids. and the movie falls flat. Markie Mark is
same as ever, and I do enjoy him. Kudos to Amanda Seyfried, who tries
so hard to make the romance story line work. But I could never get past
the fact that I was watching MW and AS and a wise-cracking stuffed
bear. Some good laughs? Yes. A good story? Not even close.
