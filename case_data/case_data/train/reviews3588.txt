Horrible

I don't normally review films as plenty of people manage to put across
a good enough review. I feel so angry about how bad this film is that I
really need to warn you about how bad it is. It's not funny and it's
boring to add insult to injury. It does have a couple of funny moments
in, but for a comedy film, that's nowhere near enough. The acting is
bad, the script is bad, the plot is even worse. I don't need to say any
more as you'll either watch it anyway or have watched it and are
looking for reviews to prove you're not alone in hating this film. This
is the second worse film I've seen this year behind Godzilla. I'm even
doubting that the first film was as funny as I remember.
