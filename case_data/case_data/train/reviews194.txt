The Fail is Beyond Epic

As with most redoes, the original is so much better. The "Turtles" of
the 90's relied heavily on snarky one-liners; likable characters and
some really good humor. This move effectively discards all
aforementioned attributes and glues its storyline to over-the-top CGI
(typical), oh-so-very-special effects and poor lighting. Oh, and the
powers-to-be smacked this chelonian trio with the un-funny stick so
hard, I suggest discarding any plans for sequels. I did watch this
movie and felt overwhelmed by the hum-drum boredom spewing from the
screen. At first I thought all would be saved when April O'Neil
entered. At least in the original, that's what happened when Judith
Hoag's strong personality came on scene. Hoag's April successfully
bridged the gap between real-world and sewer world, and further
strengthened the brotherly bond of the turtles. I'm sorry, but Megan
Fox just seemed wrong for the part. She is a very pretty woman, but she
was not the right fit. I must be fare and say that it is not all her
fault. These personalities of these turtles seemed much more
superficial than the ones in the earlier movie(s), and that might have
made her job more difficult. Anyways, like 'The Green Hornet', 'The
Green Lantern', and - even 'Superman', I am over redoes. I will not
watch the sequel and will try to erase this fail from my memory.
