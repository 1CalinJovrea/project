Some holes in the plot but It has a solid message

I didn't have high expectations for the picture before watching, given
the rating and having seen that it's an Action with Owen Wilson (you
know) and Pierce Brosnan whom I haven't enjoyed seeing him in any
pictures since 007, This movie has proved to deserve a rating higher
than it's current 6.8. the message it sends is clear and courageous as
to expose that western politics do have interests in other lands and
they would do above and beyond to reach their goals. while the plot had
a dimension of truth in that, and it also contains some highly
thrilling scenes that will put you on edge at different points of the
movie... in summary i enjoyed watching this picture and I would wish
more producers and directors would work more towards producing movies
with such courageous message to make people aware of how things are in
this world.
