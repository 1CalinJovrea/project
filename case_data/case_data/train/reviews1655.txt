No classic but not bad

You are not going to watch Texas Chainsaw and expect a classic unless
you are seriously deluded. You do get what you expect which is plenty
of gore, a far fetched story line and a mindlessly enjoyable film. This is no acting masterclass although to be fair the cast are not bad
at all. Alexandra Daddario is nice to watch and the supporting cast do
their best with limited material. This is a slasher movie and you get your moneys worth of gore and a few
pretty tense scenes. As an easy to watch slasher this works pretty well, it moves along at a
swift pace, has all the elements you'd expect in this type of film and
is well executed. All in all it's better than I thought and worth a
viewing for genre fans.
