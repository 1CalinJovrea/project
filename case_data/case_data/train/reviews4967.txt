Wow, just Wow

I was looking forward to watch this one and had high expectations
without knowing that I would watch another obvious and typical American
movie. I admit that the action was OK but there were too many
stereotypes and plot holes. I am getting sick and tired of those kind
of movies, in which the Americans save their world, their president and
one man single-handedly takes down a gazillion enemies with just a
butterknife. Don't you people realize that those happy endings with the
president surviving and adressing to the nation are just pathetic? At
the end of the movie I was hoping that that korean dude would make it
and nuke the entire country but no oh no, the president gets shot and
the one-man American army saves the world with three seconds left on
the clock. Come on now. Even you Americans can come up with something
better than that. I will start avoiding those kind of movies and rather
watch CSI Miami reruns.
