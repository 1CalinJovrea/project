I Enjoyed This Movie

I really enjoyed this movie, but I must give a disclaimer... I never
read the book, so I can't base my rating on how accurately the movie
follows the book. I found that this movie had a lot of twists in it and
wasn't as predictable as most other romance movies. (Also, it didn't
hurt that James Marsden is great to look at.) I thought the actress who
played young Amanda was really good, and I loved seeing the story as
the two were growing up & also in modern times. I'm not sure why this
movie has gotten so much hate... I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and
would even pay to see it again if I get the chance.I was not a fan of The Notebook, and would much rather watch this movie
instead of The Notebook. Sure, the movies probably don't follow
Nicholas Sparks' books super detailed, but they're good to watch if
you're in the mood for a heartfelt love story.
