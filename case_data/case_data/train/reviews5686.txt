Truly, a brilliant film and story!!!

I was sceptical and not very gripped at the start of the film, I've
seen too much rubbish come out of Australia, but once you give it a try
and look past your reservations... Your'e hooked! Truly great performances by the actors, as well as the crew. I wouldn't
have been able to tell this isn't a Hollywood film if it weren't for
the accents and small giveaways... Captivating and emotional. A must
see!!! Might even give it a 10/10 if I watched it again :D
