The ending comes too shocking and too artful to get such prediction

The story centers upon a missing corpse of a wealthy lady from morgue.
This is an excitatory thriller, framed with severe mystery and
unthinkable twists. El Cuerpo is a stirring creation from Spain that literally causes my
goosebumps. Actors do their job well-enough to depict the script more puzzling,
more shifty. Their believable acting makes the investigation occult;
clues are popping up but not helping much to unravel the plot. The
ending comes too shocking and too artful to get such prediction.
Excellent screenplay; Kudos towards director Oriol Paulo___
