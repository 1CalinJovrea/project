A tale of love, and survival amid the horror of war

18 March 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Suite
Française. Based on an unfinished series of books by Irène Némirovsky,
a Ukranian Jew who died in Auschwitz, they were discovered and held by
her children, but not read until 1998. They were eventually published
as a single volume in 2004 and this film is the adaptation of that
printed story. It's a tale of life in the war, a tale of love,
betrayal, a tale of deceit and survival. Lucile is a young girl forced
to live with her severe and controlling Mother-in-Law, played
exceptionally well by Kristin Scott Thomas. When their village is
occupied by the Germans they are forced to play host to a German
Officer, but he is unlike the others. Lucile is a timid put upon girl
who appears to meekly abide by what her Mother-in-Law decrees, but as
the film gains momentum we see her true character assert itself. This
is a tale of everyday people, trying to survive as the horror of war is
raging around them. Very beautifully shot with a delicate soundtrack
revolving around the piece of music written by the young German
Officer. Once again you leave the cinema with the feeling of futility,
and waste which come from watching stories about the war, but also in a
peculiar way, I had the sense of having watched something very
beautiful.
