Terrible

While I enjoyed the original Chucky films, I found this one to be in
poor taste. The whole thing is just terrible. Firstly, it does not tie
in to any of the original films at all, it's like they are just trying
to remake the films, secondly, the doll doesn't even look anything like
Chucky as you can see from the films posters, and thirdly...CHUCKY
NEVER LOOKED CUTE! This film has made Chucky look cute, in the original
films, he never looked cute, he looked a bit odd, but not cute. I gave
this a 1 star rating, and that was being generous, I found this
particular version of Chucky, to be absolutely dreadful. Even the Bride
of Chucky, which people count as the worst of the franchise, was better
than this film, at least the bride of Chucky actually fit into the
story, along with the seed of Chucky (fair enough that one was a bit
weird. Even Child's Play were better films than this, even though they
got a bit far fetched, I mean, there are only so many times your soul
can die before its actually just poof, you are now permanently dead.
This was just such a dreadful film, my partner and I never even watched
the end of it, thats how bad it is, the least they could have done with
this film is made it tie in somehow, or still had Chucky, looking like
Chucky! I just absolutely hated this film, and I don't think they
should even attempt to make another.
