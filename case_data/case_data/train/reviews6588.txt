Brilliant

I have just seen Sing with Hubby and two 7 year old's we all thought it
was absolutely brilliant. It is rare for us all agree we all enjoyed a
film. In fact this is the only one this year.The music was first class lots of heads rocking to the beat, it had a
good variety of music and I am even considering getting the soundtrack.Rosita Pig was my favourite character and I thought Reece Witherspoon
had an amazing voice though really all of them were good singers.If you are looking to start the New Year off (as due for release in
January 2017) I cannot recommend going to see this film enough as "fun
for all the family".
