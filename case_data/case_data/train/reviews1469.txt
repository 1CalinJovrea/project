Why is this getting so much hate?

To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be
another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had
really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh
this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a
non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who
are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to
scream out "OW" and he is alive and will help you until you are better.
The only way to put him back to sleep is to say "I'm satisfied with
your work" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has
gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit
of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about.
However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the
back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and
even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted
comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the
people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's
"Cliche" "awful" "boring". I found none of these things in the movie at
all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little
teary-eyed towards the end. So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a
lot of laughs: it might be better than you think.
