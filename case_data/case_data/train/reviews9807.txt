A total dumb movie

I would give the rating zero or even minus if I could, This is a total
unrealistic dumb movie I have seen. Everything I have seen in this
movie is made for people with very primitive mindset, of course but
this could be a superb movie ever made for some folks but it depends on
the mindset of the viewer. I am not going to point out case by case
where these pathetic unrealistic scenes are because otherwise my review
will be flagged as a spoiler, anyway lost the faith and the respect I
had for Will Smith, he was a true star back in those days, but not
anymore. Just ignore this movie, its a total time waste, this is just
an unsuccessful creation.
