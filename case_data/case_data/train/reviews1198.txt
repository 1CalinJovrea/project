Divergent... Insurgent... Washing Detergent

The worst of the Divergent series to date, in Allegiant we finally see
what lies beyond the walls which encircle Chicago. Answer: 120 minutes
of utter tedium. We follow our protagonists- doe-eyed Tris and
perpetually dull Four- through the wastelands and into the hands of
sinisterly-titled Bureau of Genetic Welfare, led by Jeff Daniels'
character David.What follows is multiple occasions of Tris being called up to David's
office for meetings- like an episode of The Apprentice- but instead of
getting fired she exchanges some of the dullest exposition dialogue
heard in the cinema so far this year. The set of David's office is so
over-designed and green-screened to the point that it just became a
distraction.There are large swathes of the film's running time where nothing seems
to happen, no surprise considering this is the first of two parts of
what is one book. The decision to split the final novel into two is for
reasons which can really only be described as monetary, a gamble which
appears not to have paid off judging by the box office takings. Miles
Teller's character attempts to inject some comic relief into the
proceedings but even his jokes fall flat. An absolutely turgid affair.
