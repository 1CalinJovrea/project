Pointless movie, will only suits to below 8th grades schoolkids

Turns out this juvenile Spidey is a bad guy who would have sunk a boat,
destroyed a historic monument because of his obnoxious ignorance and
crashed a plane into a city but all he got "lucky" and no casualty
occurred, except enough property damages amounting to a cost which
could easily surpass the budget of this film. All of this why? cause he
just wanted to avert a robbery!! Seriously? call police or simple
message someone responsible about this instead of doing stupid tricks
and putting everyone lives in danger! I hated this spider-man for his
utter immaturity and for no loyalty to the comics. This spidey is just
a sham, tony is the hero here.Moreover, the vulture came out to be a good guy at the end! All he was
doing is to make some money like Stark did in his earlier days! Instead
of sharing the tech with the world they made it illegal, what will a
person do who lost all his money? Sell that thing in the black market
cuz it's illegal now.
