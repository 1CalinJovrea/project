Back to it's roots!

This is my first review on IMDb so I hope you like it. I thoroughly
enjoyed Curse of Chucky. It shied away from the slapstick goofiness of
the last two Chucky titles. It doesn't take itself too seriously either
though. There are a few good laughs but nothing that takes away from
the horror aspect of the film. I rated it a 10/10 because I think a 5.9
rating is a little low and I'd like to see this film get the
recognition it deserves because I for one would love to see at least
one more Chucky film like this one. It was refreshing and the best one
since the first two. If I have anything to complain over it might have
been to have Chucky speak a little more speaking parts in it. But I
still really enjoyed how they did it. Long live Chucky! Long live 80's
horror flicks.
