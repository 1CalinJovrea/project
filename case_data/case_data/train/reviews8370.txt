A worthwhile animated movie

My Little Pony's current iteration has been a strange if not
fascinating family friendly product, and their movie continues this
trend. Make no mistake, this movie is definitely written mainly with
children in mind but with enough thoughtfulness that adults should be
able to adequately enjoy it to at least a modest degree.The songs are catchy and worth remembering, and the characters are
distinct enough to be memorable. Although the main seven characters are
not equally distributed in terms of screen time, they still get enough
screen time to remember who they are for even a new watcher.The movie is mainly straight forward with very few twists, but it makes
up for it with strong writing. The pacing can be a bit too fast at a
couple of points, but only just so.Unlike most current Disney movies, however, the villains are quite
straightforward in who they are. If you are a fan of twist villains,
you'll be disappointed, but if you enjoy a good villain, you'll enjoy
two out of the three villains shown. The weakest member - Grubber - at
the very least only suffers from not being funny enough as the comedic
sidekick to the serious Tempest.As for the comedy, the movie goes for a more hi jinks, silly comedy
with a few deadpan jokes here and there. Don't expect to a lot of
sarcastic remarks or much in the way of deprecation towards their
series or its ideals.Finally, the soundtrack is quite good. There are six sung songs in the
movie and they all keep a different beat and genre. Their distinct
style keep them memorable, and not only help progress the plot but
explain certain characters in an easily digestible fashion.Overall, it's more of a classical styled Disney movie, and wholly
enjoyable to anyone looking for a solidly written film.
