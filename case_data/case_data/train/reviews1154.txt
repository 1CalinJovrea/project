Hollywood shooters-shi.

one star for Denzel, I think he did it for the money because the film
stinks. Like the 2016 version of Ben Hur its a empty vessel, boring and
the characters are footnotes and soulless. Kurasawa's masterpiece is
about characters, the people, Antoine made it in a Hollywood
shooters-shi. for the brainless. Actors who sell there soul for this
kind of B grade zombie violence movies, are in despaired need of money
or the don't care what they do. I made it through half and than i fast
forwarded it til the Gatling gun opens fire and I start crying. Now i
have to write 2 more lines about this movie but I don't know what to
write because its not worth to write about any more.
