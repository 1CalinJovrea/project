Good graphics, Bad story

I doubt I'll ever watch or even remember this movie again because of
its lack of emotion/depth/creativity. Really it leaves us with nothing
at the end, not even a little bit of warmth. Terrible story line that
had me only focus on how beautiful the forest was looking since it
failed to deliver neither laughter nor message. Not a single moment of
"oh I'm glad I'm watching this movie". It was more like "I just hope
the next part will be good" through out the whole movie. First the acting from main character was so bad he had a same type of
face expression every scene. Even the voices from other animals were
completely emotionless I could not relate to any of the character's
feelings. Second there was nothing new or unseen in this new jungle book. I did
not mind the slightly different story line from the original since I
was expecting something more innovative from the start. However, It was
the same old "man stuck in a jungle" type of story that anyone could
come up with, I feel like the popularity it is able to gain right now
is fully due to its graphics. Most of the movies that do not have a very good plot at least give me a
few chuckles on their way. This movie even failed to do that, which is
why I felt scammed by the current reviews out here and bothered to
actually create an account, make an honest review.
