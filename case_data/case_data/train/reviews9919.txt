Great film

I don't know why this film has had so many poor reviews. Myself and my
husband loved it. We've loved all of Adam Sandlers films and this one
delivered just as well as the rest. The chemistry between him and Drew
Barrymore is as good as 50 First Dates, it was funny, we laughed all
the way through, the storyline was fun and held gentle messages to any
families in this situation therefore approaching potential sensitive
subjects with tact and diplomatic wit.I watch and enjoy a range of film genres but in today's society where
many things are far less censored and where daily we read in papers and
see on our screens the horrible things people do in the name of
whatever their intent and films that relay these and far worse
depravities it's fun, refreshing and heartwarming to watch something
like this.I read somewhere that Adam Sandler said making his films was like
having one big vacation if that's true then why not? Who wouldn't like
a job that felt like a holiday! When watching any of his films there's
always the sense that the actors were having fun. I hope he keeps on
making these fun feel good films for a long time. If you don't like
them then don't watch them. There's still a solid place for his films
and many people will continue to watch and enjoy them.
