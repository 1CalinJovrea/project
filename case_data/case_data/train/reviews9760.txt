WOW I don't expected that!!

Probably because of the weak marketing campaign, I'n not hear much of
Geostrom, and I watched it last night with low expectation. And Woow!!! I did not expect to see it coming. It was so Goood!! The
Weather technology used in this movie are very detailed. I love how
Geostorm makes this sci-fi movie into a thrill mystery. I love to see
the chemistry between Jim Sturgess and Abbie Cornish. The only lacking
here is the development between Jim Sturgess and Gerard Butler
character.While waiting for the big movie at the end of the year, Geostorm is
definitely must watch.
