I wish I had the option of giving a Zero

This movie was terrible. It was awful. And infuriating. It made no
sense. This movie is the epitome of crap. In fact, instead of watching
this near 2 1/2 hour movie, watch a piece of crap. It will have a
better plot than this flick. The first hour and forty-five minutes
(precisely) are spent on the wrong thing. It makes reference to the
"government" (cough CAPITOL) to being some sort of evil, but rather
focuses on Tris becoming part of a cult. It doesn't even make clear
what they do. It gives no reason to why they are in "factions". There
were so many plot holes I would have thought Tommy Wiseau wrote it. The
guys name is Four. Four. Apparently the author of the book thought,
"Well, anyone who reads this is a moron anyway." Four. Why? Why?
WHY???? I understand that this garbage was only put together to make
money, but did they have to assume everyone is an idiot? Couldn't they
at least let it make sense? Or shorter? Or less cheesy? Or better
acted? Or more focused? Or more intelligent? There was a point when
Tris argues with Kate Winslet's character that them choosing isn't a
matter of free will. Or at least she almost does. Right when it seems
like the movie has any brain they shut it down in a hurry. There is way
too much wrong about this movie. If I continue I will only be hurting
myself by spending more than ten minutes thinking about this movie.
