A bit too disappointing...

Me and my family bought the DVD to this after my sister raved about how
good it was... That was a waste of money...We had seen the trailer and thought it was going to be really good, but
trailers can be misleading and in this case, the trailer made a better
film than the actual one. Personally I don't think that any of the
actors did very well, especially the main boy. Also, we keep getting
told that it is based on a true story, but the actual family is
Spanish, not a rich, white, privileged family who get seen first in a
hospital full of people dying and get given their own special room even
though the hospital is bursting for space.I have to admit that I did cry, but I think that was more of the fact
that so many people died in real life, not the fact that they got a
private jet home perfectly fine. It was a sad storyline, but i found it
hard to connect with any of the characters on any level, or empathise
with any of them because they just annoy you so much by the end.Overall, it's a really bad film with a story based on coincidences we
are supposed to believe. To be honest, I would rather have seen what
had happened to the guy who lost his family on the beach.
