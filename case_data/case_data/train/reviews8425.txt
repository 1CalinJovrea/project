An intricate film with genuine laughs centered around a solid script

When I was driving to the theater, I was doubting my choice in Seven
Psychopaths, because the trailer made it seem like so many films I'd
seen before that looked edgy and wry, and showed so much promise in the
previews yet fell short because of flat characters and muddled plots.
This one, however, did not let me down.I suggest that you see this film purely because it tries to do more
with a movie than anything you've seen in a while, and it manages to
actually succeeds on all levels, while dangerously romancing the
clichés of toying with clichés, movies about writing movies, and
gangsters with a soft side. Every time the story started to get even a
little generic, wild cards came firing in from all sides.The actors played their parts well, but Rockwell gave the best
performance. I was impressed by Woody and Walken's abilities to shed
their skins and get deeper into character than I've seen them be in
years. This is a writer's film--the subplots (really, borderline vignettes)
about the various psychopaths that Marty encounters are well done,
their back stories unfold at different paces, and their details that
connect them to the central plot are creatively deployed, while the
momentum of the film clearly hinges in the here and now and does not
make the mistake of merely chaining together several subplots to
produce one "dog" of a story.I enjoyed almost everything about Seven Psychopaths. 10/10 to offset
the 2 that someone without a brain will rate this.
