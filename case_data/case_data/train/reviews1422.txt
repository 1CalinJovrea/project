A Wasted Opportunity

I enjoyed the Inferno film for the most part as I'm very fond of Tom
Hanks as Robert Langdon. One of the main reasons that I like these
books so much is because they provide such a wealth of background
historical information so they're a prefect blend of education and
entertainment.While it was obviously impractical to include an involved literary
discussion of Dante's Inferno in the film, it's a shame that it was
barely touched on at all as to me, it was one of the most interesting
aspects of the entire story. Like many, I was also surprised and
disappointed by the changed ending. The book's solution was challenging
but elegant; the filmÂ…clunky and predictable. Pity.
