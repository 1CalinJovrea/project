Surgeon's warning: Don't watch this from the first row

The last Borne entry is just OK. Summer entertainment movie, no more,
no less. On the bad side: The script is pointless and tricky, Alicia
Vikander sounds really like a bad actress and the fist fights are
poorly staged. But the worst problem here is the direction: one gets
really tired of that shaky camera. I watched the movie from the 5th row
of the Multiplex (escaping form the pop'corn munchies) and 5 minutes
into the movie I was feeling dizzy alright. I cannot imagine what could
be the effect of watching it from the first or second row.Just two more objections: Can anyone tell me what car is Bourne driving
in the final chase? I definitely want that brand, as it seems kind of
unbreakable after all it goes through!! (even if it has a major
drawback: air-bags don't seem to work at all). And the last one:
Really??? Can a SWAT truck do that??? C'mon, guys!! You really stressed
out my suspension of disbelief muscles with that!!!
