Sad way to glamorize immoral behavior, long and drawn out.

Cricky, lets start of with saying how long and drawn out this movie
was. Gosh 3 hours to sit through watching a porn movie(basically) along
side drug abuse and lying cheating behavior. Quite a few people actually got up and left during the movie,maybe it
got a bit to much for them seeing that you saw naked woman every couple
of minutes. Overall the movie glamorized greed. Sad part is there was only about 15
minutes of the whole movie that showed any consequence to this false
immoral lifestyle. I feel the message of the movie was wrong and the
movie could have had a lot more emotional impact if they had showed
this lifestyle in a less glamorous way.
