Just give me another Da Vinci Code

I never did read the Dan Brown books and solely went to see this movie
with the previous two movies as background. What a disappointment!The movie starts with Robert Langdon having flashbacks and weird
visions. By itself nothing out of the ordinary weren't it for the
tedious assembly. In stead of getting people invested in what is
happening with the professor, you just get white flashes alternated
with some scenes that do intrigue until they give those again a generic
filter you can even make yourself in Windows Movie Maker.When the movie eventually gets into the story it's rushing from one
place to the next. If this was an ordinary action movie that would be
acceptable, but absolutely not in a Dan Brown movie. The attractive
part of Langdon is the puzzle solving, the adventure, the mysteries.
Not someone who says:"Let's go trough this door. I know it is there
because I read it in a book."The ending is the worst of the whole movie. Again, a lot of action, but
that is not what the Dan Brown-series is about. I heard that in the
book the ending is totally different and I really wonder why they
changed it, but this is a review of a movie and not from the book. So,
I have to give the ending the fame of one of the worst endings of 2016
for me. No puzzle, no big reveal, just some action.Overall if you like Langdon and you wished for something like Angels &
Demons without the riddles and with even more action than you are at
the right place, but that's absolutely not what I wanted or expected
from this movie. I wish I could go back to the static, immersive
Langdon from The Da Vinci Code who paused here and there and where the
history and the characters intrigued him and me.
