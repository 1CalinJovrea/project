Lesbian Sex Scenes &  Lesbian Kiss Were All Deleted In All Arabian Countries Including Lebanon!!!.

I am visiting Lebanon this summer and surprisingly was shocked to see
more than 10 minutes of Lesbian sex were heavily censored in a country
regarded as one of the most civilized countries in the Arab world and
where people are open-minded!!!. Even The Lesbian Kiss Between
Charlieze Theron And Sofia Boutella was censored from the movie in
Lebanon,even in all Arabian countries this is happening!!!. Despite the
fact it is rated 16+ in Lebanon, the Lebanese General Security censors
Lesbianism & gay adult scenes!!!. Lorraine Broughton is a sexy and smart spy in MI6, an agent who is
always ready to use all of her lethal skills to stay alive during an
impossible mission. With the Berlin Wall about to fall, she travels
into the heart of the city to retrieve a priceless dossier and take
down a ruthless espionage ring. Once there, she teams up with an
embedded station chief to navigate her way through the deadliest game
of spies.Catchy Disco Music,except for the noisy hard rock song.Clever
acting,great action and amazing direction.Do Not See This Movie In Any Arab Country (Including Lebanon) where
censorship is heavy!.
