A True Story of Courage

During the World War II, the bombardier Louis "Louie" Zamperini (Jack
O'Connell) and the pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) are assigned in a
rescue mission in an old plane immediately after a successful bombing
mission. Soon two engines blow up and the plane crashes in the sea, and
only Louie, Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock) survive. Louie is a former
Olympian from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and stubborn since he was a
kid, and he encourages his mates. After a month on the sea surviving in
two rafts, Mac dies. A couple of weeks later, they are captured by the
Japanese marines and sent to a P.O.W. camp in Tokyo. The commander
Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) is a sadistic and frustrated man and
treats Louis with cruelty since he was Olympian. But Louis is
hardheaded and brave and is not broken by Watanabe, resisting his
torture and inspiring his mates in the camp. "Unbroken" is a film directed by Angeline Jolie based on the impressive
true story of the former Olympian Louis "Louie" Zamperini. The story is
engaging and the screenplay is well written, showing the personality of
Louie through flashbacks. The reconstitution of the period is also
excellent. However, there is lack of emotion and the film does not
touch the heart of the viewer. The only feeling inspired by this film
is anger and hatred towards Watanabe. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Invenc√≠vel" ("Invincible")
