Guardians of the Galaxy/The worst film in the universe

If this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then,
after 50 years of cinema-going, I'm opting out for good. Are the
filmmakers of the 21st Century so devoid of originality that everything
has to be a cut and paste from the past? So, a brief run through of the
tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteur's the
writer-director. A dude from the past (1988) gets taken into space
sub-Hitchhiker Galaxy-style and gets to spout sub-Star Wars dialogue in
a sub-Spaceballs kinda plot. I was looking at my watch after the first
half hour. There was no irony or intelligence in the story, the hero
takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to
the sour-faced flat-chested Star Trek reboot and they both survive! The
director could have at least looked at Total Recall if the physics were
too tough for him. If they can censor the best part of Zulu for alleged
raaacism then I truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and
cynicism. A sequel is, naturally, in the works. God bless you Stanley
Kubrick.
