A classic in its own right

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them... It's not Harry Potter,
however it is a classic in its own right. I loved the creature
creations for this movie including of course those greedy goblins which
I was so very happy to see in this film as well. Eddie Redmayne did
such a wonderful job as Newt Scamander and his cast of creatures was
breathtaking. They were all created differently and beautifully in
their own right. His deep connection and understanding of the creatures
was so well done by Redmayne who seemed to be a little Autistic with
his lack of eye contact most of the time while talking, which if it was
done on purpose, I love it. It gives the character even more depth and
beauty. The other wizards were amazing, I think my favorite was Queenie
Goldstein she was so endearing and such a wonderfully played character.
She had a lot of heart and that endeared her to the audience even more.
It was cool to see the differences between the American and British
Ministries of Magic and the difference in terminologies between the two
countries. All in all this movie gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me. The
continuity was incredible and I highly recommend it.
