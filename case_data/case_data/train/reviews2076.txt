What a boring movie.....

And i say that with the greatest respect for some of the cast who do
what they can with the script.Its biggest failing is that its over a decade too late, the story is
well known (well the real true story, not this Hollywood abomination -
when has a true story survived the bs filter that Hollywood slaps on
any of them), and has been covered in documentaries, newspaper articles
etc.Its about as timely as Hollywood coming up with Battle Of
Britain....years too late Can we like move the movie industry away form
the hackville that is Hollywood, no ones had am original thought there
in at least a decade...M Night Shamalan was the last person widely
regarded as having an original idea (or pretty close to it), and even
he couldn't maintain it for another film. Hollywood, your time is up,
this movie proves it. No new ideas ....I gave 3 stars for the 3 main stars, the main characters i would like
in any other film. Seriously why is Keira Knightley even here? If i
were her id fire her agent for the few spliced in bits she gets. Shes
wasted here, but then, so is everyone else. Just when she was starting
to get interesting (to me) and doing things like Laggies and Imitation
Game - you know things that a man can actually watch and enjoy...and
which she is REALLY great in, she gets this unpolished turd.The whole thing is a colossal clusterfudge
