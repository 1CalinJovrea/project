More Braun than Brain

Look, I know going into a Brett Ratner film starring The Rock as
Hercules shouldn't have expectations high, but I expected more from
this. Right from the start of the film we are immersed into a world
without character development and rushed story telling. The action scenes are all very well shot (by PG-13 standards) but
everything else is subpar. Besides Dwayne Johnson most performers range
from hammy to awkward, and the special effects are nothing special. If you are capable of 100% turning your brain off, I'm talking
Transformers level, you may be able to enjoy this film. But all others
need not give this myth any more life.
