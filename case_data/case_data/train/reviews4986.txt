Awful

Whilst watching Nymphomaniac I found myself often intrigued but when it
was over I wondered what I got out of watching it ultimately. It all
didn't really go anywhere if you ask me.Why is it a worthwhile experience to watch this film in Lars von
Trier's opinion? Why do we need to see this film in which we among
other things see mankind more or less at its worst? What is the point
of this film which disgusts at times? It also depressed me as it seemed
to have quite a grim, defeatist, misanthropic outlook which I found a
waste of time to witness. I think the film lacks focus as well as
maturity.What disgusted me for instance was the moment towards the end during
which the girl relieves herself on top of the female protagonist. What
is the point of this, Lars? We already knew the girl was bad news.The fact that there was nudity and sex in the film didn't disgust me in
and of itself. I don't have a problem with nudity and sex in films but
it has to be there for a good reason and it's like the whole idea
behind the film isn't clear; what Lars intended to do with this film is
simply beyond me.A one star rating on here stands for "awful" and I have no choice but
to give it that as I truly do think it is an awful film.
