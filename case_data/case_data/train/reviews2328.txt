Fun! fun! fun !

Fun! fun! fun !Is that kind of movie that will take out the kid in you, no mater how
deep you hide it! Trolls just proves that we all have a kid in us, and
it's nothing wrong to let him out  every now and then. The mix off
colors, the jokes and the fun music will light your face. By the half
of the movie,all you want to do it's singing and dancing.  Moddy or
happy, we all know that it's a very healthy expression. I strongly
recommend Trolls, not just for kids but for the whole family.  You know
that day that you are not in mood for anything? I mean anything! That
day that you are a step a way to put a sign on your head with: " out of
service " so people will live you alone, this is a day to see Trolls! 
I promise this movie will  put a huge smile all over your face.
