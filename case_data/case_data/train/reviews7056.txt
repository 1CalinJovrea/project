The most amazing movie you are going to watch in a long time.

I think in 50 years this movie will be seen as a classic, I personally
couldn't find one thing about this movie, I did not like. This movie is
clearly something great from the very first scenes, and it just keeps
getting better and better. I started out by thinking this movie was
gonna be at the highest OK, but it just completely stunned me by its
amazing story. The movie can be very tough sometimes but each and every scene is just
beautiful. The movie is very emotionally powerful, and it wont leave
you bored one second. Even though I don't think it is going to win the
Oscar for the best movie of the year, i still really think it deserves
it. The soundtrack was incredible and it has some literally beautiful
camera work. I really think this movie is a one of a kind, I at least haven't seen
anything ever like it. I don't want to give away to much of the story
but here is a short resume. The movie starts out with the main
character Saroo (later found out to be Sheru), and his older brother
Guddu going out looking for work. When Guddu later leaves Saroo on a
train station looking for work, Saroo goes on a train leading him to a
unknown place (for him) in India. After a lot of things happening
eventually he is adopted by an Australian couple, where he will grow up
and also get an brother also adopted from India. After 25 five years he
finally tracks his hometown down and goes on for a search for his
family. I could talk all day about why this movie is so great, so I am just
gonna say WATCH THIS MOVIE, it is definitely worth it. I hope you found
this review helpful and I hope you will love the movie as much as I do.
10/10
