A disappointment

After reading so many good reviews about this movie, I decided to check
it out! I was really excited because everyone said it was hilarious. I
was very disappointed from the beginning as all the funny scenes from
the commercials that I had seen were in the first 2 mins of the movie.
I will say, however, that the movie started off well and was quite
funny, but once the two cops entered high school, it all went down
hill! Most of the jokes were inappropriate and I'm not saying that
inappropriate jokes aren't funny it's just that they were basically the
same joke over and over again and it got old very quickly. The rest of
the movie was rather slow and seemed to drag on in the middle and the
end was just very predictable. Overall I would NOT recommend seeing
this movie, unless you like wasting your money!
