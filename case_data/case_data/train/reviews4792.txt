Fine retelling of the familiar story

In this retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk, the title character and a
runaway princess are thrust into the sky when vines sprouting from the
magic beans vault Jack's cabin into the sky. A race of giants exiled
there by the power of a magic crown plots to return below and recapture
the human kingdom. The King sends a rescue party of his knights and the
princess's evil fianc√© to rescue the princess, and the evil prince uses
the magical crown in an attempt to seize the power of the giants to
take over the kingdom. It was refreshing to find a non ironic, non meta straightforward
telling of this story, with some elements of charm and humor. The 3D is
fairly unspectacular, although there are great sequences, such as the
collapse of the vine which causes catastrophic damage below. The body
count, for a family film, is quite high, surpassing some of the later
Harry Potter movies. It is also notable that there are virtually no
females in either the giants' or human's realm. The cast is fine, and
Nicholas Hoult makes a fine Jack, and brings more life and personality
to the role than he did earlier this year with "Warm Bodies."Most elements of the film work quite well and it has the potential to
work alongside dark family fare like "The Never Ending Story" or "The
Dark Crystal."
