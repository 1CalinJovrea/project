Bad man v Super Messed up

A Batman who behaves likes a hissy teenage girl taking the fight to
Superman because there's 'a 1% chance he will destroy earth' when he
was shown up to be of not much use when a nuclear warhead was fired or
when Doomsday was totaling the city; a Batman who was all set to write
his legacy by killing Superman (who doesn't know for a fact if Aquaman
and the lot are friend or foe) only to become his friend just like that
even saying cringe worthy lines like 'Martha will not die tonight' and
the even worse 'I will not fail him in death'...A Superman who could hear Alfred talking to Bruce Wayne at the party
from miles away but couldn't tell that a bomb was ticking away less
than 5metres away; a Superman who overdoes the love sick puppy bit
stopping just short of tears (to an aging Amy Adams gawd); a Superman
who gives Batman a face to face warning because that always works with
foes (perceived or not)...A movie that has borrowed from James Bond (from Bruce Wayne's aging
brooding looks that were probably set for 'smouldering' to the red
herring L'Americain-White Portugese to 'key' action sequence linking
back to a location from the earlier movie - former MI6 Building v Man
of Steel destruction site - to the Aston Martin etc) and Avengers
(nuclear warhead, enhanced Iron Man suit, dream sequences - gawd how
many were there!?!) with a Jim Carrey/Riddler-like Lex Luther but in an
infinitely more annoying Jesse Eisenberg...Actually, 2 out of 10 may be too much for making us suffer two and half
hours of a self-important drama but seeing how Warner Bros seems to
have bought sooo many 10/10 reviews here, it's about right.Only Gal Gadot looked like she was having fun albeit her brief
appearance and therefore, she should be declared the rightful winner of
Batman v Superman.
