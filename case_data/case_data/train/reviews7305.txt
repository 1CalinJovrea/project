Worst movie I've ever seen.

I'm not comparing this to bridesmaids. I haven't seen bridesmaids. This
movie was the worst pile of drivel I have ever been subject to. Upon
it's completion my movie-going partner and I turned to each other and
burst out laughing, wondering why neither of us had suggested walking
out in the first 10 minutes.Apparently it's based on a play. Perhaps the play is the worst play
ever, and this movie is just a faithful interpretation. In that case,
BRAVO!The characters were all bland, forced, and incredibly annoying. I
didn't care for any of their situations or stories. Plus it felt like
it went for aeons. When the end finally rolled around it was a
celebration of freedom, and a mournful reflection on the many minutes
of my life that had been wasted on this atrocity. If movie tickets
weren't so expensive these days I would have walked out immediately.
