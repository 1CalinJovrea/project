Seven Psychopaths.......could probably have written a better script.

Once again I find myself a victim. A trailer victim. Oh yes, Hollywood
knows how to bait the hook that attracts the gullible cinemagoer and
yanks the money right out of his/her pocket. (Apart from the trailer
for World War Z which actually inspired me to have root canal work done
so as to make life a bit more interesting). Anyway, what can I say
about Seven Psychopaths that hasn't already been said? Well, I managed
to stay awake all the way through which I found to be quite an
achievement and made me walk out of the theatre with my head held high.
Sadly, there was not much else to be happy about with this film which
seemed to promise so much but deliver so little - just like every
politician living today. I kept waiting for the fun and entertainment
to start but sadly it never did. Nothing of any real interest happens
in the film and if there is any comedy in it then I'm sorry to say that
I never found it - and I was looking really hard for it. I can only
recommend that you watch the trailer and content yourself with that as
you will be much better off emotionally and financially.
