Virtual reality comes alive - in a fun way :)

* MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS (and peanuts) * It had the basic concept we all know of the aliens trying to invade
earth in-order to decimate it, and human kind has to come together and
rise up to defeat the bad guys.As technology evolves (in our world) - it is a nostalgic feast for the
eyes to see all the games you used to love come to life (1987 here). If
you didn't realize it by now, LIFE - is - a video game. You play the
role of your persona, and set out to conquer the world.All in all, for avid people of nostalgic games (and newbies), get your
glasses (3D) on and enter the fun world of games.
