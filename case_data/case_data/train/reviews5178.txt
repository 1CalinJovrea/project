One of the Dumbest movie I've ever seen in my life

Just wasted a good hour and half of my life. This movie sucks. Dumb gambler bets and loses. Then he decides to play Indian Poker for
$50,000 and loses. One card for $50k. Then he decides to borrow more
money just to bet like a dumb idiot and loses all. Then he decides to go mob to mob trying to borrow money to not pay
back, but to gamble more and lose it all. Then he goes to see his mom
who basically gives him all the money she has, which is enough to pay
back everyone. Does he? Would I give it a 2 star rating if he did? No.
He decides to go to some Indian casino and lose it all again. He keeps
up his I don't give a F attitude. Then at the end, he miraculously pays it all back by borrowing a whole
of money and then putting it all on black. Happy ending right?The character is someone who I was basically hoping to get killed so I
can be put out of my misery. This was one of the worst movies I've seen
with a dumb plot line, retarded character and frustrating development
that goes nowhere other than frustrate-ville. I've never given a rating this low, but this one clearly deserves it
