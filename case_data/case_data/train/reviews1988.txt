I could not stay awake

I can not believe these two actors ( who I'm fond of) would lower
themselves to be in this, at best Karate Kid movie. I feel ashamed for
them and for anybody who rates it above a 3. Talk about rehash and
lowering the bar for the general public? Next time they make a movie
together I'll bring a barf bag. And a pillow. And a 5 year old. And an
Ipod. Cell Phone. Decent book. Relatives pictures. For the sake of
producing 10 lines I have to note that I did enjoy Wedding crashers.
And I like Vince in nearly everything. Owen gave this movie about 1/2
of his all. I paid 12 bucks for the ticket at the shore. I'd really
like my money back.
