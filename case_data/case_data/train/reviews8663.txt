At last - a film that is too short!

You know how you sometimes read those annoying reviews by people
moaning about how the film is nothing like the book? Well I'm not going
to do that. I am going to say that they made as good a film as possible
without changing anything significant (other than the ages of the
recruits which they obviously needed to do to make the story filmable.)Ender's Game was much better than I expected and surprisingly so given
the years it has been in development hell with various names attached
to it. As it turns out Gavin Hood was the director to bring this to
life. The design and production values are excellent and I especially
liked the animated sequences where Ender enters the computer game
crafted uniquely for him. The cast was pretty much perfect and they all
played with conviction. I was impressed from the start by the way the
film makes clear that Ender progresses so quickly because he is a
brilliant strategist and Asa Butterfield is a good enough actor to
convey this without resorting to over-acting.The film does not shy away from the brutality of the lives that these
young recruits lead, at least not within the confines of a 12A film,
and the ending is as shocking and moving as it should be. My only real
criticism of the film is that it's too short, not something you
normally hear from me. Ender just seems to progress too quickly and we
miss some of the nuances and real difficulties he encounters along the
way. Unless sequels are planned then we could probably have done
without Ender's family background and relationship with his sister and
brother and devoted more to the Battle School.Overall though, this film was worth the long gestation period. It
delivers more than we had a right to expect. Orson Scott Card may be
homophobic but the powerful message at the heart of this film says much
more than the average Hollywood film is capable of delivering.
