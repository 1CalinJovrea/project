Low Budget, High Stakes

North Dublin teenagers start dealing drugs to make some fast money, as
their business increases they appear on the radar of the local drug
dealer with devastating consequences.Well directed and acted, both the tension and violence mount
incrementally until the bloody finale, the actors are young and mostly
unknown, but play their parts with conviction.It's amazing what they achieved with the obviously low but well spent
budget, which puts many larger budgeted movies to shame.Well done!
