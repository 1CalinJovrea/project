What's everyone on about

Masterpiece. 100/10. I loved it and I don't see why everyone is so
upset!? I cannot express in words how deeply moved I was by this film.
It was about on the same emotionally stirring level as Moonlight(2016)
or La La Land(2016). Scenes brought a tear to my eye. I think everyone
can relate to the main character, Gene, on a spiritual level. However
what made this movie fantastically amusing as well as deeply emotional
was the brilliantly timed and clever humour. I will say there just
wasn't enough poop jokes, there really should have been many more.
However it's probably because I can't wrap my tiny mind around the
genius of the writers, because this movie can't possibly do anything
