Not totally sure of the point of this movie

Turned up at the cinema to find that our chosen movie was sold out, so
decided to take a punt on Deepwater Horizon. I'm not sure whether it's
possible to put a spoiler into this as most people will already be
fully aware of the story line. I really can't see the point of the
movie because of this. If you have spent the past few years is
isolation then the movie tells the story of the Deepwater Horizon oil
drilling platform in the Gulf Of Mexico. They are drifting behind
schedule and starting to take short cuts in an attempt to reduce costs
and save time.I'm a fan of Wahlberg and Malkovich, so some of their scenes were
enjoyable to watch. Think the movie may have been better if it focused
more on Mike Williams and less on the event. A lot of the dialogue was
a bit clunky though and felt like it had been lifted from the
investigations. There were also a couple of very contrived scenes. The
film does give you a flavour of what it must have been like to be on
the Deepwater Horizon. Maybe that was the point of it.
