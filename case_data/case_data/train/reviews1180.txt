trow your money in the trash can and save time

clich√©, weak story line, slogan and washy plots, awkward casting. There
is nothing in this movie to watch just endless chase and run.
Government is bad and a god guy try to solve a case everybody want to
cover. Nothing new casts are very awkward. Talking nothing but crap. No
I don't ever recommend this movie even for once. I just surprised how
Tom Cruise is casting in this move which went to watch that based on
his credit however i am not really his fan but I WAS respected his
talent. How bad. I don't like this movie at all. I recommend allies and
arrival is far more better than this to spend your money and valuable
time for that. Stay at home and stare at floor is way better that that
