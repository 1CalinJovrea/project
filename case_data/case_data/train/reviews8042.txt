Three hours of beautiful crap.

I have seen the preview of this movie and was disappointed that Halle
Berry was in this movie. She is a very boring actress who always plays
a confident woman and in this movie she was not different than that.
But Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving made me watch this movie in the cinema.
I did not know it would be a three hours hell.The movie is very beautiful made. What more can you expect from the
Wachowski brothers (or brother / sister, I got lost there). The movie
switches from the one parallel universe tot the other. In the preview
the only thing the actors and actresses said was that the story is very
complex and everything will come together at the end. Like boring the
preview was, so was the movie. We got to see three hours of scenes
going from story to story and back. Only to tell a simple story what
the whole movie was really about. Yes, you get to know what the movie
is about at the end, but it is very disappointing.Acting was bad. Make-up was awesome. The actors and actresses were
pimped up very beautiful. Sometimes the actors and actresses had to
speak words of the English language in a different way like we are used
to. I could see they had a bit of trouble there and that really stole
the magic of the movie.Some people left the cinema before the movie was over. Most people,
like me, stayed. Maybe because we hoped the movie would get better, or
the urge to know what this movie was about, or maybe not letting our
money we paid for the movie wash down the drain.One big advice: don't watch it in the cinema. It's a waste of your
money. It's nothing like the matrix, what in my opinion was a great
action movie.
