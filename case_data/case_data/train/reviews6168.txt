A waste of time, money and talent

How did they get this green-lighted? Why did anyone want to make this
film? I kept waiting for something to happen, butt nothing did. There
was a subplot of sorts, with a whispered narrative. Big chicken feet
came out of the mist to squirt ink blots on a glass wall. Whaaaat??
That's the alien encounter? I resented waiting on line to see this
idiotic piece of crap for free. On my worst movies ever list. I was
hoping for some great CGI, but that was not evident, either. Lots of
green screening and flipping back and forth in time. Amy Adams and
Jeremy Renners performances are faultless. it's the plot that leaves
you wondering what is that about? Ultimately, boring and anticlimactic.
