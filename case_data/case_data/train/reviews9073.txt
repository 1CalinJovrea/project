Hipster-class "scifi"

I have expected a lot from this movie. A lot of people have praised it
as a great movie that literally blows the Hollywood out of water. I'm
shocked into disbelief how the public today can assume the movie is
clever and spiritual even if it is so incredibly shallow and stupid.
Maybe they got confused by the cool soundtrack and the fact the actors
do wear glasses.Well. The movie has a lot of very bad flaws. For the start it is
insanely boooooring. Basically there is nothing going on for almost two
hours. It is not surprising, there are not twists. Not a single one.
Well there is an elevator. So we know someone is going to die here, it
is obvious at least five minutes earlier. We do know the scientist will
go full spiritual, it is obvious at least one and half hour earlier. "I
have been hipster scientist and now I'm hipster believer." This level
of shallowness is just stunning.The movie is not emotional. It has same level of emotions as displayed
in "Melancholia", "Her" or "Another Earth" - I do mean there is just
single emotion, which is kinda mixed out of passivity, longing, sadness
and guilt.The movie is not scientific. The level of science displayed in this
movie is analogous to the Penny in the Big Bang Theory: You will let
the actors to wear glasses and to say "molecules". Well, here is the
"science".The movie is incredibly pretending, shallow and stupid. It completely
focuses on surface and totally abandons any attempt to make anything
clever. Cool camera, cool haircuts, cool sadness, one single emotion,
completely absurd premises. What has happened to the public that this
is applauded as a great scifi flick? What about "Memento", "Blade
Runner"? "The Moon"? "The Box"? Those are great and deep scifi movies.This is just movie analog of Starbucks decaf vanilla latte: It looks
cool but it is not coffee anymore. It already lost all the qualities
and it only resembles greatness.
