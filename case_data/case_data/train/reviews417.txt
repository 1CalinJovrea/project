Worst movie of the year.

Worst film of the year in my personal opinion. You have MM and Elba,
you have 8 - EIGHT - books of material, and you do a movie that is hour
and a half long, you butcher the material, and after all, you don't
make the Gunslinger the central character in the movie. This project should've been straightforward: Chronologically you start
with the genesis of the conflict between Ronald and the Man in Black,
you build your characters toward the conflict aka Last Stand, and you
end the movie in the dark, just before the start of the first book.
Movie of 2, 2.5 hours, dark, with R-rating. You exploit the potential
of the brilliant actors at your disposal. You just don't do this. Rubbish. I gave it three stars just because of
McConaughey and his obviously good performance as the Man in Black.
