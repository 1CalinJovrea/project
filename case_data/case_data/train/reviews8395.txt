'Ant-Man', Marvel's little hero

I went to see Avengers: Age of Ultron to the cinema, and it was not
that bad. Still, the first one keeps the first position. After that, i
knew that MCU's next movie was Ant-Man, a completely new hero. But i
wasn't so excited for that movie. And it was weird, because i always do
it when a new Marvel movie is about to come out. I thought it was going
to be just fine, even boring, 'cause that particularly hero didn't look
attractive. I was very wrong.The movie is about Scott Lang, a thief who gets a second chance from
Dr. Hank Pym, the inventor of the Pym Particle, that makes a man reduce
his size and become stronger. What Pym needs Scott to do is to destroy
the Jellowjacket, a suit similar to Pym's suit (Ant-Man's suit),
created by Darren Cross. And it needs to be destroyed because Darren's
intension is to sell that suit to Hydra. The story is very simple, but it's entertaining enough to make us see
it to the end. I was afraid that Ant-Man would be full of comedy, like
Guardians of the Galaxy, that had so much that was tiresome. But this
film had jokes in the right moment, it was very well used.To be honest, i was very surprised by Ant-Man. Paul Rudd makes a very
good performance as Scott. I think that the best part of the entire
film was the battle between Scott and Anthony Mackie's Falcon in the
Avenger's new base. An epic battle with a short appearance of a new
Avenger. I recommend this movie to any MCU's fan. Now we have to wait
for Captain America: Civil War, that promises to be awesome.
