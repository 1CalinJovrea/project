Depp has always been back, but Black Mass will be his Oscar winning film

The only time I ever recall of being terrified of Johnny Depp as a
character was in Sweeney Todd and I never thought he could top that
performance. But I stand corrected, his performance as Whitey Bulger is not only
terrifying as hell but one of the best performances Depp has ever
pulled off! This is the type of the film that makes you want more and
more after each scene is done all the way towards the end, and the
supporting characters really help Black Mass reach its full potential
of hitting the right spots for a moviegoer. Scott Cooper did an amazing
job in this biopic he also she be up for best director, Joel Edgerton
steals the spotlight in some scenes and bloody nails it in all the
screen time he gets. This film also has a nice funny side to it as well
which really makes you laugh then BAM all seriousness. By far probably
the best film I have seen this year!Deserves more than 10/10
