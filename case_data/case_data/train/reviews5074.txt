Garbage

Really guys I know that sequels tend to screw up the 1st movie but this
was bad the only thing that held true to the 1st movie was zartan?????
I mean really ZARTAN SO MANY GREAT CHARACTERS IN THE 1ST MOVIE AND THEY
PICK ZARTAN...... rip chord wtf really and no original joes why does
Hollywood always screw up sequels. only movies like lethalweapon and
die hard were able to do the action sequel why cmon stick to a story.
in an economy like ours is right now I would not waste 10.00 to see
this garbage movie. I am upset that I did I wqas so upset I walked out
of the movie and demanded a refund. in closing if you have no previous
wants from the last movie then watch good action but as far as G.I. Joe
is concerned this movie was crap
