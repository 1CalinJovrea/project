A stunningly crafted Sci-Fi with a star making turn from Vikander

Nail bitingly tense, terse and most importantly thought provoking, well
renowned British screenwriter and author turned director Alex Garland's
incredibly competent feature debut is one of modern cinemas most
memorable and original Sci-Fi's, a film that you sense will be oft
discussed in years to come thanks to its wealth of questions asked and
a heralding in of the era of young actress Alicia Vikander.While Ex_Machina deals with the old aged staple of A.I and the pitfalls
of it and what it means to be a human, not a machine, Garland operates
his tale with a pinpoint accuracy that mines tension and intrigue from
the films first frame to its last and creates a small scale vision that
feels entirely in a world of its own. Garland's vision is a sight to
behold and his direction is not far removed from the works of greats
such as Kubrick, while Machina largely takes place within the confines
of reclusive tech genius Nathan Bateman's stunningly designed home/
research facility, there is much visually wonderment to be found
wherever you look. From the beautiful surrounds of the wilderness
outside, the handle-less rooms that operate Nathan's lavish digs
through to the flawless design of Ava the artificial being at the
centre of this cautionary tale, Garland has created a small scale yet
undeniably impressive universe that manages to mix the smarts, the
visuals and the performances into one.Filled with heart and humour (a trademark of Garland's works)
Ex_Machina features what will be one of the years most accomplished
trio of acting turns with well-rounded and pitch perfectly played
acting turns. In another sign that he is quickly becoming as good as
his father, Domnhall Gleeson plays kindly tech guru Caleb with the
right amount of smarts and heart while his scenes with his upcoming
Star Wars co-star Oscar Isaac are brimming with underlying motives and
tension suggesting that their pairing in this year's space adventure
will be a sight to behold. Isaac shows off a dark side to his growing
screen powers and his Nathan is in equal measure sad and dangerous and
while the two leads excel, they along with the film itself pale in
comparison to Vikander's star making turn.With a beguiling beauty and a truly remarkable ability to possess the
charms of a human and the persona of an artificially created living
entity, Vikander's Ava is without doubt one of the year's most stunning
creations in both a CGI sense and characterization sense. Ava's
"sessions" with awe struck Caleb may be purely dialogue driven but it's
here that Garland's study of the not too distant A.I advancement comes
to its greatest fruition and it's in no small way built almost entirely
on Vikander's turn, as Ava is hers through and through, thanks to
motion capture abilities. While it's some time off one would hope that
Ava see's Vikander find just rewards come awards season but Ex_Machina
may be slightly to left of centre for the sadly outdated and out of
touch Awards ceremonies that dominate the industry.While it's not flawless, some motivations and scenarios remain somewhat
underdeveloped or questionable; Ex_Machina is a stunning Sci-Fi vision
that is also a fully formed thinking man's thriller. With a jaw
droopingly good turn from the soon to be megastar Vikander, Ex_Machina
is another excellent example of what makes the Sci-Fi genre such a
harbourer of thought provoking classics and further proof that Garland
is one of the most consistently good storytellers working in the
industry today.4 and a half dancing showcases out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com
