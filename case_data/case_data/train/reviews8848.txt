Slow starter but very very funny

This film is a true romcom as you can literally split the film into two
halves the first half is the rom the second half is the com. However
this adds emotion and understanding to the film as it really sets the
scene. The second half really does have some eye watering laugh out
loud moments. The acting was great and the filming is superb. Despite
being a 'chickflick' i didn't find it particularly predictable or too
clich√©. In fact there was one part of the film that was so unexpected i
actually jumped a little in my seat in the cinema but so did a few
others. Strongly recommend the film to anyone, my husband watched it
with me and he too was just as impressed as i was. A*
