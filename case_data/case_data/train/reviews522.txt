Superbly scary movie!

This movie is a must watch for all the horror fanatics. I really did
not expect it to be so good and after watching it am totally impressed.
The the sound effects are amazing. The movie is so unconventional and
different than most horror movies in a way that it makes you wonder if
its a true story. Best part is that it makes you think and there are so
many scenes wherein you just want to pause the movie because you just
cant handle the intense suspense. Its a must watch and you will not
regret for even a single moment, all the more a true horror movie fan
would get peace of mind for a good deal of time before they would want
to watch another spin chilling horror movie. A fantastic horror movie
after a long time!!! I hope a sequel comes out soon to reveal the
secrets of the origin of the murderer!
