As good as it could have been

Let me start by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as in my
opinion, it did everything right. Sure, it had no real substance of a
story line (hence the 8/10) but that didn't take much away from the
film. The simplistic story also had its advantages, as more time could
be dedicated to Dredd doing what Dredd does best, instead of messing
around in lengthy conversations. Besides, a detailed emotional story
might have made this film a flop, as the cold, ruthless character of
Dredd would have been somewhat diminished if that had been the case.So what made this film for me? Simple, the fact that they weren't
afraid to make it an 18. This lends strong evidence to the argument
that if you want to make an action film that raises the bar, it has to
contain all of the shots that just aren't allowed in a 15 rated film.
The drug, SLO- M0, that is used by the junkies in this film to slow
their perception of time, allows for stunning, and brutal, scenes that
also look great in 3D. The 18 rating also allowed for the director to
create villains that you despise and you can understand why the other
innocent characters fear them, which engages us as an audience.The film's script is cheesy, but if you've seen the other Judge Dredd
film, that'll hardly be a surprise. And I must admit that Karl Urban
does a fantastic job of making the lines still sound good. And overall,
the acting is good, which is a relief after seeing so many action films
where even the main character can't act..Overall, a great film. Possibly not the best film to watch on a first
date, but if you know what you're getting yourself in for and just want
some entertaining action, I really don't think Dredd will disappoint.
