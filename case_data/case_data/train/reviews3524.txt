Keaton shines in this fascinating biopic

For many the thought nowadays of takeaway food is but a convenience we
all enjoy (some more than others) but at one stage during human history
the very idea of having your burger, fries and ice-cold Coke ready in
mere seconds was a novelty that began sweeping the nation of America
before taking over the world as we now know it today. A staple for over 60 years, McDonalds restaurants are a mainstay of
everyday life, a reliable source of cheeseburger delicacies, crispy
French fries and refreshing beverages that continue to supply the goods
to those both young and those young at heart. When consuming McDonalds
however, its unlikely many of us have ever truly considered where this
establishment was born from and thankfully for all us, the story is a
real doozy. It's often the case these days that high profile, well-marketed biopics
are reliable as a Big Mac (you always know what you're going to get)
but John Lee Hancock's film is imbedded with both an energy and pace
that elevates it above the usual bio-fair and with another awards
worthy turn from Michael Keaton as its centrepiece, this enthralling
slice of history is a fabulously entertaining ride tinged in nostalgic
1950's vibes and garnished with a quick- smart script from The Wrestler
screenwriter Robert D. Siegel. Capturing the time, place and allurement of this mankind changing
business model, The Founder does a great job of transporting us back in
time as we ride alongside struggling salesman Ray Kroc, whose eyes are
opened when he comes across the McDonald brothers, whose business model
of "fast food" finally gives Ray the chance his so longed for all his
life, to make a buck and then some. Keaton's performance as Kroc is quite the feat. His a genuinely cold
and calculated character but as the film begins we are happy to see him
put in the hard yards as his franchise model of stores takes off but as
the brand grows so does Kroc's ego and Keaton's performance morphs
naturally as it does in fascinating and unexpected ways.Come the films later stages, the real feat of Keaton's turn comes into
the spotlight and what we're left with is a layered character brought
to life by the performer, whether it's in comical situations or
brutally raw moments shared with lawyers, Keaton is on fire here and
while his ably supported by the likes of Nick Offerman and John Carroll
Lynch as the unfortunate McDonald brothers Dick and Mac, The Founder is
founded off the back of Keaton's turn and whilst unlikely that this
film will find itself in to many awards categories, Keaton is looming
as a key player in the upcoming awards season.The Founder is one of those rare biopics that grabs you from the get-go
and doesn't let up. A well shot, scored and acted studio film that tells a story worth
telling (plus one of the best advertisements McDonald's has never paid
for), The Founder offers a fascinating insight into the beginnings of
the McDonald's brand that also gives us an equally fascinating real
life figure and another chance for the career revival of Michael Keaton
to continue on its merry way. 4 milkshake sachets out of 5
