3-D: Disgusting. Degenerating. Dangerous.

Absolutely nihilistic piece of stupidity. Seth MacFarlane's story is
beyond the limits of human foolishness. Let him hear it. A mixture of
morbid imagination and conscious attack on the minds of degenerated
generation. Hidden lie and abominable attempt to profane everything.
What inadmissible frivolity it was to show this concoction to the
public. I may only suspect of the reasons of those wretched and
ill-natured producers to contribute money for nothing but spoiling the
minds.Infantile person is a "hero" befriended by a bad-mouthing, swearing
religiously toy. No talents, but both are "extremely funny". Even Norah
Jones!!! (what a shame!) gives him a chance. And a shop-girl who
couldn't invent anything better as having intercourse with teddy-bear!
What kind of love is in the story I ask? Sham and shame. And
propaganda: "you don't know yet whether you are gay or not!". And
carefree violence: drinks, drugs, parties, doll-girls and sh-t.Conclusion: never watch you will never miss.
