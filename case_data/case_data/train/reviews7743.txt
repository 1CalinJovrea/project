Bruuuuutal

This movie was AWFUL. The only good thing I can say about it is that we
bonded watching it because we were all laughing and cursing at how
awful the movie was. The flashbacks were horribly done - cutting in and
out until you're nauseous with no flow and no benefit to the film
itself.Biggest problem I think everyone would agree on: The description of
this film needs to be changed. If the description actually described
the film, I would never have wasted my time watching it and thus never
realized how brutal it is and never have commented on it. It says it's
a movie about the PCT. It's not. We see maybe 5 minutes of the trail in
it. Change the description to say it's about a druggie sex maniac
psycho woman who goes for a hike and has never hiked before. that's
about the extent of the content and outcome of the movie. don't even
mention the PCT; it's irrelevant to the movie.I am an avid hiker, and saw this movie to get an idea of the trail, the
challenges of the trail, and how the drop offs work, etc. To have to
withstand the poorly acted crybaby "I've never hiked before and didn't
plan anything or think anything through" idiocy, weirdo makeup (clearly
those people have also never hiked before - bleeding knuckles like she
was in a fist fight after she set up the tent on day 1 after 5 seconds
on the trail??), combined with the crappy scenery and worst
cut-in/cut-out so-called flashbacks was too much. I turned it off LOL.
insanely terrible. i'd vote 0 if I could.
