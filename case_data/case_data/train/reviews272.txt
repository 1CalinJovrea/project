It's Still Alive!

"You know this story. The crackling lightning. The mad genius. An
unholy creation."And so opens up the lastest interpretation of Mary Shelley's legendary
novel-turned-pop culture myth. So, what does this version add to the
time-tested tale? Surprisingly, a fair amount.An amalgamation of various film versions (taking most of its cues from
Universal and Hammer), this film tells the origins of Victor
Frankenstein through the eyes of a nameless hunchback who, after a
quick and very nasty surgery, is dubbed Igor. It tells the story of how
the world around Victor reacts to his experiments, from the conniving
entrepeuneur to the over-zealous man of faith trying to stop him. And how does it all hold up? Again, surprisingly really well. The
chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy sparks the film up
quite a few notches while Andrew Scott, Jessica Brown Findlay and
Freddie Fox all make good work of their admittedly under-developed
supporting roles.The direction by Paul McGuigan is energetic and lively, even if the
pace is a tad too frenetic at times. The use of practical effects for
the monstrosities that our heroes bring to life are impressive to
behold and everything is boasted by a powerfully theatrical score by
Craig Armstrong and some beautiful production design by Eve Stewart. As I said, pacing is a tad too fast and certain bits of writing
could've used some tweaking, but the cast and enthusiastic direction
definitely make this a more than worthy entry into the Frankenstein
mythos that I will gladly welcome into my collection as soon as it
makes its to Blu-Ray/DVD.I'm pleased to say that it is very much alive.
