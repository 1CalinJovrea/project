Positive reviews from Richie fans only. Movie is tripe

I like films about King Arthur and have done ever since being a child
many, many years ago. I find it interesting to see different takes on a
classic legend from my part of the world.However, this movie is the ONLY one I have seen where I have cringed
from beginning to end.It is big - has lots of CGI - and that is about the only thing I can
say about it.The story is ridiculous and the acting is worse than imagining Daffy
Duck perform Shakespeare (although that would be far more
entertaining).Then there is the awful, dreadful, dire, and ridiculous appearance by
David Beckham. It does not follow that because Beckham is a mate of Richie's that he
can act - he obviously can not - and will never be able to.Of the thousands and thousands of films I have seem in my lifetime
there are very, very few I would like to get a refund for if I could.
This is one of them.
