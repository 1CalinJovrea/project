Awful

Didn't laugh once. The story, acting and directing was terrible. I
usually don't find these sorts of romantic comedies that bad and I
laugh very easily but the humour was just so forced and lame. 100%
Wouldn't recommend watching it in cinemas. Shouldn't even be rated R as
their is no nudity, foul language or heavy violence.
