Google Infomercial...that runs too long!

To be perfectly honest, I really like Google, it's not that I am
against the brand or anything, and I even think their marketing
campaigns are very intricate and subtle...and that's exactly why I
hated this movie, it's not subtle at all.The Internship, to sum things up, it's one of the longest infomercials
I've seen in my entire life, and badly enough is also really boring at
that; the actors do their best to make it look like an actual movie,
they even succeed in the first 15 minutes of the film, but it's when
Google takes the whole screen that everything goes down the
drain...they even go in the "Google AdWords just saved an entire
franchise" direction...I think this is just a waste of time, if I wanted information about
Google Drive, Gmail or Google Wallet I could have googled it right? I
mean, there are youtube videos about those products, and there's a
reason why people don't just waste their spare time watching those
videos...well, now Google charged us to do it...Oh and by the way, as a comedy it sucks big time, I did not laugh even
once...
