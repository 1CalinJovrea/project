Disappointing

I went into this movie with the highest of expectations simply because
I did these type of gangster, conman, dramatic type of movies. However,
about 20 minutes in I was waiting and waiting for that big climax, the
first killing, the twist, etc etc. However, I was left empty and
unfulfilled throughout the entire movie. This movie was advertised and promo'd as a serious crime, corrupt drama
and it came across as a comedy moreso than a drama. It was difficult to
take Bale and Cooper seriously, and the only time I really felt
connected to the movie that I thought I was going to see was when
Deniro hit the screen. He gave the movie a little bit of credibility,
however it was short lived. The story is fictional enough, and it kept somewhat interested, however
it was too long and should have been shaven back a good 20-30 minutes.
It was difficult to follow Bale's character because you could barely
understand a thing he's saying. I understand that's his character,
however it doesn't add any clarity to the story. It just makes it that
much more confusing to understand.The acting was nothing to write home about. I enjoyed Lawrence's
performance, however I enjoyed her comedy and humor, and that was just
disappointing as I didn't want to laugh in this movie. I wanted to take
it seriously and I wanted to see more crime, killing and drama. It
didn't deliver this unfortunately.Anyways, if you go to see this movie, just don't expect to see a top
quality, Scorcese type of crime / drama, because this isn't it. It's a
weak attempt at trying to copy movies such as Goodfellas, The Town,
Italian Job and Oceans Eleven. It does have a sweet sound track, but that's not enough to save this
one.
