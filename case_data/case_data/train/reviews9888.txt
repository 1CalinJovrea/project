Chris Evans in a different avatar

It was refreshing to see Chris Evans portray this kind of role after
quite some time. He is a screenplay writer who is forced to write a
rom-com. He is a person who doesn't believe in love after a traumatic
incident involving his mother. He believes his life is perfectly fine
with his bunch of friends, his grandfather, and occasional flings. He
has a deadline coming up, his agent is pressurizing him, and he has no
clue what to do. He has a severe writer's block until he meets her at a
charity event. Love at first sight for him. A friend and support for
her. He confesses his love, but she is already engaged. Now, it is up
to him to fight or let go. There are a few laughs here and there
throughout the movie.Chris Evans keeps the energy and spunk alive.
Michelle also plays her part well, as the girl torn between love and
stability. On the flip-side, I found the story clich√©d in some places.
On an afterthought, quite a treat if you are a Chris Evans fan.
