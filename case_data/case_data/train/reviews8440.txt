The best zombie movie I have ever seen

The best zombie film I have ever seen (outside of the comedy Shaun of
the Dead). Such a great film. It starts exactly like a train ride
gathering momentum and gaining speed. The only difference with this
train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script,
fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also
has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie
genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear
that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it
will be done as well as this. I thoroughly recommend this very
refreshing and fast paced film. Get a ticket and enjoy the ride!
