Loved it- well worth a watch- a comedy with substance

I know there are lots of negative reviews (critics, I mean) about this
movie which made me unsure about going to see it. Basically what I can
say is that reviews can't tell you how you are going to experience this
movie- I found it hilarious. I came to a point where I couldn't breathe
as I was laughing so much- a nice bit of stress relief. I didn't find
that there were laughing moments the WHOLE way through- I don't know
why the critics didn't like this though- at least it's not just a
mindless comedy. It has a genuine plot line which is followed through-
a comedy with substance- it's not just one funny scenario after another
and this emphasises the hilarity of the funny moments that do come up.
Would definitely recommend it- left me buzzing after wards- can be
enjoyed by everyone. I found Leslie Mann was the shining star of the
movie- so was Cameron Diaz (slightly less so than Mann). Kate Upton, I
think contributed very little- don't know why she got the billing that
she did. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau also stood out for me.
