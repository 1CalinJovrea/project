Despicable me

Great acting, good plot with a nice twist at the end. BUT, I found this
movie quite frightening, more so than your normal "horror" film, the
main reason being the utterly amoral main character (and its truly
frightening that one reviewer found her "sexy"!). She is self-obsessed,
arrogant, ambitious, rude, narcissistic, manipulative, totally
unlikable, etc but despite all this I feel we are expected, in the long
run, to admire and begrudgingly like her, why? because she was
amazingly clever and most importantly she won. Is this seriously the most important thing in the long run? Is the
perception of American society having a "win at all costs "mentality
actually true? I hope this makes people question their values and leads to discussion
on morals/ethics etc and the realisation that no matter the issue, that
you don't have to cheat in order to catch a cheat, to become a villain
to catch one etc. Hopefully such discussion was the writer's intent,
its just such a shame that it was via such a truly despicable
character.
