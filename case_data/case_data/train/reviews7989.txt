i never expected "the mortal instruments" to be a great movie, but the
poorly directed steaming pile of crap that it is?! for frag sake, you
would think with the quality cast in the film it would at least
entertain.now, i like movies. even bad ones...however, everything from the shabby ruins that look like sharpie marks
to the sadly displayed comic relief, this 2+ hour film begs the
question, "is it over yet?" unfortunately, there's a sequel in 2014. wonder how many actors in the
film will be asking to be payed per scale...in closing (10 lines of text? i could use 10 lines of text to describe
"poo" or i can just call it "poo"...) save your money. i just watched a
lady go crazy in a mcdonald's drive thru on youtube for free and i give
that a better review than the mortal instruments.
