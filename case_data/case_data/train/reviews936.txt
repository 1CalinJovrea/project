Surprisingly entertaining

I never was a huge fan of Liam Neeson's action flicks, but I went to
see this because of the good reviews. This movie is a very suspenseful
and a great "Whodunnit" movie. It it's share of action scenes, but it
never went too over the top. Even if you don't like Liam Neeson, this
movie is worth seeing and is a guaranteed good time. Lot's of twists
and suspicious characters leave you guessing and most likely wrong.
Lot's of on the edge-of- your-seat scenes because of how well it was
made and has a silent and lonely feel to it which helps you understand
everything going on. Overall, this movie is a great thriller without
being packed full of action.
