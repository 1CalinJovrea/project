Wish I had missed it

Actually a good well acted movie till the end. Ben Affleck was
excellent and Rosamund Pike had me 100% convinced she was evil
incarnate. Carrie Coon as Ben's twin sister and Kim Dickens as the lead
detective also gave excellent performances. As for the story, I can
deal with sad endings where the hero dies like Braveheart, Cool Hand
Luke, and endless others. When the credits came up on Gone Girl, I
could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me
that angry. I would have preferred she had just killed Ben Affleck and
gotten away with it. Assuming the book had the same ending I would have
thrown it across the room upon finishing it. I enjoyed the movie up
till the end but that completely ruined it for me.
