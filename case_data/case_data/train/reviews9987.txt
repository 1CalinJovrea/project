Raw power and emotion

Rarely does a film use its source material (in this case, two
powerfully devastating short stories by Craig Davidson) and transform
it into something new and equally formidable. That, however, is
precisely what Jacques Audiard has done with "Rust and Bone," a moving
and raw look at how two rather ordinary people respond to extraordinary
circumstances. Stephanie, a whale trainer played by the brilliant
Marion Cotillard, must face life as a double amputee after a freak
accident. Alainplayed by the painfully handsome Matthias
Schoenaertsis a single father who must juggle his need to support his
son while eking out a living for himself as a security guard.
Stephanie's and Alain's lives intersect in unexpected but perfectly
plausible ways, and their story generates equal parts despair and
inspiration. This is an emotionally difficult but ultimately life-
affirming film. And I sincerely hope that it helps catapult Schoenaerts
to fame in the US. He embodies an atypical combination of ruggedness
and heartfelt emotion rarely seen on film.
