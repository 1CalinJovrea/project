Great in every way!

Thanks to the New York Film Festival I got the chance to see this
perfectly crafted film early.Carol's nothing short of fantastic. It's story is one of the best
romances i've seen put on the big screen. What I love is how nobody
makes it a big fuzz about the two lovers being females. It's treated
with the same respect as any other romantic drama, and it's done better
than most of them. The film is on another level when the two leads Cate Blanchett and
Rooney Mara are on screen together. Both undoubtedly gave two of the
best performances of the year. It's pace is slow, but never boring. Giving us some intense
slow-building moments that leaves us smiling or shedding tears. Carol's great. Watch it.
