Mr Renner burns the screen!

Thanks to the 2 heroes, I give a good mark though the script was a
labyrinth of complications between different US National Security
Services and their different projects more or less secret, some of them
more secret within secrets because untellable, unacceptable. And when
one of those has to disappear, lots of dead people it means. Here is
the story of another run-for-his-life hero, Jeremy Renner! He surprised
me this actor. He blows the screen from his very first appearance until
the last. And Mrs Weisz, the co-runner-for-her-life does well too as an
evolving character, a woman scientist who goes from naive close to
stupid terrified victim to a full grown resilient survivor, doing very
well with Mr Renner. Wow they are good! They SAVE the movie Let's hope
there will be a sequel with these two but with a MUCH IMPROVED script,
please. I declare myself a fan for Mr Renner (Please forgive my
probably curious use of English, my second language...)
