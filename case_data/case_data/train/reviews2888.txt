Outstanding masterpiece.

The Handmaiden was an outstanding masterpiece, a pure work of art. It
covered the whole spectrum of human emotion: Lust, love, hate, vicious
moral decay, and all matters of perversion. And all presented in such a
raw and passionate intensity, always keeping you on your toes. And I
haven't even stared gushing about the cinematography - simply
breathtaking, from start to finish. I quite liked Stoker, but not as
much as Oldboy, which was fantastic. But Handmaiden has been my
favorite work from visionary director Park Chank-Wook so far. Cannot
wait to see what he will baffle us with next.
