Disappointing

I first heard of this movie back in the Summer and was really looking
forward to it for a long time. I loved Contracted and its sequel, and
this movie seemed to promise something similar, but ultimately fell
really flat.This movie feels like taking a bite out of a beautiful shiny red apple,
only to find tasteless mush inside it. They got the FX right, but
nothing else was. The script was too bland to carry the plot anywhere.It was very basic. Casey got bit by something underwater while on
vacation in Costa Rica. And of course, whatever bit her was carrying
something far worse than Lyme disease. This thing started to transform
her into some other species.There were very interesting FX and Casey got some new and deadly
abilities. I really wish we could have seen more of where all that was
headed.The rest of the movie didn't have much plot. And the characters really
weren't that likable. Casey had one friend who genuinely cared and
wasn't that bad. The rest were not so good.Ultimately, beyond the FX, there isn't anything to really like about
this movie. The other reviews on here are spot on. We're all saying the
same basic thing. It's not a good movie, but the FX will keep you
entertained for awhile.
