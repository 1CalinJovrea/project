Amazing script, completely original and not to be missed

Must be Babysitter week for me (also The Babysitter), because I just
watched another one "Better Watch Out", and what a killer this is, in
more ways than one. First of all, the script is brilliant, absolutely
impossible to know what happens next, IMO. It starts out with a
babysitter for a 12 year old boy, and the parents leaving. It appears
to be a home invasion genre, but it turns out far far from that. Saying
much more than that might be a spoiler, because you need to see it, not
knowing anything about all the twists and turns. The kills are great,
and not really bloody or gory, but very effective. I totally loved it,
it is highly original, I've never seen a movie like it. I guess it is
supposed to be a comedic horror film, but I found it more horrific than
funny. Outstanding, another must-see.
