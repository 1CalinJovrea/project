Better than Original! Seven Kids Versus Evil Cannibal Clown

The first sequence is classical example of US horror film. In which,
the evil clown suddenly and naturally appears, and it victimizes the
kid who drops his toys into drainage passage on a rainy day in the
local city of US. We not only easily grab the setting of the evil clown
and what he wants. It is a typical bogie man story who eats and kidnap
kids who are afraid of it. It(2017) proves effective use of VFX, CG animation is to crate what
traditional acting or camera working or editing technique can not
achieve. This film actually avoided overused VFX and CG animations (CG
is not an editorial work but it's computer animation). Moreover, it recovered or tried to revive the core spirit of 1980s'
Goonies or Stand By Me to the certain extent. This is also well
accepted and understandable. The evil clown is typical Boogieman, and it has common feature with
Freddy. And it is scarier than the latter. I appreciate the legitimate and efficient structure of this film. It is
the best horror film of 2017! 10 out of 10!
