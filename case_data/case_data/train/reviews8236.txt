A great scary movie without the B.S

This movie is amazing. No stupid twists or turns. It doesn't try to be
witty or smart. It's a good ol'fashioned scary ( not horror ) movie.
The acting is superb. Ethan Embry is almost unrecognizable as an Iggy
Pop-esque painter / Artist. This dude did some work to get in shape, I
had to pause it and think " Is this the guy that played the kid in the
movie Dutch?". Pruitt Taylor Vince is amazing. He is one of the most
important yet underrated actors of our time. It has a good story line
that doesn't try to be too serious about its self. As a music fan, I
was impressed by the soundtrack and was more impressed they got the
rights to a Metallica song! In the early 90's Metallica turned down
John Carpenter when he asked to use Enter Sand Man in his movie " The
Mouth of madness" and Carpenter is a legend.This is a fun movie for fans of visual effects , story and sound track.
