Game of Thrones + Lord of the Rings story lines with Snatch + Lock Stock dialogues and editing

Will keep it short and simple. If you don't get/understand the
(British) humour (i.e you don't think the jokes are funny), dialogue
and fast "flashbacky" editing style presented in Lock Stock and Snatch,
you will hate this movie. Easy as that. For us who understand what
constitutes a Ritchie movie will be more likely than not, like the
movie.
