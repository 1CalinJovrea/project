Pleasant Surprise

Yes, like most "kids" movies, it had it's corny, funny, sometimes just
plain silly parts, but... Paranorman left me pleasantly surprised.
First and foremost, if you didn't like this movie because you compared
it to Caroline, that's your problem. This movie stands well on its own
and it's completely unfair to make comparisons. By the time the movie
had finished, the beauty of it shone through and, without hesitation, I
would say it stands up very well against "blockbuster" films designed
for mature audiences. It's neither vulgar or obscene, but there are a
few parts in the movie that will go straight over the youngster's heads
but you will most certainly get it if you're over the age of thirty and
haven't been living in a cave. If you take your kid(s) to see this, be
ready; there are a few intense scenes that might have them a little
frightened. Regarding the poor guy who didn't want to see the
Expendables 2, I didn't see it, either, but I sure heard it. They
poorly placed this movie the very next theater over from it.
