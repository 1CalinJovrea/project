Not as good as expected

When I first saw the trailer for '2 Guns' I couldn't wait to see it. It
had so much potential to be a great film but after watching it seems to
be a bit of a let down. Almost any Denzel Washington film is at least
good and usually a great film, this is an exception to the rule. The
plot isn't great and it isn't delivered well either. At times it is
even confusing. The selection of Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg to
play along side each other should have resulted in loads of funny
little lines throughout the film and both actors playing off one
another. This was not the case. The script didn't allow the full
potential of this acting pair to be utilized. This was one of the main
reasons this film fell down. Without Wahlberg and Washington being used
fully it just became a mediocre action film with two expensive main
actors and a confusing storyline. (6/10)
