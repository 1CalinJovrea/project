A great movie and great acting

Having read and seen the documentary about The Iceman I was a little
scared that they would have gone all Hollywood on it but I was
pleasantly surprised.A few details of his life were not accurate, but the movie does not
focus on that anyhow. What it did do, was to show the man as what I
would have imagined him as. Anyone that has seen the movie I'd
recommend that you google the documentary about him. In the final scene
of the movie Michael Shannon manages to catch his persona insanely
well. Almost gave me the chills how well he acted in the last scene,
not to say the whole movie.Hands down one of the best depicted movies on a real world person. And
if you haven't seen the documentary watch it first, it won't spoil the
movie but it will give you a reference point on the man.
