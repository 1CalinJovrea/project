Jungle Madness

I viewed this movie last evening and found it moderately entertaining.
The title grabbed my attention. The first half of this movie had me
wondering if I had made a bad choice, but as the movie went on I was
drawn into it and satisfied at the end. I think that McConaghy was way
over the top and had a negative effect on the movie as a whole. I
always want to "like" a character but this guy was so unlikable that it
hurt the film. And at the beginning of each scene it always had the
same start, the lighting up of a cigarette another thing that that was
just too noticeable. I think that this should have been a better film,
but it was not a waste of my time!
