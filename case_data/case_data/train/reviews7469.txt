Who told Kristen Stewart she could be an actress?

The movie is good (not great, though), specially because of the visual
effects and Charlize Theron acting. She is great, beautiful,
impressive, plays her role full of passion, as usual. Also I think
there was no need for a 127 minutes picture. It could last less time,
because in some moments I felt like they were just dragging it for no
reason. I expected more, but all the problem is with Snow White choice.
Kristen Stewart is like my refrigerator, no matter what I put in it
(milk, soda, eggs, vegetables, meat), it is and it will always be a
refrigerator. And so is she. She is always the same, no matter what
role she is playing. If she can be an actress, so can my refrigerator.
They are both cold and have no expression.
