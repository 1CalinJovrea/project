Screw Rotten Tomatoes this movie is as fantastic as it could get

Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far
this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth
entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2
and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance
as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film
right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a
year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far,
Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want
from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give
us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The
newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them
again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about
Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!
