the worst film I have paid to watch

It would have to rewritten with a decent script to get to the dizzying
heights of awful. I know that Adam Sandler regularly wins awards for
his lack of performance, but this film truly is painful to watch - I
would have left the cinema but for the fact my11 year old so wanted to
see the film, and we were holidaying in unfamiliar territory in the
USA. My 11 year old son enjoyed it though. Expect it to win the raspberry
awards this year! The humour was infantile. The storyline lacked any
form of credibility . I guess these just took the money - disappointing
especially as I rate Steve Buscemi who has been undone excellent films
and productions.
