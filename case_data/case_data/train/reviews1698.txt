Pretentious and tedious

If you love long drawn-out scenes with no dialogue, trite characters,
and around an hour too long, then this is the film for you. The main character lives with a junkie mom, yet always appears bandbox
fresh?The main character, is habitually, and is known for speaking slowly, or
not at all! and with few words when he does. Slow doesn't begin to
cover the tediousness of this habit on screen. This is just one more message film beating one over the head... okay we
get it!Artistic? No way! Pretentious as hell.
