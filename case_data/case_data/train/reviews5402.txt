Body horror soap opera

After Thanatomorphose (2012) and Contracted (2013) another bad movie
where the main character slowly rotting or transform in something else
without foolishly even go to the ER. Apart from this the big problem
for me in "Bite" was the plot used to intersperse the body horror
scene. It was basically a damn boring soap opera. A pity because the
visual fx aren't so bad but the plot and lots of mistakes put this
movie in the bottom of my ratings, unfortunately i'm starting to accept
the idea that we will never have more masterpiece of body horror like
"The fly". 2/10.
