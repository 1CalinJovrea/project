1
Positively the most idiotic movie I've seen in decades.

1(awful).... Actually that is a KIND rating, but there's no option for
a negative rating so I went as low as I could. Simply stated, I went to
this film on the basis of its prequel which while not great, was
entertaining. This film is so STUPID and poorly written that I'm
frankly astonished that any of the "talent" hired to play the roles,
agreed to do it at all lest their resumes be thoroughly sullied. I've
walked out of 3 or 4 movies in my life. Tonight I added another. Don't
waste your time unless you enjoy AWFUL films and you're a cinematic
masochist. My time would have been better spent sorting socks.
