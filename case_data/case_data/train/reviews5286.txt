A fresh take on the iconic Superhero,

Jack Snyder's fresh take on Superman/Man of Steel is... fresh indeed. A
superhero movie that maxes visual wizardry but beautifully balanced by
emotional tones without feeling heavy. Gone is the sleek metal and
crystal polish we have known replaced by a techno- organic theme
(reminds me of Prometheus) that is both regal and advanced. This is
perhaps the only Superman film with the best narrative of the
Kryptonian's heritage and history. Good casting and an impressive
performance by Russell Crowe. I give it an 8.5/10 (just behind Dark
Knight Rises IMHO). The Dad in me deems this movie watchable by kids
(more age-appropriate, less violent than Iron Man 3)
