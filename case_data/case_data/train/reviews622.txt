One of the most impressive coming of age story I've ever seen

Been quite long since the last time I wrote something about anything,
but I guess this one deserves a bit more words than others.Every once in a while you might watch something that absorbed you
completely and got you thinking about it. Not because it's perfect but
because it touched you personally.A Monster Calls tells a story about a boy named Conor who has to cope
with his mom's illness while going through his adolescence. Sounds like
a typical coming-of-age story, but it's not. Bayona has created one of
a kind, exquisite, complex and profound story for all ages while at the
same time didn't forget to look gorgeous (I'd totally buy their
watercolor artworks) and well-acted. The most impressive part of the
movie for me wasn't the technicality but the emotion and imagination
involved while creating this.But at the end of the day, Bayona won me over simply by reminding us
all that sometimes it's when you hold something closest to you that
you're finally able to let it go.
