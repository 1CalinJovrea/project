So bad

The film is not bad based on its technical merits. The lighting,
effects, and acting are all fine and actually Johansson is fabulous in
the first part of the film. What makes this movie so terrible is that it's attempting to make a
sophisticated statement, but it can't even keep its own logic straight.
There is no conflict; Lucy is so powerful and devoid of empathy that
the film devolves into total nihilism. She just gun battles and goes on
car chases because she has only 24 hours to download her brain for the
sake of... who knows? Humanity? So let's rush, because without that all
is lost for... humanity? But Lucy doesn't give an f* about anyone else.What does a person beyond human logic act like? Since that's
impossible, I don't know, and apparently the director doesn't either.
Why does using more of her brain make her lose all capacity for empathy
or social logic? Don't know. It feels like the whole thing is just for the sake of itself. Her
powers and their progression are just not believable. Scene after scene
of gun violence without any moral lesson or conflict gets very boring.This movie could have made some sort of intelligent comment on human
morality, the origins and purpose of empathy.... nope, instead it makes
the comment that gun battles are cool.
