Embarrassing

I honestly do not know where to begin.. First of all, the first part of
the movie seemed to me like it was aimed at 14 year old's who have just
discovered masterbation, not that I can't appreciate the female form
but the way the camera flowed one of the female characters buttocks was
plain ridiculous and that top the main character was wearing was just
stupid, she needs to eat something. But that aside, the story line, dialogue, acting and execution was
utterly embarrassing. Now I am a huge fan of the TCM franchise, I even
enjoyed the re-make and 'the beginning' but I found it difficult to sit
through this movie, the line 'do your thing cuz' literally made me
cringe, leather face was a joke in this film, and the 3D was terrible
and pointless like with most 3D films.Words just cannot sum up how awful this film is, even the gore is sub
standard and not abundant. Simply put, this film should not exist and
everyone involved should be extremely ashamed of themselves. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been massacred by this abomination.- Townz
