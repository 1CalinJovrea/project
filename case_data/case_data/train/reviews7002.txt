This is awesome

I've never been a fan of the original Jungle Book movie, but I did grow
up watching it, and I did like it. This remake is (in my opinion)
Disney's best remake so far.The animation and the scenery is basically a new age in CGI. Not only
are there CGI characters and creatures now, but locations too. The
entire jungle looks absolutely real, yet it's not, and that's the great
thing about it.The characters themselves were pretty cool. I didn't care for Mowgli in
the original movie, but this movie got me liking him. He's brave, not
as bratty, and he's pretty inventive. Bagheera is as stern and careful
as ever except that he's also got the action his book counterpart had
had. And I like Baloo's character here, having a bit more of a
self-serving trait his older counterparts never had but eventually
becoming a nice guy. And that's the main characters. The wolves got
more screen time, Kaa got a lot more dangerous (though she doesn't have
as much screen time, which is my only complaint in this movie), King
Louie is more sinister and less comical, and Shere Khan is a flat-out
beast.I'm also glad that they brought back three songs I enjoyed as a kid. I
really liked Bare Necessities, and I've also started singing this
version of I Wanna Be Like You. Trust In Me made me feel like Kaa was
in a spy movie.So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect score: 10/10. It's
an epic movie, and I highly recommend seeing this movie.
