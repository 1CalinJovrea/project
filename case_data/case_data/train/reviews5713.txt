The best movie this year so far!

Mr. Ron Howard is a great story teller, this movie is about human
nature, love and tears.It is difficult to make a good movie about car racing, especially to
make one for the time period from 1970 to 1976. I don't know how they
did it to bring those old F1 cars back to life. You will feel like you
are really there watching the racing, it's really unbelievable.It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role
for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a
talented and devoted actor. Daniel Br√ºhl also did a great job on
portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good
soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced. Rush
is that good meal, it's a fun ride!I have to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Thank you Mr. Ron
Howard for making this masterpiece.
