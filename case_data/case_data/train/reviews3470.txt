Superhero-movie without the edge

Another of the Avenger heroes makes an appearance. Having seen the
other Avenger movies I knew pretty much what to expect. A movie full of
action mixed up with a humorous dialog and some classic comedy. And
Ant-man was just that. A funny action packed spectacle. However, it
doesn't really rise to the level of the other Avenger movies. I don't
know what does it, it might be Ant-man's hero ability that is more
comedy than action. Or the constant size-zapping that make most action
scenes fragmented. Or that Ant-man's ability is not consistent within
the movie. Oh, I know and have no problem with that the movie is
unrealistic, it is in the genre. But that the Ant-man one moment is
heavy enough to dent a car's roof but not the ants he is sitting on. A
movie need to be true to itself.Well, it is fun. It is action packed. Paul Rudd does it well in a role
unusual to him. But it is not at the level of the other movies that it
is inevitably compared to.
