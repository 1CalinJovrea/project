A nicely executed movie, very Japanese, good mythology

My wife and I saw this movie panned by critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and
the only conclusion we came to is they just were not sensitive to the
culture of Japanese mythology. The movie was excellent. We had been
dying to see it since the first announcements, and despite the critics
reviews, we went. Thank goodness we did.The special effects were good, the story was good. Keanu Reeves did not
come off as Bwana, the white savior of the poor little Japanese people,
as some people might think, as per the usual American movies. He did
stand out, but it was well shared with the Japanese actors. The story itself is not American, and I believe that may have thrown
off critics. The ending is unusual, though I will not spoil it for you.I recommend this movie highly. Should you have the itch as we did, see
it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
