Disappointing neo-noir from Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy

THE COUNSELOR (2013) * Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz,
Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Bruno Ganz, Rosie Perez, Ruben Blades, Goran
Visnjic, Dean Norris, (uncredited: John Leguizamo) Disappointing
neo-noir from Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy (his first - and should
be his last - original screenplay) which makes not-a-lick-of-sense
about titular Fassbender (surprisingly wooden) who finds himself in
over his head in a drug deal gone awry involving mysterious cowboy
middleman PItt (far-too-sedate here), an obnoxious nightclub owner
(Bardem relying on wild-hair and rock star accouterments instead of
'acting), and a drug cartel out for bloody vengeance. The cardinal sin
of this potboiler is the first leaden hour cannot compensate for its
too-quick-to-kill final one and wasting Cruz completely. While Diaz is
the film's saving grace as a femme fatale with a feline complex nothing
else is worthy or remarkable except how much of a dud this truly is.
