could have been a great film

what a shame this could have been such a good film not bad acting by
Stallone but its the story line that lets this film down how it has got
a 8/10 is beyond belief only has 4 fights and is the world champion no
big build up the one guy who knocks him out does not reappear to fight
him so no revenge the make up on the eye of the last fight was terrible
the original make up was bad but i thought 2016 but no not even a
little bit believable its was not bad acting that spoiled the film just
a bad story line the fact that Stallone has cancer should have been a
bigger storyline in ie just living long enough to see him win or his
deaf girlfriend signing him to get up after being knocked down but none
of this they could have had the ghost of apollo shadow boxing with him
in the ring anything but this such a waste of a film that could have
been so much better
