Awful

This remake was very disappointing, and highlights how you cannot mend
something that isn't broken. The original movie was fast paced,
character orientated with a style and mood unique to that movie. It
managed to capture Carrie's isolation, her fear and shyness, her
tentative reaching out for normality. This was a fiasco of poorly
paced, poorly characterised, vacuous and grossly miscast mish mash of
baloney.For starters, the casting was dire. We have Carrie, a beautiful pouting
nubile girl who no red blooded male in his right mind is going avoid
like the plague. Her mother, slightly loopy but not enough to make us
fear for Carrie's life. The evil Chris, who has about as much character
and charisma as a plate of cold fries.... need I go on? Each character
was just a pale ghost of the original, and nurtured not one ounce of
sympathy or connection from the viewer. The final denouement, which had a hell of a lot to live up to, was
disappointing in the extreme and barely worth watching. I felt cheated
after seeing this movie. But I can only blame myself for even going
there. The original is a masterpiece of film making - a classic that
cannot be bettered. Leave it alone.
