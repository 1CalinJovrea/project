9
Almost perfect....

Hiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother
sets him on a right track. Tragedy strikes, and Hiro teams up with new
friends to find the truth...eventually saving the day.Baymax is a robotic healthcare assistant that could have been developed
as the usual annoying sidekick that has the heart of gold, but he just
has a heart of gold here--as in doing research, his only intention is
to help whomever he can.On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and
soul outweigh the problems I have with it. Some scenes might be
upsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.My issues:1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2. The villain's
identity and motive feel tacked on.I know the primary audience is not going to notice things like this,
but I do...and I this happens to be one of those times that I cannot
let it go.
