Well made, but left me cold

This was certainly an amazing looking film, and knowing it was all
computer generated is almost worrisome--computers are capable of so
much now, practical effects are becoming endangered. The story was very
familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my
childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I
don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of
the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between
the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much
prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care
about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and
uninspired. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't feel that I would ever
want to watch it again.
