Brutal, meditative, and smart. The surprise of the year.

I write this as a Mexican living near the border, meaning, as a direct
witness of the drug war. I loved Heli, and I loved the Counsellor, this
is why.I went to the cinema to see "The Counselor" expecting to watch a crime
movie almost as entertaining as the old school Scorcece. It ended up
being a fantastic and sublime meditation about the process of
dehumanization that drug trafficking detonates (I'm using the word
'sublime' here in its Kantian definition: Any phenomena that surpasses
our imagination and make us watch in anguish or awe). Fantastic
dialogs, which although unlikely because we will never find lawyers and
killers as poetic as the ones depicted on this movie (Cormac McCarthy,
after all, is a great writer) summarize and propose precise reflections
on how little we really understand about the violence and brutality of
drug trafficking. It's not cryptic dialogs as some suggest, you just
have to pay close attention to the details.Adding that the violence displayed in the film is unbelievably cruel
considering that this is a AAA movie ( big budget, great director,
big-name casting, famous writer, etc), this become the most pleasant
surprise I've watched this year. And the most politically incorrect:
You never submit a AAA's audience to this kind of dialog and cruelty,
yet Scott risk it, with great results.I do not recommend it as a film that intents to be realistic. Scott
never wanted to do that. The intention of this film is to be a poetic
articulation of the distance between humanity and inhumanity and the
process that transforms one into the other.10/10 The movie of the year for me.I don't care the critics are destroying it. This is one of those moves
that will make me seem like a hipster (Maybe I am one): People are
simply not getting it.
