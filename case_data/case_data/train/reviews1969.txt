The New Jason Bourne?

If it is a hit, it could be the new Jason Bourne. As both Bourne and
the main character, Mitch Rapp played by rising star, Teen Wolf's Dylan
O'Brien there.As his fianc√©e that he planned to marry and just propose to was killed
in a vacation trip, eighteen months as he is seriously kicking rear.
Taking martial arts, any kind of guns, as well as languages.At first, he goes on the mission rogue by himself. But he is then
recruited to the CIA and goes by a rough edged ex-Navy Seal turned CIA
Cold War Operative Stan Hurley played with wit and toughness by Michael
Keaton. As he and Hurley form a father-son and love-hate relationship bond.
Both are in way over their heads along with a female operative named
Annika in trying to find a US Navy Seal that has a personal history
with Hurley. Going only by the name "Ghost."As nuke plutonium is a threat to the world and national security, the
team is trying to either bring to justice or kill the main antagonist
"Ghost" along with stopping the shipment of plutonium from killing half
or all or the world's population. By targeting Navy ship of fleets over
it.Action packed non stop. As Dylan O'Brien has a lot of charisma as well
as lots of potential for the big screen. Keaton steals every scene as
the jaded with wit ex-Navy SEAL who has seen it all and done it all. Think it is the new Jason Bourne and can't wait for more sequels to
possibly be made.
