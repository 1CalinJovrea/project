Predictable and so much fun

The franchise did lose a bit of steam in between, but the last 2
installments were great.Yes, predictable story, but you don't go to watch the movie for the
story.You go for the stunts and if you thing 7 was good, wait till you see
this, equally good if not better.Smart one liners, A M A Z I N G stunts, great photography or rather
camera angles, you know what to expect and it delivers!Great fun, really great fun, wont say throughout but the last 30
minutes are amazing. This will not disappoint the franchise fan, that is for sure.Okay this is a Vin Diesel movie, so the Rock and Statham takes a back
seat but all is well, Theron plays a mean baddie, could have been a
little more defined, nice cameo by Kurt Rusell, all in all bottom line
is, you will like the movie if you know what to expect.
