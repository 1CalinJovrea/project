We're all glad this creep fest lost money.

This movie is worse than awful. Not only is it boring, it's also
unwatchable. Wilson creeps you out the entire time; his character is
more like a yawn than a human. His partner, whats his face, is also a
bore. Do these guys have a range beyond this, their typical movie
persona? Everything in this movie is predictable. The troubles and
successes, the bad guys, the good guys... The only thing I didn't
expect is how much the main characters in the film would creep me out,
the ones on Wilson's and what's his face's team, the actors themselves
actually made me feel uncomfortable. Quite unnatural performances from
weirdos that never be cast in anything. Ever. Ferrel also fails
miserably in this. You can actually tell he doesn't give a crap. All in
all I stopped using Google. Thanks for the 2 hour long commercial, D
bags. It's clear that the scenes with all the titties were added late
in production... "Hey guys, this movies blows... we better add a lot of
tits." I'm all for mammary glands but those scenes seem SO out of
place. I strongly suggest avoiding this excrement. This movie should
not be paid for... for any reason.
