Typical Ma'Dea

This is a typical Tyler Perry movie. Either you like it or you don't.
His main focus is to entertain. To make you laugh and if he can slide
in a life lesson or some "Ma'Dea" wisdom on the way, then so be it.Tyler Perry doesn't let you down with his many roles as Ma'Dea, Joe and
Brian. Brian is in over his head with raising Tiffany as a single
parent and when he tries to forbid her from going to a college
fraternity's Halloween party, all hell breaks loose.Trying to win the approval of her friends, 17-year-old Tiffany sneaks
out of the house to go to a Halloween bash at a fraternity anyway. The
fun soon ends when police and the cranky, fast-talking Ma'Dea (Tyler
Perry) arrive to crash the party. Unhappy with this sudden turn of
events, the vengeful collegians decide to scare Ma'Dea and her cronies
with a series of pranks. She soon finds herself under attack and on the
run from an assortment of ghosts, ghouls and zombies on the scariest
night of the year.If you want a good laugh this is your movie, but don't read too much
into it as far as meaning, its pure entertainment.
