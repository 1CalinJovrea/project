One of the worst films I've seen recently

RZA's film has some amount of imagination,but, simply put, he has no
idea how to build, pace, or tell a story. He has made the unfortunate
mistake of imitating a genre he loves without understanding what makes
it work. The dialogue is half nonsensical exposition, half nauseating
one-liners. Lots of clumsy penis and vagina jokes. The plot is so diffuse...there is not enough time given to any
character for them to be read as an actual character. The film fails in
tying together any of these frayed threads and also fails to make what
happens in any of them significant or sensible. For example there is a
"betrayal" plot which happens in the first two minutes of the film,
when there is no context to make that betrayal meaningful, make the
traitor seem particularly villainous, etc. The acting is very broad and
simplistic, which I guess is to be expected given the things RZA
expects them to say. He doesn't seem to understand that all of these
things, the characters, dialogue, plot points, etc. are pointless
without a proper context.Some people might be inclined to tell me it's the "point" of the movie
to not have a story, to be a loose framework on which a series of fight
scenes are hung. I'd first suggest that that is not a meaningful effort
to make. But even as a visual spectacle or stylistic effort, it doesn't
do very well. All of the fights are basically the same knife/sword
play... none of the characters really have a specific fighting style,
and the CGI gore lopped onto the fights is excessive and silly. The
music cues are embarrassingly overdone...any time the film wants you to
feel an emotion, the sappiest orchestral music instantly kicks in, to
the beat of a hip hop song.I think it's possible that RZA could make a good film someday, but this
certainly isn't it.
