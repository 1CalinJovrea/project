Fantastic Movie

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. Where most movies
nowadays rely on special effects and unrealistic action and superhero
powers to capture the viewers, this movie is built on real danger to an
innocent family. Having two daughters of my own around the same age as
the kids in this film, I found myself profoundly connected to the
fathers dilemma throughout. But even if you don't have kids, if you're
human you will feel the danger and emotion in this film.This is Owen Wilson's crowning jewel of films, he was perfect in the
role of protective father. The kids and wife were fantastic actresses
as well. The entire story, though far fetched, was absolutely
believable and horrifying. If you want a few hours of action packed
drama, this is a great choice. I cannot say enough about the film. No
flaws and excellent story telling through film. Don't believe the
critics. 10/10.
