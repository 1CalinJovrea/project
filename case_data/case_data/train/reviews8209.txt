Hard to sit through, horrible ending

The beginning is rather promising as we are introduced to a sex
deprived couple in need of rekindling their marriage. The problem here
is the first 20 minutes already tell the story, leaving you to sit
through boring memories/drama of the handcuffed woman's life.People are saying the Stephen King book on this was great and i can not
doubt it as i have not read it, but what i see is people being
incredibly biased to Stephen King novel movie adaptations, the fans
still give great ratings to this film, even though it is absolute crap,
i hate to see that. The movie feels boring for most of the screen time
as you simply can not get excited about what is going to happen next,
because we kind of know that nothing is about to happen, because of the
setting. But if the movie itself felt boring and stupid to you, wait
till the ending, i am absolutely shocked about the way this film ended.
This has got to be one of the stupidest and worst ideas in the history
of film making, the ending is absolutely horrible beyond belief.Definitely something we all will forget, absolutely nothing clever,
funny or extra ordinary about this film. They tried making the woman
absolutely delusional to pass the time obviously, if she was just
sitting there the whole time it would not even last 20 minutes, would
it? But that was also a massive flop, since the delusions were simply
not engaging enough for you to care about the plot or the outcome of
this film. Completed with a laughably dire ending this movie is a joke
and definitely not worth your time!
