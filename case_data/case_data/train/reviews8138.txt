As an action packed movie, great. As a movie adaption, horrible.

If you've read the series and love it, please do yourself a favor and
don't watch this movie. This movie has taken the book that you love and
change it into a mainstream zombie survival movie.When I first watch The Maze Runner, I really like it because even
though they did change some stuff, they're at least stick to the
storyline and have most of the plot.So when I heard that The Scorch Trial movie just comes out, I expect it
to be as great, or even better than than the first movie. Which turns
out to be a great disappointment and makes me leave the cinema feeling
angry and disappointed.They really change the storyline and twisted the plot. For a starter,
The Scorch Trial supposed to be another trial from WICKED. And they
change it into an escape with WICKED hunts them and try to get them to
get back to WICKED which is supposed to be the part of The Death Cure.Seriously, what's happen to the silvery liquid who eats people head and
turn it into a ball, an epic journey across the scorch and the betrayal
scenario?We understand that it's kind of hard to make a movie that is exactly
like the book, but if you're going to make a movie adaptation from a
book, at least follow the book plot. You can't make your own storyline
and expect the book fandom to be happy with it.
