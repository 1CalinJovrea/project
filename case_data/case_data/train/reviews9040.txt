Lighthearted

I enjoyed the movie. Some people are writing reviews longer than the
movie. It was fun and lighthearted. If you want a break from reality
with out explosions this fits the bill.The kids were interesting. I think the writer or director missed a
great opportunity for the boys to be taken more seriously. Certainly
plenty of opportunity to have a black character but none taken.
