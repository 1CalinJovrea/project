Not good but still better than first one

This movie has assigns from the first part. Still movie has it
differences about the doll and the demons. I would give a better grade
if the movie was more realistic and its confusing should be more by the
doll. Movie has a perfect ending and that's why i gave the better grade
plus 2. My opinion is as well 6.1 out of 10 I would say this movie is
for teenagers from 15 years old
