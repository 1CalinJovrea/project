Fell Short of the Goal

This movie might be worth the rental and then it is just something to
toss at your kids about 6 to 8 years old. The first movie was hit with
both young and old but this movie is just clich√© filled with tropes and
idioms. Unlike the first story this one lacks humor.The writers completely lose sight of the good characters from the first
movie such as; Vector, Dr. Nefario, and even Gru's Mom. They bring in a
new villain who leaves a dry taste in your mouth. The only thing
original and funny about him was his premature demise. Instead the
comedy falls on the shoulders of his minions. The plot is far too
predictable for any adult. The moral of the tale? Apparently single parents are just no good at
raising children.
