Vin Diesel-please retire

I don't know what was worse. The writing, the acting or the bad CGI.This should be a stunt man/woman and fans wet dream. Extreme sports,
meets action film.I just kept hoping Tom Cruise would show up to save us viewers from
this bad cartoon of a film. Sadly that didn't happen.Gorgeous cast. Ruby Rose and Deepika Padukone stole the show as far as
I'm concerned, but don't go see this film just to see them. Even if you
are a hardcore fan. I'm a big time fan of Donnie Yen and even though he
was his usual great self, it didn't stop the pain and agony this film
caused my senses. At least with a comic book film you already suspend belief. Even for
human characters that have no superpowers what-so-ever. You still
understand there will be outrageous stunts and CGI. I can't grasp why
Vin Diesel does films like this. He doesn't do his own stunts the way
that Tom Cruise does and Diesel looks over the hill.This film did the right thing by hiring actors like UFC champion
Michael "The Count" Bisping and Tony Jaa who can actually fight, but
sadly drowned them in poor writing and special effects. I wouldn't watch this again if it was forced on me at gun point. Avoid
at ALL COST!
