Slow Boring and Beyond Dull - Terrible Script -

This has to be one of the worst of Steven's movies. The script and
directing was horrible. The characters and pace of the movie was so
slow and highly unrealistic that many people just walked out of the
theatre.There is not really a lot of comedy or smart set ups like Ocean 11
movies and instead it is a meandering of endless short set ups by idiot
red necks that at first you think just perhaps there is some back story
that convinces us that they are really sharp like in Ocean 11 - but
they are not and it just gets tiresome and the directing is amateurish
with no style whatsoever and silly characters that do not add up to any
clever thriller or comedy.It is shocking to see 90% on Rotten Tomatoes or even a 7 on here. The
end has little punch and you're so exhausted and bored out of your mind
even with great actors but the pay off is unrealistic and you no longer
care except to want to slap the writer and director for even making the
stupid movie and wasting the great actors. I give it a 4 only because of the actors performances even with a lame
script. And please do not use Channing ever again. He is dull as paint
