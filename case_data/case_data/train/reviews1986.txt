A unique and decidedly dark sci-fi film

"Predestination" is an incredibly original and creative film, employing
what may seem like 'common' aspects of the science-fiction genre, and
putting a darker, grimmer twist on them. Time travel is handled quite
well in this Australian film, focusing less on the effects of
travelling back (and forth) in time than other sci-fi films.
"Predestination" uses decidedly odd pacing, beginning with a 'bang' and
following that up with almost an hour of subdued plot. But oddly
enough, these moments of -almost- pure dialogue and occasional
flashbacks never become boring, but rather deepen the film's characters
and their back-stories. The cast performances are what really make this
movie 'shine'. Ethan Hawke, as usual, delivers an almost flawless
performance as the unnamed lead, and Sarah Snook, an Australian
newcomer, surprises with her wide range of acting abilities. Overall,
the third feature film by the Spierig Brothers is a surprisingly
original, daring, and genre-bending film.
