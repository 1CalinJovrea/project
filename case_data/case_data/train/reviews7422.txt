Annoyingly quirky and pretentious

I just can't fathom why this movie is getting such good reviews. Most
likely the first and last Wes Anderson movie I'm seeing. There's
nothing genuine or charming in this film. There's just this forced
intentional quirkiness to this film that I can't stand. It just tries
too hard to be quirky and cute and ends up feeling pretentious. The
line between quirky and annoying can be very thin indeed and for me
this movie crossed it by a mile.The film is partly categorized as a comedy but I didn't even get a
slight chuckle during the entire film. Was I supposed to? Everything's
delivered deadpan and I didn't buy the dialogue between Sam and Suzy at
all. Deadpan humor is good and all but you can't have everyone doing it
for the whole movie. Also, I didn't like this whole idea of kids
delivering adult dialogue and ended up disliking the protagonists a
lot. They didn't feel like kids in the slightest so how is this whole
first love between kids angle going to work here then? They're just
flat and emotionally detached. All of the characters are essentially
missing a human core.I also didn't buy the love story between Sam and Suzy and that makes
everything else pointless. I'm supposed to think they're in love but it
didn't even seem like they liked each other. Didn't care for the rest
of the characters either despite there being some serious talent behind
them. If there had been at least one or two there who I liked somewhat
I wouldn't give this one star. Visually it was kind of interesting but
without a good story and characters, what does it matter?
