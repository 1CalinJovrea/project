I don't ever review movies, but I had to tell someone how bad....

The internship was the most patronizingly painful film I have ever
seen. Google's brand is in the toilet. The cast can never live this
terrible film down. I was embarrassed for them. The infantile script,
with it's ceaseless metaphoric overdose, the bogus team tension and the
constant philosophizing brings up bile. Then, just when I thought the
plot less, pointless, plebeian picture could not dredge any deeper the
depths of clich√©, we indulged in a bit of sexual self realization with
a team night out at a stripper club for some lap dancing to get the
teamwork and the creative juices flowing! Now I feel like I was so
terribly insulted by this writer. I'm sure that, now that I have walked
out on this film that Owen will get his girl, we'll all come to our
senses and the sweet, sincere music of mood will remind us to sow our
oats every time we need to be creative.
