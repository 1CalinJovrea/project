Best movie of LFF this year

Critics have compared this movie to The Night of the Hunter, which
makes sense, because of the scary reverend and it quotes some of the
same biblical texts, but to me this movie felt much more like a mix
between Cormac McCarthy's 'Blood Meridian', Garth Ennis' Preacher and
Jodorowsky's El Topo, yet in a completely original way. While these
three stories are very muscular, Brimstone's leading characters are
female and the film even has a feminist message. Because stories like
the ones mentioned before are violent, some people will have a problem
with this. But in the end, Brimstone seems to show the world as it
probably was and maybe even still is in some parts. Impressive writing,
acting and film making skills.
