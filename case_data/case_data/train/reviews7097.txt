Surprisingly boring and cold

We went to the theater expecting interesting but sad biopic of an
enigmatic woman. Well... my husband and at least a couple of other men
in the theater fell asleep, at least when the noisy and creepy score
did not keep them awake. It is difficult to tell what explains the
discrepancy of the overall positive reviews and our clearly
disappointing experience. We felt that the reason why the story was
told was not clear to the writers and director. It is difficult to
understand how the movie was so boring when everything you read about
the Kennedys is interesting. Natalie Portman really tried to be
convincing but the acting was forced and you could smell the hours of
training. The accent of Jackie Kennedy was really weird even though it
tried to resemble the original way of her talking. I overheard one
couple discussing when we walked back to the parking lot:" It was
rather static. - Yes, and psychotic." I am not sure if they understood
the meaning of the words but weirdly it made sense. Overall the
photography and costumes were beautiful and all other actors were
convincing. In conclusion, the lack of connection with the viewers was
evident despite the overall high quality.
