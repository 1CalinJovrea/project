Masterful on its own merits, respectful to its predecessor.

T2 is all you could hope a sequel can be. Independent and respectful to
its predecessor while standing on its own merits as a great movie, art
even, powerful maybe. 20 years on things have changed,mostly. It's
funny,sad and mature above all else. Boyles directing is complemented
with a great script and beautiful cinematography. On to the important
aspects, the film plays cleverly With nostalgia without depending on
it,giving the audience of the 1996 cult classic something to savor,
while also standing independently as an entertaining and even inventive
film. Performances are a solid as you'd expect, Robert Carlyle returns
in a fantastic albeit expected performance as begbie. The film
introduces the advancement in technology over the intervening years
with inventive and clever special effects, however the original also
boasted some amazing trick of the lens. Finally upon leaving the cinema
one gets a feeling of bittersweet and sorrowful fulfillment, the
characters we've come to know over the last 20 years hive us nearly two
hours of nostalgia packed entertainment, yet one can't help but long
for its energetic,frenetic and classic predecessor, no matter how good
its sequel is, and it is.
