Wait, This Movie Had  A Great Rating

I thought this movie was mediocre at best. I laughed out loud a few
times--as did the rest of the audience, but other than that I found it
boring and actually nodded off twice. One of the girls sitting in front
of me stated, "well it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't that good
either", which I thought summed it up pretty well. The biggest shock
was that it had a 7.9 IMDb rating which normally indicates a
potentially "great" movie in any category--especially a comedy.
(anything above a 7 tends to consistently be what I consider a GOOD
movie).I give it a 5.5 or maybe 6. THere were several other movies in
the same theater with lower IMDb ratings that, in retrospect, I wished
I had spent my time and money on.
