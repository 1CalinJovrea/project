Trio con Brio

Like most people who going to movies on a regular basis I'm familiar
with the original Three Stooges if only from the 'Saturday Morning'
kids programmes of my childhood. They were recycling Three Stooges
shorts made years earlier and they were reasonably funny as far as
slapstick goes. The movie seems to be a faithful and loving recreation
of the group. The lookalikes are not going to fool any real aficianados
but they ARE lookalikes as well as behavealikes so that the
idiosyncrasies of all three are captured faithfully. You don't, of
course, expect much in the way of plot but perversely the producers
have thrown one in which sees the trio attempting to raise, against
ridiculous not to say astronomical odds, $300,000 to save the orphanage
in which they were raised. What can I tell you, they perform their
schtick; if you're susceptibly you'll laugh; if not, you've wasted
ninety minutes.
