Don't read too many reviews - experience it for yourself.

By now you know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash.What you have here is the anti-Sully Sullenberg. Denzel is incredible
as the best pilot you don't want flying your plane, or do you?????
Tough questions and tough decisions as Denzel deals with, or doesn't
deal with, the aftermath. You pull for him every step of the way, but
the problem is which way do you pull? The visuals are very good,
gripping, scary. I felt like I was hit hard in the chest while watching
the plane.Make sure the little kiddies stay home, but you need to see this movie.
I hope the Academy hands Denzel the Oscar.
