mixed feelings

Jacques Audiard's films are always so frustrating for me. They are
always marred by the violent male protagonists and his love of
violence. The lead character loves his son, yes, but he's a horrible
father and should not have custody of him. I kept wishing he would be
arrested for his various crimes and put in jail. The extreme fighting
scenes were unnecessary - he could have the same basic problems without
the extreme violence.Marion Cotillard gives a really interesting performance but I can't say
I "liked" her. I found the special effects surrounding her missing legs
very distracting. She was very contradictory.It will be interesting to see on Thursday if the academy nominates 2
french actresses - I vastly prefer Emmanuelle Riva and if only one gets
a nomination I hope it will be her. They should both get Cesar
nominations; they are both Prix Lumiere nominees already.
