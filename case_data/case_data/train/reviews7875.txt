Awful

In a word, horrible. The film has a predictable action, evil gets it,
everything ends well and Mark Wahlberg something stronger than Chuck
Norris.Who wrote the script i do not think has more than 12 years, like when
the police get to the captain house,arrested him and the two criminals
when captain could simply say "No sir,everything is OK" or criminals
could threaten him to keep quiet. Or Biggs which goes every 10 minutes
and threatened his wife Faradday. Everything seems so hair pulled and
fake.I think it's the worst film I've seen of Kate Beckinsale,i don't
understand how could she accept to play in such a miserable,2 penny,
movie.
