Absolutely hated it

I can't believe why people like this movie unless you're a fan of
no-brainer action-packed movies without a story. 2 hours of non stop
rubbish without dialogue. I was a fan of the original Mad Max and at
first Tom Hardy seemed like a great actor for the role, but this movie
didn't do him justice. He did well as Bane but he wasn't the star in
this movie, almost like a support character. I almost fell asleep and
left the theater because I can find better ways to waste my time. The
only positive thing I can say is that the world looks great as well as
the props. Good job on that George Miller. At least there's something
good about it. The trailer was promising and since many people praised
this movie, I gave it a shot. How can you watch this for a second time
"to indulge in the deep content and story it provides". There was
absolutely nothing in there. Yes beautiful woman, owned by a dictator
who holds all the water and controls the people. Let's escape, make a
diversion, trap him, beat the living hell out of him and return to be
happily accepted as the new rulers. Hurray.
