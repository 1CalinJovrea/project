Worst Film Ever

This really is the worst film ever! i love horror films, and this film
had no storyline to it what so ever, it was so disjointed i couldn't
believe it! i would have had more fun watching a Disney film than this,
no wonder it never made it into the cinema! It starts with one
storyline if you can call it that, then goes to another story, then
another, its all done through a cam, so very shaky and half of the
story lines don't make sense anyway, its utter rubbish, don't waste
your time, their are far better horror films with an actual storyline
out there to watch this is just a wast of a few hours out of your life.
I don't normally write reviews but i felt so strongly about how bad
this was that i had to do this review
