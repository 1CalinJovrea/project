After seeing the first half I knew it was a complete waste of time and
money. Seeing a bunch of 8 graders playing war games and given powers
to destroy planets was so retarded. Let's choose a kid as the prime
minister and another one as the army leader. Why not, is so plausible,
right? It's absolutely stupid to believe that some kids that play video
games are capable of fighting an alien race by themselves and win !!!!!
I can't express my feelings towards this "movie" that, besides good
computer generated special effects is a big zero for plot, action,
acting, directing...total fiasco !!! Can't understand where the 7.1
comes from ?
