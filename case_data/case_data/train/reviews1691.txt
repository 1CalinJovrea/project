Flawed Adaptation

I refrained from reviewing this movie until it was possible to view the
BBC TV version made in the late 70s. While that series consists of 5
parts lasting over 4 hours it is not simply length that makes it far
superior. The BBC version is never mawkishly sentimental or histrionic
as this Hollywood version is. My first reaction to Vera, in the
Hollywood version, is that she is petulant in a way not that is not
befitting to her character. After all, this is a well brought up girl,
living in England, in the early 20th Century. Strong opinions are one
thing but temper tantrums are quite another. There are also a lot more
tears shed in the movie than in the TV series. Not that there aren't
enough tragic events to warrant tears but, sometimes, less is more -
and this is one of them.Apart from the above there are factual differences between the movie
and the TV series. Does she speak German, or not? Does her father
thrust an unwanted piano upon her or not? How does her mother take the
pressures of the tragedies? All of these things are presented
differently in the movie and the TV series. Also, though I will not
explain how, the endings are quite different.One could hardly believe both of these were adaptations of the same
book. And which do you believe is more accurate? No, even though this
movie can be enjoyed as a melodrama it really does not deserve even to
share the same title as the book.
