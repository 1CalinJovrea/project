Amazing! a Contemporary masterpiece!

I saw "Demolition" without much hope (after a quick view to his
trailer) I though that it will be one more Hollywood-drama for the
collection, one more for those of "spent your time"... Wrong!Demolition is a great and awesome movie, with actors in state of grace,
a great and atypical script, that create a great "Non-love" history
that have a lot of emotion and sense like the best "Love history" and a
beautiful fable of destroy everything than don't matters, accepting
oneself disasters, to bring something beautiful and brand new.You feel a lot of empathy and shame for his characters, Jake and Naomi
are just dazzling making this crazy and taciturn roles. Good
soundtrack, good history... A great discovery! Do yourself a favor and
see it!
