I understand why Daniel Craig doesn't want to do another Bond.

This is one of the worst Bond films. There was some good cinematography
and an all star cast, but just God awful plot and story telling. I
don't recommend seeing it.I like all of Craig's Bond films, except this one. Actually, Craig is
my favorite Bond actor. In the previous Craig films, they did a good
job of using ancillary characters like M, Q and Moneypenny to augment
his character so that that his missions seemed logically paced and not
solely center on his prowess alone. They deviated from the traditional
Bond by allowing him to have Blonde hair, who had a an experience worn
face and body that did break down from wear and tear, who was detail
oriented and mission driven. While this film still tried to keep to it's current trend, it reverted
back to just stupid unrealistic scenes, like Bond shooting SMG's with
one hand from 200 yards out and saying clever one liners like "You're
bluffing," I lost track of how many helicopters were used in this film.
How many times was bond apprehended and somehow able to break his
'bonds' from his captors and escape the villain's carefully planned
exotic methods of execution? And it was 2.5 hours long; plus the
editing made no sense of how they got from point A to point B. They
could've at least had the villains die in extreme and weird ways, but
no, a total let down even on that point. This is a first time I've written a review and encouraged the audience
members not to see this film. It reminds me the Die Another Day film
with Pierce Bronson which was terrible, but they squeezed it in because
he only had one film left on his contract. Forgivable, Yes, but I hope
the producers have something better for the next Bond film seeing as
they are pacing these releases 2.5 years apart, which a tight deadline.
