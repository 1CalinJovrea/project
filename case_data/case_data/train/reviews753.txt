Hansel, Gretel And  A Load Of Bulls **t!!!

There are popcorn movies and there are crap movies. Unfortunately
"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters" belongs to the latter category.
Loosely based on the popular Brothers Grimm fairytale, this movie is an
exercise in cheesiness, kitch and just overall suckiness! The only two
valid reasons for seeing this dung heap, at least they were to me, were
Famke Janssen and Gemma Arterton....and that's it I got nothing else!
Going in I thought this will be one of those early new-year releases
which movie studios always dump quickly and without great fanfare...its
almost like an embarrassment dump slash quick cash grab...but "Hansel &
Gretel: Witch Hunters" is too slimy and its stench to powerful for
something like that! And boy, does it stink!!! One of the crummier
movies I've seen in a while and more wasted time than I would have
cared to! I would advise people to stay away from this stinker but if
you must see it, then make it about, as I said, Famke Janssen and Gemma
Arterton...and pretend the rest doesn't exist!
