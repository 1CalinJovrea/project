moving, if you can relate to it

hey I loved this movie. If a movie stirs my emotions to a point where
my body can't control itself, cry, laughter, anger etc, then in my mind
it's done it's job. Movies are escapism. If you don't feel like you've
been transported into the movie, then you're just not into it.As a father I relate to this movie, the sacrifice the father makes for
his talented daughter.. It well and truly stirred my emotions. It's a
10 in my book. The concept might appear cheesy to some, but it was up
my ally. If you're a romantic at heart, you will enjoy this flick. If you don't
want to embrace being taken on a journey of what it might be like in he
next world, then go check out something else.
