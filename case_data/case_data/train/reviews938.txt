Little more than a mix tape with dull characters and clichés attached to it

I read an early tweet that described Baby Driver as 'a mix-tape with a
film attached to it' and that proved to be an accurate comment. The
tweeter may have thought this was a good thing, but I certainly don't.Yes, there are some good tracks and the action sequences are elaborate
and frenetic (a little too frenetic, actually), but the characters are
dull, unlikeable and bear very little relation to the real world. I
simply did not believe in them, especially Darling, the sassy, kick ass
stock character that only a fool would consider to be a strong female
character.Then there's Baby, whose laconic, boyish demeanour makes him a rather
uninspiring protagonist. His romance with Debbie, a cute little
waitress, is yawn-inducingly clichéd, too.If you want a stylish heist film that isn't so bloody try-hard, then
watch Drive. It's an exercise of style over substance much like this
film, but it has suspense, atmosphere and characters that could
actually exist rather than blaring music, mind-numbing action and flat,
hateful comic book characters.
