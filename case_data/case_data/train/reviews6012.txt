Great Shame.

Gosh what the hell is going on with this movie?.It ain't worth watching!."Straight Outta Compton" portrays the life of ruthless beggars who
abruptly rose to fame as a result of their infamous vulgarity.Everything is boring and disgusting about this bad and violent movie.The music really sucked and the acting was artificial.The few enjoyable things that lustful adults could temporarily enjoy
are the naked prostitutes and the blow job scene.I think this ain't a musical biography but rather a story of evil men
who enjoy pornography and who fantasize about committing every kind of
sin.REALLY IT IS A GREAT SHAME!.
