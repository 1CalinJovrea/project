Or not, but sometimes it's about promoting and other stuff rather than
being first. It's also about perception and about marketing. And about
going for it as hard as you can. And the saying is, that history will
only remember winners. On the other hand, movies have proved that there
is a place for "losers" too.Now the movie itself is not so much about McDonalds itself as you may
think. It's more about how it spread all over America. And all the
obstacles it had to pass to come to that point. And with Michael Keaton
you do have a star/actor who can carry this role. A very difficult one
to pull off. Because he has to make it believable that he is pushing
and never letting go off his dream. Even though even he has doubts of
course.There is a fine line between liking a character and seeing their flaws
as unforgivable. It all makes sense though and Michael is the "hero" of
the movie. So if you like Drama and tension and the pursuit of your
dreams ... This one will be the one to watch. Hopefully you don't draw
the wrong conclusions from that
