A story with good elements that doesn't work.

An arrogant and lonely auctioneer fiddles auctions with a bent
colleague to build a private collection on the cheap. An heiress
contacts him with a vast collection in a crumbling villa. She keeps
evading meetings, and turns out to be an agoraphobic hiding in a secret
apartment in the villa.A romantic relationship, complete with furious
arguments and reconciliation, blossoms between the fifty-something
auctioneer and the 27 year old recluse. A whizz-kid helps the
auctioneer on technical matters, including putting back together an
automaton pieces of which mysteriously appear out of nowhere, on the
floor, in various rooms in the villa. Many other sub-plots emerge, no
doubt in order to give complexity and subtlety to the plot, and lead
the viewer off on wrong conclusions, all the better to be absolutely
amazed when the truth comes to light.This fails to happen. The plot lines are transparently obvious, the
flaws grotesque ("The experienced auctioneer" can't tell a real 17th
century from a version put together by a mechanics nerd. The auctioneer
can't tell the "valuable ancient collection in the villa" from bits and
pieces put together by the youngsters, and so on).It's entertaining for a good bit, but disbelief cannot be suspended for
the second half. And then it goes into extra time, and that's just too
much.
