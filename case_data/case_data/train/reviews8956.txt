Extremely over-hyped, but still entertaining

I'm a huge fan of the 1990's TV film of "It", especially for its
aesthetics and soundtrack, but it left out a lot of content from the
original novel, leaving me confused when I first saw it at the age of
12. This remake, or perhaps actually a "re-adaptation", is certainly
very timely, what with "Stranger Things" becoming so huge with
pretentious hipsters everywhere. I'm still not sure it hits the "scary"
factor very well, especially without Tim Curry's tremendous acting, but
it's certainly creepy. It's not nostalgic though, nor does it retain
much of the original novel, including the 50's setting, changed to the
80's to obviously market itself with "Stranger Things" and "The
Goonies".My problem with this new adaptation of "It" is that it's addled with
CGI and jump scares, neither of which add to its nostalgic appeal. At
the risk of sounding like a film snob, if you're trying to make a film
set decades before this era, you don't use CGI at all if you can avoid
it, unless you really know how to camouflage it. The constant profanity
did nothing for the story either, it only gave the false illusion of
being "intense". The sheer level of nerdiness made me cringe, unlike
the TV movie which had genuine friendships and sweet moments of love
and joy amidst the horror, just like King's novel.This film isn't completely terrible. It passes the time, but the only
thing it has going for it is that the director thinks he has hit some
80's vibe gold mine when in reality it just looked like a bad video
game full of childish jump scares.
