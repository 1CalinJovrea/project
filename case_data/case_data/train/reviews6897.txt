Nice fantasy movie

Im 33 years old and probably not in the main-group for this movie
(teengirls maybe). But me and my friend got a free ticket and went for
this movie we would normally not had seen. But i was charmed. The young actors played well, was cute and had
chemistry together. We smiled many times, and the effects was good. The
story was OK, and i have never read the story this movie is build on. This is a good movie i think, and probably they will make more movies
so we see how the story will go. I found it fun with the southern small
town fun of religious narrowness. And the fight between good and evil
is a fight in many of the fantasy-movies, and that was a red line in
this movie and worked good. Fun also to see Emma Thompson, she did a awesome actor-work.
