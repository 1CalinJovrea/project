War Dogs is one of the most mixed-reviewed movies of 2016 and I
understand that. It's a very heavy theme and the true story involved
isn't properly one that should be taken lightly.Milles Teller and Jonah Hill have amazing performances. Teller is
really brilliant, he's a great actor, even if his movie's choices
sometimes aren't the best (Fantastic Four), but hey ... We're all
human. Jonah Hill has what I think it's his best performance yet. He's
compelling and he's able to transmit Efraim's personality so well. We
never know if he's a good guy with bad intentions or a bad guy with
some good qualities in him, and Hill captures that perfectly. Bradley
Cooper plays Henry Girard, a supposed terrorist that helps them getting
the 300M deal. He's fine, he's just in the movie because he's a good
friend of Jonah Hill andÂ Todd Phillips, his character could have been
played by literally anyone. He's not in the movie much, but when he is,
he's good.The story it's really interesting and captivating, I always wanted to
know "what comes next?" and "how are they going to do that to achieve
their goal?". I felt captivated and focused for the most part, but the
plot doesn't flow really well since the second act drags a lot. The
pacing is kind of a roller-coaster between the first and third act and
that brings the film down.Also, I feel that the movie is longer than it should be, it has some
scenes that don't need to be there. It actually lacks some backstory
scenes so I could connect more with the characters but instead, the
director chose to tell everything through narration and exposition,
which definitely didn't help.War Dogs is still entertaining, for the most part, it has two great
performances by Teller and Hill, its story is really interesting and
captivating, but it doesn't flow as it should, it's too long and it
lacks some character's background.- MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)
