Disgusting

This movie was just disgusting. First off, there are so many other
terrible review giving this one star, and many people find those
reviews helpful. The movie only stars like 4 or 5 emotions in people's
heads, 4 or 5, I forgot, and frankly don't care since this movie was
complete garbage. I "watched" this movie at a potluck at a friend's
house but ended up playing ping pong with a friend the whole time since
the movie failed to attract my attention. This movie is not suitable
for kids as well. I do not understand why it is on the IMDb top 250
list, it should be on the bottom 100 list. This movie can scar kids and
make some people actually depressed. It is quite depressing that there
are such limited emotions and little activity in the brain expressed in
the movie. I was actually depressed after watching this movie and found
myself in a bitter state lacking interest in activities I usually
cherish. Why? Because this stupid movie is trying to tell me what is in
my brain and is completely corrupting. I was emotionless after the
movie just like how the movie is. I'm sure the disgust emotion in the
movie would be disgusted at the movie.
