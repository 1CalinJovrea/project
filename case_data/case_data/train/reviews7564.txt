What about Hook?

Pan is a great ride for the family, but allow me to elaborate more on
artistic choices that turned this film into a poor execution. The movie
makes the viewer feel that the initial conflict between Capt. Hook and
Pan will be analyzed, or at least spawned out of the plot. As many
movies and television series (Once Upon A Time, Christopher Nolan's
Batman, Maleficent, etc.) fill in the gap for viewers these days, I was
under the impression that Pan would satisfy my craving for a
back-story. The movie was a real Expectation vs. Reality lesson, as Hook carried
less depth than I would have expected. Instead of a dignatious, future
arch enemy, the character was reduced to a cowardly comedic-relief
role, portrayed by a poor actor. I walked away from this film
frustrated. The action, visual art, musical application, and Hugh
Jackman-- all marginal to what truly makes a great film (emotions,
plot, character relationships) -- are the only thing that carry this
film out of the depths of the 1 and 2 star category. Here's the
spoiler, readers: The movie could have functioned the same without a
Capt. Hook.
