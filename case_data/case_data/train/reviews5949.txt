Nicest movie of this year until now

Yesterday I went to watch the Accountant movie. After watch the movie I
felt a strong relation with another movie, Warrior (another movie that
I really enjoyed). When I came back to my house, with a small research
I saw that the director of both movies was the same, Gavin O'Connor.
Now, I feel that I watched 2 movies with different histories but with
the same essence. I really enjoyed this movie. It worth every penny.Ben Affleck did very well on this movie. Other actors too. Well done
production.The action scenes were really well done and the Barrett .50 sound is
amazing. I love that weapon.
