Intense, great action and unpredictable!

Freaking best movie I have seen this year! I honestly don't understand
some of these ratings.How did this get a 6/10 and some crappy predictable comedies get like
8/10.I don't get it! Anyway watch this film asap and come up with your own
opinion.I am sure you will really like the movie if you don't pay attention to
any negative reviews! The acting was great. Very intense. Enjoyable although not perfect ending and just a very smart plot!Just great all around movie 69/10 ;)
