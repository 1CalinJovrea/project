Good movie, too bad it's a fib.

The truth, a little of the truth, so far from the truth. I read the
original novels, and they are indeed pretty far from the Disney
Treatment (capitals are in order) they got; yet, I really love the
movie (Mary Poppins, that is), but I can also see why Mrs. Travers
loathed it. And I read about the real encounter between Walt Disney (a
way more unpleasant person than pictured here) and Mrs. Travers, and
once again, this is its Disney Treatment. Once again, I liked the
movie, a lot; yet once again I see where someone could loathe it. The
Disney Treatment is responsible of the popularization of many famous or
obscure tales (as an Italian, I'm thinking of Pinocchio); and, at the
very same time, it is responsible for their massacre in an orgy of
sugary coating. That Pamela Travers had to suffer this twice, is way
too cruel. Summing it up: 9 to the movie per se, 5 to the Disney
Treatment of reality.
