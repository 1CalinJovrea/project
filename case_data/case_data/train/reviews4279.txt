One of the Funniest and Most Intelligent Criticisms I Have Ever Seen in Many Years

When the UN threatens the nuclear program of the Republic of Wadiya,
the dictator Hafez Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) decides to go to New
York to make a speech in the assembly. However, his minister Tamir (Ben
Kingsley) is plotting a scheme to topple Aladeen and sign
multimillionaire contracts with foreign oil companies to make him a
tycoon.Tamir hires the torturer Clayton (John C. Reilly) to kill Aladeen, but
he fails and the dictator flees without his long beard. Aladeen
unsuccessfully tries to reach the Lancaster Hotel and he meets the
owner of the store of natural products Zoey (Anna Faris), who is
protesting against the presence of Aladeen in UN. She believes that he
is Allison Burgers, a refugee from Wadiya and brings Aladeen to her
store to help him to cater the hotel. He stays with her while he tries
to find a means to break in the hotel with his comrade Nadal (Jason
Mantzoukas).The politically incorrect "The Dictator" is one of the funniest and
most intelligent criticisms I have ever seen in many years. Sacha Baron
Cohen is hilarious in the role of a dictator and only his speech in the
United Nation explaining what a dictatorship is to people used to
"democracy" makes the movie worth. But there are several other jokes
that made me laugh most of the time. Further the cameos are also a
great attraction, especially Megan Fox in the role of herself. My vote
is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Ditador" ("The Dictator")
