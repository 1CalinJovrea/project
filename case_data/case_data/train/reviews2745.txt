Worst movie of 2013

I could not believe how unfunny this movie was. I kept waiting for even
a single joke to land. It was like they forgot what makes this kind of
premise funny in the first place. It was truly awful and easily the
worst movie of the year. The only laugh it got was when my wife and I
both looked at each other and laughed that the movie was so unfunny.
Shame on you cast and Director of the Hangover III. I want my money and
time invested back. I texted all the people I love and care about and
told them not to see this movie. This isn't even a rental. The title
should never be mentioned in public ever again. THE WORST! As I am
writing this I am still amazed how unfunny this movie was. It was like
listening to a story from your grandma about how she went shopping at
the grocery store...BORING!
