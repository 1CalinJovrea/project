Excellent Sci Fi movie - do NOT read spoilers!

I SO enjoyed this movie - always LOVE to see a very entertaining sci-fi
film. This one really must be seen on a big screen. But don't let
anyone tell you about the movie plot (which is excellent)!!! If they
start to do so, stick your fingers in your ears and hum! Don't be
tempted to read spoilers! Part of your fullest enjoyment of this film would come from everything
about it being a surprise. If you like sci-fi, you will thoroughly
enjoy the plot line, the action, the actors, wonderful visuals of
earth, the music and the well-done special effects. Just watch the trailer if you need to be intrigued. It is a well done
representation.
