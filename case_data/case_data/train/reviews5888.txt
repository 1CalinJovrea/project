Assassin's Creed: A Movie Worth Watching

Despite critic reviews and reports expressing their concern on yet
another video game spin-off attempt, I decided to still go view the
movie on its first showing. I can honestly say that not seeing this
movie in theater would be a mistake. The action sequences combined with
excellent cinematography and special effects allowed for a thrilling
ride from both the present-day Cal Lynch to the Inquisition-Animus
Aguilar segments present in the film. Being that I have previously
played many of the Assassin's Creed video games, the plot proved easy
to follow, flowing from one concept to the next easily. For those who have no background on the franchise, any confusion that
might result from the movie's plot can be cleared up by a quick
brush-up on the story-line of the Assassin's Creed games. This possible
confusion that might result due to a viewer's inexperience with the
story-line is the only reason this movie does not merit a 10/10 review.
A word of advice that might help to clear up confusion centers of the
Animus. The purpose is not to alter the past, but rather observe it
through the eyes of an ancestor in order to pick up on clues and hints
which could aid in present-day tasks. The task that Sofia (Marion
Cotillard)is attempting to complete is the discovery of the Apple of
Eden--basically a very important artifact desired by both the Templars
and Assassins. Thus, the Animus sequences that appear to lack much
background or a concrete plot are intentional due to the fact that only
the sequences hinting or involving the Apple are viewed. If the entire
life of Aguilar (Michael Fassbender) was necessary to finding the
Apple, the movie might as well have just been about him. Nevertheless, anyone who is already familiar or is willing to take 30
seconds to familiarize themselves with the Assassin's Creed story will
watch an excellent film--surpassing most of the recent releases this
year.
