Another good Spanish mystery movie

I'm not very familiar with all the Spanish actors and actresses but I'm
sure the ones in this movie must be the better ones from Spain. Because
the acting is really good in Contratiempo or The Invisible Guest. The
story is everything you want when you want to watch a mystery crime
thriller. It's never boring, with plenty of twists and turns. All you
want to do is know how this story will end. It keeps your attention
from the first second till the last one. I saw plenty of Spanish movies
and some are really good, way above average. This one is definitely one
of the good ones. If you look for a good entertaining mystery movie
search no further and watch The Invisible Guest. You won't regret it.
