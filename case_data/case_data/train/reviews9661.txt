Suicide Squad?? Morelike Suicide DCU

If you expect this movie to be a great fusion of picaresque and
superhero genre, you are wrong. This is really a desperate attempt from
WB and DC to revive the dying DCU, so they decided to copy what they
think makes marvel movies such a success. A PG13 lighter atmosphere and
add some comedy. Really? is this what DC thinks people like watch
Marvel movies for? Well if they really wanted to be successful like a
marvel movie, they should try to make something like Deadpool. Rated R,
some blood and anti-hero stuff. As usual DCU completely missed thing that make Marvel movie successful.
A good script that makes sense. This is just a movie that introduces
less popular DC characters nothing more nothing less. The whole movie
is like "This guy is Deadshot he shoots guns! This guy is Killer croc,
he is scaly! Here is katana she is for all weeaboos! We have more than
Batman and Superman you know." When all the introduction is done, half of the movies is done. And the
rest is just rushed plot and really bad PS3 level CG and action to fill
up the rest of the time. In the name of bad script, bad CG, bad action.
A trinity of fail makes this makes Dawn of Justice look like Citizen
Kane. And that is no compliment. Such a shame as it had elements that
could have been an innovative superhero movie. But just like dawn of
justice, it has been wasted and it will never see the light again.
