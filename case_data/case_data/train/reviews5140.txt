real stinker, avoid this movie

Poorly written, same clich√© con movies as others. Poor acting, they
needed a better supporting actress, Margot Robbie is eye candy only.
This movie is slow, don't waste your time. I wished Will Smith would
have passed on this one. Horrible, horrible music set to this movie. If
you want a good snooze then this is your movie, so slow it would put an
insomniac to sleep. I got in for free and still couldn't sit through it
and walked out. Wow just when you thought Will Smith couldn't do a
worse movie than, The pursuit of Happiness, he does this movie. This
movie sucks, crap, the writer should be shot. Everything about this
movie was poor and I cant reiterate enough on how you should stay away
from this one.
