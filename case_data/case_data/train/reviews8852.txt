Awesome find

I really enjoyed this film. I had actually never heard of it and found
it on Amazon. I thought it was very well thought out and very well
acted. I couldn't stop watching it. I wont ruin the show but to say I
was disappointed with the ending, I did not want it to end. Many of the
other reviews stated that this was a show for Women power and that men
are a-holes, I did not see that in this film. I was shocked at how
quickly she went from innocent student to artist. The interaction
between the professor and Mary I felt that portion of the movie wasn't
really followed through with throughout the film, especially the last
scene that we saw him in; many unanswered questions. Overall, excellent
film I will add to my collection.
