Still playing to full theaters

I saw "Moana" tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting
to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my
amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. "Moana" is a
fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would
imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4
times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was
attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great
movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and
beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of
fun. Highly recommended for all ages.
