10
One of the best action movies I ever seen

I am retired at 41 years old and watch movies all day and night. I take
my action films very serious.. From Die Hard to District 13, from First
Blood to Taken... John Wick 2 is one of the best action movies I've
seen. Simply put.. on a scale of the good old 80's red blooded American
action films, John Wick 1 will draw you in and make you a fan, John
Wick 2 will satisfy your soul with the 2017 evolution of 80's action
with a feeling of have hit the gritty lotto. This is a man's man film that should be enjoyed after a hearty steak
dinner (as I did tonight). I may have to go see this again.
