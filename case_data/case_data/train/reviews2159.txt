As believable as WrestleMania 29

Let's for a moment abstract away all the blue team good, red team bad
stuff and focus on the facts of this movie as we are told them. In the left corner we have the blue team consisting of 4 guys armed
with three M4A1 Carbines and one Mk. 12 Mod 1 Special Purpose Rifle.
They each carry a couple of hundred rounds of ammo and some M9 pistols. In the right corner we have the red team consisting of a couple of
hundred guys armed with AKMS, PKMS and type 69 RPGS. Already things are looking bad for the blue team but things are about
to get even worse when we learn that the blue team members consists of
guys who will be airdropped into a foreign civil war where team red is
currently fighting. They will know nothing about the local customs and
language and will have to make their way on foot using only maps and a
radio. Their task will be to kill the commander of the red team and get
back safely.Having only this basic information any reasonable man will conclude
that team red will wipe out team blue and he will be correct 99 times
out of a 100. What is perhaps more surprising is the amount of damage that this 4 man
team is able to cause and absorb. And this is where we leave the realm
of the possible and enter the real of WrestleMania. I would have much preferred the depiction of what probably actually
happened. They where spotted, engaged and finally subdued. At least
this way we would all have learned a valuable lesson. That being; if
the mission sound crazy, it's because it probably is.
