Best Movie With lot of Minions

Firstly,Thank to Pierre Coffin to design the Minions, the best animated
characters we ever had. As they are obviously funny to watch,the movie
is quiet good with most of their presence,but gone eager for the first
20 minutes for the kick start entry of Minions.A Must watch Perfect
Family entertainer. The Character of Sandra bullock is pretty good and
the dialogs in the movie are written well.The story was framed clearly
and the voice of all 899 minions given by the Pierre coffin is
awesome.The other crew of the movie also acted well.Especially the
three major roles of the movie Kevin,Stuart,Bob are the strongest
traits for the movie. The screenplay is well done and great editing.Thanks
