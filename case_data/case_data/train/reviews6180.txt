Intensely Stupid

Two generic, entitled American girls decide to pay money to get on a
shabby boat to go cage diving. Along with CGI, extremely aggressive,
and larger than life sharks, these enthusiastic pleasure seekers come
to the brilliant decision to trust a bunch of strangers with their
lives. Oddly, and predictably, the rusty cage is not up to standard, as
is the winch and line. Every shot of sharks are of ridiculously
proportioned great whites with their teeth showing, and-or mouths
agape. The only redeemable character is overwhelmed by Mandy Moore
illogical screams. It was a frustrating and nonsensical movie, where
sharks, once again, prey on humans like humans prey on animals. When is
Hollywood going to stop their misconceived lunacy when it comes to
animal behavior?
