brilliant scifi!

Absolutely brilliant scifi movie! The best I've seen in a long time
except for the latest Star Wars. Don't believe the negative comments on
this film, it's good ;) I hope they'll make an entire series of these!Basically it takes place on a newly colonized planet where the main
character is working and has his daughter staying over. At the same
time there is also a prison labour camp on the planet, and it is here
that the trouble begins when a virus breaks out that turns people into
violent monsters. To fix the problem, the corrupt company that
basically owns the planet decided to just blow the entire planet up,
killing all witnesses in the process, so they can then pretend the
whole thing was to blame on a group of terrorists who supposedly took
over the prison. This scenario gives the main character only 24 hours
to escape his work place, find his daughter in the middle of chaos and
seek shelter in a secret bunker out in the wilderness.
