It will crush you

With his portrayal of Glendon Swarthout's novel, Tommy Lee Jones
presents us one of the most impressive pieces of cinema I have ever
seen. Story, screen writing, acting and photography are top notch. But
there is no way to enjoy it. You can only be crushed and survive. The
Homesman tells us story about a low life caught between two worlds,
both he can't relate to. Circumstances take him on a journey that will
test him to his limits. It's a story about human spirit, moments of
glory and the point of break. A story of human civilization, religion,
morality, life and death. Yes, it is that deep. It is purely
philosophical drama, please don't expect to get any western action.
Movie is slow, hard and painful as all biggest lessons of life are. PS
I assume low film rating is a result of pepsi generation voting. PPS
And thanks to everyone who made this film despite it being obvious
commercial suicide and cinematic challenge.
