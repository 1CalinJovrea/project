Emotional and Epic

With it being a New Year, I thought I'd go and see a comedy to kick off
the 2013 film season. Unfortunately there wasn't any comedies showing
at my Cinema so I ended up seeing this film about the 2004 South-East
Asian Tsunami which killed over 250,000 people and displaced millions.
Not what I had in mind as a cheery film, but oh well....So basically we have a family that include married couple Henry and
Maria Bennett (played Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts), a classic middle-
class couple, as suggested by the fact they spend most their time on
the plane travelling to Thailand worrying if they set the alarm to
their house back in Japan, and also their three sons all string
sentences together without saying ''Bruv'' or ''Innit'', so they must
be Middle- Class. Anyway the family arrive at their resort in Thailand,
and all is going pleasantly when.....yes arriving in spectacular
fashion, almost like the rise of Godzilla, the Tsunami arrives and
decimates everything in site. The family is split in the wreckage of it
all and the film then deals with them all trying ti locate each other,
if they all managed to survive that is....The film was actually very good, a simple search story made gargantuan
by the amazing effects used to portray the actual Tsunami, it literally
comes at such a speed and power that leaves you in bewilderment and
gives you a better idea that news reports of what it was all like at
the time. They also have the classic ''Titanic'' Hollywood orchestra as
the soundtrack whilst this is happening just to add to the emotional
intensity, alongside top notch acting from McGregor, Watts and Tom
Holland as 12 year old son Lucas. The main complaint, and flaw of the
film, however lies in the fact we hardly see any actual Asian people,
in a film about an Asian tragedy. The main Asians in the film are
tribesmen and doctors who seem unable to apply composure or logic to
any of the hectic situations occurring, we don't see any Asian
characters searching frantically for loved ones or showing pain at
losing those they love, unlike our Western Heroes here.So overall, aside from the debatable premise of casting for the film,
which you'd expect from Hollywood, it remains a good, epic, emotional
film if you watch it for what it is. 7/10
