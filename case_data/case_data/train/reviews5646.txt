Really enjoyed this movie...

Just had to give my thoughts on this movie it will be a quick review
without spoilers so those of you who haven't seen it can read on
without fear of that. I really enjoyed this movie it's about a father
who puts on a clown suit which he can't get off afterwards and his
personality starts to change. To me this was like Stephen King's IT in
a way only it didn't shy away from anything really it showed the
children being murdered which I liked and it was also so damn creepy
and disturbing when he did it. All I can say is this has become one of
my favorite movies and this clown was scary unlike Pennywise. I highly
recommend it.
