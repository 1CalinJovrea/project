An awful tale of sick and confused attitudes toward love and sex.

This film was so disappointing. I was ready to stomach what I perceive
as Ms. Schumer's raunchy stand up which is basically all you have here.
I am a huge fan of Mr. Hader but don't expect anything from him here.
He plays a stand up guy there is none of his brilliance of character
here. If you are a fan of Amy you might like it. Or if you are so
inebriated or high you might not remember it. Unfortunately it's like a
bad song in my head. I can't get it out. The title should have clued me
in but I would have more fun watching an actual train wreck than I
could tolerate this waste of time and money. Although I'm happy Ms.
Schumer get's her screen debut I'm inclined to think it will be her
last. Any character movie from Mr. Hader would have been far superior.
This flick kind of leaves you regarding how you feel about dog poop. It
happens but best to be scooped up and thrown away. I didn't even laugh.
