Damn creepy yet damn funny

It's called a horror comedy but I'd say more of a dark thriller with
some comedic parts. This is a fun movie! Took me back to the "horror"
movies I grew up with. Silly horror. It makes you laugh in the right
places and say eeewwww in the right places. Even after watching the
trailer I was surprised by what it turned out to be. I don't want to
give anything away because it's done really well and I don't want to
spoil it. The kid is amazing, reminds me of a young Christian Slater,
anyone remember him in Twisted?), I'll be expecting to see more of him
in years to come. Suspense is there, originality is there and surprise
is there. If you get a chance to see it do so! Sat through credits at
the end and I should have known ..... it's Australian! They know how to
make some good movies!
