A timeworn twice-told tale. I almost fell asleep.

Disappointing. A forgettable musical score. Even the oddly cast Disney
multi-cultural video is superior. As much as I like that production, I
believe that "Cinderella" has to be a fair-haired blue-eyed blonde!
Other actors can be anything they wish! Good performances by all in
this 2015 "remake" so I can't quite figure out just what's missing
here. Walt Disney used to call it "heart". As a "film" collector, I
have both versions of "R&H Cinderella" (which are both videos),
Disney's animated classic, and "Ever After" with Drew Barrymore. Plus,
I have seen "The Slipper and the Rose" as well. (It's also excellent,
but it's a bit too operatic, with ballet dancing, for kids.) Here, both
her mom and dad die, mercifully, "off camera". The most redeeming
quality is the great over-the-top Fairy Godmother pumpkin coach and
animal transformations (and after Midnight un-transformation). Where is
my "Bibbity-Bobity-Boo" song? Yes, the chattering mice, lizards and
goose are too cute and very well done. There is just not as much
surprise here, as the Prince remembers meeting her in the forest and
therefore shouldn't have had that much trouble finding her? The new
Beauty and the Beast movie (2016) is just so much more captivating and
"alive". At least there is no "chunky" Fairy Godmother here. Whitney
Huston could barely squeeze into her costume, so many years ago!
