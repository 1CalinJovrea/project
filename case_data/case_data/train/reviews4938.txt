Damn you Marvel!!!!

Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy of what superhero films could look
like. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies
and a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't
just a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the
child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor
franchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on
that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm
for the world. This is exactly how we should be rewarded for their
fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire
kitchen sink at a single title and having every single washer and
lug-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than
Ragnarok.
