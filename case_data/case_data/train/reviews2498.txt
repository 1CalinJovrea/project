Amazing!

I don't want to give away anything, but my god was this movie amazing!
The motion capture was superb, the acting superb, and the plot itself
was great. For the Warcraft fans you will see plenty of easter eggs
that will make you grin or laugh. Over all it's what of my favorite
movies I have seen this year.I went to an early screening with my girlfriend and a friend of mine
and even though they know nothing of the storyline or world of Azeroth,
they absolutely enjoyed it. The characters were awesome (Duncan Jones
did amazing) and so were the actors. From what I could gather, the
entire crowd who went to see it enjoyed it.
