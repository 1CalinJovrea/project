incredible true story and lesson for us all

the film a true story of the background to the writings of a milne
books, winnie the pooh and a lesson in life to us all is an incredible
movie you are'nt expecting, a little slow in the middle then a powerful
revealing of where the director wants to get you , tearjerking and
heart moving but a great end as you sit in despair at the cost of a
brilliant book revealed to the world, do the things you love with the
people you love is one clear lesson go watch this movie , i rest my
first ever writing of anything on it. 10 outa 10
