Surviving - but alone

Some unknown disaster has struck the planet causing a severe food
shortage, it's every man for himself. The title character is held up
all on his own in the woods, subsiding on the meagre scraps he can grow
and repels anyone who encroaches on his land.Then a woman and her, rather plain looking daughter, show up asking to
trade. The Survivalist, devoid of all human contact apart from the
marauders he kills, cannot resist the pull of some female
companionship.This film has a very small stage, concentrating entirely on the three
central characters. Dialogue is minimal but affective, the Survivalist
is especially grumpy and non-communicative.There is a lot of nudity, expect dong shots and people washing their
bits in the river and some very grubby sex scenes.The scope of the story is small but the stakes for the characters are
high. It has a poke around at desperation and necessity. Would you pimp
your daughter out for a bowl of soup? I suppose it depends how hungry
you are.Well made, well acted, small budget but clever lighting makes it look
gritty rather than cheap.A very good, low octane watch.
