Just plain irritating compared to first three

This is in no way like the other three Ice Age movies. It is just plain
irritating from beginning to end. The voices of Wanda Sykes, Queen
Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and Nicki Minaj are like fingernails on a
chalkboard from beginning to end, and every crowd scene is made to
sound like a ghetto basketball game. I guess they're trying to appeal
to "minority" audiences...Throw in a stupid take-off of Pirates of Penzance, a bored performance
by the main characters (although they made Peter Dinklage into a manic
monkey), and you get a stew of pain. I guess they decided it's time for
minority voices to drown out the white males, and this is the stupidity
they come up with. Blecch.The only good thing about the movie is Scrat, but even that comes out
being relatively stupid. The animal goes to the core of the earth, runs
back and forth and makes the earth crack up. Riggghhhtttt.
