Beautiful story, beautifully told

This tale of Cinderella is not only entertaining but a brilliant study
in jealously, insecurity, and being true to who you are. Young
Cinderella is much loved by her parents and before her mother dies she
is given the advice "Have courage, and be kind". Cinderella takes these
to heart. After her father's sad death she is faced with fear and
cruelty on a daily basis from her step-mother and stupid, spoiled
daughters. How Cinderella deals with the irony of her situation in
comparison to what her parents were like, is part of what makes the
story line so entertaining. The movie is beautifully shot, with great
care taken with costumes, colors and overall theme to each image. The
actors play their roles with style (albeit Cinderella herself is a bit
flat) and Kate Blanchet is restrained yet deeply malevolent in her role
as the step-mother. Cool beauty with ice in her veins, a true Disney
villain! How fun! The restrained approach to the personified animals in
Cinderella's world is true to Disney's idea of "probable
improbability". This is a movie that could be watched many times over
and always be entertaining.
