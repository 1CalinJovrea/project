Wow this movie is overrated. I feel cheated

I will begin by saying that I'm still debating whether I should give
this movie 1 star to make up for all those high rated reviews. As someone else stated in the comments, Eddie's character is so poorly
researched, it's almost insulting to the trans community, I may not
know a lot about this, but one does not dress in a costume as a favor
and then identify themselves as another gender overnight... sure, the
story wants to offer more background into this but fails to do to so at
a satisfactory level. The main character comes across more likely to
suffer from multiple personality disorder than being trans, and
considering some less enlightened viewers still confuse sexual identity
for pathology, this may be one of the most epic movie fails I have seen
in years.I should also add that the acting feels forced in some scenes, but
that's mainly because many of those scenes are clich√© so the actors
don't have much to work with...... but man, if you've seen 10 movies in
the past decade, the not-subtle-at-all foreshadowing will surely let
you know how it ends. I had hopes for this, if you want a LGBT movie,
see Carol!
