The Evil Dead has passed away for good i'm afraid...

This movie is very easy to summarize : If you're an Evil Dead fan who
loved the previous parts (and part 1 especially) : avoid this like the
plague. If you've never seen any of the other Evil Dead flicks : you're
in for an average horror movie with bad acting, poor dialogue and a
thin storyline filled with loopholes.Fede Alvarez makes his debut here, directing the granddaddy of horror
and failing miserably. He has no connection whatsoever to the
franchise, despite claiming to love it, and it shows when he turn the
sadistic Kandarian demons into a mix of the "Exorcist" and a second
rate "The Ring" child. Not once will you quiver in your boots, not once
will you be grossed out, not once will you be on the edge of your
seat,... (you get the point)While the original grabbed you by the throat and didn't let go until
the very end, this one will merely spit gore at you every minute and
expect you to care.During my viewing, several people left the theater, disappointed and
angry over what this franchise has become...a cash cow for Raimi and
Campbell.The worst part is that enough people were suckered into believing that
this was going to be true to the original, (Raimi swore, Bruce
testified, the trailers lied,...and in the end we were left with
something any deadite would spit upon) so we all went to see it, it
made enough cash to warrant a sequel.With the same Director, the same producers, probably the same
actress...Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell : After this you have ZERO credibility left
with the legions of Evil Dead fans of old, try to pick someone else's
pockets next time.
