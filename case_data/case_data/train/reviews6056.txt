Gr8 Movie!  don't let the critics sway you.  it is really a fun Good movie

The action and humor are awesome, and the relationship between the two
is excellent. You can just tell that this was as much of a fun ride
making it as it is watching it. Johnny Depp steals it when he is on,
you just are mesmerized by what might he do next. Its the subtleties
that he adds that really makes him so good and fun to watch. Johnny and
Armie play well off each other. Don't let the so called "professional
"critics" make your choices. Let's face it critics get paid to over
analyze and pick things apart. If you want a fun movie to see that
certainly gives yours monies worth the movie fits the bill. Can't wait
for the DVD and special features.
