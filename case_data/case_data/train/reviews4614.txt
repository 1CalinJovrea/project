How does a dope like Sandler even have a career?

I have tried to watch this abortion of a film called "That's my Boy" a
couple of times now , and all I can say is "Who is giving Adam Sandler
money to make "films" , and who in the hell thinks this CRAP is funny"?
If there was ever a reason to think our society is in it's last days ,
this "film" could be the biggest indicator of it. Raped by his high
school teacher , Adam Sandler plays the lead and is idolized by his
peers. THIS IS A PREMISE OF A MAJOR Hollywood MOVIE? WTF PEOPLE! I
guess there are rape jokes , incest jokes , racist & sexist jokes all
through this "film" . Is this any indication of what Sandler thinks
about in his real life? And , another thing bothers me about Sandler's
movies. How the hell does he get legitimate actors like Al Pacino and
Susan Sarandon to appear in his crap? Pacino was in his previous piece
of doo - doo, "Jack and Jill" , and Sarandon has a walk on in this
"film". Now , of course , his latest fiasco , Pixels is playing , and ,
really people , don't support Sandler anymore! His "films" are just
that. A filmy , disgusting slime that insult your stupidity , leave you
feeling violated , and depleted of all intelligence. SANDLER , JUST GO
AWAY , YOU NEED SERIOUS HELP!!!
