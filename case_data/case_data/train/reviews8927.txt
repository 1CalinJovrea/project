TERRIBLE with a capital T!!!

You will probably walk out of the theater of boredom halfway through
this movie. I loved Pineapple Express, and other flicks from these
guys. But, there shtick is wearing thin these days. It is the same old
stuff with Seth going "oh my god, oh my god" mostly.Maybe it is just me, but I'm sick of these movies now. Seems like the
same old crap churned out.I'm pretty sure it was the studio that hacked itself to get some PR and
hopefully fill some seats in the theaters.You would be better served giving the 8 bucks to a random stranger on
the streets then suffer through this huge steaming pile of s**t.
