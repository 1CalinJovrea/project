This "Movie" is Horrifically Bad

This is one the worst pieces of so-called "movie" I have ever seen. I
put is in the same category as "Flesh Gordon",' only with panties still
on. This is the kind of film that ends, or should end, careers. The
beginning narrative and first scene, the funeral scene, are
promising...that's it. No redeeming qualities after that. Although,
growing up Jewish in Los Angeles, I did understand the Chinese
restaurant humor (bunch or Orthodox Jewish guys eating Chinese on
Christmas Eve). We had a couple of those types of places we used to go
when I was a kid...one was called Wan Q...they asked if you were Joosh
when you walked in the door. Anyone saying yes got a menu with no pork
dishes, but I digress. Next, the drug thing was idiotic. Having lived
through the 70's, I understand what effect all those things have on a
person...the movie's depiction was terrible: Unrealistic, bordering on
asinine. I can't say anything after the "let's have sex with our
panties on in the bathroom" scene, which followed, because I left. It
was that bad...I walked out. Don't go see this crap. It isn't funny.
The acting is terrible. The writing and plot line are worse. One of the
worst movies I have seen in my life.
