Jennifer Lawrence could have released 2 hours of her praising herself to the same effect

My mother is the kind of person who, when walking out of a movie,
always has something good to say about it regardless of how bad the
movie was. We saw this movie together along with my brother and a
friend of mine and when we were walking through the parking lot
afterwords she was suspiciously quiet.I was hesitant to give this movie such a low rating because I can think
of movies that were objectively much, much worse but frankly the
complete lack of substance makes it hard to give it any kind of rating.The plot seemed simultaneously dragged out and rushed and contained
zero suspense because no legitimate stakes were really raised and even
if they had been, I cared so little about the characters that it
wouldn't have mattered.Jennifer Lawrence's character is trying so hard to be The Every Man
that it comes across as painfully fake and her performance was very
much sub par. Every other performance in the movie was not all that
memorable, even in regards to a few bigger name stars.Two separate characters die over the course of the movie, one of whom
is never actually fully seen on screen. Both times Joy seems to have
moved on completely by the next scene.A huge problem this movie had was in its attempt to retain some kind of
vaguely political message without actually taking a firm stance on the
issues in play. For example, there's a scene that essentially ripping
on Joan Rivers for being anti-feminist and yet, we never really see Joy
struggling in the work place for being a woman or having her decisions
questioned by the men she works for. She seems to have it remarkably
easy actually, and most of the things that go wrong are solidly on her.
Another aspect of this is in the fact that they're poor and it causes
Plot Issues but this is never truly discussed in any meaningful way. We
are told that they are poor and that it causes problems, but they never
really talk about it nor do they ever seem to face real consequences
for the fact.Really the only positive things I have to say about this movie are: the
soundtrack was good when it showcased period appropriate tracks as
opposed to generic drama movie background music and I was very glad
that Bradley Cooper and Lawrence didn't hook up in this movie.Overall, exactly as bad as I expected it to be and definitely not worth
the watch.
