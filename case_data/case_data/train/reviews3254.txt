Bob and Jane are Adorable!

Millions of Americans watched Our Souls at Night on September 29th, the
Netflix release date of their original film that reunited Robert
Redford and Jane Fonda for the first time since 1979's The Electric
Horseman. I'm happy to say I was one of them, and I wasn't
disappointed! Robert Redford is a lonely widower, and his neighbor Jane Fonda is a
lonely widow. After dinner one night, Jane knocks on his door and
propositions him. "Would you be interested in coming to my house some
nights and sleeping with me?" she asks. She explains her reasoning:
they're both lonely, and she thinks it would be easier to get through
the night if there was someone beside her to talk to. Her intentions
are entirely honorable, and when Bob agrees, they strike up a
friendship that just might lead to more.This movie is so cute! They put a long gray wig on Jane to frump her up
a bit, but she's still beautiful and vibrant, and Bob is as handsome
and sweet as he was decades ago. When you watch the movie, it doesn't
feel like you're watching a 79-year-old and an 81-year-old. They've
both aged so well; it feels like a love story between two folks in
their late-sixties.The plot is pretty simple, but it doesn't have to be complicated. We're
watching it for the eye candy of Bob and Jane! With her gray Gibson
bun, Jane seemed to channel Katharine Hepburn in On Golden Pond, and I
found myself hoping that Hollywood would remake the classic film with
Jane in the lead. She could reunite with costar Bruce Dern from Coming
Home, who's also in Our Souls at Night, and Laura Dern could play the
daughter. Everyone would go see it! If the Derns were unavailable, the
story could be tweaked to widower and his sister, rather than husband
and wife, and Peter Fonda could join Jane in the lead role. Bridget
Fonda could come out of retirement and round out the castÂ—there
wouldn't be a dry eye in the house! But enough of my On Golden Pond
fantasy. Go watch Our Souls at Night, exclusively on Netflix, and fall
in love with Bob and Jane all over again. It's truly charming, and it
makes for a very sweet and fun evening.
