Chick flick/Small kid movie that disappoints.

This movie is definitely for women in general. A young girl coming of
age is told she must have a suitor and get married. She's a tomboy and
wants to do her own thing and her mother and father want the opposite -
that's about it . The rest of the movie is filled with low brow humor ,
typical slapstick violence and the usual moral of the story ending.
After seeing the trailer and the movie poster ,one would think Brave
would be about this young girl fighting and winning battles with her
bow and arrow and a rousing adventure. Instead it's a dull boring
coming of age story with not much to give except for the kids who like
to watch cartoon bears and other creatures frolic around the woods and
moms raising their bratty teenage daughters. 3/10 .
