Absolutely Terrible Movie

I took my whole family to see this movie and it is right up there with
the worst movies I have ever seen. Mandy Moore has to be one of the
worst actresses I have seen...and this performance was not redeeming at
all. The story line is nothing less than insulting, the "action" scenes
were unbelievably unbelievable and the ending left my whole family
looking at each other for something we must have missed. If your local
theater is paying YOU to come see this movie...and enticing you with
unlimited free popcorn for life, I would still hesitate and think twice
as this is a few hours of your life that could be better used bathing
in hot sauce.
