The best worst movie ever

I saw this expecting it to be terrible, and terrible it was. I couldn't
contain my laughter at the entire stupidity of this movie. Half of it
didn't make sense, the jokes weren't funny, the main girl is
pretentious and annoying, the boy is also extremely irritating and his
raps make my ears bleed. The only part that kept me walking out of the
cinema was that twist in the middle. WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD
IDEA???? WHO FUNDED THIS?!?!?I tried writing a review of this, but I couldn't, so instead I'm just
going to do a quick Cinema Sins thing and list all the things that
don't make sense in this movie. Spoilers ahead.Why didn't the mother show the kids any pictures of her parents, how
did they afford two really good quality and expensive cameras, why did
that kid rap in front of his grandma, why did they keep going out after
9:30 pm if they saw their grandma not only puking, but NAKED, why
didn't they tell the mother everything they saw, how were the
grandparents always 'out' when visitors came, why did they leave that
girl hanging on that tree for all to see, what was up with that alien
story, why didn't THE KIDS RUN, why did she actually get inside the
oven, why did he all of a sudden get all weird and personal with that
'you think you're worthless' talk with his sister, why was he zooming
in on the camera why did they not just pretend they were sick, how were
the grandparents paying the bills, how did the grandparents have
internet, why did the kids not fight back, why did the boy just stand
there while the grandma LOCKED HIS SISTER IN THE OVEN, why the boy just
stands there and let the grandpa shove literal s**t in his face, why
did the boy go absolutely insane, why did the grandma stare in the
water, why did the fake grandparents kill the real grandparents and
take care of their grandkids, why was the grandma smart enough to ruin
the girls laptop camera but not smart enough to destroy the ethernet
cable, why did the police not suspect the kids of just being murderers,
why were they absolutely bats**t crazy, but only at certain times, why
did the grandma get uncomfortable when they talked about the daughter,
why was the ending so terrible, why did the boy have an expensive
camera and laptop, but a s**t mobile phone?But, the most pressing question of all, why in gods name did that girl
wear that UGLY yellow turtleneck sweater?!?!?!I have so many more questions, but my brain needs a rest. 10/10 worst
movie ever would see againTL;DR: Terrible movie that doesn't make sense but funny sometimes
without meaning to be.
