I wish I could give it a zero

That's because it should not have been made.I had no use for another Superman film. The Christopher Reeve films are
there for us forever. The filmmakers of Superman Returns made a huge
error with their storyline and therefore created what turned out to be
a bad experience, but I would have given them a second chance. When
they announced MOS as a reboot, I did not understand why anyone would
bother. But when I heard Christopher Nolan was involved I figured there
must be something good about it, since I love every film of his that
I've seen.Well it's apparent that the only reason for this film was to make
money. The ONLY reason. Sears, IHOP, 7-ELeven, and U-Haul logos are
shoved into your face during one of the "climactic" action scenes. And
I mean you could see the washing machines at Sears. It was that bad.
Beyond that those action scenes were just smashing scenes. Smashing
buildings, smashing cars, smashing asphalt. The Hulk would have gotten
sick of all the smashing. Just debris everywhere for a good half an
hour. It literally made me tired. And the effects looked bad. People
are tolerating this in movies lately for some reason but nothing about
Superman flying or the explosions or the debris looked real. I don't
understand how in 2013 the effects are looking faker/worse but they
are. I guess to the video game crowd it doesn't matter, but my eyes
want to believe what they're seeing even if it's a fantastical story.The actors can't be blamed. They wanted to be a part of Superman. I get
that. The fact is there wasn't anything they could have done to improve
or make this movie worse. It was always going to be utter garbage. The
story is stupid, the dialog is atrocious. I really sat there for about
two hours wanting to slap someone, anyone. I haven't written a comment
here in so long, but I had to. It was just that bad.
