Flippity-flop.

You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was
unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what
the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the
tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with
hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and clich√©,
a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable
scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the
film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home
(but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with
a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book.
Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty
Reasons to STAY AWAY.
