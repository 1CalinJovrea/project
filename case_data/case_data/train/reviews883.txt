Incredibly Cliché

I saw a screening of Gangster Squad last night and to say the least, I
was unimpressed. I had decent expectations for the film with a stout
cast the likes of Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling along with a
director whose last two films I enjoyed (Zombieland and 30 Mins or
Less). So what went wrong? Like the summary says it was incredibly
cliché of every gangster movie out there and tried so hard to be like
LA Confidential and the Untouchables. While this movie would have done
much better in the 90's I don't feel it fits in this generation of
film.You have Sean Penn as Mickey Cohen who decides he wants to be the king
of Los Angeles and he will take out whoever is in his way. Nick Nolte
plays the police chief who is tired of the way LA is going and recruits
hard nosed, do-as-I-please Sgt. John O'Mara (Josh Brolin) to create a
crack team to take Cohen down. From there you have the obligatory
round-up-the team where he gets the bi-focal smart guy, the
past-his-prime outlaw and side kick, the token black guy, and the cop
who doesn't want to join at first but is thrust into the fray.You then have a typical hunt down the bad guy, have a couple of shoot
outs where an incredible amount of bullets fly and no one gets touched,
and a very flat romance where you wonder why these two are together for
no other reason than they are really good looking. There were also
moments in the climax of the movie where the audience burst out in
laughter and I feel that it was incredibly unwarranted.The only real redeeming quality was Sean Penn who gave an intense,
powerful performance as Mickey Cohen. All in all I was disappointed in
Gangster Squad and feel like the entire movie brought nothing new to
the table of the gangster genre.
