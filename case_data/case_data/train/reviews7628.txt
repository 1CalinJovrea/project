Shocking Ending...and not in a good way.

In this one, Lighting struggles to keep up with the new young techno
cars on the circuit and has to go find his racing mojo. Along the way
he meets a young racing car who is ironically his trainer, it turns out
she is the one who needs the training from Lighting. Lighting teaches
her his techniques, whilst trying to improve himself. For me it was a bit of a poor excuse for a Pixar film, and the ending
is probably one of the worst I've seen in an animated flick. It just
feels so unfulfilling and so not like Lighting McQueen. (If you do not want to know the ending do not read on!!!!)In the end, lighting makes his return to racing after training in the
off season. During his big comeback race, halfway through he decides
that the car he has been training deserves to try and finish the race?So instead of it being make or break for lightning, it turns into
making a name for the young race car that he has been mentoring. I think the ending will be Marmite for people, some will love it and
some will hate it. I personally didn't like it at all.Everything up to the ending is quite slow paced and a tad boring. Sadly Cars is another franchise that has suffered through the making of
sequels. Shame.
