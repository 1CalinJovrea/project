Remarkable cheesy fun!

I love Clown! A complete surprise for me, came out of nowhere, when I
was the poster I was expecting nothing but a class C kind of horror,
but boy was I wrong!What makes it so much fun? The transformation itself is simple and
brilliant! They take their time but they make sure to always keep you
interested, waiting to see what happens next, how things will evolve
and so on. Clown is a natural movie, they didn't bother into too much
gore, nor nudity, but instead they actually focused on the story. And I
have to say, it was a good one, effective and sometimes haunting!It is a sure thing that most horror fans out there will dig this on for
sure. Without saying too much about it, if you liked movies like Rare
exports or Sint, this one you'll enjoy even more because in my opinion,
it is better! Clown, simple and effective!Cheers!
