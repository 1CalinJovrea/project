Best X-Men Movie so far

we finally get the Wolverine we have been asking for, for the past 15
years and it's his last time. Well i guess he couldn't have ended it in
any better way as a last farewell to the fans and his signature role.
Not only that but it looks like this one blows all the other superhero
movies out of the water and i hope you Weebs go pay for your ticket to
see this as well instead of watching a cam version online so we send
the message that we want more of these kind of movies.
