Stay away from this movie

I just saw this movie last night. I was a fan of Knocked up even though
my wife and I fought like cats and dogs after the movie (it was about
having kids. This time around, the movie did only one thing for me, it
made me thankful for my family. Leslie Mann's character was even more
of a raving bitch than in Knocked up. I told my wife that I would have
shoved her head in the toilet when she was trying to inspect it to see
if Paul Rudd's character was really taking a crap or just avoiding her.
He was probably defecating on paper so he could help make this film.
Actually only Paul Rudd really brought anything to the picture unless
you count Megan Fox as a hot boutique worker. The film showcases a
small part of the miserable lives of Pete and Debbie as they spiral
into unhappiness and misery. Into the mix are thrown several more
characters who are equally miserable. I was looking forward to this
movie big time and when I realized that it was going south I couldn't
wait for it to be over. Unfortunately its over two hours long. So, if
you are looking for a way to spend a few hours in the dark, lock your
self in a closet or just close your eyes but do not go see this
film--it sucked!
