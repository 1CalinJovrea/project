The Point At Which I Stop Watching This Infantile Product

I think all the people who've written a negative review of this movie
because of its apparent "scientific contradictions" are missing the
point.How can people who accept a man turning into a green monster or holes
opening in the sky and spitting out an army of hover bike-riding space
aliens criticise the science in this film? That's probably the worse
case of deluded double standards I've ever witnessed.No, the REAL problem with this movie is just like any other MCU film.
The thunderingly dull expository dialogue, the pantomime characters,
the cheap cinematography, the flat and stilted performances, the
dramatically compromised script and the infantile tone. And the most
insulting aspect is that every single one of these cinematic atrocities
spends vast amounts of its running time promising us even more of this
trash is still to come.The problem with Disney and Marvel and the relentless machine they've
created is that so much money has been made from this dross that
actually MAKING A GOOD MOVIE now seems to be nowhere near the top of
their agenda. Another $175m gets spent, it opens, pimply faced kids
vomit out their cash for a couple of weeks, then it goes to China,
makes more, numbers are counted, accountants smile, Disney smiles,
rinse and repeat.But nobody's making a good movie. And guess what? The studio doesn't
care. THEY DON'T NEED TO ANYMORE.It's time to boycott this insanity. Life's too short and there are so
many good films out there that won't make you feel like you've been
brain-raped and just lost two perfectly good hours of your life.Disney be warned. Your days of guaranteed return on these turds is
imminent.
