The jungle book surprised me

If there is one thing that Hollywood is good at is ruining our favorite
childhood films, but not with this film. So The jungle book focuses on
a boy named Mowgli that is raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle.
But when a tiger named Shere khan learns of his presence, he must flee
the jungle in search for the man village. Helping him get there is a
panther named Bagheera and a bear named Baloo that must protect him
until they reach they reach their final destination. First the pros.
The special effects are amazing! I've never seen cgi animals look so
realistic on screen before. Neel Sethi does a good job at playing
Mowgli. Considering that this kid had to work with nothing, then he is
does an excellent job. The characters are very likable. Whether they
are good guys or villains. The story seems kinda simple, but when it is
directed in a way that makes it entertaining, then your going to find
yourself liking this film. To be completely honest i didn't see any
cons to this movie. Overall i really enjoyed the jungle book. It was
fun, visually dazzling, action packed, and funny at times. One things
for sure when it is on DVD, I am going to buy it.
