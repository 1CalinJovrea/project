Slightly better than the average Wes Anderson

I don't care for Wes Anderson. Every time trailers give me the
impression it's going to be funny, I'm deeply disappointed. For me, Wes
Anderson's works range from stupid to really stupid. Grand Budapest
Hotel is typically stupid. What makes it a little better is the true
humor of the sets and costumes. From the Easter egg candy colored hotel
with delightful columns, a grand stair-step tram to raise visitors to
the heights of the hotel's entrance, delightful hotel staff costumes
and villains costumed in traditional black, this Wes Anderson did give
this viewer one arena of entertainment that the rest, acting, story
(what story?), plot (what plot?), characterizations (who cared about
any of them?) lacked. I did enjoy the stellar cast. I think they do Wes
Anderson's films because making them must be fun. My favorite of the cast? Jeff Goldblum. I liked his character. And his
was the only character about whom I had any feeling for care or
concern.Will I ever watch a Wes Anderson film? Yes, but only for the reason I
dragged myself through it this time-- it was on the IMDb 250 top films
list on the 31st of December. For those who like Wes Anderson, your
sense of comedy is different from mine, not better, just different. As
for me, I think I'll go back to Woody Allen films.
