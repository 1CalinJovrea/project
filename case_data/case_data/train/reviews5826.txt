Better than expected

After reading some of the negative reviews, I pretty much did not
expect much out of this movie. While this is indeed a rather boring
movie for adults, I did enjoy the show more than I had expected.The story is simple and easy to understand, with a few twist here and
there. Admittedly, I did not find the jokes funny at all. Considering
this is a show for kids (correct me if I am wrong), I would have
imagined that kids would love this movie.Lily Collins is a beautiful young lady with high potential to become a
great actress. The most enjoyable part was probably the ending with
"Ned Stark"
