What can i say....i was blown away by this this movie

I saw this last night and its been on my mind a lot since then..What a fantastic movie!!, i went in with high expectations, as i had
only read very positive things about it, and I was definitely not
disappointed, what a beautiful, sad and touching story Great acting
overall, mads Mikkelsen is always good, and this is one of his best
roles in my opinion, Alicia wikander was beautiful as the young queen,
but the real star of this movie has to be Mikkel Boe FÃ¸lsgaard as
Christian VII, Wow!!, what a great actor, his portrayal of the mentally
ill king was superb, he really made me sympathize with Christian, he
may have been of his nutter and mean at times, but deep down, I think
he was a good guy, but he was a very insecure young man, who didn't
know how to behave properly, and who couldn't deal with the obligation
of being king, he was misunderstood, and I felt really bad for him at
times, I really like the portrayal of the relationship between the King
and struensee, they were really very good friends/companions, and
struensee was like a father to Christian.The costumes were also beautiful, I love fashion in that period, and
this movie had some beautiful clothes to dwell on.It was about time my country did a movie on our royal history, and now
they have, and the outcome is better then i could have ever expected,
just beautiful, Hollywood couldn't have done it better, as a Dane I
take pride in our danish (royal)history.Go and see it!!, you wont be sorry
