Southern Rail provide more drama

Saw the film two days ago. It started alright but just never really
went anywhere in terms of drama, intrigue, pace, suspense or any of the
key components of a murder mystery thriller. By the end of the film you
just don't feel anything for any of the film's main characters. Having
not read the book, I can't say whether the book is suspenseful but the
film has less drama than the current Southern rail conductors strikes.
When eventually the killer confronts Emily Blunt's character you really
don't give a flying fig. The film makes me relish even more, wonderful
murder thrillers like Jagged Edge, Seven, Fargo, The lives of others,
Silence of the Lambs, and Basic Instinct.
