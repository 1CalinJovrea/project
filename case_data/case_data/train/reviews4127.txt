A MUST watch for all the Fantasy genre lovers and not only.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***I was lucky enough to get an invite to watch the movie in LA 2 weeks
ago, in a screening about press.I was the only one foreign guy
there(Cyprus but got invited since i am making my after-master practise
here).I have to note to everyone here that i am aware of World of Warcraft
and the Warcraft games as IPs but i've never played any of them.I am a huge Fantasy genre lover and this movie exceeded my
expectations. My biggest concern minutes before movie aired was the
quality of the CGI.I Knew this movie uses a lot of CGI.Well the CGI is
breathtaking easily equal or better to AVatar and Dawn of the Apes,
equally to JUngle book(what a great movie!) BUT with the difference
that it is used in massive scale, which makes it even more impressive.
Watching Hundreads of Orcs with unique characteristics and facials is
mind boggling(with the positive way of meaning).Orcs are beautifully beautifully made, main character Durotan is just
awesome he is my favourite character, HUmans are OK at start i had an
issue with how armors looked but people told me it is exactly how
in-game is.IN terms of acting Ben Foster is hands down the best
performer also Paula Patton and Travis Fimmel are nice, rest of the
cast its slightly above average not great, but serviceable. Orcs
overall are better portrayed than Humans, BUT thats the important thing
if CGI was bad in this movie i would be really turned off, but the CGI
is perfect so i can easily bypass the fact that 2-3 human chars weren't
the best.I Loved the plot, it is so rich and u can easily understand why some
people said that this movie isn't even the 15% of the whole Warcraft
Lore.Duncan Jones has done a great job for non-fans like me to easily
udnerstand the movie, even though there are a few times that let u
hanging which proposes hinds for a sequel.Visuals are stunning and we can see probably the best implementation of
magic that has been made in a movie.Summing up this is a MUST watch for every person that loves Fantasy
genre, easily the best fantasy movie after the last LoTR release(IT
would be at LOtr level with 2-3 more decent actors). ANd easily the
best video-game adaptation that has been made. 1-- Breathtaking CGI 2--
It feels more like a movie(rather than a video game movie) 3--
Incredible and rich lore/plot, Warcraft universe is HUge and after this
movie i really want to explore it.Give this movie a chance i know many are sceptical to any video-game
adaptation, but this one it wont disappoint u.
