True to its Time

A biopic about Vinny "The Tasmanian Devil" Paz - a boxer who came back
from a broken neck (sustained in a car crash) to fight again. His
career total being 40 wins in 50 fights. Some fights and events are
compressed to make the film work.Set in the late 80's and filmed entirely on location in Rhode Island
around his native town of Cranston - the film incorporates real TV
footage of the period in the background as presenters and local
stations cover his chances of fighting again. (Hilarious in some cases
as the gray haired presenters are still with us now!) The film
certainly demonstrates Paz's sheer guts and determination to train
again while wearing his "halo" collar drilled into his skull to hold
his neck straight while the vertebrae heal. (Years ago I had a staff
member also wearing a halo collar while he recovered from a broken neck
- this part is really well portrayed).Living in Rhode Island I'm familiar with the area portrayed - the close
up camera style and cars and housing all ring VERY true. Though I deny
any familiarity with the "Foxy Lady" gentleman's club - also
portrayed......If you sat up for the "Thrilla in Manila" and the "Rumble in the
Jungle" - then this movie shows boxing of the period in the lighter
divisions. If boxing isn't your thing - you might want to give it a
miss - the fights are particularly well staged.
