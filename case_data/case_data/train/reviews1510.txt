Police drama for the Social Media Generation

The script is so well written, it almost hurts. Almost because it is
really just good! And I loved the fact, that it got recognized in
America too (at the Box office, it did open at Number 1). While I won't
go into the story, the casting of Jake and his partner couldn't have
been better. It feels like the guys know each other their whole life.
Their interactions with social media and "real" life feel ... well
real. Nothing in this movie feels like it is staged for entertainment
purposes nor does the dialogue sound fake.I did write drama, but there is also quite a bit of action in this one.
The hand-held approach to some of the scenes does not take anything
away from them, it actually heightens the experience most of the time.
Of course as an Anna Kendrick fan, I would've loved to see more of her
in the movie, but it does belong to our two "heroes" and what they are
going through. It's nice to see a movie that keeps in touch with
current events, have the courage and the quality to bring that "cop"
experience on screen
