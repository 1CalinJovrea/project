Kind of a disappointment

I have always loved Peter Pan. I loved every single story told about
him and watched every movie involving him including Once Upon A Time
with Hook and Pan but when I saw this movie I was like "What the hell
IS this? Where is the ACTUAL plot? There is just too many questions
left unanswered. I am so disappointed because of this. If they are
going to make a sequel, AT LEAST leave answers this time and just
follow the original plot.Pan is a 2015 American 3D fantasy action-adventure family film directed
by Joe Wright. The film is a prequel to Scottish author J. M. Barrie's
Peter Pan story, first staged in 1904. It serves as an alternative
origin story for Peter Pan and Captain Hook.The story is basically about Peter, abandoned as an orphan, who gets
kidnapped by Blackbeard to mine for Pixie Dust so that Blackbeard can
live eternal youth. Blackbeard is also at war with the Red Indians and
a rebellion is taking place. It also shows the friendship Pan and Hook
had before they lead to what they are destined to be.
