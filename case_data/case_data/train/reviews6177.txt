This movie was a great surprise. I figured it would be just a feel good
"cute" romcom. Boy was I wrong. Yes it had the RomCom moments, but it
had a very deep dark underlying river of a very good story. The ever
Stunning Kate Winslet was top of her game in this film. She was
stunning, beautiful, witty, charming, and just plain Bad ass. She
worked it like no ones business. Her character was coming back for not
only revenge but for peace in her own skin. Perfectly casted and
perfectly executed. Liam Helmsworth....just plain delicious. Best of
all was the ever FAB-U-LOUS Hugo Weaving back in the skirt again. He is
just perfect in this film. With a taste of Priscilla Queen of the
Desert it just doesn't get any better than Hugo. I see how this movie
received standing ovations at film awards. It's worthy of it and more.
Brilliant.
