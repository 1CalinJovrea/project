2 hour equivalent of an Instagram brunch story

If you have ever stumbled upon an Insta story of a brunch table with a
polo shirt lightly hanged on the brim of the chair, a visibly used
Penguin edition of a Thomas Mann roman and a moleskin notebook full of
pretentious calligraphy, all serving as props, welcome to Guadanino's
world. The characters are moving advertisements of Polo and Lacoste who
carry books they have never read as medals, cite snippets of poets they
never got and surround themselves in a world of art to boost their
shallow egos. Every character of this film is a poor copy of a real
life personality: see the professor who is a more handsome, gay
friendly version of Umberto Eco. Under all this stylization lies
nothing. All the spontaneous action feels terribly staged and you can
taste a fear in the air. The fear that if an actor misses one step of
this mind numbing choreography, the whole world will crumble. Don't ask
me to think highly of a director who dedicates a whole scene to
advertise espresso.
