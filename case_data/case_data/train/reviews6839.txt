Everyone needs a little Baymax in their lives

Big Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that
centers on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an
inflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros. 5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and
relatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story
is set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and
San Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both
Japanese and American components within the story and setting. It
should be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the
animation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name. Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear
soft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team
on this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax
can hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the
city streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's
cute and he knows it. Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim
through details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a
chance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in
children targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace. Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by
Ryan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the
local university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon
Wayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence
and exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are
more spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review
entirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest.
