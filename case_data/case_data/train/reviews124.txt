Interesting Movie from my standpoint!

I guess people really thought this was going to be a full comedy, and I
don't blame them. It was kinda advertised as such. It's an interesting
mix, but definitely not 50/50. It's way more dramatic but does give a
rather quirky look at pregnancy and that 9-month process. I didn't have
huge expectations going into it but it kept me engaged and that was a
surprise. It did have some touching moments and I did really get into
the characters and their different dramas. I liked the way they showed
the connection between these women, especially since *SPOILERS* they're
not all friends and don't even know each other, save for one exception.
Yeah, you'd think they were all buddies given the poster, but they're
not. The interactions are mostly between the individual women and their
individual scenarios with their boyfriends/husbands, which are
ironically happening coincidentally. That was a real interesting way to
portray this drama. I enjoyed it. It's obviously not for everyone, but
that doesn't really make it "bad." 8 out of 10!
