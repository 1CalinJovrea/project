Gripping and compelling

This film was for me one of the most gripping and compelling films I
have ever watched. Nothing was dragged out the whole film was to the
point and from the moment it started to the moment it finished I was
engrossed with the story. I found it emotionally harrowing but went to
see it with my sister during the BFI film festival which I think made
the emotional side harder as you could relate to the pain you would
feel if it were to happen to you, afterwards we both walked home in
silence still playing it over in our heads. Also true praise for the
composer the soundtrack was exceptional - so beautifully written and in
perfect harmony with the film. A truly exceptional film, this story
will stay with me forever. The casting, the story, the cinematography
and the amazing music was done perfectly and I actually cannot fault
this film. It was truly mind blowing and makes you appreciate how lucky
you are to have whatever it is you have In a seriously humbling way. If
you appreciate good film, this one, is a must.
