Hard to finish

I'm rather confused by all the high praise for this rather boring
movie. My main problem was how unlikable all the characters were.
Watching idiots moving through a weird for weird's sake plot hardly
qualifies as good entertainment. The initial setup was rather vague and
poorly written, not the way to establish the main character. All in all
there is no way that I could recommend this to any of my friends.
