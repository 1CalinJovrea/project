Awful

Absolutely awful. Awful plot, awful writing, abysmal acting. I'm
curious as to whether Tom Hanks, someone I admire greatly, and who
actually did a great job acting despite the poor dialogue, even read
the script before signing on? Surely not? He and Boyega were great - a
testament to their skills. EW was so abysmally bad, It was painful to
watch. That's all I shall say. What a mess. Don't waste your time, and
especially not your money.
