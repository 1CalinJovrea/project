The Line Between Humanity & Evolving into something More.

This film will most likely split down the middle because of it's
religious tones of God and evolution. Some people will love it and some
will hate it because it might go against their belief system. For movie purposes, it has great acting, great story (though some may
feel it's a little too far fetched, which I personally don't think is
too far fetched when you see what the world was like 10 years ago
before the mainstream web), and pretty good action scenes.At the heart, it's a story about a woman, Evelyn, who loves her
husband, Will, so much she tries to hold onto him by helping him save
his consciousness. She begins to wrestle with whether this being is
really Will or is something new. It's also about evolution and the line
between humanity and evolving into something more. This movie might be
a turn off for religious people but it does make you think of what
humanity could become whether you're religious or not. Overall, it's a great movie that's enjoyable, thought provoking,
challenges some beliefs, and foreshadows some future realities we will
all have to soon deal with. I would say go see it!
