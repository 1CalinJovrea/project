A Must See Movie

At first I did not think this movie was something I would like to see.
I felt it would be one of those movies that once the disaster happened
it would become dis-interesting and would be boring the second half of
the movie. I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only
reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was
a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little
better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was
fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and
was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and
not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger
release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie
especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film
that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little
exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts
allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event.
If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not
over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is "a must
see movie" you will not be disappointed.
