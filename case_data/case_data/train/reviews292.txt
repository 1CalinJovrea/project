Abducted to a Southern hell

Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's
history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of
slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the
after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the
culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon
Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana,
which is backed up by legal records.The story begins with him living with wife and children in upstate New
York as a free man and respected member of his community. After being
lured to Washington by a couple of con-artists who promised him work,
he was subsequently drugged, locked in chains, viciously beaten,
stripped of his identity and shipped to New Orleans to be sold into
slavery. Over the next twelve years, he was owned by two men who
treated him in contrasting ways. The first was a relatively civilized
fellow, but the plantation's half-witted manager was threatened by
Northup's superior intelligence. Their mutual dislike produced a
dangerously volatile situation, and unwilling to lose his investment,
Northup's owner re-sold him to a neighbor. This unbalanced individual
regarded his slaves as property to be used for pleasure and profit,
which caused them to live in perpetual fear that his capricious moods
would flare into sadistic lust or rage at any moment.It's noteworthy that a British director has become one of the few
filmmakers to delve deeply into this subject, and the combination of
John Ridley's powerful script and McQueen's directorial skills has
inspired exceptional performances from the entire cast. Their
dramatization of Northup's experiences is both riveting and
uncomfortable to watch, as the film depicts the perverse nature of a
society that permitted such a barbaric system. Hopefully it will reach
a large US audience, who will learn how a privileged Southern elite
cruelly exploited their fellow humans in order to acquire greater
wealth for themselves.
