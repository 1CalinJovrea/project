Worst movie i've ever seen in my life

To be fair to this steaming pile of crap of a movie, i have not seen
the musical.Even if this movie is based on a musical it should have enough
interesting aspects about it to stand on its own. Saying 'you just
didn't watch the musical that's why you don't like it' shouldn't be
used as an excuse. The camera work was just awful. I don't want to see anymore close ups
of Russell Crowe's face. The story was waaaay too slow moving and for
some reason everyone had a British accent?This is the first time in my life I walked out of the theatre on a
movie. I couldn't take the awful singing anymore.Save your money and torrent this one!
