One of the worst films of the last decade

No pacing, no decent dialogue, no characterisation, no decent action.
No surprises. It's completely pointless and non-sensical.There are so many plot holes and impossibilities, even within the world
of the initial premise, that right from the first line you understand
that the only way you can get anything out of this stupidity is to
follow along with the heavy-handed allegorical message. Unfortunately the film never waivers from the allegory even when you
get the message after ten minutes. Still waiting for plot surprises?
Sorry there won't be any. The only point in waiting for the end is just
to see what happens. Trust me, if you having washing to do, do that
instead. Spoiler Alert ! It's not worth finding out who lives, who dies and what happens to the
kids.If you like allegories may I suggest Animal Farm, the Bible, the Matrix
or the Wizard of Oz. Avoid this, unless perhaps you're high on
plastercine. It's dreadful, one-dimensional tosh.Spoiler alert! And where on earth were the chickens?
