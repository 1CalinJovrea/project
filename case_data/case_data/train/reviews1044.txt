It's like driving a race car as fast as it will go... so fun you can't stop smiling

I went into this with no preconceived expectations. I saw the trailer,
it looked interesting, I went.I wasn't disappointed. Whether this is a commercial hit or a flop, it
will be a cult film forever. It's an instant classic for no other
reason than it's just so damn fun. Your best bet to enjoy this movie is to see it as an experience and not
as art. Don't ask questions about characters background or whine when
they don't explain random biker chicks with samurai swords... it just
doesn't matter. I eat ice cream because I like ice cream... I don't
pick through it during dessert.
