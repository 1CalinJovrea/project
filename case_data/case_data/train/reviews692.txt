3D first, Movie second

The movie Pompeii was obviously thought-up and directed around the 3D
effects. The plot, acting, and script must have all been after-thoughts
to the 3D fireballs shooting off the screen, 3D ashes floating in front
of your eyes, and the 3D objects being hurled around by tidal waves.It was watchable, but don't be expecting a fabulous plot that you
haven't seen dozens of times in other better movies. The bad writing
had most of the actors come off sounding like lifeless wooden statues
that would say and do very unbelievable things just to keep the story
going. Everything was very predictable. So predictable, in fact, there
were a couple of moments I could have sworn I did see it before!This was a good example why I typically do no like 3D movies. Having
some good 3D effects is not a valid excuse for making a bad movie!!
This definitely could have been much better!
