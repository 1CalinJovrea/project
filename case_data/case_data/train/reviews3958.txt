Laugh a minute

Absolute laugh a minute, don't take it too seriously and you'll love
it! Having seen the old Baywatch the two aren't really comparable and
thats the point, they're not meant to be similar, this is a complete
throw your brain away popcorn movie and that is what it should be
judged on!
