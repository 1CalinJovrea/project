A movie that will leave you awed

I never wrote a review on IMDb before, but I feel I have to say
something here. It goes beyond me why there's such a low rating for
this movie. Sure, it's not a literary piece with deep and fine philosophical layers
(although even that could be disputed), but it keeps you on edge and
it's got everything that you'd expect from a a piece of entertainment:
action, drama, thrill, Sci-Fi, love, friendship, comedy, etc. etc.
Although the end is sadder than I'd hoped for, it's a movie with an
original plot that I'd highly recommend to anyone. I am looking forward to the sequel, though it'd be hard to match the
level of excitement that this pilot offered! 10 out of 10.
