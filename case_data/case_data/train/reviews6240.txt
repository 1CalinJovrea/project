Total garbage

Halfway through I wondered whether this might be a piece of
experimental filmmaking to see whether its possible to maintain a lead
character who has absolutely no agency whatsoever. It was afterwards,
when I found out the script was by one of the bros behind Sons of
Anarchy, where my having just sat through two hours of the only female
character being ferried around by all the manly men whilst crying and
asking what she should do next made perfect sense.In terms of character development it's paper thin, and standard sexist
tripe. Blunt's character's only moment of development is when we find
out she hasn't had a boyfriend for years and hasn't been bothering to
pluck her eyebrows. Del Toro's back-story turns out to be his need to
avenge his wife and daughter's over the top murders. Yawn. Del Toro, to
his credit, gives the best performance in the film, and reminded me of
a manky Brad Pitt.It's yet another male power fantasy, and a real waste of Emily Blunt's
talents. After her great performance in Edge of Tomorrow I had been
hoping for more butt kicking, but she literally does nothing in the
whole film. The film could have almost made up for this, and had some
kind of point to it, if it had allowed her a final moment of agency at
the end by forcing Del Toro to kill her, but instead she just has
another cry.There are a couple of nicely made tense action sequences (involving the
male characters of course), however they are lost in the dreary pacing
of the rest of the film (I think the creators were aiming for prolonged
artful suspense, but they failed).Instead of watching this film I could have stayed home and done the
dishes. As it is they are still piled up waiting for me. In an
alternate universe they are done by now and I never wasted my time on
this piece of garbage.
