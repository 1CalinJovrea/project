Bollywood is desperate!! this movie is proof...

I was surprised that RKH and AK did a movie like this...this movie was
nothing but a collection of clich√©'s..I mean, things like a girl from
India falling in love with a guy from Pakistan..donno why they stopped
there..why not someone from afganistan?? or a let militant??? then
there is the alien -mr AK who look like an alien anyways, I mean
literally without costume J(actually Anushka also looks like one after
the new lip job!!)..and there are stupid pathetic jokes like pasting
stickers of Hindu gods on the face and saying it is self defense...I
mean you must be a idiot to laugh at that.. I liked OMG a million times
more..it was a movie that was shot sensibly and made sense..this movie
is just cheesy..at the end of the movie you will be left wondering if
this movie was a alien movie or a love story or something
else...Imagine mixing pizza, ice-cream, pickle and tamarind paste and
eating it at once..what would be the aftertaste?? This movie is like
that..Don't waste your money on this...get a copy of ET and OMG and
watch it back to back..
