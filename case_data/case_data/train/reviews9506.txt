Give it a try , It's not that bad

I don't watch Madea movies , this is my first but it's really a good
one .. I had a nice time and it cheered me a lot . I just don't know
why it has all these bad ratings and critics , It's not perfect we get
it but it's a good comedy movie The story is good , The humor factor is
fulfilled , Music and picture were fine ,, and above all the movie has
a meaning and a message that was well served .. What I didn't like in
the movie was just the acting of the girls and some parts of the movie
i thought they were little boring mainly the first half an hourBut overall , To me it was a nice pleasant experience that worth time
