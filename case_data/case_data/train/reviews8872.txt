Ant Man is astonishing.

This movie is incredible. A ton of fun with brilliant action and
hilarious dialogue this is another fantastic win for Marvel. Paul Rudd
plays a likable and charismatic hero who really makes you root for him
and his goals. Michael Pena is the real heist of this film as he steals
every scene that he is in. Corey Stoll as the villain was a fantastic
choice from Marvel. He can play the corporate business man and an
intimidating villain. The visuals are stunning in this film. All of the
tiny ant scenes are visually outstanding and hilarious. The are two
post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger
universe. Ant Man is a fantastic movie which is worth your money and I
suggest that you see it in cinemas.
