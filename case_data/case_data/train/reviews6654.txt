OK, but very disappointing

I wanna start by saying I do not hate this movie, it is in fact very
rarely I see movies I don't at least think is pretty good. But this was
definitely the biggest disappointment of 2016. I am not sure I can
explain why properly, there was just something about this movie that
made sure I couldn't give it more then 2,5 stars. It is actually quite sad since I think the story is extremely
interesting, and I am 100 percent sure this movie could have turned out
great. Maybe it was driving a bit to much on the black female side of
the story, and I understand it is a big part of the story (if not the
biggest). But it definitely drived on it way to much and somehow ruined
the whole movie for me. Maybe I have no good reason for not liking this movie, and I admit
that. I was just really bored watching this movie. It reminded me of a
cheesy 80's movie, with bad acting, bad story, good effects. Most of
the actors are actually quite good they have just been given some
terrible lines to work with, so I don't blame them. I am gonna finish
by saying, it is an OK movie, and I know many people who liked it, but
I just personally found it terrible. 5/10
