Nicely shot, well acted and utterly pointless

I read many of the reviews on this site before deciding to watch this
movie. And since I really like slow moving psychological thrillers I
gave this move an honest chance. That should not be given.The movie is well shot, well acted, yet utterly uninteresting. The
story does not build up in any straight direction, you never know what
is real and what is not and there is just so much confusion in the
storytelling that I never really knew where I was standing. I began to
wonder if there would be some grand twist in the end, and was waiting
for it through one pointless scene after the other, just to realize the
ending could be seen a mile away and all that confusing storytelling
really amounts to absolutely nothing.I would recommend this movie only to people who can sit through two
hours of something they are not exactly sure whether it is what you are
watching. Just terrible in my opinion. The entirety of the story could
be summed up in 30 minutes and it would make for a wonderful short
movie. But as it is - it is tedious and unrewarding.
