Anticlimactic and very predictable

Recently, the thriller and horror film genre has been producing A+
work, through films like "Don't Breath" and "Get Out." The pacing of
such films builds to different peaks with an ultimate climax that is
unexpected, yet enjoyed. "It Comes at Night" failed in this department. With incredibly strange pacing, the viewer was left waiting for
something that was ultimately never given. The ending summarized is
essentially "don't trust anyone who's not family, because they will
bring a disease into our home and kill the character the audience most
relates with."And some point after the film, I realized that the filmmakers intended
for me to feel sad at the end. Sad for the nice family who was killed,
sad for the baby that was shot, sad for the nice boy who got the
disease, sad for the mother and father for having to kill him. But the
only time I genuinely felt sad was when the dog died. And that's saying
something
