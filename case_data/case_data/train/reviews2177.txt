Metalheads-don't watch it, as you know the world will never get us right

This is a disgrace to the legend that we have cherished more than
anything. A guy who wear a tux and make movies like hairspray, I say,
how dare he makes a 'musical' covering rock n roll. All this movie has
shown is putting the negative stereo type of the black age. Def leppard
and motley crue like bands: they were no rock idol.The movie wanted to show that rock n roll is all about sex. Tom Cruise
portrayed a retard rock star who is sleeping with tens and hundreds of
17 years old and singing like something is shoved in his exit. And also
I did not get the point of him taking off his shirt all the time and
bending backwards while singing as if he is suffering from
constipation.What I felt watching this movie (could only watch till the half of it),
can't be expressed within the constraint of 'using decent words'. The
summary is if I could I would have taken lawsuits against all the cast
and crew of this movie.I am a proud metal-head and an artist as well. The world never got us
right and never will. And I don't see the point of trying to pretend
that they do. And to Tom Cruise-doesn't matter how good actor you are,
if you are not into it, you can act it. Jack black can because he is
one of us.
