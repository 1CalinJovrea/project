Boring ***yawn*** Good ratings, a mystery!

Don't waste money, no story, you don't feel for the characters. The end
is so abrupt every one was waiting that at least director would give
one good scene, but credits appear.2/3 movie is about last movie and it was too hard to relate to any
character and you feel what do I care...in last 30 minutes games start,
no parallel story lines for other participants, again you feel I don't
care if they win or loose. The action scenes are very average and the
entire movie is so predictable.It does not deserve this high rating. You will find it uninteresting
and hard to retain interest for 2 hours and 40 minutes.
