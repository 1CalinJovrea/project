Despite familiar tropes, Geostorm is surprisingly timely, entertaining and with a lot of heart.

In Geostorm, Earth is beset by natural disasters. In facing adversity,
mankind developed a satellite station to prevent these catastrophes.
While people overcame this problem, another conflict arises when it
becomes opportune to use the technology as a weapon for sole global
domination.The setting in which the story takes place, you can say, parallels our
own at the present in which we are experiencing technological
advancements which perks we use to solve our crises but also create
further dilemma as countries individually vie to be the world
superpower. Going to see the movie, I wasn't expecting much for it because it
seemed like a so-so movie that's probably been done before only re-
released with a "semi different plot" under a different title. But I
was surprised by how entertaining it is. There's the timeliness of its
subject, there's definitely humor (which is funny but I thought they
somehow overdid with some of the dialogue) but this one has also
dramatic scenes that would touch you. The pathos really got me
emotionally involved with what the characters are experiencing. This
aspect I really enjoyed. The downside, I can still say that it seems a lot of it's contents were
borrowed from/ inspired by previous natural disaster/sci-fi flicks such
as Day After Tomorrow ( look at one of its posters for instance),
Armageddon, and Gravity to name a few. This might be a turnoff for
moviegoers who are expecting originality and it will most likely be so
but for me, I got over it and had myself a good time in the cinema. It
is definitely not the best movie this year or ever but its up there
with the good, entertaining ones I really enjoyed watching this year.
