complete boring garbage

I can't remember the last time I wanted to walk out of a movie; there
are times I fall asleep but it's rare that I'm suffering enough to
actually leave. I felt that way within 15 minutes of sitting through
"Sex Tape" and it never improved, it just kept getting more agonizingly
crappy. It was bad enough that I don't think I can ever look at Cameron
Diaz again and certainly will never go to another one of her movies.
Jason Segal... that'll take a while as well. The writing was
unimaginably boring, like a bad drama trying to be a comedy. Painful.
Was there some reason that the best friends' kid had it in for Jason
Segal's character, because I never figured that out. Can't imagine what
they were thinking. Just awful massive fail.
