Try and make it past the first story, after that it gets better. If you
cannot quite make it that is understandable. Dustin Hoffman is this
movie. Besides his character, this movie is sub-par. Which is a big
problem considering what happens about halfway through. All of the
actors do well, but they don't seem to have had much to work with. The whole film is all of our characters dealing with Hoffman's self
centered character. If you enjoy watching children argue with, or
indulge their parents. As the parent blatantly calls out his favorite
child, as the siblings compete. Or find funny a father watching his
daughter naked. Here ya go. There are small spurts of (comedy?), some of what they try as comedy is
just jarring, and not funny. if you watch it you will know what I mean.
Again when you make it past the first story the comedy gets better as
well. The editing is weird. There are a lot of scenes cut mid-word. Or cut as
soon as the emotion elevates. The background music seems to never stop,
and is loud. There will be a conversation going on, and you will barely
be able to hear it. Even important conversations about Hoffmans health. It's always a sign that you are in for a tough watch when the glowing
reviews state that the film has levels, and that you have to look
beneath the surface. It's a decent flick. Is it worth the two hour
investment? I don't think so, maybe to see how Ben Stiller and Sandler
play off each other. I guess it's something else to watch on Netflix. I
don't know. Maybe it's worth it just to watch Stiller attempt to cry. I
came on here to see what others thought, and they all seemed to be on
the poles, nothing along the equator. Normally I would have just used
the discussion section, but IMDb wants to stop cyber bullying by
removing discussion.
