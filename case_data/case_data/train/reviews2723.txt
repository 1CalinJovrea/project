Heartbroken and disappointed :/

I'm a huge Alien fan and was massively impressed by Prometheus, and
like all avid Alien fans I was excited to see Convenant - but what an
utter disappointment.I thought the beginning was spectacular, except for the fact an obvious
and critical error was made to explore an unknown planet. Then the
face-palm moments increased at an alarming pace. The scene where the first Alien was born, and the events leading up to
it, was simply painful to watch. e.g. why would a specially trained
scientist hug a clearly infected soldier while he's having a seizure
and bleeding all over the place? simple - poor writing. I have to say the moment when the 2 Aliens attacked from the bushes was
intense and highly suspenseful, but that was the only relief before it
was obvious I'd wasted my money.The fact that David was scarier than the Aliens, that one idiotic
decision was made after the other, and that many questions after
Prometheus were left unanswered - make Alien Covenant a monumental
failure. What a crying shame.
