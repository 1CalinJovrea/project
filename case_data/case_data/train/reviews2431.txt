Denzel's Showcase

Flight will rank alongside The Lost Weekend, Leaving Las Vegas, etc as
one of the classic films about alcoholism. It features, in my view,
Denzel Washington's greatest performance to date. It is so easy to
overplay a drunk but extremely difficult to get it right and Denzel is
spot on and totally believable here as an alcoholic. Also, not many A
list actors would play such an unsympathetic character.Perhaps the biggest surprise is Robert Zemeckis's decision to do what
is basically a character study. However, as shown in his previous films
what he brings to the table here is to ensure that as well as studying
this flawed character, we have a thoroughly gripping and entertaining
movie. In addition to Denzel's standout performance, all the other
performances are great. John Goodman balances the drama with the right
dose of humour. Go and see it, but not on board a flight!
