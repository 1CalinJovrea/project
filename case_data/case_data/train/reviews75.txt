Loved It!!!

In all honesty I can't remember the first film that well, so I found it
hard to compare to the sequel. On the other hand this film is
completely memorable and so enjoyable.I saw the preview and I absolutely loved it. I was worried that all the
good bits were in the adverts but the film was full of exciting and
hilarious parts that aren't in the advert. The minions are so funny, I was actually crying with laughter at some
parts. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I am taking my little brother to
see it again (mainly so I can see it again! Hehe) The characters are lovable, hate able, and hilarious, the film has
evolved from the first one (from what I can remember) and its such a
heart warming family film.I COMPLETELY Recommend THIS FILM :)
