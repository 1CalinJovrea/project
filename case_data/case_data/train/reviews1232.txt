Funny film with some shipshape moments, tremendous laughs and ace action.

Ah, I love this film - somewhat hilarious and has exciting action
scenes, amazing on-screen chemistry and genuine (b)romance. It's like
the perfect blend of both action and comedy, with some minor dramatic
scenes and little adds here and there. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum,
admittedly, are ace in this film. They're simply hilarious and they're
a great team. One's a little bit of a dork, quite chubby and funny
(Jonah Hill), and the other's "hot", apparently, and is slim,
quite-built and rather tall....in comparison (Channing Tatum). 21 Jump street is a laugh-a-minute thrill ride of an action-comedy that
never fails, as it lives up to its expectations (if you've not seen it,
you'll be left satisfied....and you may need to change your
pants!)Better than most action-comedies out there and it has better
stars too. They're great working together - almost as good a pair as
Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. Overall, a very funny action-comedy with great stars and favourable
moments. I wonder if the second one surpasses it. Thanks for reading.
