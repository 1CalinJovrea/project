Beautifully animated and fun filled family adventure

Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is
one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This
film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the
film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's
plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very
enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling
characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I
have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the
character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite
character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny,
inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and
assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie
to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!
