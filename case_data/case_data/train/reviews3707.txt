3
Action over writing (spoiler free)

I'm generously giving this movie 3 stars simply because Kate Beckensale
is so very hot in a black cat suit and because the action was
impressive. Unfortunately, the writing was seriously lacking, which is
pretty sad since I didn't go in with terribly high expectations in the
first place. Without giving away any spoilers, the story was virtually
non-existent. I'm not saying to avoid this movie altogether, just to
know what you're getting onto, lots of flash and next to no substance.
This is NOT on par with the original Underworld, nor Rise of the
Lycans. Even Evolution was better, and that was pretty forgettable.
Kate, however, continues to impress as Selene, though her age will
belie her vampire nature soon if they keep making sequels. The amount
of makeup on her face was actually distracting in this film, especially
since there was no time set aside between beat downs for her to apply
Ru Paul style cake. But, these are small matters. The real issues are
related to the story itself and I'm trying to avoid mentioning
specifics. Speedman's absence was sorely felt too, despite the infusion
of a new piece of beefcake for the ladies.
