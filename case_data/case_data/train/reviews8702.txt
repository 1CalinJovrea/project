Tale of Two

The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or Grand
Hotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental,
or hotels in movies are places to be avoided). Dysfunctional characters
drift through, delivering their lines with humorous lack of awareness
and emotion, strange rituals are performed to bond the guests, and all
the time the clock is ticking - find a partner, become a couple, within
45 days or be turned into an animal of your choice.The first part of the film is amusing, quirky and entertaining. The
style is pleasant and interesting, despite some nasty moments. Some of
the shots drag a little, but it adds to the curious atmosphere. The
dry, deadpan dialogue is perfectly delivered, Colin Farrell as the main
protagonist shows he really is a fine actor.Then the film changes. New characters are introduced and the mood
becomes much bleaker. No longer is this humorous, the stakes have
changed. It is hard to identify with the new characters as we had
already invested emotion in the earlier ones. And it gets worse,
leading to en ending that is as unclear as it is unpleasant.The Lobster cannot seem to make up its mind what kind of a film it is,
is it simply saying that we are all venal and craven in the end? If so,
why the humour at the beginning? And if we are capable of love, is it
really so shallow as to be broken by people saying things?I loved the beginning, I didn't like the end. This was one fish dish
that left a bad taste.
