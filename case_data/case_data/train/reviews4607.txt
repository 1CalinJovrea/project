Shake, Shake, Shake...  Shake, Shake, Shake... Shake That Camera...

If there wasn't so much expository dialog about how formidable Denzel
Washington's rogue agent Tobin Frost is, maybe he wouldn't have to live
up to all that infamy once the story's underway.Beginning with a botched heist in South Africa, leading to Frost
turning himself in to the C.I.A. and taken to the first of three Safe
Houses, where he's watched by a young agent Weston played by an
extremely serious Ryan Reynolds.But there are a lot of really nasty people who want him dead, and the
first of several bombastic action scenes, practically impossible to
view as the camera rocks back and forth without ceasing, leads to
Weston, with Frost as his prisoner, taking to the streets  till Frost
shakes his tail and When the duo meet again, and we realize the bad
guys are supposed to be the good guys (like in every Hollywood film
involving the C.I.A.), it's a desperate fight for both agents, now
teamed up, to stay alive.Washington turns in a surprisingly bland performance as a character
who, like a Hannibal Lector, is supposed to get into people's minds;
and for an agent of his legendary caliber, he seems more confused than
cunning. Reynolds holds onto a one-note scowl, and a side story with
his beautiful, put-upon girlfriend means absolutely nothing.But it's that ever-shaky camera that really sinks this clichéd
thriller. Take plenty of sea sick pills before getting on this ride,
and prepare to blame America all over again. It's getting awfully
tiresome...For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com
