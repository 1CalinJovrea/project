Cheap, lazy characterizations

It seemed very promising that the film would feature figures such as
Karl Marx, novelist George Gissing, and Douglas booth playing a drag
queen. But, the former two are just there to take cheap shots at.George Gissing fell in love with a prostitute when he was a college
student, and he wound up going to jail because he stole things from his
campus in order to keep her afloat financially. After leaving prison,
they embarked on a very unhappy marriage together. So, no, George
Gissing was not a 'virtue signaling' "white knight" going around
bragging about his past and wife. In one of his best novels (which
deserve adaptation into film,) 'Born In Exile,' he describes some of
this history and the impact it left on him.So no, I don't appreciate the detective sneering at him because he was
so swayed by sociopathic lying serial killer murderer of children
Lizzie (borden.) The screenwriter also seems to wrongly believe that
destitute, homeless working class boys in the era didn't experience
similar abuses. A cheap, empty film issuing blind polemics that tries
and fails to make it's main character, a user and abuser, sympathetic,
or interesting.
