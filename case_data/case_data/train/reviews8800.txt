Ridiculous!

As an experienced diver, I found this film totally ridiculous and have
trouble believing that this film has an IMDb rating of 5.8 to date.The stupidity of the characters was so bad that it was hard to believe
that they were so stupid. There were so many technical flaws that I
presume that the makers have never even been near the sea, never mind
been diving. Plus how many crappy dive trips that are so low budget
have full face masks with microphones? My 11 year old son was on the
seat of his pants, the grown ups went on to do other things after a
painstaking hour.Don't waste your time with this film
