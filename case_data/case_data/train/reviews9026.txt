In my opinion, the most overrated movie of 2016

Overall: This movie is the most overrated movie of 2016 for me. It had
some highs but many more lows for me. I don't think it deserves the
praise it receives.Good: 1. I won't deny that the CGI in this movie is some of the greatest I've
ever seen and 100% deserves the Oscar. It is practically flawless and
would receive an 11/10 if I judged movies solely on that. Alas, I do
not.2. The voice actors did great jobs even if I think there were some bad
calls of judgement for who voiced who.3. I respect Neel Sethi for doing what he did under the conditions he
was in. Despite this, I couldn't buy his acting but he does deserve
respect for it.4. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken and Ben Kingsley were perfectly
casted.Bad:1. As stated before, I couldn't buy the kids acting.2. I believe that both Idris Elba and Scarlett Johanson, while giving a
reasonable performance, were not fit for the role they were in and much
prefer the original cast for both them roles. 3. The story was quite weak for me. I don't care if it's identical to
the book, I really didn't like the way it was presented and written.4. The songs in the movie were stupid. Nostalgic? Yes! Brilliant for
animated film? 100%! Fit for realistic looking animals? No. It doesn't
look or feel right to see a jolly bear or a huge monkey sing.5. The film is much darker and less happy than the original. I'm all up
for a gritter, more mature reboot but this was so devoid of life and
joy that the slight attempts at humour just fell flat and felt wrong. I
much prefer the happier tone of the original Jungle Book.6. There are quite a few annoyances, such as how they clear up the
fire, that I thought were annoying and lazy.5/10
