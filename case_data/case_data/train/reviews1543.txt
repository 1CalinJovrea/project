boring movie

As a screenwriter this movie really upset me - a bunch of journalists
expose a case, where hundreds of children have been molested by
priests, and covered up by the church. How do the journalists expose
it? they call up a bunch of guys who said it before, but nobody
listened to them. No doubt it's an important story, however I didn't
detect any brilliant journalism - this is not All the President's Men,
nor is it The Verdict where Paul Newman battled against the church.
Spotlight reporters never stray in the dark or risk anything - the
story is basically handed to them on a silver platter, and they only
verify it. Drama? hell with it. worst of all - No brilliant cinema, no
actions, just dialogue about this and that, we hardly get to know the
characters outside of work, so we don't care about them. Bottom line is
that this horrible case leaves hardly any impact. By the end of the
movie you just realize that there have been pedophile priests. Didn't
we already know this? No climax, no anticlimax, no heroes to root for.
Hell I don't understand the raving reviews.
