The worst film I've ever seen

While not having particularly high expectations, it must be said, I did
go into this film with an open mind. However only a few minutes in and
I already felt the urge to leave and fill my brain with something less
awful and mind rotting.It's not just the non-existent plot and hammy acting that let this film
down, although they were major factors, the chemistry between the two
leads was like watching two planks of wood getting together. None of
what I saw made me believe he was an irresistible sex god with a dark
side. And with Ana, let's just say biting ones lip every time something
is suggested gets a bit old.Furthermore, without wanting to spoil, is her IQ supposed to be about
50? I have to ask because she pretty much agrees to everything he says,
and not in a dom/sub kind of way, more just because she doesn't seem to
have the mental ability to argue. You have to wonder how she's employed
in the first place.I've seen some absolutely dire films but I can honestly say this is the
worst film I've ever seen.
