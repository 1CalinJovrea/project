Exquisitely made dramatic knockout

A fantastic film about a country whose history is seldom portrayed, A
Royal Affair is a historical drama set in the latter half of the 18th
century in Denmark. An English girl is sent off to marry the Danish
king, only to find out that he's not fully sane. In her loneliness she
falls for the king's doctor, and they find they share not only amorous
feelings for one another, but a passion for Enlightenment ideas and
political reforms.There are a few caricatures in this movie that keep me from giving it a
higher score: the reactionary forces are pure, unalloyed evil; the
reformers are probably far more liberal in thinking than would have
been possible in that era; and the preaching against established
religion is a bit thick. But otherwise, this is a gem of a movie with
outstanding performances in all three key roles, particularly the
doctor who is portrayed with an incredible intensity and realism. Also
noteworthy is the king who is not quite sane yet not totally loony
either; the acting here is frighteningly good and utterly convincing.
Last but not least, the queen excels in showing real pathos and
long-suffering endurance trapped in her destiny, and then comes alive
beautifully in her relationship with the doctor.As icing on the cake, costumes are sumptuous, period settings flawless,
and the music is era-appropriate and delightfully arcane. Original
music is also quite good, though most of the time one is so engrossed
in the story that the music just vanishes. Movie is almost all in
Danish with English subtitles, and I felt the size/font choice for the
titles was too big, too pushy, you never quite forget that you're
reading titles.This is a tale of exploration of the darker side of the human
experience: what does it mean to be sane, how can a divinely ordained
monarch be deprived of his wits, to what lengths will a person go to
promote his/her progeny into power, are the "unwashed masses" really
grateful to those who try to emancipate them? This movie (and its three
main characters) will haunt you for many days.
