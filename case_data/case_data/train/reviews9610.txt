A real surprise

This film was a real surprise to me. I was expecting something that was
a cross between Kevin Sorbo's TV show and Wrath of the Titans. But the
producers chose a completely different direction for this re-telling.
Aside from the shorts at the beginning we see no monsters. Nor do we
see beautiful gods and goddesses. Hercules' greatest enemy in this
story is the very real (and human) threat of betrayal and treachery.
And rather than a one man- show, we see Hercules aided by a band of
loyal friends who are every bit as skilled as the demigod. The film
raises the question what is more important: what others believe of you
or what you believe about yourself? The film has a bevy of great actors
including John Hurt, Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell and I think Dwayne
Johnson is perfect for the main role.
