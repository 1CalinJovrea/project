Shallow, boring, a complete waste of money.

Jupiter Ascending, a film that deals with subjects that I'm sure a
millennia old advanced species would have no interest in, such as
wealth, materialism, physical appearances and girl crushes. A totally
shallow film with not a single redeeming feature. The Wachowski
Brothers should be ashamed of themselves. It was a good job we had a
gift certificate because if we had spent the full £20 on the film I
would have been mortified. I walked out before the end of the film as I
didn't care the slightest about the fate of any of the characters and
it was pretty obvious that the ending would be a complete happy ending
cliché. These sorts of films make me want to give up on the modern film
industry, they only spew out high budget garbage to appease the idiots.
Excuse me while I go watch some Hitchcock or something. Urgh.
