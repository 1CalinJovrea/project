Remarkably good.

I fully expected this film to be slightly underwhelming but possibly a
bit of fun and I never read any reviews on here or elsewhere before
watching it. It was very funny, witty and thoroughly absorbing. The
acting was excellent - Matt Smith, as others have said is wonderful -
and the production superb. The peculiarities of the novel are self
evident and, when the zombie influences are absent, you could think you
are watching another excellent version of Pride and Prejudice. I have
now read many reviews on here and am pleased to find that many
reviewers have given the film praise. The low score is disappointing so
I can only assume that many people have just written off the film
either not having watched it or are just trying to be clever and above
it all. Some reviews I've read are really quite pompous in their
approach. If you have an open mind, an imagination and, preferably a
liking for both Austen and zombies you will find this film
irresistible. I have noticed that some reviewers say this is just a
Victorian / zombie romance. It's Georgian, more precisely Regency and,
although a romance, is a story of manners. Great stuff.
