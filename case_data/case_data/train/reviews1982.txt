Just amazing

I enjoyed this movie far more than i expected to.Things i liked.The relationship between judy hopps and nick wilde was really special
and i enjoyed watching their interaction and growing friendship, they
are both as heroic and smart as one another and although judy is this
adventurous and outgoing go getter type of character for a few brief
scenes she also had an emotional side i think it was delivered with
great balance. I take zero pleasure admitting tears were in my eyes
throughout this movie.The humour although present throughout was never shoved down your
throat which lead to a nice upbeat and colourful atmosphere and that's
not to mention all the great design decisions behind the world created
here. For example Ergonomics with giraffes in mind e.g a funnel to
deliver a drink from ground level to giraffe height and small doors for
mice. People should watch this movie for the world alone.I could continue to shower this gem with praise but instead i'll list
the things that bothered me about this film, the first thing is that
the film was too short like no really i wish this film lasted an hour
or so longer, the plot seems incredibly rushed at the end i never saw
the plot twist coming and didn't predict the direction the film would
go down but i feel it's because the culprit behind it all has come and
gone within 5 minutes is arrested there's no build up or tension in the
uncovering of the secrets behind the commotion which is a shame. I also
feel like the chief of police was a relatively poor character and most
of the characters in the film could do with more fleshing out.All things said and done go watch this it is great.
