Hmmm...

First of all, I must say that I was expecting 'something different'
considering the 7.3 note here! Something really worth of that note, but
this is not that great!As many have pointed out, this film has a problem with ending. I would
have ended the film when she sees the birds flying. But that alien /
mars attacks ending was just totally out of the blue. Totally not
connecting with the film ( though I admit it proves the story that
something bad had happened). I mean... even if they really wanted the
alien ending, it could have been more subtle. This was like you added a
totally different movie to the one you are doing.Good point is that you really DO NOT know if the guy who held the girl
in the basement is good or bad. We do not know if he killed anyone
before he took the life of the guy in the basement. Everything is up to
you to decide. All in all, he is actually a good guy from what we were
seeing up to the point when he shot the guy ( but only when he said he
would take his gun).All in all, this maybe could have a better note if it wasn't for such
laughable ending. I did not like it.5 from me.
