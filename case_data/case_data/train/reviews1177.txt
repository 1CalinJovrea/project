Worth a look IF you get a free ticket.

Essentially a third rate comedy dressed up with boring and excessive
special effects, this one is about half as good as a Three Stooges
short subject. Lots of big dollars squandered in order to jack the
price up to the reported $17.50 price. We paid $8.25 and saw it in 2D;
just fine.Old timers can remember when we watched a comedy there were many people
laughing. Sweet memory! This time there were maybe two knee-slap
laughs. There was no significant laughter going on at our showing.They ought to have spent $200 or so on a historian. I was OK with the
fish monster and some of the other sight gags, but Will Smith could not
have stolen the Cadillac from in front of the Roosevelt Hotel in 1969
because that property was closed and boarded up. Few tourists in NYC
due to extreme crime problems. Similarly, they show us normal "family
crowd" folks enjoying Coney Island. Not in 1969, folks! As New York was
sinking in a cess pool of drugs, violent crime, corruption and losing
20% of its population, visit Coney Island with two large friends for a
hot dog at Nathan's; walk in any direction past blocks and blocks of
boarded up abandoned houses, many with the boards ripped off by the
heroin addicted squatters. Families being happy? No way! Today, sure;
not in 1969, not 5 years prior or 10 years after. The story need not
have been in NYC, but if so they ought not paint a false picture of it.
