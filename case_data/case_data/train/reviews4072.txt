This movie amazingly hilarious!!!

I didn't think that the first movie could be beaten but I was proved
wrong!! It was incredibly made and the story was great, you need to
watch this movie!!! Well done Elizabeth Banks!!!Every scene was great and the movie was perfect, it was full of jokes
great songs, the new Bellas fit in well and the love story behind Fat
Amy and Bumper is hilarious, their public kiss was just crazy
hilarious, I think that there should have been more of them and their
love life in this movie as it would have made the movie even better!!
All of them grew up and they are better singers, Aubrey isn't her
manipulating self and it's great!!Just great!
