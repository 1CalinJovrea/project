Surpassed Expectations

Already drawn to the premise of this film, I had high expectations of
it, and was particularly interested in seeing Blake Lively in the lead
role as a 107 year old eternally young woman. From only seeing her work
in Gossip Girl, which was adequate but not particularly memorable, I
was keen to see what her acting range was like. Not only did Lively
impress me, but the film did also, surpassing my expectations. The Age of Adaline is not only visually beautiful, (props to
cinematographer David Lanzenberg) but the story is also. Yes, this is a
romance film, but the evocative story raises questions from the viewer
about life, death, and love. Michiel Huisman is great in his role as a
sensitive romantic who yearns to be close to and understand Adaline -
well done to the writers for creating a male romantic lead who isn't
unrealistically perfect and clich√©. Harrison Ford impressed me greatly,
especially in his scenes with Lively, so much so that I was brought to
tears through a mere look. Ellen Burstyn as Flemming provided a
charming voice of reason for the protagonist. The score was also
wonderfully done, making the emotional scenes all the more powerful,
and the costume designer did very well in allowing the audience to fill
in the time blanks without knowing the era through the narrated dates. Overall, a beautifully crafted film with a wonderful story and powerful
performances that will completely captivate the viewers.
