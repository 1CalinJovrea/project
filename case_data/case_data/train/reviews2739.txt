Not About Gambling

This movie is about a man who has given up hope on achieving his dreams
and is trying to make his pain stop by engaging in self destructive
behavior... his weapon of choice is gambling but he is not a gambler.
He says so multiple times. I have read the many negative reviews of
this movie and I think people are really just missing the point. He
wants a real love and something real to do every day and if he achieve
anything beyond mediocrity then he would rather be dead. People who can
relate with that sentiment will love this movie but perhaps no one
else. If you enjoy a movie that makes you think a little and go beyond
what's on the surface. The movie is not about gambling... it is about
finding inspiration and hope.
