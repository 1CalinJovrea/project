Unexpectedly Good, Worth The Money

Basically, if you're a romantic drama type, you'll love this movie. I'm
NOT a romantic drama type, and I still enjoyed it immensely. The
shining star, no pun intended, for me was Channing Tatum. He added so
much subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, comedy to the movie. The
ending was also not expected but I was satisfied with it. That said
though, I could have easily watched another 30 minutes of this. No one
was ready for it to end and that's a good sign. The plot is what it is,
being based on a true story and all. It felt like the screenwriters and
director wanted to stay close to the actual events and it worked. I
would have paid for this and been happy. Romance drama fans will be
pleased. Non romance drama fans will be pleased.
