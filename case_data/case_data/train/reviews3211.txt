Terrible in a 100 different ways

I have never reviewed before but this definitely warrants it. The
script was terrible, the action was ruined by the fact that he could
have killed lots of innocent people and police officers. The detectives
were terrible at their jobs and it was ruined by the 12 (pg-13)
certificate because there was no blood which made the action scenes
unrealistic and boring. A 6.1 out of ten is the most generous rating i
have ever seen on IMDb. Six people walked out of the cinema when i saw
it and i have never come so close but i refused as i had payed. If you
do see this then start watching with the lowest expectations that are
humanely possible.
