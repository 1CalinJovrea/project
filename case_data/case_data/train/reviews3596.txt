An Open Letter to Seth Rogan

Dear Seth,I just watched your latest effort in the "Neighbors". Here are a few
tips for you, your current and future directors, writers, producers and
movie execs, to help you to not make another movie that my somewhat
intoxicated adult friends turn off less than half way through.1. Saying "F*ck" in every sentence does not give you street cred, nor
is it particularly humorous after about 5 seconds. 2. You are in crappy
physical shape. Quit having your writers put in sex scenes with you and
the obviously unattainable women you are cast with. The sexual
chemistry between you and Rose Byrne was about as believable as the
chemistry between a swan and a water buffalo. 3. Watching a nearly
middle-aged man-child get f'd up on shrooms, pot, etc. is about as
entertaining as watching a dog lick its b*lls. It is mildly
entertaining for about 10 seconds, and then is simply disgusting and
annoying. 4. You are NOT a modern Jimmy Stewart "everyman" character.
You are in fact the very antithesis of that. Overweight, pot smoking,
video game playing D'bags that refuse to grow up have very little in
common with folks that have to work for a living, raise a family and
muddle through. 5. You are a middling character actor that, through
some Faustian bargain, has become a quasi-leading man in romantic,
raunchy comedies. Grow the F up, learn a little more range of emotion
than "Holy F*ck Man" and "I'm so F*cked up", and maybe you can keep you
soul (if you indeed ever had one).Sincerely, Raynjuls
