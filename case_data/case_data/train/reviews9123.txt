Enemy Review

Summer 2014 has come and gone and with it we got stories of
superheroes,dragons,and of course apes on horses!However with the end
of the scorcher season comes Autumn,a darker time where darker movies
come out and to send of thr summer I end it with a review of a film
that tackles adultery,self-conflict,totalitarianism and other much
darker themes.The film is called Enemy,and it might be the most
compelling film I have seen in 2014.Enemy is the story of history teacher,Adam Bell (JAKE GYLLENHAAL)
who,one day out of the blue,gets a movie recommendation EHðŸ˜ƒ from a
coworker.So he finds the movie at a local rental store and upon a
rewatch,discovers that a certain actor in the movie looks exactly like
him,minus an awesome beard.So Adam discovers the man is Anthony
Claire(ALSO played by GYLLENHAAL),who's a small time actor,who actually
happens to live in the same neighborhood himself,and the two look
alikes to unravel just what the hell is going on and as a person who
really supports going into these kinds of movies as oblivious as
possible that's really all I wanna say about the plot.It's a
pretty...riveting film to say the least.That being said,this is NOT by any means a movie for everyone!Not just
because of the unconventional way the film or the story are crafted,but
just because of the touchy subject matter that the movie portrays.The
simple story of JAKE GYLLENHAAL'S twin characters may sound like a
Lindsay Lohan style,quircky time but let me tell you guys that the
story of Enemy,when really looked into,is really a well written and
acted story of a man who's trying to overcome his inner demons and
personal problems that are wrecking his life and loved ones.It's a hard
movie to review and more of a movie for discussion.And THAT ladies and
gentlemen is why I like this movie WAY more than most people might!The
symbology and images used to tell the story like the use of spiders is
great.I love when a movie can tell a story by mere images and scenes
that contain very little dialog,it's credit to director,DENIS
VILLENEUVE'S excellent vision and the strong cast performances.Which brings me to Mr.JAKE GYLLENHAAL,his performance in this movie is
terrific.May I remind you that he plays two roles,which means two
different characters,both with their own unique physical
trademarks,ways of speaking,even walking posture and that's why I was
so blown away by how good,JAKE pulled of his roles.His career has
really blossomed as of late and with NIGHTCRAWLER releasing in a few
months I've got this guy on my top actors to watch list.There is a
supporting cast as well,with MELANIE LAURENT and SARAH GADON both who
are really great opposite the two Jakes.I really enjoyed their
characters and the raw emotion that they showcase.The movie is technically flawless to me,some people might get turned
off by the simple color palette but it really gave the movie the right
look and tone.The musical score is also fantastic,you can tell a lot of
it may have been inspired by the movies of ALFRED HITCHCOCK like
VERTIGO'S classic score.Actually a lot of this entire movie really
feels influenced by HITCHCOCK'S work.ENEMY is my favorite kind of movie,one that promotes
thought,discussion,and really shows that movies can be SOOO much more
than MEGAN FOX running in slo-mo or constant reboots and sequels.There
are unique stories that can be told by talented story tellers in ways
that may not be told in a traditional,movie way.ENEMY is a movie that
sucks you in with it's characters,performances,and sheer mystery at
what might happen in the next scene.It's a powerful character study,a
really suspenseful psychological thriller and I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST
RECOMMENDATION! BUY THIS MOVIE!Unless you can't stand art films,just
don't bother. 8/10What about you guys? Have you seen or even heard of ENEMY? Are you
