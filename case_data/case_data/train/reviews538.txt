I guess that for once I was easy to please!

" Monsters University" is a new film from Pixar that is a prequel to
their film "Monsters Inc.". In addition to the two main characters, a
whole lot of new characters are introduced at the college that Mike and
Sully attended. The plot involves Mike trying to become a 'scaring
major'something quite unthinkable since he isn't the least bit scary.
There's a lot more to the film than this, but I won't spoil it by
saying more about the plot.My daughter was lucky enough to go to the debut of "Monsters
University". She liked it but also felt the story was disappointing
since it lacked original characters and the story reminded her of too
many college films (like "Revenge of the Nerds" and "Animal House"). My
wife saw it with me and she said that the film put her to sleep! This
is all very odd, as I am usually the most difficult to please in the
family when it comes to filmsyet I thoroughly enjoyed the film and
nearly gave it a 9. While I would agree it lacks originality, it did
make me smile. It was a nice, gentle filmone that I didn't mind just
watching without picking it apart (like I usually do). Much of this is
because the CGI was simply gorgeous and It was a pleasure watching such
a beautiful filmas well as such a nice and enjoyable film.
