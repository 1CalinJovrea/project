A ridiculous mess

This here tries to be a sophisticated modern day thriller...but falls
flat time after time.Michael Douglas is shocking and Bloom is tepid at best.Naomi Rapace is marvelous usually..like in The Drop, but she is wasted
in this.At one point I was having a giggle at the really bad script.Mush better than the pathetic London Has Fallen...but that is not
really a good thing.This should have really been straight to DVD.Save your money and buy a new hat!
