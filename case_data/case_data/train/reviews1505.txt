Even worse than the 1998 version.

Worse film ever! save your money and don't go. Godzilla is only in the
film for a maximum of 10 minutes, the rest of the 90 minutes or so,
that I lost of my life, is filled with mediocre acting that was about
as exciting as treading on an upturned plug with no shoes on. I got the
impression that the majority of the budget was spent on the sets and
actors, leaving the effects for Godzilla until last, which resulted in
him having minimal time in the film. Literally, up until the 70 minute
mark, you only saw a tail and a few spines from his back. When a
headshot finally materialised, it was only for a matter of seconds. I
genuinely feel short changed and would strongly recommend that anyone
planning to see the film should wait for it to come out on DVD.
