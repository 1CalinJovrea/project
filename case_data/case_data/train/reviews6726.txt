Good Ride and Twist to the Clown Genre...

I just watched this movie last night. I'm a sucker for a good clown
movie, I'm always searching for something that tops Penny Wise, which
scared the crap out of me back in 1990.I will start out with I LOVED THIS movie. It doesn't top penny wise but
it puts a good twist to the clown genre. It comes in at close 2nd
place! The movie starts out fast, you get to grab all the details up
front within the 1st 10 minutes. It actually gets pretty funny after
right wards then it gets real from there on out. It does have 2 slow
spots, it rolls pretty fast. The clown looks awesome! you get to see it
develop throughout the movie, which is a nice slow burn. Its just not
like BAM here it is... its a slow progression. It doesn't look like
Bozo the Clown with blood, it looks like a real monster, which was
awesome! I've read a lot of reviews on how parts of the movie are not
realistic. I could see 2 parts, but you know, its a fictional movie.This does have a feel of a fast paced Sci-Fi channel movie in the
beginning, but then it starts to rev up into a real movie.The ending is really predictable, but its a good ending, its not
confusing, it ends on a good note. After you watch that movie, your
clown phobia will def take new heights.If you want a good scare, with a few laughs, this is it for you. I
watched it on a big screen, Oppo blue ray, with a nice surround sound.
Oh man! it was great!!
