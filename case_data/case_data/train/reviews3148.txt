If you are wondering about negative reviews, don't

I mean, don't be surprised. Yes, Tomorrowland is a science fiction adventure of the highest grade,
an unpredictable thrill ride of a movie, full of plot twists,
jaw-dropping imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and brilliant acting
by major star power. Not to mention the great direction and editing
that does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length.
Disney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird. Clooney and Laurie, Robertson
and Cassidy. Wood and Murch. Giacchino. Rule-breaking and ingenious,
inspiring and fresh, this is a top notch entertainment from a top notch
talent. But it is more than all that. It is also a fable, a tale of two wolves.
It makes its moral pretty clear.The thing is, people a fable is addressed to usually do not find it
funny or cute. I wonder how many 'dumb', 'disappointing', 'preachy',
'pointless', 'boring', 'leftist propaganda', 'I fell asleep right when
the Grasshopper...' Aesop was getting in his time. That is why Tomorrowland was a very brave thing to do. It takes guts to
make a movie where everything from start to finish very smartly, very
carefully, very distinctly adds up to the core message 'negativity is a
failure' -- and to release it in a world full of negative people. Wow.
I get why they hate it. I can also see why Brad Bird skipped Star Wars
to make it. Personally, I think it was worth it. Thanks, Brad!
