About as tender as a toilet roll

Having just come back from the UK Premier, I can honestly say, that was
quite simply appalling. Only Kill Your Friends is a worse film of 2015.I absolutely loved Enter the Void with a passion, the poster has been
my iPhone screen saver ever since. It was slick, stylish, sexy and
trippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what the
director was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due to
the appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where on
earth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing to
show his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered with
such a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anything
he says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film which
lacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is the
Warmest Colour and 9 Songs. Caspar Noe, you have let us done badly here. Go back to making in your
face trippy films.
