The lowest form of cinematic expression.

Yeah. The title pretty much sums it.Cheesy dialogs, the same old awkward situations that eventually lead to
dramatic stupid dialogs, and then things are suddenly better.I'm not saying the first ones were good for something, but this one
gives a new meaning to the term generic movie. This is so bad that the
actors seem to do it with a sour taste in their mouth.If you expect the same old basic aborted Hollywood script, that says
nothing, then this movie is for you. Otherwise avoid it. It's not even
funny when it should be funny. I come to think that the recent study
that correlates being fat with being stupid (in US) has a direct and
harmful consequence over many things people produce. The market will
continue to make these kind of movies, because stupid folks are ready
to pay money. Just because the ratings are good, doesn't mean this
movie deserves more than one star!Avoid it. And yeah, this is not a subjective opinion, because American
Reunion is garbage, fact!
