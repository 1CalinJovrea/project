Sorry but it sucks...Why is it rated so highly ?

I know making movie in general is a long tedious process and no offense
to maker. I appreciate all the hard work it might have gone
through.This movie is not mainstream,clearly aimed at oldies Westerners
living in a small place and were Scout goers who enjoy being
melancholic.Somebody who would love to run away when they were boring
kid. I think rating is too high of 8 without any reason. Some funny
bits but you have to be dumb,quirky and boring to watch it. Movie
didn't make me think or connect with me even though I tried very
hard.It is no way that great that it has to go to Oscars.Story too
simple and humor too quirky. I can not believe the cast got ready to do
this film especially Bruce Willis.The movie does capture the
awkwardness of child growing to teenager but characters lacked emotions
or major transformation.Maybe sometimes it is good to have simple
quirky story but sorry not for me.
