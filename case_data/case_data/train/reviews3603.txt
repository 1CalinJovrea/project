Mindless

This is one of the worst Michael Bay movies yet.It never stops, it taught i was going insane... just mindless action
with almost no breathers.Escapism at its worst.Tough if you like a confused plot, bad performances, disgusting
monologue, horrible mindless action, horrible comedy, really bad
timing, terrible editing and getting your energy sucked out slowly and
brutally during what feels like eons... Then by all means, go waste
your money.This is not a tribute to Transformers. It's a hymn to the mindless, and
shallow escapism which has boomed in Hollywood the last 20 years with
the coming of the digital era(Even tough there are good digital
movies). Not even worth the illegal act of downloading. Glad i got this
paid by a friend who insisted i joined. Last time.Cheers
