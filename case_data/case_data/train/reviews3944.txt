What Ever Happened to Charm in the Movies?

"The Edge of Seventeen" is really two films. The first half is a sloppy
teen comedy with very few laughs. The second half is a syrupy coming of
age story that is not believable. Neither the comedy nor the serious
drama succeed in their objectives.The only character whose scenes are engrossing is the lazy high school
history teacher played by Woody Harrelson. His banter with his student
Nadine actually has a spark of life. Unfortunately, Nadine's character,
who drives the film, is so unpleasant that it is impossible to
empathize with her growing pains.Nearly every relationship in the film lacked an essential level of
honesty. Nadine's beloved father seemed far too old. The relationship
of Nadine with her older brother was never credible. The treatment
Nadine's mother by her daughter was deplorable. And it made no sense
that Nadine would reject her best friend for dating her brother.The main ingredient missing in this film was charm. The ungainly
seventeen-year-old would have been much more likable and the film would
have been much more watchable, if only she had an ounce of charm.
