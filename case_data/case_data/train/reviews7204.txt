An awful, sometimes disgusting and boring movie

Regarding all the critics and expectations for a topic presented like
that, I would just say that this could not keep me interested for more
than 10 minutes on the movie. The first music itself (rammstein) at
least tries to gain your attention, makes me remember some
psychological movie, which would at least makes you feel disgusted
(like Srpski Film) or disoriented (like Irreversible), and make you
think a little bit on the point of having watched it, to gain a certain
sensibility, or a different perception on a specific case.After the song, all I could see was a porn movie, filmed on a couple of
bizarre angles, with a little but none background, of a person who is
sad, boring, with a depressing tone of voice, and some pseudo-cult
aspects. Sad, plain sad. Boring, plain boring. Luckily, I was able to awake my mind from this non-thrilling and boring
story, after Rammstein song started to play again on the credits.I like to keep track of the notes given on the movies on IMDb, but his
undeniably DO NOT deserve this hype. If I knew, I would keep distance
of this specific story, but as a movie lover, unfortunately I'll need
to watch the 2nd part.
