Why All the Unnecessary Drama...Hero Not Enough?!

I was all set to learn about the details behind the big Hudson River
splash down so l went to see this film with great anticipation. What a
disappointment!Almost half the film contains a drama that seems very contrived and for
some reason anti- NTSB. I'm not sure why the organization tasked to
investigate "all" airline incidents is portrayed in such a sinister
light. Were they not performing a routine investigation into an
extraordinary event? Is Capt. Sully beyond reproach to the airline
paying his handsome salary or the passengers to which their lives were
in his hands? Give me a break.If it wasn't for that elephant in the room the movie would've been 45
minutes long and a good adventure film with a real American "hero" if
that label is necessary to sell tickets. But I'm not sure why this
picture was made with such a thin story trumped up with a very
questionable amount of fluff to make it a full length feature.I hope an appropriate documentary can be made for television to tell
the real story of this incident but I wouldn't waste $12 to see this
film for what it's worth.
