I hate found footage but....!

This is surprisingly awesome for a found footage. I hate shaky camera
movies with a passion but this one blew my mind for horror. Sorry, TBWP
fans. I hate TBWP and never liked it but this one compared to it, blows
it out of this world. I went and saw TBWP, and wish I asked for money
back.I did not watch this one in the theater but for free with friend owning
it. I thought before knowing it was a found footage and was debating to
watch it, because of this. I finally jumped in and took the chance and
do not regret it but glad I did. This was an awesome movie for a found
footage.Like I said that I hate shaky camera, but what I really love was the
continuous pace it had. No just boring parts like on TBWP. I like the
part where they first realized they were going in circles and going
through the same places they already been. That creep me out. I was
blow away that they kept seeing things come at them.Another thought when they went in the catacombs was The Descent, that
movie I really love too but not much a found footage. George I like and
all the movies I saw him in, he did great. So when I saw him in it,
knew he would be just as good or better. This is one I would try to get
on bluray and watch a lot.
