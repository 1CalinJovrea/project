We Make Our Own Destiny

The Camp Half-Blood is protected by Thalia, a daughter of Zeus that
sacrificed her life to save the young Annabeth, Grover and Luke from an
attack of Cyclops and was transformed by her father into a magical
tree. Out of the blue, Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is visited by his
unknown half- brother Cyclops Tyson (Douglas Smith) and they discover
that Thalia was poisoned and is dying. Then the camp is attacked by a
Colchis Bull but it is vanquished by Percy. Soon he learns that Luke
(Jake Abel) is the one that has poisoned the magical tree. Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) discovers the mystic Golden Fleece is
capable to heal Thalia and save their camp. But Mr. D (Stanley Tucci)
assigns the winner demigod Clarisse (Leven Rambin) to the quest of
retrieving the magic fleece. However Percy Jackson, Annabeth, Grover
and Tyson decide to follow an ancient prophecy and they go to the
dangerous journey to the Sea of Monsters to recover the Golden Fleece
from Luke that wants to revive the evil Kronos to destroy the Olympus. "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters" is a reasonable infantile adventure of
the demigod son of Poseidon Percy Jackson. The beautiful Clarisse is an
unpleasant character and Percy Jackson is a weak hero; Tyson is too
dumb and Grover is funny but coward. Therefore the only attractive
character is Annabeth, gorgeous and strong. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Percy Jackson e o Mar de Monstros" ("Percy Jackson and
the Sea of Monsters")
