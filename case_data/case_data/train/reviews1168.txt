One of the worst movies ever

I wish I could say anything positive about it, but I feel the
responsibility to keep people, especially kids and teenagers, away from
this movie. This is literally the worst movie ever and one of the few I
walked out on. I do not understand that this movie can be entertaining
in any way. The scenes are merely numbing and the time span could be
reduced to an hour at most. The plot is nothing new. Even worse, left
alone as it seems. The possible moral value that it has to carry is not
traceable. It appears that the producers caught themselves too much in
the story. Therefore, they could not see that they are actually
displaying something that should be categorized in the "adult section".
