Dialogue Often Seems  Staged

Maybe I'm from the wrong demographic, but this film never entirely
clicked for me. It certainly has its moments, but overall the main
problem was in the script (written by 4 screenwriters), which often
came across to me as staged and awkward.Chris Evans stars here as Nick, a trumpeter readying for an important
audition with a jazz band in New York City. He also makes his motion
picture directorial debut here and I thought did a credible job. Alice
Eve, the charismatic and underrated actress, co-stars as Brooke, an art
consultant, who has just had her purse stolen and subsequently has
missed the last train out to her home in Boston.Nick and Brooke meet by circumstance in Grand Central Station, and
together they begin an odyssey through the streets of Manhattan, each
with relationship problems weighing heavily on them. Brooke's marriage
may be "on the rocks" and Nick is scheduled to be at a wedding
reception that night where a lost love (Emma Fitzpatrick), from years
before is expected to be in attendance, as he still fantasizes and
pines for her.The chemistry between Nick and Brooke really worked well, I thought, so
the eventual question will be whether they will get together
romantically or be like two "ships passing in the night". Overall, there are things to like here, including the wonderful
cinematography of Manhattan at night, plus two charismatic actors
commanding the screen. However, I was never "sold' on this movie due to
the often non-believable and clich√©d dialogue.
