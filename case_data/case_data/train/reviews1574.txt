Subtle, romantic, beautifully crafted and acted

My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. It had been a while since we
had seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. His
costar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as a
couple. There was plenty of action across two different settings and
times. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often the
case with American movies, The English seem to do a better job of
allowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences. It kept us
interested and entertained throughout. Cinemaphotography was good with
colours and weather helping with the mood and atmosphere. For people who favour the spy genre set in wartime it is worth a few
hours of your time. It is a serious film that shows that love
transcends everything!
