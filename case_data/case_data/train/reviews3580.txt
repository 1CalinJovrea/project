Radiant; Saoirse Ronan is Spectacular

Looming skyscrapers in a distant land, the kindness of strangers, love
and hope for a better life; such things open the eyes of Eilis, a smart
and insular immigrant to 1950s Brooklyn, to opportunities she did not
have in the Irish countryside. While at first lonely and homesick in
this new cityscape, Eilis is soon enthralled with the bright
possibilities, encouraged by all she is learning and charmed by the
people she meets. She breaks free from her shell and shines in this
radiant, unfamiliar realm. Returning to Ireland for what she hopes is a
brief stay, Eilis both sees through and is seen in a luminous and
different light. Both worlds, New York and her Irish home, now pull the
new and improved Eilis in different directions.Saoirse Ronan is spectacular in her performance as Eilis. She really
makes this Sundance hit come alive. It is comforting, as always, to see
a film that does not depend on explosions, computer graphics and alien
contagions to entertain. There is a deeper pleasure here, one that
pulls at mind, spirit, body and heart together. Visuals, story,
organization, acting, intriguing characters and more, all come together
well.
