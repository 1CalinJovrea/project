The worst Transformers movie

This movie is like a big story put up in one paragraph with no
punctuation marks whatsoever. Usually Transformers builds up a simple
story that explodes into one big final battle, filled with special
effects and epic fights between autobots and decepticons; pretty
entertaining to watch, especially if you're into big explosions-
action-robots-movies and usually it works. "The last knight" is
different from the beginning, it introduces way more story lines than
it should, it tries to make a suspenseful plot with so many resources
it just drags into a story that's full of holes and patches that it
seems you're watching a lot of trailers from different movies with no
connection between each other. The movie forces a lot of secondary roles (between the old and new
characters) that it becomes boring and confusing at the same time. The
main story becomes clear in the last quarter of the movie, just in time
for the final battleby this point you're in fully overdrive mode
trying to catch up with everything that's happened that it's barely
enjoyable. Personally I think that the worst part is the lack of continuity, they
jump from one scene to another in less than 30 seconds. This
"dynamicity" makes it impossible to follow the main plot or even one
story line. There are so many details and jumps between stories that it
exhausting trying to connect the dots. I don't recommend it at all, not
worth the money or time. Maybe if you're really curious or a big fan
into the saga you may find it entertaining at some point, my only
suggestion: lower your expectations, cause this is, by far, the worst
Transformers movie.
