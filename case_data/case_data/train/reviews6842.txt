Mesmeric, stylish and brutal Italian crime drama.

Set in 2011 in the port of Ostia (Rome) we meet a plethora on ne'er do
wells from politicians, gang types, and just low downs caught up in a
bigger plan. That plan is to turn the port into a modern day Las Vegas
(I mean really!!). This entails a gangster called Samurai in buying up
all the real estate in readiness to cash in.The problem is the politicos have a taste for young flesh, hard drugs,
money and power which equals corruption. Throw into the mix the Vatican
connection a whole 'traveller' network of crime types and you have all
the ingredients for a roller coaster of a film.I thought this was superb, the acting and style were all seductive. The
violence visceral and brutal Â– yet seemingly expected. It is one of
those films where the time just flies by and almost makes you hold your
breath. It has made such an impact that, according to IMDb, Netflix are
making a series to follow this up, I am glad a that I subscribe as if
it is half as good as the film it will be well worth the fee.
