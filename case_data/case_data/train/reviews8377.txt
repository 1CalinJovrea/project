Twilight meets American Psycho, minus the good parts.

I sat through the last half of 50 shades darker today because my sister
was using my Macbook to watch it... Let me sum it up for you:Him: "I'm not good with people because I'm mysterious." Her: "I like mysterious, but I'm scared cause I'm fragile." Him: "Don't be afraid, I'm the one who is afraid... of hurting you." *Have Some Sex* Her: "You're so thoughtful, maybe I misjudged you. Now I want to be
hurt... just not emotionally." Him: "I always hurt people, but I would never hurt you... unless you
wanted me to." Her: "Ouch, you hurt me. Now my feelings are hurt and I'm sad and my
whole life hurts." Him: "I'm sorry if I hurt you. I'll try harder, but I don't think I'll
ever change.'Her: "I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear that, but please don't hurt
me again. I trust you to change for me- projects are fun." Him: "Put these things in your ass." Her: "No." Him: "Okay, I'm not good with people because I'm
mysterious." *Have Some Sex Again* Aaaand Credits
