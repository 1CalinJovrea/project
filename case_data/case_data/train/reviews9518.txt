I laughed so hard

I honestly thought it was way better than the first. This movie is
ridiculous, the whole scenario is ridiculous which is what makes it
funny. The three main actors have the best synergy. Three morons who
try to kidnap a millionaire's son for ransom, you can only imagine the
chaos that ensues. I really enjoyed it, but the humour is a little
silly so it's not for all. You either going to like it or hate it, more
specifically Charlie Day. A lot of people complain about his voice, but
personally I thought he was one of the funniest. One thing is for sure,
this movie does not deserve a 6. It's well above 6 and should easily be
ranking 7-7.5 score.
