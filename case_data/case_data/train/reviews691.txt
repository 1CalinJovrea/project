No, just no.

This is one of the worst based on a book movies ever made. If you read
the books, you will be disappointed to the point of crying. The script
is very poor. Of course you can't put everything from the books in a
movie, but this was just bad. The cast also was a big disappointment,
the actresses didn't match the characters at all, it's a big question
to me why they were chosen to play them. Rose, my favorite character in
the books, is completely ruined by this girl (ZoÃ« Deutch or something I
thought) that doesn't have any of Rose's style and sass. Her acting was
also very poor. No, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Just read
the books instead.
