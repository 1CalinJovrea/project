Not your run of the mill LAPD movies

Unlike many of the current crop of macho cop dramas, End of Watch plays
mainly to the grit of the daily challenges of patrolling the mean
streets of South Central LA in the "Shootin' Newton" division. Unlike
the stunning LA Confidential, with a historical story line, End of
Watch is done in the cinema ver'ite' style - in a realistic real cops
on duty in the LA war zone frame. The casting in this movie is picture
perfect, with each actor giving in depth performances.The story line
brings the Mexican / US drug problem into crystal clarity. Initially,
the story fails to coalesce, and the video cam work is a bit disjointed
and over done at the outset, but once you settle in to cinematic
method, the film gets a hold on you. Definitely a movie for any law
enforcement aficionados collection.
