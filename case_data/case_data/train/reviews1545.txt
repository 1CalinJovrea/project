An actual viewer opinion - Not even kids worthy.

I cant spoil the story as there is barely any to find.



The only one/s who truly earned any coin in this movie are the people 

who did the trailer, because they managed to put together a clip from 

the none existent content of the film.



Suffice to say, I can bet you the 80 million dollars to that took to 

make this film that first graders and/or some random drunken people in 

a bar can come with a better screen play.



Its so bad that you can see everyone of the actors in the film can not 

believe they are actually going through with this scene after scene.



Its so excessively dull that I wouldn't even want my children to see 

it.



The ONLY thing you can do to make this film bare-able is to turn of the 

audio and watch it as a mute film. Anything you could imagine about the 

dialog would be better.



I'm only giving it a 3 because believe it or not I've seen worse ( : 

And CGI? Maybe we could have enjoyed the CGI if it wasn't crushingly 

burdened with carrying the dumbest dialog I've seen in years.



I'm only wasting my key taps on this "film" on the off chance that this 

will save someone the waste of time.
