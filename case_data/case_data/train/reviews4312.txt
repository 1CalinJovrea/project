It just didn't make a good movie.

I never felt more stupid watching this. The movie starts out with fart
jokes and cute friendship between an animal and a super pig. I have a
feeling the rating is only so high because if you don't like this movie
you hate animals. It's not true. This is a bad movie.**SPOILS** One thing I really don't get is the bad guy, in the end,
giving the girl her pig for money. No way her genetically mutated pig
is worth less than that small gold statue. Given that THEY refused to
sell them to anyone and only rented them out but in the end, she
decides it's OK to just sell the animal? I MEAN none of this would have
happened. You can't just say "company" doesn't want to sell the pig
only wants to rent them but in the end, the company now does want to
sell the pig. It is just so stupid. This whole story is so flustered
with issues. Like the "ALF" they needed to make some high-tech device
to sneak in using this girls 'pig' but near the end, they walk right
in. No guards and the door wasn't even locked you're telling me that
they have this much trouble getting into these guys buildings when a
little girl managed to do it with little to no effort. God this movie
has a sin counter of over 9000!
