You've got to be kidding me

The trailers are misleading and I believe that people who said that the
jokes were creative and of high quality are nuts. I went to see this
with my parents last night...now, I am in my 30, my parents are in
their 50's, and we all loved Your Highness and other movies that some
of these actors are in separately. Franco and McBride can be hilarious,
but this was far from their finest moment. Seriously, we collectively
laughed 4 times. I kept count. The only reason that I am giving this a
2 and not a 1 is that there was a scene where some large 4 legged demon
came launching into the scene and my mother jumped and dumped half her
candy.How do I get my money back for this complete waste? I feel completely
and utterly duped. The reviews said it was great overall, I wonder what
has happened to society when an entire scene dedicated to an argument
about masturbating on a magazine is funny. There have been some funny
jokes about masturbation in other movies, this sure as hell isn't one
of them.I seriously want my money back.
