The best movie of 2017

This is by far one of my most favorite animated movie of 2017*spoilers ahead*The animation is very beautiful and fluid. Even the ponies look
adorable in ToonBoom. I love how the animators did with the program. The setting too is creative. It consists of land, air and water. One of
my favorite scene of this movie is the Seaponies and some musical parts
of this movie. Daniel Ingram is an amazing song writer. His music piece "One Small
Thing" and "Open Up Your Eyes" are very catchy and fun, it made me did
a little dance in the movie. Overall, this is my most favorite animated movie of 2017.
