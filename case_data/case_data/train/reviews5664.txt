Not very thought provoking!

This movie was one of the worst I have seen for a while. Bad taste,
weak humour, distasteful characters and a waste of my life. I'm just
grateful that I was sitting down. I was staggered at the times other
movie watchers actually laughed. Not a great deal of intelligence is
obviously required to enjoy this load of rubbish.
