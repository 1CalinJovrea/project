9
Great movie with beautiful cinematography

Yes, I give this a 9 out of 10. Not because it's a blockbuster
(actually I don't know if it is, or not, and I don't care.) or because
of any hype. (I've watched it by pure chance.) I enjoyed the story, which was well thought through. I enjoyed the acting -- by everyone. Really. That doesn't happen to me
often. And it is beautifully shot.The movie has drama, humor, sadness, and happiness. Even a little
romance. The story revolves around a little girl, Mary, who, at 7 years old, is
found to be a mathematical genius. Her uncle, Frank, is bringing her
up, after his sister committed suicide. When it comes to light that
little Mary is truly exceptional, Frank's mother enters the equation
(pardon the math pun). She wants Mary to go to a school where her gifts
are challenged, where she can advance her level of mathematics. Frank,
however, wants Mary to be a kid. To grow up playing, having friends,
and tromping around with her one eyed cat Fred, and go to a regular
school, with regular kids, so she's not alienated from kids her own
age. Basically, he wants her to have a normal life, where she can be
normal. A custody battle ensues between Grandmother and Uncle, and Mary
is caught in the middle. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm keeping it vague. :) Sorry. The movie has many "Moments". Things that you'll recognize from your
own life, the troubles and the joys. I loved it for that. I would say
it's suitable for kids to watch, although there are some adult themes.
Nothing graphic though. It's a quiet movie, not something flashy, not hugely dramatic. But
there is a good story that's well filmed and acted -- and honestly,
there don't seem to be many of those anymore.All I can say is, watch it and make up your own mind. And yes, I would definitely watch it again.
