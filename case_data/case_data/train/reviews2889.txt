The depressed Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle) lives with her disabled
daughter Nica (Fiona Dourif), who is stuck in a wheelchair since she
was born, in an isolated old house. Sarah receives a package with the
creepy red- haired doll Chucky and she throws it in the garbage. But
during the night she is found dead and Chucky is sat on a chair in the
living room. Nica's sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) attends the funeral with her
estranged husband Ian (Brennan Elliott); their little daughter Alice
(Summer Howell); the nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell) and her friend
Father Frank (A Martinez). Along the night, there are mysterious deaths
and Nica discovers that the package was sent from the evidence
depositary. She also researches the Internet and suspects that Chucky
might be behind the murders. "Curse of Chucky" is a great return of the franchise with a sinister
history of Chucky. The cinematography and the camera work are top-notch
and the plot is well developed. Wait until the end of the credits since
the movie continues with a long scene; in the end, "play with this"! My
vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Maldição de Chucky" ("The Curse of Chucky")
