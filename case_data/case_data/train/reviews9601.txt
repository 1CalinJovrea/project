Better than I was expecting....

I was lucky enough to watch an exclusive Premiere Screening in Sydney
with a friend last night, I can honestly admit that it was better than
I was originally expecting.Storyline goes that William Cage (Tom Cruise), a military officer
inexperienced in combat, is deployed into a combat mission against the
aliens and even against his will. Though Cage is killed in minutes in a
spectacular battle sequence that echoes the opening sequence in Saving
Private Ryan, he finds himself starting over in a time loop, repeating
the same mission and being killed. Each time, Cage discovers and
remembers the timed events that he experienced and decides to learn
better to fight the aliens, he teams up with Special Forces warrior
Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to defeat them but he will learn why as
well he has this power and that he was not alone.The storyline was strong all the way and it never loses itself or goes
over-the-top, the acting from Cruise and Blunt is both epic and really
a game changer for both (people have complained about the lack of
emotion in the characters but I can admit it was not needed here much),
casting as well includes Bill Paxton, Brendon Gleeson and even
Australian actors Noah Taylor (Game of Thrones) and Kick Gurry (Speed
Racer) and they all provided excellent performances.The visual effects are really top notch and even at times remind me of
Elysium and even Battle: Los Angeles. The action-set sequences are very
well choreographed and are even tense in the opening minutes of the
film. The aliens they fight are really incredible looking, scary and
even remind me of something out of a Guillermo del Toro film (think
Hellboy 1 and 2 or even Pacific Rim). The Exo-Skeleton suits are being
more and more awesome whenever they are used in film, I just wish they
had invented real ones by now.Overall, EoT is a movie that will not only enlighten Sci-Fi fans but it
will keep the action junkies glued to the screen and if you like or
hate Tom Cruise, you may be in for a surprise
