Besson how we know him!

I absolutely loved this movie. I had so much fun watching it.I do love the graphic novels though and I know DeHaan and Delevingne
are not exactly like the two original characters however that was the
70s and I do think we should be able to cast actors which are more
appealing to us in today's time. I think they did a great job and I was
absolutely amazed by DeHaan as per usual.The story itself was great and with more than two hours of running time
the film had enough time to tell a nice futuristic tale.10 out of 10 is my verdict and I will stand by it. Nice one indeed.
