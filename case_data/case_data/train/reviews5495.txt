It might just be me, but I liked it.

This was on my year-end list as well. It was buried somewhere down the
list.. like it was nearly hanging off of it. Actually, it was in a
separate list of "Films I may or may not see in December if reviews are
really bad". Why Him? actually did get awful reviews. But for some
reason, I wanted to take a chance on it. I felt something was there.
For one, I am a Franco-file, and I love him in anything he's in. So I
went and saw it.I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed a lot. It's really just a goofy
movie, and that's alright by me. Don't put too much thought going in.
If your afraid of not laughing, even a little bit, leave that nonsense
at the door, and enjoy the show. James Franco brings his A-game here,
and is once again totally hysterical. Bryan Cranston has great comedic
timing. Megan Mullally is a scene stealer. Kegan-Michael Key is
bonkers. It's got Kaley Cuoco as an awesome version of Siri, the best
of Silicon Valley, Adam Devine, a moose dipped in urine that explodes.
Oh, and 1/2 of the band KISS in full costume and makeup. It's been a
while since a comedy movie made a tribute to one of the greatest bands
of the 70's. Role Models was the last one. You could say that it's
shamelessly borrowing from Role Models, but in Role Models it felt
forced and unnecessary. In Why Him? It fits in with the craziness.This is a holiday, cornball comedy that doesn't suck.. as they tend to.
