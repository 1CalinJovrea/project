1914 it's not

I guess all the really bad Germans have been exhaustively & now
boringly used up one to many times,beat dragged & tortured in the
previous thousand turkey shoot WW2 movies from the Longest Day to
Inglourious Basterds ... maybe having an Israeli IDF glamour girl
pummel the last surviving movie Nazis seems rather unsportsmanlike.So now we have fresh meat Germans from WW1 that just aren't as Kosher
as the WW2 bad-ass Nazi robotrons . It just doesn't come across as the
good fight,IDF Wonder Woman against the exhausted muddy trench fighting
& dying Germans of the Kaiser's Army. Wonder Woman defending the huge
British Imperialist Empire against the upstart smaller German
Imperialist Empire. What Empire should I root for?So duel citizenship Wonder Woman kicks Kaiser Sheev Palpatine Admirals
right of the bridge off the first Allegiance-class Star Destroyer she
crosses paths with...ops, wrong universe ... kicking Kaisers Wilhelm's
poison gas snorting quasi-Nazis off the bridge of the nearest Zeppelin
so the smaller Axis of Evil Ottoman Empire can be carved up & the
righteous State of Israel formed on the back of the defeated Turkish
subjects thanks to Wonder Woman!Well...basically that is the historical time-line.Hollywood writers wet dream rewrite of history since they now have
picked clean the dried carcass of WW2 & can finally move on,but the
sidekick American Hero going futuristic suicidal jihadi just doesn't
bode well for gentlemanly slaughter of 1914. Lawrence of Arabia versus
Wonder Woman might be in the works with smart-ass Shia LaBeouf as
Captain Lawrence.Maybe I'm reading to much in this generic CGI feast on the eyes.but I
have to as this endless stream of Marvel/DC comic green screen movies
are blurring into each other .Now the original corny T.V Carter always
seemed like an awkward top heavy super hero gal but Gal Gadot comes
across as a sweaty Stairmaster extra & just as talented as a 10lb
Dumbbell.
