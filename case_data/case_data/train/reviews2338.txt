Great Horror film

This movie is very good for a horror filmIt starts off well and you have very good characters, the father in the
film is a very good actor.Overall the directing of the movie is excellent, all the pieces fit
together well and you understand the story. A lot of horror films fail
in the directing as things are mismatched and no one knows what is is
going on.It is a very well told story that develops into lots of thrills and
scaresIt is not a gory film which is very good but it keeps you entertained
all the way throughThe characters are excellent and interesting, the acting is good so
this keeps you gripped all the way throughOverall an enjoyable film and does the job of a good horror film
