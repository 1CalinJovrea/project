Remarkable translation of a play to screen

After this film was screened at the Toronto Film Festival today, an
audience member asked director Andrews about the skill of lead actor
Mendelsohn in his portrayal of such a deceitful and manipulative
character. The host repeated the question without the adjectives but
fortunately the question was answered as it was asked. Mr. Andrews
noted that many audience members didn't see the "Ray" character in that
fashion at all. Indeed this ambiguity and its affect on Una is at the heart of this
film as well as the play Blackbird upon which it is based. I generally
am not happy when plays are translated into films but I found this
adaptation to be quite the exception. The camera was able to extend the
scope of the play to include scenes from the crucial events which
occurred 15 years before the main confrontation which occupies most of
the film. A brilliant first film from director Andrews which will hopefully reach
the wide audience it deserves.
