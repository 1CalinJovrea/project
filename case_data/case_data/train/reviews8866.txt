Nice romantic movie

The movie will definitely put a smile on your face. It's a romantic
drama with a few brushes of comedy thrown in.Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum play a young married couple whose
lives take a tragic fate when they suffer a head on car accident.McAdams's character isn't horribly disfigured or anything like that,
but she suffer brain trauma which has blocked all memory of Tatum's
character Leo.Leo tries to get regain her memory by trying to have her fall in love
with him again.It's true that these types of movies aren't original, but that doesn't
bother me too much as long as the product is good.The performances are excellent, Channing and Rachel have great
chemistry and supporting cast from Sam Neil to Jessica Lange is more
than adequate.All it's just a nice romantic movie.
