Amazing indie production that falls short on the long run-time

Novice producer/writer/director Travis Milloy has created a visually
stunning and entertaining indie film that is near perfection,
considering it was funded with a Kickstarter campaign and stolen
pop-crates (see Trivia section).The directing, sound and visuals on this film are better than 95% of
the Hollywood blockbusters out there, so bravo Travis for converting
your vision into this masterpiece and hitting it out of the ball park.I am not a fan of long films (unless the story justifies the length)
and this one was just that, very long at 2h,23m, but sadly, the story
did not justify the length. Had the pace been slow (thankfully it
wasn't), it would have been unbearable. With the repetitiveness of the plot, this film needed to be cut down to
about 1h,30m to have made it more fluid, instead of feeling as if it
was all over the place. I felt there were some unnecessary scenes that
convoluted the main story, such as his father. I understand that this
may have been symbolic, but it really didn't add much to the overall
story. Additionally there were some miss-mashed plot issues that could have
easily been either omitted or covered better.But the stunning cinematography/visuals paired with near perfect
directing and outstanding score kept my eyes glued to the screen and
made the above issues less significant. Even Christopher Soren Kelly's
acting became more convincing and you started to feel for his
character.Some reviewers complained about the ending, but that for me was
perfect, as it left it up to the viewer to come to their own
conclusion. To me, I feel it left the door open for a Part 2, and I
hope that does comes to fruition.I am rating this film based on its own merits of a novice-produced,
truly low budget independent film that hit the mark and excelled in the
most critiqued areas, so as such, it's a very well deserved 9/10 from
me.
