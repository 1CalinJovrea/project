Stunning, but for believers, some clarifications required...

I found this movie absolutely stunning. Beautiful cinematography,
outstanding acting, and astounding special effects. Of course, there are a few things that fellow believers need to be
aware of. The movie, 'Noah', is not told from an ultra-conservative
point of view. There are multiple parts that can clash with your own
beliefs. When creation is explained in the movie, it is portrayed in
the fashion that God, or The Creator as He is referred to throughout
the movie, used the Big Bang as His tool for the creation of the
universe, and evolution for His creation of animals and of Man.
Although I do not personally believe that is how He created everything,
the movie tells creation beautifully and with God as the Creator,
therefore I do not find it offensive.One piece of information that will be helpful when seeing this movie is
the background and origin of the Watchers. The Watchers are originally
mentioned in the Book of Enoch, an ancient non-canonical book of the
Jewish religion. The Watchers are, as stated in the movie, fallen
angels, but after that, the production team took their creative
license. Since it is in neither the Jewish Tanakh nor the Christian
Bible, most viewers will think that the producers simply made up the
Watchers.Also, there are many gruesome and gut-wrenching scenes, for this movie
reveals just how corrupt Mankind had become. There is no happy parade
of animals arriving two-by-two, and Noah is not a happy old man with a
long flowing beard In this film, Noah tries to follow exactly what the
Creator commanded of him, taking himself past his breaking point. In
this film, Mankind is scrambling for survival, taking what it wants and
not caring for anyone else. In this film, the story of Noah is
portrayed realistically.I implore you to go see this movie, but you must watch it with an open
mind.
