Grown Lions Will Cry

This film is an emotional true story set in the mid 1980's, based on
the novel "A long way home". Staring Sonny Pawar as a 5 year old boy
"Saroo" from a destitute Indian village. He and his older brother
scratch a living selling stolen coal, their mother is a labourer, their
lives are extremely tough. One evening the boys are out looking for work, but they're separated
and Saroo falls asleep on a decommissioned train, the train travels
without stopping. 2 days later he's 1200 miles from home. The first
part of the film follows young Saroo as he tries to survive his new
life on the streets.An orphanage rescue him from begging, scrounging, and living rough.
He's adopted by an Australian couple, his new life couldn't be more of
a contrast to his original poverty.The scene jumps 20 years forwards to almost present day, the adult
Saroo is now played by Dev Patel, his ambition is to work in hotel
management. While studying he learns about a new technology, 'Google
Earth', which he uses to view satellite images. Although looking for
his village isn't easy and needs extensive searching for obvious
landmarks since he has no idea where in the country he's from.The first half of the film is all set in India and is fabulous in every
way - 10/10. The second half is mainly set in Tasmania but loses some
atmosphere (IMO).Stay for the end credits to understand why the film is called "Lion"
and also see some photographs of the real people highlighted in the
film.Highly recommended tear-jerker.
