Waste. Of. Time.

This is the worst movie I have ever been talked into going to see in
the movie theater.The story is ultra-predictable, and not at all interesting. It is great seeing Elizabeth Shue.....but her character is flat and
somewhat unbelievable. (What doctor marries a rock star??)They should have just called this movie: Jennifer Lawrence on Screen
for an Hour and a HalfLawrence wasn't terrible, but it shouldn't be hard to play a high
school student who hates her mom in every scene. All of the supporting characters are poorly developed. I did not feel
attached to any of them, and after a while was actually hoping that one
of them would be killed, so as to add some sort of entertainment value
to an otherwise bland movie.Overall, this movie was awful and not worth wasting any money to see it
in the theater or renting/buying it on DVD/blu ray. Unless your significant other begs you to see this because they are
HUGE Jennifer Lawrence or Horror fans, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
