A waste of 2 hours

Rating this as 1 out of 10 (awful) doesn't really reflect just how poor
this film actually is. I understand that this is Summer blockbuster
patriotism but this trash is an insult to the eyes, from the bad acting
to the script... who would say these things. Rather like 24 (which is a good watch) can I suggest that the
Government departments and agencies beef up their recruitment
procedures because it seems that they regularly employ traitors and
never properly check the background of people who suddenly start
working in Government buildings.One positive is that the bad guys gradually lose their ability to shoot
accurately as the film progresses. At the outset, they are slick and
basically kill everyone with dead-eye precision but later on they
become standard 'can't hit a barn door' baddies who attended the
university of bad guys never win..2 hrs lost forever...
