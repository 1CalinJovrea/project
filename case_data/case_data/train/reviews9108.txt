All style, no substance

Perhaps this movie means more to people who have some kind of
attachment or attraction to the King Arthur legend already. That's the
only way I can explain how so many people are giving this movie gushing
10/10 reviews.For me, it was a largely vapid CGI-fest completely devoid of realism or
reality. It's pretty much on par with your latest superhero / Avengers
type of movie, with fast cut action sequences, explosions, things
flying around the screen, and stylized slow motion. I expected more
than this from Guy Ritchie.I also didn't expect it to be so much of a "fantasy" film. I was
expecting / hoping for a historical action movie but there is almost no
history here. Everything is stylized and made up. The armour and
weapons are all made up, the castles are unbelievable and fantastic
(huge towers, arches, 1000 ft bridges, etc), African and Asian
characters have been inserted, and there are almost no historical
references.So it all kind of mashes together into 2 hours of fantasy-action
featuring characters you don't really care about and that have no
grounding in any reality that seems to make sense. And you can tell
they want to turn this into a franchise with several more sequels.
Thankfully we may be spared this horrible future as I hear it's bombing
at the box office (there were 2 other people in my theatre). It's a bad
film I would never want to see again.
