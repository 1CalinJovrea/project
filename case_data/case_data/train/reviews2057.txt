Save your money for anything else

I am not one of those people to be as dramatic to say "I want two hours
of my life back " , but am thankful for the part of my brain that
suppresses awful awful memories. I am a huge Coen brothers fan , but
this movie has much appeal as a Rolf Harris benefit concert. Nothing
happens in the film , and not in a Seinfeld sort of humorous/witty way
, but more in a waiting at a doctors room for an appointment sort of
way. More disappointing was the clich√©d story line. Without giving
anything away , Llewyn loses a cat, finds it the next day and then
returns it to the owner , and I am sure you can guess what happens
next. The same thing happens when he records a single and signs away
any royalty benefits.There is no character development that occurs in
other Coen films. I have no idea what they were thinking , but they
were not thinking of making a good film when they may this - In short ,
please avoid !
