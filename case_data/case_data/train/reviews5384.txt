When the Trailer Is Better than the Film

The 17-year-old Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) receives a coded signal
and his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) helps him to decipher the
message. They find that Sean's grandfather Alexander Anderson (Michael
Caine) has found the mysterious island in the Pacific described by
Julio Verne and two other writers in their novels.The stubborn Sean wants to travel to the coordinates and Hank decides
to buy the tickets and travel with the teenager to a small island
nearby the location. They rent an old helicopter owned by the locals
Gabato (Luis Guzm√°n) and his teenage daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens)
and the group heads to the unknown spot. Along their journey, they
cross a hurricane and crash in the island. They find a beautiful and
dangerous place, surrounded by forests, volcanoes with lava of gold and
menacing life forms. The meet also the old Alexander and Hank discovers
that the island is sinking. Now their only chance to survive is to find
the legendary Nautilus. "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island" is a movie with a trailer that is
better than the film itself. The lame screenplay begins in a fast pace,
with Hank and Sean guessing to quickly the message. The story is very
weak and the film is supported by the special effects only. The spoiled
Sean and the rude Alexander are detestable characters and Gabato is
stupid and annoying and never funny as supposed to be. Hank is multi-
skilled in codes, hydraulic and electric engineering, medicine, and
music and diving. In the end, "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island" is a
very disappointing adventure. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Viagem 2: A Ilha Misteriosa" ("Journey 2: The
Mysterious Island")
