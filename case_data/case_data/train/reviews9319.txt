Dreary, weakly feminist production

Rather silly, and superficially morose, this pretends to be set in a
girls school in Virginia in 1864. Settings are important - there are no
giant live oak groves with heavy hanging Spanish moss in Virginia. The entire 93 minutes seem sunk in impenetrable dark mists inside and
out. Gothic? Fairy tale? Hard to decide. Actors seem to move around as
subjects in a tableau of stylized Victorian portraits, their roles seem
interchangeable. Handsome Colin Farrell hardly seemed worth the group
effort. Nothing emotionally charged, not much going on at Miss Martha's School
except a bit of sewing, foraging for mushrooms, French verbs, dressing
for dinner, more sewing. One could see why these gals were left alone
during the War for Southern Independence. Even the wine couldn't stir
up any heat or light.
