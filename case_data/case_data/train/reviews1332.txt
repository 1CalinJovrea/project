B for boring, very very boring.

Wonder what the refund policy is at Premier Theaters. Of course they
are not responsible for this fiasco. It just went on and on and
on......plot meandering went nowhere...actors mumbling...no suspense,
just one predictable scene after another. Some of the scenes looked
like they were shot on my grandpa 8mm Kodak movie camera. And to boot,
the "reality" of the fight scenes would meet a standard of a 5 year
old. We all know this is not a documentary, but when Bond / Craig get
pummeled by the bad guy on the train and his tie stays in place and he
suffers not a scratch or a black eye where is the realism...The
Islander aircraft flying with its wings clipped outboard of the
engines?????.Come on Broccoli team - is this the best you can do? Sean
Connery is rolling his eyes and chuckling at the new low in Bond
movies. Wasted evening, could have snoozed on a couch instead of a
movie theater. Now, let us face it..10 lines of comments on this almost
two and a half hours of boredom is a task that even Sam Mendez could
not master.
