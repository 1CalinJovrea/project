Dull drawn out twaddle

Went in with high expectations and ended up almost dozing at the slow
pace of this movie. Few highlights and drab backgrounds will not
attract me to visit Copenhagen. Typical Oscar type movie, well acted by
Redmayne and Vikander just a too slow movie pace. Redmaynes character
didn't develop for me at all and I couldn't see it improving if I'd
stayed longer so 65 mins into it I followed several others who had left
early and noticed one guy fast asleep. The core subject as stated in
the trailers and posters is Redmayne's exploration of the femininity
side of humanity. All well and good in a psychiatrists consultation but
for a movie no. Had this been made for TV it could better be
serialised. This is just my opinion but I was bored by it however most
folk will watch it and rate it for it's acting merit - I rate for
watchability.
