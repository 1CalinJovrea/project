10
It Could've Been You

I've rated almost a hundred movies and I've only ever given out six 10s
on this website. I don't rave about many movies and I am tough to
please when it comes to film, but this film is absolute brilliance. It
is flawless. This one earns its 10 and it is one of the best films I
have ever seen. Everything about this film is brilliant. The camera work is great and
the score is underrated. However, what makes this film is an absolutely
genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock
your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic
area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this
movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for
yourself. However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects.
Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely
important to American and world culture, this movie does everything
else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly
true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both
act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure
brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both
cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should
see.
