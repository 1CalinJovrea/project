This movie sucked.

Clich√©, cheesy, inane, boring, predictable ... all could be used to sum
up this horrible movie. It sucked, and I want my money back. Because
this is America, and when things suck you should be able to get your $8
back.I mean, I'm all about suspending disbelief in watching a movie. But
Let's face it, if the only three people in the world with the
detonation codes for every single nuclear missile were all being held
hostage by a terrorist in the White House bunker -- which just happened
to be the only place in the world where the detonation codes could be
changed -- well, I feel pretty confident the order would be given to
storm the White House and kill everyone in it ... including the
President. And if the cops and the Navy SEALS couldn't handle this
task, I feel pretty sure every one of us gun toting rednecks would
swarm on the White House and demolish it to the ground in about 15
minutes.And speaking of stupid, how about that super dooper gun turret they
somehow miraculously smuggled into the White House and strategically
placed on the roof such that it could shoot down 6 Navy SEAL
helicopters??? OMFG! STOOOPID! This movie was Die Hard on steroids.
Lame lame lame lame lame, and again, lame. Of course they cap the whole
thing off with the proverbial ticking time bomb at the end ... that our
hero just manages to deactivate at the last second, saving us all from
certain doom.What has the American population become that they would try to pass off
an utterly inane and stupid piece of malarkey like this movie on us as
an even marginally plausible scenario for a terrorist attack ...
never-mind having only one goober inside able to thwart the attack ...
and we as Americans don't stand up en masse and demand our freakin'
money back for this garbage?? Cheesy!
