yeah, I was just like you

I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah
Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80's television show -
doesn't sound all that appealing.Hill's "The Sitter", completely mediocre, and it's been quite a while
since Superbads success. Channing Tatum showed his comedic timing during his appearance on SNL.
I was still hesitant.But, I stand corrected.This is the funniest movie since last years' Bridesmaids.The key here is the fantastic script. The story isn't rocket-science,
and we knew it wouldn't be, but the comedic timing of the leads is
spot-on, and they were given a great script to work with.I found myself laughing multiple times throughout. My spouse concurred.
One late, unnecessary gross-out moment brought it down a notch. The
film hadn't used any of those gimmicks and didn't need to in the end.
It just seemed a bit out of place and distasteful.The leads did a great job here. Their characters worked exactly how
they should in a buddy-cop flick like this. They bounced off each other
for an hour and a half, and the result will surely be one of the best
comedies of the year, and an outside shot for my 2012
top-25(back-end)if it can hold-on.Watch out for a sneaky cameo(spoiled by the cast list if you look).Nice surprise.Deserves it's ranking here.Stuck between 7-8, but going with 76/100, so I'm rounding to 8.You'll enjoy this if you liked:The Other Guys, Starsky and Hutch, If
Looks Could Kill, or Blue Streak - even though I think this is actually
a clear notch above all of those films.
