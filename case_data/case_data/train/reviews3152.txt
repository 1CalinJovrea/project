Fantastic True Comeback Story

Wow! Miles Teller is phenomenal in this story of a boxer that is in a
horrific car accident that breaks his neck and then surpasses all odds
to mount a comeback and fight in the ring once more. It is baffling
that this is a true story and I had not heard hide nor hare of before
seeing this movie. Aaron Eckhart and Katey Sagal are practically
unrecognizable. All of the actors throw themselves into their roles
with abandon. Fantastic truly fantastic. Engaging and enjoyable
watching this film.
