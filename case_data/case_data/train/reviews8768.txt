Surprisingly good despite the bad reviews on IMDb

I feel like a lot of people are giving this movie flack because they're
comparing it to Bridesmaids. That's the problem with movie-goers. We
call each movie, the next or the imitation or worst than or better
than. On it's own, Bachelorette did really well. It's a dark comedy/
raunchy film but it's done so well. It's not common in Hollywood that
you have movies where women are complex as the men. Some reviews state
that they find the characters to not be redeeming, but I think that's
what makes Bachelorette so strong. We have 3 complex, intriguing, and
yeah, messed up individuals. What it gives you is a very plausible
comedy. A review online called this the mix between Mean Girls +
Bridesmaids. Aside from the similar wedding scenario, this is more the
women version of the Hangover and fused with Mean Girls. Check it out,
it's a good laugh ride if you're into dark comedies.
