All style, no substance

The acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else
was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of
the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible
exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all
action plots - some "bad dudes who happen to be really ugly" decide to
"destroy the world for no reason other than being evil" and "only our
hero can save us all", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an
absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn't
expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made
with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers
were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the
surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard
to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in
2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.
