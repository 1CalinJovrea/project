Sam Shepard was the lucky one.......

First let me give the positive things about this film:The direction was great, and the editing was fluid with scenes allowed
to play themselves out instead of hacked up like chopped meat. There
were no quick cuts to annoy the hell out of me, and this film was shot
beautifully.The acting was first rate (as you can imagine with this cast), and I
thought Julia Roberts especially was spot on. Meryl Streep got on my
nerves, but I'm not sure it was her or the fact that her character was
as hateful a character as you can imagine.Now the problems for me. By the 30 minute mark, I was over it. I could
identify with no one in the film, nor did I care about any of the
characters. At the 60 minute mark I was pretty sure that Sam Shepard was the
smartest person in the film by drowning himself within the first 10
minutes. With envy I longed for the sweet death of sucking water into
my lungs and never hearing this bickering, awful family again.By the 90 minute mark I was convinced that these were some of the most
vile, hideous creatures on the face of the earth. They had no redeeming
qualities at all. All I could think of was the line from Aliens, "Nuke
them from orbit. It's the only way to be sure."By the 121 minute mark, I was grateful it was over. Meryl was alone in
the house, Julia had left, and we had no resolution to a story we had
suffered through for two hours.I'm not opposed to dark films. I'm not opposed to sad films. I'm not
opposed to films that try to qualify and explain the human condition.
But what I am opposed to is a film that makes no effort to be
ENTERTAINING.August: Osage County is a film that doesn't give a crap if the audience
is entertained. It's too busy showing how smart and edgy it is.
