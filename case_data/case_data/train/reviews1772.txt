The only people who interest me are the mad ones

What a brilliant adaptation!The very beginning of the movie sets the tone, and shows Kerouac
walking, and walking, different locations.From this very beginning, Walter Salles captures the essence itself of
Kerouac's work. He may not stick to every passage of it, which would probably prove
quite tedious to follow in a movie, yet he keeps what is necessary, the
essence, the purpose of it all. Living fully, enjoying life to its
fullest.Sam Riley as Jack Kerouac is incredible, a raspy voice, gleeful,
mischievous, eyes full of sparkle, he makes it entirely believable, and
is highly likable.Garrett Hedlund, a very talented actor (as he has proved it in Death
Sentence, Four Brothers) shines bright as Neal Cassady, full of
charisma, virility, and true madness. There is a fantastic energy
absolutely suited to the character, a very difficult character to
portray, a madman.Hedlund is an absolute standout and is both riveting and heartbreaking,
notably so at the end of the movie.Kristen Stewart is glowing, both beautiful and highly sensual (very
torrid scenes showcase this), she proves something that most people
seem to have forgotten with the Twilight series, that she is extremely
talented.Tom Sturridge is impressive as Allen Gisberg, both vulnerable and crazy
in a sense. The cinematography is outstanding, and it is a sight to behold,
beautiful landscapes, a smooth, delicate filmic texture. This movie will divide, whether people appreciate the book, or they
don't.It leaves a mark on me, it goes to my heart, as the book did. As Jack repeats those last words "I think of Dean Moriarty, I think of
Dean Moriarty", intertwined with Neal looking afar, tears running down,
my heart sinks, riveted as I am, as if paralyzed by those last words,
my eyes fixated on the screen, I can't move because I think of Dean
Moriarty, I think of Neal Cassady.
