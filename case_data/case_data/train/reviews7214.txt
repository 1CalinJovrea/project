Worst. movie. ever. made.

No matter how much I'll try, I can't tell you how horrific, terrible
and just god awful this movie is. I've seen hundreds of movies,
including so bad they're good movies, but this movie- IS OUTSTANDINGLY
BAD ! I downloaded this movie, watched it and closed it after half an
hour. This movie should get 3/10 or 2/10 in this site. I'll never watch
this movie ever again. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. I
actually wanted to hit myself for seeing this movie. If you still don't
understand how bad this piece of garbage is, if I'll record myself
taking a shower- it'll be better than this. My advice- move on with
your life. Have a good day, and take care.
