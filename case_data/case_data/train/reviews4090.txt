Done and done

This is your typical cliché movie. I wanted to leave after 30 minutes
of watching it. Boy and girl are friends. Oops, they fall in love,
oops. Oh no! They will not be together for some soap opera reason that
makes the audience, tired by the same story, let out an underwhelming
sigh. The ending drags on and is so, so, so cliché. Alison Brie is a
fabulous actress but I found her character the way I find the sound of
nails on a chalkboard. Jason Mantzoukas was actually pretty funny, so
his scenes were great. Jason Sudeikis was in his typical type of role,
so no excitement there. A lot of famous actors, pretty shiny things for
audience to get distracted by to forget they've already seen this story
a thousand times.
