"Ticklegear" Apparently Just Does Not Like Mark Walberg

Reading the review of "Ticklegear" I had to check out his other
postings. Apparently Mark Walberg is his anti-actor. There was not one
movie with Walberg that he remotely liked. "Walberg stinks up another
movie"..Walberg this..Walberg that. Man...just DON'T bother going to
any of his movies. I suppose he thought "Ted" was a stinker also. As
far as "2 Guns" he was dead wrong. This movie was great. The chemistry
between Walberg and Washington couldn't be better. The humor (mostly
from Walberg) couldn't have been any better also. The story line was
fast and above all easy to follow. The action scenes were as good as
one could want. Not over bearing (like this summer's "Man Of Steel")but
a great crime thriller. I wasn't a fan of Walberg's when he first
started appearing in films but have progressed to where I totally enjoy
his current movies. Regardless,if you like a thriller/drama/comedy
you'll love "2-Guns". Rated a one star by "Ticklegear'???...give me a
break!
