I really liked it.

THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS.I really liked it.The movie was made by Rza, who is a member of the band Wu Tang Clan. He
got together with Quentin Tarantino to make this movie and it
definitely feels like a Tarantino movie.The movie does not especially feel new. It is made in the old fashioned
kung-fu movie style. It feels old, there are a lot of floating around a
bit like Crouching Tiger. The blood and violence is so over the top
just like the old fashioned kung-fu films. Bloody literally flies! :)The difference between the old movies and this one is the soundtrack.
During some scenes there are some WTC songs and hip hop songs... which
i liked. I thought it brought a new feel to the movie. It worked really
well.It has got some big names it it. The film stars Rza, Russell Crowe,
Lucy Liu and former WWE Champion, Dave Bautista. There are some pretty
good effects in it and also some great fighting scenes. The
choreography was good too. This film is excellent entertainment.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.If you like the old style Monkey TV show, kung-fu movies then you will
love this.If you would like to read more of my Movie reviews, please like my
