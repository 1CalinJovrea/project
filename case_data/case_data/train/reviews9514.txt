disappointing

I was looking forward to seeing this movie, I like Katherine and the
concept looked good. This movies was a complete failure. Katherine
acted so emotionless throughout the movie that the character became
boring and her motivations were not understood. I especially hated her
money problems, a American med student would have a crazy amount of
debt, and she had already been dealing with it for years. Also the rape
scene...ugh...This movies would be-more interesting if based in
reality, the surgeries should have been more realistic, arm transplant
would be impossible and it would have been cooler if the surgeries
would have been failures. The ending came out of no where. Don't see
this movie it sucked.
