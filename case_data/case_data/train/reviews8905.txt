How This Brutally Awful Movie Was Made

Arnie:"Hey David, I am bored and was wondering if you fancy making a
movie David Ayer: "I am kinda busy watching the grass grow, did you try
any other directors." Arnie: "Tried them all but their phones were all
switched off" David Ayer: "Damn, forgot to do that. OK I will make a
movie with you. What have you got in mind." Arnie: "Duh!...I was hoping
you would have some ideas." David: "Ok, just round up some actors and I
will get Skip Woods to write a story." He should be able to throw
something together in about an hour." Arnie: "Great."A couple of weeks later.David:" Arnie, I got the footage you sent me. It is almost 3 hours long
and I cannot make any sense of it." Arnie: "Oh Yeah!...sorry about
that. The Actors seemed to be stoned and drunk most of the time and we
kinda lost track of things. I suppose that means the movie is screwed."
David: "No problem. I will cut the crap out of it and make some kinda
movie from it. All the blood and guts and shooting should help. The
story or the acting is irrelevant. The morons who go to movies will
watch anything if it has a few star names attached. Anyway, it is no
worse than most of the utter crap coming out of Hollywood the past few
years. I am sure we will make a bundle before the public realise how
bad it is. We can always get some of our buddies to write good reviews.
That always seems to work." Arnie: "Thanks.....gotta go....time for my
meds." David: "Yeah!...me too."THE ENDNote: Save your sanity, your money and your family, and stay far away
from this brutally bad movie. It is seriously bad. Note 2: I had some
time off and decided to relax and catch up on some movies. I will never
take time off again. I am considering therapy to undo the possible
mental damage this so called movie may have done to my poor brain.
