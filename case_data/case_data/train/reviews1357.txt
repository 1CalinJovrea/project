"First Time" actually first feature for scion of film royalty...

Lets move quickly over the fact that Jon Kasdan is the son of Lawrence
Kasdan, top-tier Hollywood film royalty with a list of credits that any
film geek could recite even if in a coma. So for his "first" film (see
the pun in the title?) we have high expectations. This story of young
love, while a little uneven, is unforgettable, mainly as a result of
the chemistry between the actors. There is no substitution for
chemistry. An excellent script by Jon (whose father first attracted
attention mainly as a writer) helps, but at the end of the reel its the
performances that matter. Britt Robertson has a strong future ahead,
she pulls a page from the Rachel McAdams handbook, and actually seems
to glow in some shots. The film works, and works brilliantly, whenever
the two leads are in frame. Trivia: Kasdan changes Robertson's makeup
after the "event" in the film to emphasize the change. It's a cheesy
trick but with an actor like Robertson to work it, he pulls it off
anyway.
