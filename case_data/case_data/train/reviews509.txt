If I could give this 0 I would.

** spoiler alert ** (maybe - assuming there's a story line)This movie is rubbish from the outset - unrealistic and unbelievable on
many levels.Works on the drummed up emotional fear of sharks. I think the cameras
should have focused on the marine life and sold the footage to nat.
geo.Comparing this movie to JAWS....yeah right..."don't reach young blood"Some huge holes in the movie: * Amazingly all the shark equipment and
cage fall apart on *the day* (even the backup stuff) - like half the
rig falls into the water. Cage falls apart.* Dive time & charts - the 2 girls who are 'trapped' have less than 9
mins bottom time. Period. They are there for 1hr+ while a crap rescue
effort is on the way. Maybe even buddy breathe etc.* As they dive, goes from a summers day to a dark tank in less than 20
meters. Follow the bubbles up.* Poor preparation by those on the boat who actually run the shark
diving.* typical music plots...*...and the list goes on....oh this movie is just horrible.The only thing this movie does is cause the uneducated to fear sharks
even more...and in typical Hollywood human fashion - anything we don't
understand...we kill (e.g. King Kong, Planet of the Apes...)Seriously - save your money
