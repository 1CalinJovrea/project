Atomic Blonde Film Review

The new action spy thriller film Atomic Blonde starring Charlize
Theron, James McAvoy, John Goodman, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan, Sofia
Boutella. In Atomic Blonde Oscar® winner Charlize Theron explodes into summer in
Atomic Blonde, a breakneck action-thriller that follows MI6's most
lethal assassin through a ticking time bomb of a city simmering with
revolution and double-crossing hives of traitors in Berlin the capital
of Germany in 1989. The crown jewel of Her Majesty's Secret
Intelligence Service, Agent Lorraine Broughton (South African actress
Charlize Theron - The Devil's Advocate, Mad Max: Fury Road) is equal
parts spycraft, sensuality and savagery, willing to deploy any of her
skills to stay alive on her impossible mission. Sent alone into Berlin
to deliver a priceless dossier out of the destabilized city, she
partners with embedded station chief David Percival (Scottish actor
James McAvoy - Welcome To The Punch, Filth and who use to be married to
English actress Anne-Marie Duff who met and crossed paths when they
both starred in the UK TV Series Shameless back in 2004 but they both
divorced each other last year meaning they are not together anymore) to
navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies. Atomic Blonde is
a blistering blend of sleek action, gritty sexuality, and dazzling
style.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Atomic Blonde includes English
actor Eddie Marsan (The World's End, Mission: Impossible 3) as
