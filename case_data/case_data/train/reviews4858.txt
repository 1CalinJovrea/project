I read the book and still loved it!

I read this book before watching the film and i was apprehensive to see
if they would get all the important things from the book into the film.
I think they did a very good job to get it all in, in just over two
hours. Cast: I thought they cast this film perfectly and all the characters
played there roles perfectly. My favourite character from the book and
film is Jace as he was so witty and he was really witty in the film
which is good. Story line: The story in this film is all very cramped together as the
book was quite big so i think the screenwriter done a good job fitting
it all in the 2 hours. Music: The music in this film was perfect and fitted in with the film
perfectly. overall i think this film was impressive but there was some things that
they changed which makes me wonder how they will be changing the story
line in the second film. Worth a watch...7/10
