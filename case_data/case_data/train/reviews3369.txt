Absurdity at its best

This artsy deranged drivel can only appeal to the worst of
pseudo-intellectuals in our society. No story as such, no flow, just
snapshots of bits and pieces of life here and there. The one redeeming
moment, of perhaps 30 seconds, belongs to the beauty queen skinny
dipping. This film goes to show that even well respected actors will
accept a role when the money is right. Sign of the times, but don't
waste your hard earned money going to watch this...rather, go sit on a
park bench and watch snippets of the world, it'll be more interesting
and free to boot. Don't make me laugh, nominated for an Oscar, unless
it is for the photography of pastures and cows in Switzerland.
