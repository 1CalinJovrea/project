Great movie, but a great director!

Few movies will leave a lasting impression on you..Life of Pi is one of
those. Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is woven so
tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is
beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee, not only was he able to
capture the beauty of India, he was also able to get the best of the
actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D, its just visually
mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest
level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the
premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the
movie for the next few days!
