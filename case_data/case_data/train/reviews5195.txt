Megan Leavey

Great movie, but I couldn't get past the slight build of the main
character and buying into the story that this frail little girl could
make it in the Marine Corps. Definitely a tear-jerker. The bond and
relationship that was built between Megan and Rex was believable, and
her fight to be able to adopt him was admirable. I recommend this film.
