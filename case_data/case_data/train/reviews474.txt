The Three Stooges just how you remembered them

If you still watch the old Three Stooges Shorts from way back when and
appreciate their humor, there's no reason you won't love this movie.
The setting is contemporary, with iphone's and the jersey shore and
what not, but this setting is only used to further punctuate the
timeless humor of the stooges. All three actors who portray the stooges
do a flawless job and make you actually forget that they are not the
originals halfway through the movie. It's as if Larry, Curly and Moe
have been pulled out of time and placed into today's society getting
into the same type of trouble and running the same type of gags they
always would. There really isn't a better way the Three Stooges could
have been portrayed in this day and age. The Farrelly brothers do an
incredible job doing the character of the Stooges justice, weaving a
fantastic Stooge-esque plot and transporting these lovable nitwits into
the present day. Heck the Farrelly brothers even made sure to include
the classic title slides seen before every Stooges short. It's for this
reason I give this movie an extremely high rating, not because it's a
profound comedy, but because it had one goal: recreate the enduring
humor of the Three Stooges, and with that goal in mind this movie
overwhelmingly succeeds.
