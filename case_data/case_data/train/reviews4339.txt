Just plain vulgar and crude

This is a story that tries to be funny by putting a dirty mouth, vulgar
and sickening frat boy persona in a teddy bear. With all the skills of
animating such a bear, it could have done something uplifting, but the
happy ending is a sham. I felt tricked to watch this movie. It made me
so upset that I actually wasted my time on this. I kept wishing there
was some redeeming value to this movie but there wasn't. This movie
puts the worst of human nature out there and makes it appear good. Who
could come up with such a story line that is so nasty? The story line
is so pathetic and uncreative telling a story that's been told many
times over. Definitely not for your kids or teens. And people wonder
why we have an attitude problem with young people in the US. This is a
case in point.
