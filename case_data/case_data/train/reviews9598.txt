Excellent movie by all accounts

I remember when I was in the cinema watching The Package (1989) - I
just didn't want it to finish. I felt the same way with Atomic Blonde.
Wow - what a movie.The setting is 1989, and the team made quite an effort to make it as
authentic as possible. The clothes, the cars, the weapons - even the
classic Tetris game played by the Russians, which indeed was a Russian
invention.Every single scene is well thought out, and the story unfolds nicely.
This is hands down the best movie I've seen in years.
