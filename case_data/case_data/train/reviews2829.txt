It's like Jamie Lannister saying " The things I do for Love "" You need to watch yourself " -Mud In fact, everyone needs to watch
himself, mostly the eponymous fugitive and almost so the 14 year olds
Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), who aid the murderer
Mud (Matthew McConaughey)as he connects with his lost love, Juniper
(Reese Witherspoon) and evades bounty hunters and irate family members
of his victim. Everyone seems to be running from something.Mud, who is in trouble for killing his girlfriends " troubler/ molester
" , is being chased and hunted down by the police and the victims
family. Mud runs off to an island on the banks of Mississippi and finds
a Boat on a tree and apparently two young explorers also find the same.
They help Mud rebuild it so he can get off the island and go far from
there as possible with his love Juniper.While Juniper still doesn't trust him, he leaves her for good, and
decides to leave the place alone once and for all. While saying the
final good bye he gets attacked by the bounty hunters at gets shot. The
last scene depicts him on a boat with his uncle ( who according to Mud
was an Assassin) are off to the sea with a new life.The filmography is beautiful with a country-side setting. The shots of
the great Mississippi river is also charming. I still don't get it why
Matthew was not nominated for Oscars for this.
