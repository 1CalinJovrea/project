best modern zombies movie

Hello,We can argue whether a zombies should be fast or not In the movie, they are fast, deadly and merciless. It is more
believable than those zombies can take over a city or a country within
a day.The movie succeed where Fear The walking dead failed miserably, to
explain how the pandemic starts and how it has been spread so fast.Most of the movie take place in a train, very claustrophobic place if
you are chased by a herd of undead, but it worked for me, I felt the
tension, the drama, the crazy survival instinct of ones and the
resignation of the others.Walking dead made the zombie apocalypse almost cool, with guns and sex
and love story, In train to busan nothing is cool, you do not have gun,
your family and pretty much everyone you know are dead, there is no
escape and nobody will come to save you ..I spent 2 marvelous hours watching a movie about zombies, I despite the
fact I watched hundred movies about zombies, I have been surprised and
scared.
