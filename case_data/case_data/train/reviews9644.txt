Masterful...and hollow.

First allow me to say a few good things about this astonishing film -
it is visually magnificent. The camera work is brilliant. The acting is
superb. The segments of story are clever, entertaining and creepy as
hell. The locations/sets are amazing. The concept is quite unique.Unfortunately, it is probably the most boring film I have seen all
year.No matter how masterfully this film is crafted, it has no soul. There
is nothing here to lure you in - I found I didn't care what happened to
any of the characters, the good ones or the bad ones (that's
simplifying things because there are no real good or bad here). Watching this movie is like looking at a cake display through a
window...it all looks so beautiful, but you can't smell or taste
anything. Technically, this film scores a solid 8/10....as far as its
entertainment value goes, I give it a 4/10.But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder...
