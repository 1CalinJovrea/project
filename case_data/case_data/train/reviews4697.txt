Could have been a great satire!

This is one of those movies which sadly is a feature-length version of
its trailer with little more to offer. During the entire movie I kept
waiting for the story world to crumble into satire, because I was in
disbelief that someone would make a zombie version of Twilight, let
alone one this messy. In Warm Bodies (as explained in the trailer) love
literally conquers all. R goes for days without eating because of:
love. R becomes living again because of: love. R transfers his
love/revitalizing powers via...telekinesis(?) to the rest of the
zombies because of....love. What kind of love can have that kind of
power? Good 'ol American love: he sees a blonde-haired blue-eyed
teenager firing a gun and that's it, baby. No one needs to tell the
girl what Stockholm Syndrome is, because that would ruin the magic that
is their romance.Don't get me wrong, there were definitely a few laughs here and there
but I just kept waiting for that moment where the fourth wall would be
shattered! Having at least a little meta content would have been great,
adding a tiny bit of intelligence to it all. 2/10
