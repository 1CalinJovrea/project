Brilliant! Watch it

A brilliant movie, I truly enjoyed it. In brief: four characters, one location, excellent dialog, clever
script, good acting. This is film-making.It is a thought provoking, a bit eerie, and leaves you with a "holy
crap" feeling when its done. When it ended I was like "who wrote this?
what else has he done so far. gotta watch it"..They did so much in this film with such a small budget. In a better
world this movie would be celebrated in cinemas worldwide and not left
for torrent down-loaders.Warm recommendation! :)
