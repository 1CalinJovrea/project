The Texas Shotgun Massacre... Annoys

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINORS SPOILERSMy hype about this prequel was high. I loved the idea of follow 4
inmates spreading out the chaos in Texas and making the viewer trying
to guess which one of the protagonists would be the famous serial
killer. Although Leatherface gave us an ambiguous taste! In a good way
we have a movie about 4 lunatics characters trying to escape from the
police, but in the bad way we have a movie without the typical vibe of
the Texas Chainsaw films.Forget all the things that made you liked the previous movies, I
thought was watching a spin- off instead a prequel, Leatherface only
turns in a lunatic killer during the last 5 or 10 minutes (and he only
dress the skin mask in the last 2 seconds), the Sawyer family
development was far way of what we have seen in another films, they
weren't so crazy or creepy, they were just a sadistic family. Even the
sequences about the inmates spreading the madness could be better, they
go to 2 places after escape from the asylum, take a shotgun and then
the final act begins, the producers could put them in more scenarios
and doing a lot of crazy stuff.Leatherface isn't so bad, has some potential but is very far away of to
be a good horror movie as also I can't call it a Texas Chainsaw movie,
because even a shotgun has more screen time than the chainsaw, hasn't
the typical insane vibe and sometimes looks more a spin-off or a
thriller based on the story that we all know.Rating: 4.5/10
