I just got tricked into watching a rom-com, but I'm not even mad.

So...this movie is somehow thrown into the horror genre, but it is
DEFINITELY not a horror movie. It's an avant-garde romantic comedy.
There are a few sci-fi moments, but for the most part it's one of the
cutest movies I've ever seen. The plot is very Disney with subtle hints
of Slither-esque grotesqueness. I liked this movie a lot, but I feel
tricked... I was really in the mood for a good horror film, but I got a
strange rom-com instead. I'm not mad though. I enjoyed the film for its
extreme amount of cuteness. I highly recommend this movie, but don't
expect any horror. It has a lot of personality. I can't relate it any
other film. I think this movie might pave the way for a new type of
romantic comedy. I usually loathe romantic comedies, but this one takes
a fresh approach! I can imagine this new genre really taking off. If
you're a dude who's really into sci-fi and you're dating a girl who is
really into typical chick-flicks, then this is a great movie for
meeting her in the middle.
