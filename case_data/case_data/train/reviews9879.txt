Not worth it

The script does not deserve to be made into a movie. Its more like a
five minute bed time story for a 5-Year old. The story revolves around
the beautiful Saoirse Ronan who won many hearts due to her enchanting
and mesmerizing eyes. That's all that is to the movie. A little
summary, that's the introduction and the end to the movie. An immigrant
to Brooklyn, she has home sickness, but then she thrives, then she goes
back and faces the dilemma to stay or go back. Voila! Obviously she
goes back, end of story. No drama, no romance, no suspense, and
according to me no story-line. Waste of time and money. This movie is
so short that I can't even write a 10 line review for it.
