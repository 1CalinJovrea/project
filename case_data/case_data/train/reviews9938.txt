1
one of the most exploitative films ever ... and a rising star

First, let's do the real backstory, that is, the real world backstory.
KA1 was a pretty interesting movie, with some nice ideas, some nice
execution, and a decent plot arc. Arguably, the best thing in KA1 was
Chloë Grace Moretz, who stole entire scenes from more seasoned actors
with an impish grin and comic timing that Jack Benny would have envied.
Ironically, since both KA1 and KA2 are about evil, you need to
understand that the real evil happened after KA1 was made, when a new
production team got hold of the rights to the sequel. Now, there are
bad sequels and there are worse sequels, but the baddest of them all is
a sequel that, from the getgo, seeks to exploit the vulnerabilities of
its audience. And that's what we have here. Essentially a moronic story
with episodes of violence bordering on the pornographic, interspaced
with interesting (albeit undeveloped) secondary arcs that riff off, for
example, MEAN GIRLS. To call this movie an abomination is unfair to
real abominations. Through it all, however, Chloë Grace Moretz shines
in her reprise of an older more mature Hit Girl, pretty much stealing
every scene she is in - again. She is photogenic, athletic,
charismatic, and knows how to deliver dialogue. We'll be seeing more of
her.
