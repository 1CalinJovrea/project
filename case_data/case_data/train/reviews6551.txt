Not what I was Expecting

I had to go watch this movie series just to justify the mixed ratings I
read.Well, I have to say, In My Opinion, there was more going on in this
movie that was unrealistic and slow than favorable / enjoyable moments.So, personally, I won't hold fire against the comments that rated this
movie below a 7. I actually would say they are right on target.I have to say movie quality has certainly went down over the last 6
yrs. I'm beginning to believe many directors and movie industries are
expecting movie goers will watch anything with engaging previews to
suck us in and torture us with the rest of the movie being BAD.I am a sci-fi fantasy type movie lover, loving the tech and all that
stuff, however, there is a threshold as to what I enjoy watching when
it comes to this type of movie genre and this movie just don't quite
get there for me. Divergent followers or not, this movie fails for the
length of time and plot it delivers to be enjoyable.As stated before, I don't believe in rating movies terribly low, so I
give this movie series a generous 6 without going into more details.Thanks
