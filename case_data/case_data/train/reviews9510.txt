My eyes...they burn

What started out as a promising film with a decent sound track at times
and more than average visuals, quickly turned into the film equivalent
of autism. It lulls you into a false sense of security thing "hmm you
know what this may actually go somewhere"but it just doesn't, then it
adds in some more details to make up for the fact it makes absolutely
zero sense. It's like the writers were high, like when you think you have a
fantastic idea but really it's just the weed tricking you. The links
and Blanks this film expects you to make you need to do as much writing
as Dylan does on his glass panels just to make sense of any of it. I cringed so much at times that my toes pretty much curled up, I'm a
huge fan of alternative reality/time loop genre but this film just a
random mixture of pointless links which in a random and bizarre way
link to a star going supernova, I'd go as far as saying one of the worst films I've ever seen
