Outstanding!

As a long-time fan of the original series who has watched rights
disputes, and cast and director changes over the years, I viewed the
pre-release publicity with high hopes and low expectations. But in the
end, the film itself was a wonderful surprise! Witty, light-hearted
without being a spoof and dramatic without being heavy-handed. The two
main characters were updated from what was allowable in 60s television
to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original
incarnations, and the attendant allies and villains were all one could
want. The film was very much what the series could have been were it
being done now, in the era of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. I've been
twice and will be going again, as well as buying the DVD. Open Channel
D; this film is more than I dared hope for!
