Wanted to love it

I tagged along at the last minute to the Venice Film Festival. This was
one of the films we were able to see on short notice. Sorry to say, I
was underwhelmed. I love Matt, and he was brilliantly scary, but the
story line, even though I knew it was satire, seemed like it was trying
too hard to be more than just entertainment. But all was not lost, I
loved The Shape of Water, and absolutely adored Charlie Plummer in Lean
on Pete.
