It just got better!!

It was so good! It was hilarious, I have never been in a cinema where
the audience reacted like they did last night, the roar of laughter at
times was louder then the film. At parts, well, one bit, the audience
even clapped (you'll know what I mean when you watch it). If they're is
any skeptics out there, anyone that thinks they couldn't top the first
or that Pitch Perfect couldn't get any better .... It just did!The songs are modern, with the odd 80's power ballads thrown in and the
classic riff off half way through that includes everything from 90's
hip- hop and club anthems. I immediately downloaded the soundtrack on
Spotify when I got home and currently its playing in the background as
I type away - with the odd body pop and head bang ;)If I had to rate it, honestly I'd give it *****'s without hesitation.
