More Like A Theatrical Play Than A Film Feature

Director David Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin made a film feature
about the late Apple Computers founder Steve Jobs.Michael Fassbender
stars on this film that was based on the Walter Isaacson's authorized
biography of the late Apple CEO.The film takes us into three different acts of the life of Steve Jobs
just like a play.The first act was during the time when Jobs was part
of the Macintosh R and D group and was about to release a new computer
that will be known as Macintosh.The second act is during the time when
Jobs was now seen working at NeXT Computers after getting fired from
Apple and was about to release the new computer "Cube" in 1988.Finally
in the final act,we get to see Jobs back again at Apple Computer and he
is now working as the CEO.Once again,a new computer will be released
and it is known as "iMac".No question that this is a talky film after it is being patterned in a
play.Expect the characters to talk constantly and less movements among
the characters.Added to that,expect the story to take place into the
words spoken by the actor rather than the actions that are happening in
the film.Viewers who are used to watching a movie might find it
boring.People who are not greatly familiar with Steve Jobs would find
themselves lost among the words of the actors and actresses involved.But in spite of the movie being patterned in a play,expect to see great
performances from Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs as well as his
co-star Kate Winslet.It also provides a lot of knowledge about Jobs
too.But for one who want to know more about Steve Jobs and finds this
theatrical play-patterned movie boring,watching Ashton Kutcher's movie
"Jobs" as well as the TV movie "The Pirates of the Silicon Valley"
could also be helpful.For documentaries,"The Man and the Machine" is
probably the best.
