Truly 'A'wful

I went in to the cinema expecting to be entertained with a funny and
entertaining film. Oh how I was let down. The acting if just plain bad.
The humour is almost non-existent, and when there is some, it is
dragged out until it is no longer funny. Almost from the beginning I
was tempted to walk out of the cinema, but I was hoping that the film
would pick up - I wasted the 80 plus minutes of my life.I do not know when I will be able to risk watching another film with
either of the lead (I should use the term 'Actors' here, but I felt
that there was nothing that could be referred to as acting in the film
from them). Avoid, and save some of your life.
