Really?!?

I was SO excited to see this movie and thirty minutes in I was.........
BORED! And there was another 110 minutes left! The acting was not great
and accents seemed to change every few lines for every character. It
seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead
of acting - I think I caught "Blue Steel" face a few times. Gal is
gorgeous but I did not get Amazonia princess from her - could they not
have found an actress with muscle? Felicity Jones in Rogue One was more
Wonder Woman! Of course the movie had to throw in the bits about being
beautiful AND smart - but not too smart because a man had to explain
snow and she was not so Amazonian that she didn't like looking drop
dead gorgeous for the guys. Nope, no Wonder Woman here - just another
Hollywood "preach it" to the public movie only this time the super hero
is thin, scantily glad, super duper smartish/childish, and
condescending.
