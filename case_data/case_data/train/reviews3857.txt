Kong would regret being in this film

I was confused about the purpose of this film, and sadly, I was still
confused after watching the film. All the elements of this new version
of King Kong have been recycled. Taking parts of the originals/remakes
and hastily gluing them together again in a different way doesn't mean
it is going to create an inventive artwork. And I knew they would put a scene where Kong saves a pretty lady in his
palm, I just knew it. All that's improved from the previous films is
Kong's appearance. He is fluffier, angrier and more realistic. Some
points must be given to the stunning visual effects.The characters' names and faces have also changed, but their nature and
characteristics are half dimensional and predictable. It is stereotypes
upon stereotypes. It is a major waste of talent with Tom Hiddleston,
Samuel L Jackson and Academy Award winner Brie Larson ("Room")
struggling in the muddled chaos. You could see and feel the
disappointment. Even Kong seems confused. The performances are half-
hearted and there is just no substance for them to work with. I bet all
they were thinking of while filming was 'get me out of here' Â–
literally. For the majority of the film, everyone says very few words to each
other. The conversations are forced and laughable. It wouldn't have
made a difference if they were just silent. It's so predictable that
you would know exactly what the next line would be. I thought while watching this, was this meant to be an exaggerated
satire of King Kong? Or was it meant to be taken seriously? Even the
execution of the film presents the same questions. At one point, it
would be slow and mystic, and minutes later, overly upbeat music would
hit your ears, and we are treated to magnified slow-motion action. It
feels it is trying too hard to get our attention. And once it does, it
doesn't know how to sustain it. And finally, there are so many extreme close-ups of Samuel L. Jackson's
face, it probably took up half the film. They did it to match Kong's
face, so you can imagine how gigantic it was. Maybe if Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts figured out from the beginning
what type and style of film this would be, it would have been a better
film. It seems like he had an idea but is unconvicted towards it, and
instead keeps changing his mind to offer more 'fun'. The result that it
is a jumble of various pieces that don't belong in the same puzzle.
