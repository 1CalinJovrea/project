Great history

Absolutely fantastic film, great history behind it and the actors and
actresses play their roles with such passion. Definitely states a lot
about the Ottoman Empire times and a lot of history behind many
cultures who are still strong in growth as of today across the world.
If you are interested in seeking a film that will pull you into the
screen and get lost in suspense of disbelief then this is the movie of
the year that you should invest your time into watching with no
distractions.
