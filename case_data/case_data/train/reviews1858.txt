All in all a big disappointment!

Very poor performance from Kristen Stewart. She keeps looking as if she
is sitting on the toilet and doesn't convince nor captivate the
audience in many scenes. At one point in the movie she gave the men a
pep talk, one of the worst ever! Almost all her dialogues are poor and
unconvincing. The only thing that kind of kept me in the audience were the funny
dwarfs. Also the CGI was pretty nice. But the bottom line remains,
acting is the most important and especially that of the leading role...Apart from Kristen, the other actors were OK, but unfortunately not
enough to save the movie.All in all a big disappointment!
