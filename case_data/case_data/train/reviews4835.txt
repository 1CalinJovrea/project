Good actual horror.

Since no one written a review its on me i guess.I really Enjoyed the Movie so sorry if i don't really have much
negative to say.The Good: -Scary scenes are actually scary. (suspence build up pretty well, i
liked seeing the "Monster" which I usually dislike in other Horror
Movies) -Krampus is pretty accurate. (And Scary) -Additions to the old myth are either working well or are too funny to
not include. -Brings the world closer to the real old Christmas we "enjoy" in
central Europe. -Funny half of the movie working well. -Scary half works perfectly fine. -Overall pretty good contrast to the rest of the commercial holiday.The Bad: -Maybe a little slow on the start. -Maybe overall a bit too harsh for some viewers. (but no blood or
overuse of the F Word, but still pretty scary but the closer the end
the more serious it gets with less comedy)The cinema was pretty much enjoying it some people hated it i guess.
But i felt it was quite good and had a good evening.I would say overall if i wanted to watch Krampus in the very beginning,
which i didn't intend to, i would be happy with the actual Movie.It Keeps its Promises and does very well what it intends to do. Don't
expect something like Tucker and Dale, Shawn of the Dead or Braindead
more a mix of Jeepers Kreepers and and regular Christmas Comedy, but
does this much better. (i disliked jeepers creepers and all this
Christmas comedy but liked this)
