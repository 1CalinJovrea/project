Pedal never gets to the metal

WheelmanWheelman is a Netflix original production and it is a quality
production too. The movie looks and sounds great. I watched the film in
UHD with 5.1 sound and the technical aspects of the film are immersive.
Shot with reminiscence to 70's car chase movies this film does offer up
something different. I would say unique but the whole in car thing for
the duration of the movie has been done before. The movies opening
titles have a 70's vibe too but it soon becomes apparent that this is a
modern day tale.Frank Grillo stars as the wheelman. A driver for a botched bank
robbery. A man who then finds himself in a desperate struggle to keep
himself and his family alive. Someone always wants their money back! A
relatively short movie which is just as well. Admittedly I enjoyed
Grillo's performance here and found myself semi-invested in
proceedings. But for me Wheelman never really put his foot on the gas
and the whole film was a forgettable experience. I would recommend you
check out the film because it offers up something that hasn't been done
countless times before. There are less enjoyable ways to spend 82
minutes but don't expect anything too high octane to get the pulse
racing.
