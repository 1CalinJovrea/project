Rod, not a sword

I like Ridley Scott's movies. Actually I went to watch "Exodus" only
because he was the director. However, in my humble opinion Ridley Scott
shouldn't even thought about filming this movie. It was ridiculously
inaccurate in many details. Eg. Moses didn't kill two Egyptians but
one, he fled to desert and was not exiled there, he spent not 9 years
but 40 yrs in the desert, the Bible never says that Moses used a sword!
Aaron used to talk before each plague to Pharaoh and in the movie even
Moses doesn't do that, and that humiliating image of God being a child
and that kiddish dialogue between Moses and God, etc. So the whole
interpretation of the story of Exodus is pretty much diverted in this
movie. Now the question is, why take an information from a certain
source if you are going to completely divert it? Better be more
creative than just diverting a story. Pass.
