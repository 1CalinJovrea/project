Meet Bob.  Think you know him?  Better think again.

Bob Saginowski(Tom Hardy), is a sort of down, but not quite out, kind
of guy. Maybe even slow. He and his cousin, Marv(James Gandofini) run a
mob owned, NYC neighborhood bar. The bar, once Marv's, is now a "drop"
(as in the movie title) because the mob often parks its daily take
there. Bob's life is complicated. He sort of watches over his cousin,
Marv, who's still not happy about losing ownership of the bar years ago
and still schemes foolishly. Bob also takes care of a puppy he finds in
the garbage. Neighbor,Nadia(Noomi Repace), helps with the puppy, and
slowly falls for Bob. Unfortunately the puppy's owner and Nadia's wacko
ex-boyfriend, Eric Deeds(Matthias Schoenaerts), is not happy about
this. The mob is also not happy after its money is stolen. What will
Bob do? Therein lies the well crafted story. This movie is great entertainment. More than that, it's great movie
making. The writing, directing, acting, camera work are first class.
But the story is what really shines. Based on a short story (Animal
Rescue) by Dennis Lehane it's got all the ingredients we crave: flawed
good guy, flawed beauty, really bad guys, and and a superb ending. You
might say it's all very predictable, but maybe not.The Drop is a juicy, violent slice of urban Americana. Does everyone
get what they deserve? Ya gotta see it to find out. See it also for the
last performance of James Gandolfini, which should not be missed.
