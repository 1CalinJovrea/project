worst film I've seen. disgusting tripe.

From the very start to the very end I was shaking my head in disgust.
The acting from the 2 lead fella's angered me throughout. That English
one is probably the most annoying gobshite ever. Eastwood's a proper
douche too. Them birds are tidy but Christ they're terrible. The bad
guys are bullshit and the tunes in this movie are dog muck. Canny cars
aye but who cares. There's a bad guy who seems to smile a lot, he's a
proper dick. annoying as fuk face. you'll kna who I mean if you choose
to watch this pish. So to summarise, Its god awful and the English lead
dude needs to have a think about what he's done. Clint would be turning
in his grave.....if he was deed.
