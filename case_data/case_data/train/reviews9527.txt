Fodder for Morons!

A Re-hash of so many similar Movies - family trapped In house fighting
for survival. The reasoning behind the 12-hour Purge Is never
satisfactorily explained,other than It's a short period once-a-year
during which there are no laws and everyone can do has he or she sees
fit. Rather than huge Gangs causing havoc - race-war,religious war,etc,
as one would expect - Instead,It's neighbour-on-neighbour. Quite how
this release of pent-up animalistic anger makes for a good
America(Including unemployment down to a mere 1%)we shall never know.
Everything takes place Inside the one house and we are fed the usual
"walking-around-slowly-In-the-dark-with-flash-lights" routine. Yeah,how
fresh and unique! A ridiculous premise and lousy script made bearable
by some pretty decent acting. Sadly,we are left still waiting for that
special little something that never happens. Massive anti-climax. Don't
bother watching unless you've no paint to watch drying!BLOOPER.....The
guy Is tied up In the chair with the duct-tape down from his
mouth....In the next scene,where he tips the chair over,the tape Is
back around his face!And directors get paid tens of thousands or more
for missing obvious mess-ups like that!
