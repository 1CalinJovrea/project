Spectacular SciFi pulls no punches

The first thing you'll observe about Luc Besson's Valerian is how
gorgeous it looks, how much work went into the perfect realisation of
this world. In a time where nearly every blockbuster features tons of
CGI, Valerian stands out and highlights how cheaply the effects are
done in most of the other ones.Next, the sheer inventiveness of designers, artists, set builders,
wardrobe and makeup - again, makes us painfully realise how
off-the-rack and dull most blockbusters are. Add to that Besson's
quirky aesthetics and you're in a world that's nearly overpowering you
with its inventiveness, its visual splendour, and also plain fun. I
mean, a movie where a Jessica Rabbit cameo doesn't feel forced or out
of place, that's just unique.In my opinion, the optical fireworks were even a bit overdone, some
scenes were plainly set up in a certain way to make them more
spectacular but didn't really add to the story - an early on action
sequence in a half-virtual market comes to mind that would work nearly
equally well in a normal bazaar, just without some gags.As to the story-line - lovers of the books (as I am) will recognise a
lot of ingredients and species, and the main set-piece, a space city,
is obviously taken from "L'Ambassadeurs des Ombres", but the story
itself is a new one and revolves around a planet wiped out in a war
about 30 years back, and the repercussions thereof. The "secret"
someone wants to keep is not that secret to us, in fact about half an
hour into the movie you already have a pretty good idea of what's going
on, the joy comes from the detours we're taking on the road to the
happy ending, not from silly plot twists.Now, the characters, Valerian and Laureline: Dane DeHaan looks too
young for his part from the comics (where Valerian was the more
experienced partner, here he just has a higher degree), Cara Delevingne
is perfectly cast, standing her ground with just the right amount of
sarcasm and spunk. The team dynamics were as readers know it - Valerian
the one who tends to stick to the rules and play by book while
Laureline tends to act more impulsively - but both working together
really well, be it as a duo or solo. There is a romance angle in the
movie that was not taken from the books and feels a bit forced,
thankfully it stays marginal and doesn't lessen the overall enjoyment.And cheers to the screenwriters (Besson, mostly) for not going full in
with the stakes. While there's some serious action here - people die
and some more might die if V&L didn't succeed - it's actually a rather
smallish plot, with just one single villain, and no worlds or even the
universe to be saved, just the lives of some innocent bystanders.Big recommendation for all fans of colourful SciFi and optical
fireworks!
