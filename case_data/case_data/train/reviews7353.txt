Good way to wile away a couple of hours on a flight

I watched this movie on a flight and found it pretty enjoyable. It's
fairly staple Rom Com script.Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) and Chantry (Zoe Cazan) become best friends,
but do they want more than to be just friends. Chantry has a long term
boyfriend Ben who she is very close to, so it seems they will remain
just good friends regardless of whether Wallace wants more.This is pretty much by the numbers rom com storyline. They've been
churning these out for years and will continue to do so. It seemed
pretty unlikely that Wallace and Chantry would have been best friends
and the relationship between them doesn't really ring true. It's pretty
watchable though and a good way to pass a couple of hours.
