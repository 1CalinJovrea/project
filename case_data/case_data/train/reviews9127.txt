Don't waste your time, pretentious crap

Just got back from the theater. Don't understand the rating. Reading
the reviews ... I feel lonely. I feel like these critics got their job
too easy, or by scheming, or by sheer luck. Am I the only one who
laughed out loud when Tony shot himself in the groin? Or when he,
blinded by a well deserved blow to the head, stumbled out of the
trailer? For those of you who think that I didn't understand the inner
turmoil of the writer pictured there as a physical struggle.. let me
put your mind at ease. I did and so should everyone, because this movie
is a like a fake easy test you get just to feel good about yourself. No
thanks. After twenty years this is his revenge? Showing her that he
wrote a crap book? Making her feel alone, left behind, like he felt
back then? Making her understand what he has been through, what she
missed? Big whoop, she already knew and beside hurting a bit she didn't
do anything about it. You know, like in real life. Tom Ford, master of
the cinema verite.I have a fun fact for you: did you know that when Ray is sitting on the
toilet outside, and the cop tells him to get dressed, he wipes his ass
with a page of the script? True story.Joking aside, there is so much "The emperor's new clothes" thing going
on in the movie business nowadays that my head hurts.Anyway, trashing this flick is the only thing that makes me feel better
after losing 4 bucks to this writer , director , fashion designer, lion
tamer, electrician, etc, so I'm sorry if I upset anybody who was deeply
moved by his movie, and will forever remember it as one of great pieces
of cinema.In all honesty, there are so many movies more deserving of good
reviews, and it is sad that we don't have smarter critics.
