need my money back!!! :(

I did not see in my life movie in cinema like this horrible failure in
the acting and the script and directing ... is to disregard the
mentality of the viewer, and I think that the film level does not rise
to view it by the kids, get bored and not exciting, the film under
performed and a waste of time .... a real loss actually pay for this
the film.. In many moments as you watch the film you feel stupid, did
not give every scene right because of events accelerated in the film I
do not know why the producers issue movies like this. We are in 2016
and I'm sad that films like this film in the level of decline terrible.
I repeat I am very very upset, because I do not imagine myself watching
this horror movie very BAD BAD BAD movies EVER EVER EVER !!!!!
