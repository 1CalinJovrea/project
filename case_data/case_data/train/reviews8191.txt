No story at all, it sucks.

The only good thing I can say about this film is the fine work of ILM,
their work is fantastic. BUT- the movie is garbage. I saw the original
film 4 times the same day and twice the next day in 1977, I was hooked!
Story-characters-caring- being immersed in the film, all this is
lacking in Rouge One . I could care less about the characters. No real
plot. No passion. My Grandmother could have directed better. No
emotion. No development. Simple eye candy. At least JJ Abrams put some
passion in EP 7. Disney needs to have screenwriters and directors with
commitment to the fans do these films, or destroy the myth. If you HAVE
to see it, go to the early show at the $2 cinemas.
