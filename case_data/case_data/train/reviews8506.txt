Entertaining, surreal movie

I have to admit I don't understand the extreme negativity in some of
the reviews.....especially considering the amount of uninspired garbage
in movie theaters these days.Now, 2:22 is not a masterpiece, and like most movies it has weaknesses,
but its strength is that it builds a sense of suspense without the
usual car chases and urban shoot outs that seem to please the ADD
crowds so much. The acting is solid (not Oscar material but better than
hinted at in many reviews), the direction and special effects are very
polished, and, more importantly, the slow accretion of mysterious
details and surreal circumstances make it far more interesting, IMO,
than most movies currently on offering. I think this movie also does a
good job, overall, of hinting at parts of the ending but at the same
time maintaining a sense of suspense about how exactly the mysterious
events and patterns noticed by the main character will come together.This is not a realistic thriller, with a clear cut plot and an ending
that explains every minor thread or detail in its story, or a
relentless action movies with plenty of explosions and other events
that ultimately mean nothing, or a bloated love story with SF elements.
Hence, I think, the disappointment of some viewers.The way I see it this is a movie that, despite its imperfections,
evolves into a subtle, psychological thriller that hints at man's
endless fascination with patterns (in our Universe, in our life, in
history etc) and at our sense of wonder of how we fit in it. A movie
that while providing us with an interesting story also asks us to add
to the plot our own interpretation of the events, and our own sense of
wonder about the mystery of our existence.Now, there is no doubt that other movies on similar topics are superior
(12 monkeys and Groundhog day come to mind, among others), but I still
think this is one of the few movies worth watching I've seen this year,
despite its limitations. At least it asks the watcher to actually
engage his brain instead of just switching off and let the explosions
roll on until the cardboard cutout bad guy/guys are vanquished.
