Campy as Hell

Tales of Halloween... Campy as Hell!! OK, you do not want to watch this
if you are looking for an actual Halloween/scary movie. The dialogue is
horrible, the acting is horrible, the special effects were horrible.
Yet, overall, the movie wasn't bad. Some of the stories had me laughing
like crazy, some were really silly and some had me thinking ""What the
heck am I watching?? Truth is, I like ridiculous stories. It even got
the 7/10 rating because one of the tales reminds me of Evil Dead (the
original and Best with Bruce Campbell, not the crap they called a
remake). Watch a couple of the stories before you dismiss this movie
entirely. You never know....
