Better than expected

We're the Millers was a surprisingly fun and funny movie. Small time
pot dealer played by Jason Sudeikis is robbed of the money he owes to
his supplier, so to pay off the debt, the goofy and eccentric supplier
sends him on a big time smuggling deal into Mexico. As cover, Sudeikis
convinces stripper/neighbor Rose (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his
wife, runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) as their daughter, and young
neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) as their son-- and together they become
the uber-American family, the Millers. Naturally, the situations and
people they run into going and returning ensure nothing goes according
to plan. There were lots of chuckle-out-loud moments (not so many full
blown belly laughs), and it moved along at a pretty fast clip. The
performances were all outstanding, especially Sudeikis. Loved watching
him! Parents: some sexually suggestive scenes won't be appropriate for
kids, or you'll have some 'splainin to do. All in all, a real fun film.
