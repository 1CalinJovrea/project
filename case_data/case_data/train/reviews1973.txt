Big disappointment

I expected more serious film. It is just full with modern digital
effects, far from the truth what really happened in Pompeii. The
millions funded the creation of this trash were wasted. The purpose of
the film was to show artificial digital effects, not so successful, and
cruelty because this is the way to make money in our time. Cruel,
mediocre, cliché' fairy-tale. By the way  there were no black slaves
in Pompeii. The director blindly followed the rule in Hollywood to put
one black person in the main character at any cost, ignoring the
content of the story. It is really pity to waste money for such a
tasteless, incompetently created film.
