Watch it for the concept, the music, the artists worldwide and of course starry nights.

Last week, at the beautiful Getty Center, we had the chance to view a
pre-screening of the movie, 'Loving Vincent,' world's first
full-feature film made entirely with oil paintings. Loving Vincent
revolves around the mysterious death of the artist Vincent Van Gogh who
had created around 800 paintings in his lifetime. What could have been
much easily created as an animated or live action feature, ended up
being a compilation of over 66000 frames of oil paintings, brought to
life with camera movements on still life, CG animation, daunting music
and of course skills of over 100 artists. The concept of the movie is a
good enough reason to watch this movie but as for the movie itself:
read the review ahead!The movie follows the journey of Armand Roulin as he investigates the
mysterious death of the artist Van Gogh. The movie retains an air of
suspicion and depression throughout. The pace of the storyline is slow
as it attempts to combine several theories regarding Van Gogh's death.
Yet the village panoramas and aerial shots of Paris add life to the
story. As the camera sweeps across the field or up a river as a steam
engine pass through the bridge above, one cannot help but notice how
beautifully the steam is blending in with the sky. The dialogues have been largely inspired by the letters that Van Gogh
wrote to his brothers but lack speech authenticity from the period.
However, the dialogues do exhibit the positions of all the characters
thoroughly, especially those of Armand Roulin and if not an instant
connection with the character, one does eventually the pain and sorrows
of Van Gogh towards his end days.The death of Van Gogh was a loss to the world of art but the movie
'Loving Vincent' is a big leap in the world of art and fulfilling the
void of the amazing artist, and others like him who suffered because
they weren't mentally healthy.
