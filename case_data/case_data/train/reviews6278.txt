I was hoping for a little more from the film's climax, but still worth seeing.

'6 DAYS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biographical action film about the 1980 Iranian embassy siege in
London, and the heroic SAS soldiers that ended it. The movie was
directed by Toa Fraser, and it was written by Glenn Standring. It stars
Jamie Bell, Mark Strong, Abbie Cornish and Ben Turner. The film has
received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's now available
on both video and VOD. I found it to be an interesting history lesson,
and somewhat thrilling at times. On April 30th, 1980 six armed Iranians raided the Iranian Embassy, in
Princess Gate, London, and took 25 hostages. The world watched the
intense drama on TV, for six days, while BBC reporter Kate Adie
(Cornish) boldly covered it. Chief Inspector Max Vernon (Strong)
handled the negotiations over the phone, with the terrorists' leader,
Salim (Turner). While an SAS unit, including Rusty Firmin (Bell),
prepared to regain control of the Embassy by force.The movie is definitely interesting, and it has an especially
insightful (somewhat sympathetic) view of the Iranian gunmen,
especially their leader Salim. The Max Vernon character is also pretty
sympathetic, and well played by Strong (who's always good). Ben Turner
is also really good in his role. I was hoping for a little more from
the film's climax though, I have to admit, but it is a well made and
somewhat educational film.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
