If you want to see a woman who is kind, strong, has integrity watch this film

Joy is refreshing. Finally we see a film where the main character is
not only a woman she has real life problems to deal with. No she does
not resort to drugs or alcohol, no she does not give-up, and no she
does not turn her back on her family. She has perseverance, integrity,
warmth, and kindness. She is a woman like many women who make their way
through a 'man's world' and she does it her way. She is strong and
feminine plus she stands-up for herself. With dignity not nasty
back-stab that many women characters tend to sometimes be pigeon holed
in. This film is refreshing, well acted, entertaining--a film I know I
will watch again and probably again. Bravo to all involved. Take it
from me more films like this one are needed in today's world. I hope l
more films like Joy will be made. There are many women who have worked
hard to make it in a man's world. What did Ginger Rogers say? Anyway, I
enjoyed seeing Melissa Rivers play Joan. Now, Joan Rivers' story would
be a great project in the right people's hands. I would love to see
that film! Wonderful job--excellent outcome!
