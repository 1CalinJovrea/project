More twists then your average thriller

Rom-coms are a special type of movies. In some aspects they are
equivalent to a junk food - something that's your guilty pleasure, that
you know is way beyond your usual type of movies, but you just want a
quick fix of dopamine and you go with it. And just like with the junk
food, the ingredients always tend to be the same - people come for
their favorite snack because they know what to expect. But just like
when Coca Cola tried to introduce its new taste to the general public,
these things usually backfire. So you either need to stick to the well
known or try to be completely original, but you can never go half way.
And this is what we see in this movie. They try to be unpredictable by
putting in so many twist that an average soap opera wold be proud of
it. Yet all this twists seem so predictable that you have to ask
yourself - "why bother?". In the end you get something that neither
smells nor stinks, and that's never a good thing.
