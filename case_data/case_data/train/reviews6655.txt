awful/pointless exercise in despair with no redeeming qualities

Not sure why this is getting such slavishly, raving, reviews (although
I suspect it's because of the 'luvvie' aspect thanks to the director).
It was painful, tiresome and somewhat hideous to sit through. It felt
like a very poor nod to David Lynch, and the theme of despair and lack
of redemption didn't add to it's lack of charm.I read a review on the Odeon site which summed it up for me, so my
review will loosely echo a guy on that site. The film starts how it
means to go on - it assaults your senses in a really unpleasant way.
There is nothing new or clever about this film; it's an exercise in
bleakness, despair and much hand-wringing and naval-gazing by the main
protagonist, Susan. Lest there is any doubt in the mind of the viewer
about the theme towards the end, an art piece that spells 'revenge' is
given a bit of air time and another angsty scene is written around it.It's nothing but an empty, dark little exercise in despair, thinking
itself more clever than it actually is. I nearly walked out in the
first ten minutes from the opening scene alone. I wish I had.
