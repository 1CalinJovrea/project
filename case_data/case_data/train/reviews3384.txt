Though flawed, it was better than I expected...

The new Terminator wasn't terrible! I'm surprised. Though it had its
flaws it was much better then Terminator 3 and Salvation... and I
actually enjoyed it mostly. I probably won't be watching it like 30
times like Judgement Day, but its not like I expected it to ever live
up to Cameron's work....First off, the action was good and so was the pace, the film never
became boring even with how complex the story was so it certainly gets
points for that.The film itself runs like the greatest hits of the the franchise which
is both good and bad. The pros: Revisiting 1984 (the first terminator timeline) was a lot of
fun for obvious reasons.. You get more things like crazy manoeuvres
from the T1000 etc and Arnie gets to kick some ass and even be funny at
times....The cons: How many times do they have to repeat lines from the previous
films? Sarah Conner says: "Come with me if you want to live" Really?
Again? Really? Come on, having that as an obligatory line in each movie
is actually annoying. "I'll be back" is just like an obligatory oh,
we'll just squeeze that in there, the audience will love that! Nope,
not really, see in the first Terminator that had impact! Like the
impact of a car coming through the wall! This is there just for the
sake of it...Aside from that, I think JK Simmons character was borderline pointless,
you could nearly have cut him out of the movie and barely noticed! A
crying shame for such an excellent actor.. Generally the script could
have done with more tweaking, some plot towards the end just seemed
outright silly, but I will say the chemistry between Arnie and Emilia
was actually pretty good! Overall: It's no Judgement day but you know what, it was actually a
decent film and it was great to see Arnie as the Terminator again, and
not saying "talk to the hand" . I can see why James Cameron endorsed
this as the true sequel to T2...
