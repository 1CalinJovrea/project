Dead on Arrival

A dismal attempt to make a zombie art film. Not zombie-horror, rather
zombie-drama, which, The Walking Dead aside, I'm not really sure could
ever work, even with a good script, which Maggie most certainly lacks.
This somber downer takes itself way too seriously. There is literally
not a single laugh, giggle, or even a smile throughout.To make sure we know that this is a serious art film it's shot in
bleak, muted colors and syrupy violins play mournfully on the
soundtrack. With its gloomy, bland earnestness, Maggie comes across
less like a zombie flick and more like a really bad disease-of-the-week
TV movie, a disastrous approach which completely sucks all the fun out
of the genre.
