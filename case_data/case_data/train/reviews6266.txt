Avoid this horrible ad campaign

This is nothing more than a two minute ad stretched out to a full
feature. Its so painfully obvious that it is nothing more than a ad
campaign and not a serious movie. Although there is some funny moments
in this its pretty clear that Owen is a bit short on cash and agrees to
anything these days which is so sad because i really like him as an
actor. But the way both him and Vince Vaughn is selling themselves
short is horrible.My advise is to stay far away from this horrible corporate ad campaign.
Shame on you Owen i thought that you had more integrity than this......This movie isn't really a movie its a painful advertisement Avoid it if
you canI gave this a 1 out of 10 just because its an ad not a movie
