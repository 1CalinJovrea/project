Empire Strikes Back!

I'm a huge fan of the first Kick Ass film and the comics, so I'm a
tough fan to please but this film exceeded my expectations! In a year
full of over-hyped superhero films Kick Ass 2 came along with a low
budget, no contracted actors roped in and R rating and gave me the most
entertaining hour and 40 minutes I've paid for all year!Excellent acting all round especially from Jim Carrey and Chloe Moretz,
this film doesn't copy and paste the first but stays close enough to it
cinematically that the new director takeover isn't largely noticeable. I don't understand why the film hasn't been rated better, 10 out of 10
from me. Super on all levels!
