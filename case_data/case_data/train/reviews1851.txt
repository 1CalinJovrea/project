Confuses, as well as Disappoints...

The film starts fairly well. It has an almost 007 polish on the intro
scenes and opening credits. Unfortunately, it goes downhill fast from
there. Even if you didn't know going in, it is a comedy. The problem is that
it quickly becomes humorless to anyone more than a few years past
puberty. I would almost say, intellectually, it was "True Lies" for
Disney XD. And therein lies my confusion: with the F-Bombs in triple digits, and
other profanity as prolific, you push the film to an R rating. Who was
their target audience? The Freshmen class at Retarded U?By cleaning up the script and cutting, or at least sanitizing, just a
few scenes; this could have easily been a PG-13 film drawing parents,
as well as their kids. Not only that, it likely would have been much
funnier.I hope the writers and producers, as well as the director, of this film
starve. Their poor choices certainly should not be rewarded. It's sad
that a film that has been ruined by crassness, solely for crassness
sake, should have a 7.2/10 rating (at the time of this writing).
