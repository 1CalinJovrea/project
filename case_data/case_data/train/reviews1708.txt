A spectacular Disney sci-fi thrill ride

I went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response,
and I must say I had a blast.The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original
science fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by
the Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing.It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable.
Frank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor.
Casey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and
Britt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well.The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may
have laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying
something.I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are
stunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The
action scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where
I was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi
genre.The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little
more of the "Tomorrowland" place and that the story needed a little
more work.Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of
science fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts "The Haunted Mansion"
(2003) to shame.In the end, "Tomorowland" may not fully realize it's potential, but it
should be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family
sci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride.
