Laughed so hard I shed tears

I have not laughed so hard during a movie in an extremely long time. If
you have not seen this movie yet, you are indeed missing out. I loved
everyone's performance in this movie. However, with out a doubt Tiffany
stole the show. She is insane, crazy, (stupid funny) yes that is a term
& down right ridiculous. Tell everyone you know to go & see this movie.
It will make you laugh, cry, scream out loud & leave you feeling apart
of a real friendship. I can watch this movie over & over again. Go &
see it!!!
