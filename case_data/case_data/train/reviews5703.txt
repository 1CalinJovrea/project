Quit before the end

I usually watch movies until the end, but this one OMG.I stop watching 30 minutes before the end, WOW if they wanted to milk
the cow with that one i guess they have failed.At least the movie Leatherface had some sick moments this one does not.
Bunch of 20 something teens try to figure out if the legend is real or
not, i felt like i was a teenager again and watching the original movie
in the film haha what.Sorry this one does not pass the mark no wonder its free on google
plus.
