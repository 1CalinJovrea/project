What happened?

The previous installments nicely balanced the over-the-top tricks with
the plot, and somehow it was plausible in an imaginary sort of way.But this one? It's as if the writers had the plot then later realized
they needed the tricks, and in they went, one by one, arbitrarily, with
no real imagination or thought. You can hear the director saying, "ok,
insert a trick here, then there, and there, then there." With a
90-minute run-time, there were actually five stories going on: the
brothers, the unicorn search, the minions' imprisonment, the engagement
segment (involving the oldest child, age 12!), and the Brat. Two are
eventually irrelevant and unresolved, while the other three meet in the
end, but in a forced "we have to write it this way or the movie has no
ending" sort of way.The premise was interesting - long-lost twin brother wants to
resuscitate the family tradition of villainy vs. Gru's new home-bound
stability. But the execution was just mediocre, if that. Light laughs,
an LOL or two, but that's it.The minions stole the show.
