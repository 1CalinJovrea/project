8
formulaic Hollywood film with incredible emotion

Let's start by saying what everyone else was thinking: "What else is
new?" We have all seen this movie before. It follows the very
uninspired formula that Hollywood has been using for years now; there
is nothing cutting edge about the premise of Southpaw. Where it defied expectation was in its raw emotion. Everything that
makes Southpaw good lies in the performance of the entire cast. Jake
Gyllenhaal, in particular, simply could not have been more exceptional.
His portrayal of loss, victory, sorrow, shame, anger, guilt, and love
were unbearably palpable, and made the movie an intensely uncensored
work. This is a performance you simply CANNOT pass up. I also
appreciated the ways in which the last boxing scene was shot. It takes
the grueling perspective of Billy Hope himself and his competitor. That
camera angle put the viewer in the closest possible position of the two
boxers while in a fight which made the scene all the more terrifying
and all the more wicked awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yeah yeah.. We all have seen at least
18 movies of a successful man losing everything that could ever
possibly matter to him; however, the difference is that never have I
experienced it more vividly than in Southpaw. Props to Gyllenhaal again
for making me feel things that most actors will continue to fail to do.
