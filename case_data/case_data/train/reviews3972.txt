I wish I could purge this movie from my system

I love a good action movie. The last two "Purge" films were okay,
nothing amazing, but I was willing to give this one a shot. Honestly,
it was nauseating - not from violence, but from politicization.
Regardless if a movie's political message resonates with me or not, if
it gets to overshadowing the whole thing, then I feel it ruins the
film. That was the case here.I was fully expecting cheesy one liners (trust me, plenty of those) and
gory action, and if that's all you want from this film, then I think
you'll like it. I wanted to be lighthearted and enjoy it, but it went
sour from preachiness REALLY fast. I'm just glad that I went to a free screening - if I had spent my money
on this, I would have been mad.
