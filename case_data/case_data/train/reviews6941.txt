Skip It

I guess it is en vogue to make films about weak men so this is no
exception. Here we have this guy who against all his better judgment
accepts an invitation to see his ex-wife, who has been in a nuthouse
for two years where she apparently met her new husband. Yeah, sounds
like a party!Anyway, the "old gang" (from college?) gather for this reunion and
there is the typical (obligatory) progressive, hip melange: interracial
and gay couples (who are the most PDA of course) and the whole thing is
just stupid.New "friends" are introduced too - all creepy and enough to make anyone
who was not already high, get the hell out of there. But no, not these
clowns.And on and on and on and on they go. GO HOME ALREADY!!!Was this supposed to be like some Manson, Tate-LaBianca thing?
