It's not a James Bond movie!

It's not a James Bond movie, but the drama is real!Let's be totally honest - the movie is exactly as it's supposed to be.
It's light, slightly offensive (to whoever it can) and sends this wink
to the audience. Not like Deadpool completely breaking the 4th wall. In
a way that keeps with the summer vibe.Definitely, a summer movie to watch with friends on a hot evening with
a glass of Pimms!Lupierz
