Horrendous

This is truly the worst movie I've paid to see since "The Ice Pirates"
back in the '80s. Will and Amy are two of my favorite comedians, so I
can't imagine how they agreed to do a script that had so few laughs in
it. A comedy can get away with being implausible if it's also
hilarious, but implausible and unfunny is a deadly combination--and the
perfect description of "The House."
