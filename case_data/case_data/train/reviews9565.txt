Coppola beguiles once again

To Beguile: "to lead by deception"; "to engage the interest of by or as
if by guile"; "to deprive (someone) of something by guile or deceit". While conjecturing a position and a review for this film I realised
that he Beguiled is more than a moniker for its characters: it is one
for the film itself. You will find yourself simultaneously marveled by
the ravishing cinematography and production design, seduced by its
contained and bewildering performances and puzzled by its apparent dull
and stale pacing. True to form, Coppola once again deceits the viewers
into believing they've watched something rather stale and uneventful,
when in fact the unsaid and the hinted upon is more powerful,
substantial and engaging than you were aware.A circumspect approach to a contained setting and a suggestion to a
wider reality, for both the historic background and for the characters
themselves, the Beguiled urges the viewer not to immediately praise or
dismiss it, but rather to delve on it(s) subject matter(s), digest them
and talk about them. That is why once again Coppola proves herself to
be a singular auteur.
