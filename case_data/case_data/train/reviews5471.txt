The best midnight madness movie EVER!

As good as the Shining was something I said to all around me as soon as
the picture ended. Brilliantly conceived and executed. Fast paced action + beautifully
shot + not too gory + a cast of characters you really cared about all
combined to make this the best experience of jumping and screaming and
laughing I've seen from a bunch of experienced horror show aficionados
I have ever seen. Good performances from all including the kids. Very unpredictable and
wholly inventive storyline. Even the cleverest plots and safeguards
will not defeat the pure evil of the Oculus.Very good effort from some brilliant and talented people.
