Don't punish the film because it's doing something different

I liked the film. It's got a surreal quality that makes it a bit hard
to swallow, but once you get into it, you realize that the vision of
the writer was much larger than the actual events in the film.It all starts with an 11 year old child who is incredibly smart. He is
actually "the man of the house" and earns the money and takes care of
his mom. The inversion of control is not haphazard, but intentional.
Through this child's eyes we see how messed up "common sense" really
is, but in the end things happen that show the viewer they are not
helpless, inferior people, but part of the solution (or of the
problem).Is it a perfect film? No. But the people giving it bad reviews and low
ratings have either not bothered to make the effort to understand it or
are incapable to. The acting was reasonable, the story interesting and
- I believe - the underlying theme both refreshing and important.
