It is a pity to waste such a great idea

Not a comedy, not a drama, unfortunately this film fails in the end to
entertain. Even though the main idea is brilliant, the script
unfortunately fails to deliver. There are at least four(4) parallel
subplots going on: i) the retired widowed executive wishing to stay
active, ii) a startup growing too fast for its founders to cope with,
facing the urge of installing an external CEO, iii) the romance the
"intern" finds and iv) the price the founder of the start-up needs to
pay in the personal front with the husband cheating on her. Apparently
the creators of the film wanted to see the plot in its holistic
dimension, forgetting they just had 120min of film (too much for a
comedy anyhow) to convey it to the audience.It is a pity, because the same set of actors could have delivered the
perfect family experience; entertaining even moving; they just needed a
different script.
