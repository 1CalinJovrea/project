A Beautiful Sad Love Story

This movie is one of those that just blew me away, the story is so
powerful, and the way it shows Hawkings life is just beautiful. First
of all i think Eddie Redmayne gave an incredible performance and i
couldn't think of anyone who could have done it better, this man is
going to be a acting legend in some time. The whole movie is very
beautiful and inspirational but not in the cheesy bad way, but in the
best way imaginable. All the characters seem so real (probably since almost all of them are
real) and you will very fast be emotionally connected with them. You
feel with all the characters and you understand them to, even though
you may not agree with what they are doing. Some people say that some story's are impossible to make uninteresting
but i think this movie very easily could have gone in the wrong
direction, but luckily it didn't. Even though the story is very
inspirational and very beautiful it is still a very sad movie, all
things considered. But the whole way we start by feeling sorry for him,
and then feeling admiration and almost jealousy of his incredible life.I really cant understand all the hate this movie has gotten, in my
opinion it is a superb movie in every way. I cannot think of a better
way to show this amazing story about this amazing man. To everyone who
haven't seen it, I hope you will and i hope you will like it as much as
me. 10/10
