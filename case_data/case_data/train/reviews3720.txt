A common criticism of BEAUTIFUL CREATURES is that it doesn't do justice
to the original novel, which is often the case when the book is really
good. I had not read the book prior to watching this but am now eager
to do so.Regardless, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES is vividly filmed with good
performances by Alice Englert, Alden Ehrenreich, Emmy Rossum, Rachel
Brosnahan, and just about everyone else. Another frequent complaint
seems to be that there is not enough in the magic/special effects
department: True, but the relative sparseness here adds a necessary
realism and highlights what spectactics the film does have. The
townspeople of Gatlin, South Carolina, are stereotypical Bible-thumping
yokel-rubes, but that serves its purpose in the way it contrasts Lena
(Englert), who is just about the only character who does not speak in a
deep-southern accent. It also helps in how Ethan (Ehrenreich) and his
buddy Link (Thomas Mann) completely defy their hickish appearances.
BEAUTIFUL CREATURES captures the whole Southern Gothic tradition quite
well. One way or another, the relationships in this film are very real.
BEAUTIFUL CREATURES also walks the thin horror-comedy line most
admirably.On the dimmer end of things, the whole texture of the film is a little
slow and murky, and it would probably have been a little better with a
few minutes cut here and there.
