Absolutely a blast!

I loved it, great enjoyable movie with a great cast (especially the
older cast, loads of humor, pun and action and a script that worked out
fine. A fantastic performance by Antonio Banderas, really well done and
of course the return of Wesley Snipes, great to see him back in action
in a job he definitely pulled off. Mel Gibson as the bad guy worked
well for me but his role could've been more crafted as far as I'm
concerned. The humor was on target considering the many laughs from the
audience, I certainly enjoyed it. The action was also very well
executed and held a good pace. The positive (changes) compared to the
former two movies was the absence of the blood and guts (adds nothing
for me), this cast (additions), much better paced action and logic and
everything seemed to work. I saw this with my sons of 12 and 14 and they also loved it!!
