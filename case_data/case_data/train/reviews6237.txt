This movie makes no sense

Please understand I write this review with no personal biased
whatsoever. I like sci-fi movies just as much as all other movies. This
movie was unbelievably bad. The acting was awful, the script one of the
worst I've ever heard and so unoriginal I predicted every single scene.
They try to rip off the matrix and make 0 political points at all. It's
supposed to be about the classes but they give no story of the classes.
No one on the train at all works, some people only drink and party,
some only get their hair done and no one sleeps. One girl randomly has
visions and that is never explained again. It is like the actors and
directors ate a bunch of acid and just turned a camera on. It makes NO
SENSE it is the worst movie I've seen in my life. People who rate this
high are obviously fans of some comic it is based on and probably paid
promoters. I cannot believe this movie was allowed to be released even
on DVD/demand. With a 40 million dollar budget they couldn't even get
in the theatres. Please do not watch this.
