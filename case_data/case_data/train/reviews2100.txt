Abysmal OR one gal's confused ladybrain is another man's pitiful excuse for a rom-com

First, she's a lonely gal with a great job. Then SUDDENLY, she's
irresistible to two incredible hotties? Nonsensical.If that weren't enough to turn you away: the dialog is forced and
nonspecific, the chemistry is nonexistent, Witherspoon phones it in.
There's also a plot "twist" anyone could spy a mile away.And if part of you is thinking "well, hey at least it's sort of
progressive and enlightened to have one woman dating two men instead of
the typical reverse," stop. I'd venture 75% of the film is Witherspoon
blabbering about how her ladybrain can't handle being with two (soooo
wonderful and handsome and blahblahblah) men. Ladybrains, can't live
with 'em, can't make basic decisions in life with them. I mean,
right?!**not right
