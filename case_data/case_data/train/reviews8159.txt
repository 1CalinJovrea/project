Criminally underrated cannibalism and murder.

Ever since I've watched "A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)" this
movie has been on my radar. Ana Lily Amirpour is clearly one of the
most interesting new directors out there and her next projects should
be anticipated. I'm glad to see big name actors like Keanu Reeves and
Jim Carrey in her movie, they play their parts brilliantly and will
pull a bigger audience. Suki Waterhouse and Jason Mamoa are the main
characters and keep you interested the whole way through, but the star
of the show is director Ana Lily Amirpour. Her visuals and world
creating are definitely the biggest pull of the movie.This movie will probably be watched by the wrong audiences, because of
famous actors in it. It's a visual art movie which can be enjoyed by
anyone, but is definitely not mainstream. A lot of reviews I see about
the movie being to slow are clearly that mainstream voice. It's kind of
funny that the people who love "slow" artsy movies have to get through
the gory cannibalism and murder scenes. You can see how that can split
audiences.The style reminds me of Quentin Tarantino in the sense that the
art-house and exploitation genre are combined a little. The big
difference between Ana Lily Amirpour and Tarantino is that Tarantino
can catch that mainstream audience as well. If I knew more about why
movies are successful I could tell you why, but I can't help but feel
that it has something to do with the fact that this movie has a female
director. At least fans of good movies will make this a cult movie, but
I really think it deserves more.I cant wait for the next movie Ana Lily Amirpour makes.(9/10) Would recommend.
