Tim Burton Boring?

If you had not told me that this was a Tim Burton film, then i might
not have known it because the element of surprise is non-existent and
the usual bizarre Burtonisms are lacking. This is a remake of an old
short film Burton did in the 80's, which also fans the flames of doubt
that Tim Burton has run out of ideas. i guess their is one surprise in
this film; Johnny Depp is not in it. he basic idea of the story is
taken from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and it never veers from it,
which could have make it an enjoying film. Tim Burton should have
explored the paranormal or even some of his usual humour could have add
to this bland story. Hopefully, he will return with some great great,
but even someone as bizarre as Burton grows older and mellows out.
Perhaps he will do a rom-com next. Watch the old Frankenstein film and
skip this film.
