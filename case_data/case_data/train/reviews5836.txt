Loved this action movie

Agent 47 is one bad dude! Even though I had not seen most of the actors
before, I thoroughly enjoyed the fast moving action, special effects
and graphics. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. The story
line was suspenseful and the acting was better than most in this genre.
The stunts in this film were among the best I've ever seen. The filming
and clarity of the audio was also excellent. I sure hope there will be
some sequels, I want more. And I really think that Zachary Quinto may
have found a new calling, I totally hope to see more action films in
his future. In fact, maybe a James Bond role? All in all, IMHO, this is
a must see if you are a die hard action film buff.I can only imagine that some of the bad reviews are due to the movie
not resembling a video game or the series, which I have seen neither.
My opinion is based solely on the merits of the movie itself.
