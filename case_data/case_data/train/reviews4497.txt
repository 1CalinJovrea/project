This Rotten Town It Soils Everybody GUNS,GIRLS,BETTER THEN FRIST ONE,SEXY, BLOODY, GREAT STORY

*** This review may contain spoilers *** i was waiting for sequel when i first watched Sin City (2005) for
awhile great to see Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller BACK TO Direct to
this sequel that i head for 9 years i have no clue what toke them to
direct this sequel for a longtime i really enjoyed this flick one of my
top movies in 2014 why was it better then first sequel, remember it was
my opinion.New Actorsand New Characters Were Very good lucky actors i liked of the
replacement why wasn't same person playing that role of first person
Another character Eva Load is pretty good (Eva Green)Casino Royale
James Bond, 300 Rise of Empire was awesome as Perfect Great Villain
again like in (300 Rise of Empire) showing of herself Naked More in
movie then 300:Rise of Empire Angelina Jole could be better for that
role i won't mind seeing her in that role in movie playing Eva Load she
would kick a lot more ass in this movie then Mr Ms Smith including she
was with her Pregnancy but another choice was Salma Hayek,Rose
McGowan,Rachel Weisz but who knows why didn't they toke role for Eva
Load. Rachel Weisz was going to be bad for Eva Load in my opinion she
would been maybe bad for role but lucky she wasn't in it but still i
happy to see (Eva Green) in movie it's not just i wanted to her naked
just i wanted perfect women actress in movie for perfect role for this
movie(Devon Aoki)Played in Sin City (2005) but Jamie Chung replace her
because of Devon would not return to reprise her role as Miho due to
her second pregnancy. Miho like (Jamie Chung)as Miho Sucker Punch
(2011), she played role with (Joesph Gorden Lawett)in Premium Rush
(2012)and Played movie with Bruce Willis Looper (2012)Joesph played
role with Mickey Rourke in Killshot(2008)Good Fit Very Well with her
character she was still good i would say she was still better girl to
Play Miho then anyone else she did a lot amazing things in movie.
actors replaced another for Bit I find them still good and better new
actor replaced (Michael Clarke Duncan)(1957-2012)may rest in peace i
think why it toke a bit while for sequel because of actor past away
hard to find another actor to play Michael character (Dennis Haysbert)
actor of (24 TV Series)Dennis as Manute wasn't great as Michael Clarke
but i could say Michael Clarke was much better actor then Dennis
Haybert but i was still happy with Dennis Haybert playing Manute Better
then Noting new and old characters were in different stories Nancy
(Jessica Alba)old actors, old character bring them back to kick more
ass in movie ! more of Nancy everyone top character i loved Jessica
Alba as Nancy was only in story but she was part of movie characters
like,(Mickey Rourke)Marv was crazy, Psycho Badass characterthat did a lot in this movie then first movie people wanted to have
more of Marv because it was the story before everything happen in first
Sin City (2005),(Rosario Dawson),(Josh Brolin)Replaced Clive Owen
Character Dwight telling what happened before he turned Clive
Owen.better sequel then first one i wanted to see more of Marv i know
these characters did die but it is like back story for a bit then it
Continued from the story what first film ended ,(Josh Brolin)as Dwight
McCarthy was my favorite he kicked a lot of ass in movie was awesome
good Dialogs including it was bit stupid when he gets betrayed buy Eva
too much but find the scene bit stupid Dwight should have hang up he
left Eva for 4 years good i expect him to run far but he comeback
wanted to see her but he always loved Gail(Bruce Willis) But He Still
Was role in movie like a Ghost, the story's were prequel like tellingthe story and about Characters before the first one was very
interesting. another story tells that the story continuing from first
set of movie of Set four years after "That Yellow Bastard", Nancy
Callahan struggles to cope with John Hartigan's selfless suicide.
showing Nancy she wants Vengeance to hunt down Senator Roark the Scenes
Sin City was very good but flopped because it was released almost 10
years after the first one. WTF still continued the story that happens
sometimes what the heck ? is wrong with people the movie followed story
well why does people wants everything to be QUICK ! the problem is that
sometimes sequels take a bit long time because story's, ideas, how to
do sequel can't just be quick like that ! it's like 300 (2007) later on
sequel 300 Rise of Empire (2014) like 8 years ! NOT A BIG DEAL had good
action scenes arrowing shooting was perfect shoot, Jessica Alba kicked
a lot of Ass with Mavin, Mavin character was so much better kicking a
lot of ass it's packed with blood, babes and a whole lot of black and
white.Gore,shooting,punching, car action scenes that won't disappointed
you unless you watch first one then this if you want Acton movie this
is it then in movie this is my top movie in (2014) i would own this
movie in 3D.
