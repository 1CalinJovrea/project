Today i seen this movie and i don't understand why this movie is
receiving so many negative reviews and poor ratings.In my opinion its a
more emotional driven movie than a sci-fi.It could be made more better
but still its worth a watch and i enjoy watching this movie.Acting of
Jaden Smith is okay.But i really wish Will Smith should have contribute
major part in this movie.Art direction is not upto that mark, the
interior design of space ship is really not that good as compare to
those that we usually saw and expect from sci-fi movie but some scenes
and cinematography of capturing earth's nature is spectacular.In my opinion its 6.5 out of 10.
