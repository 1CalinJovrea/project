Excellent

Don't believe the reviewers, this action packed adventure thrilled and
entertained the entire audience. Even got spotty applause which is a
rarity except for the most exceptional films.Great camera work gave exciting glimpses of the Panama Canal, the Canal
Zone and the port of New Orleans.Contraband is a perfect portrayal of the gritty life of crime, and the
amoral people who live it. Several exciting twists and turns make the
ending a surprise not even my genius plot detective wife could figure
out beforehand.Mark Wahlberg continues to give us one realistic performance after
another. Leave the kids at home and go see this action packed thriller.
