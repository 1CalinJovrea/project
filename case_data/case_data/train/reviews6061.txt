This movie does an outstanding job at doing what others have done time
and time again, yet does it in a way that captivates you. It will
either have you on the edge of your seat, or off to take a bathroom
brake without pausing.The opening scene of this movie is full of good intent but left me
feeling confused. And not in the good way, but more in the way that
makes you think that this movie is going to be just as bad as you
expected.The rest of the first half of this movie is extremely basic setup. It
does absolutely nothing to innovate, captivate, or even make you care
about who, what, when, why, where or how. Meet the characters, make
them seem young and hip, and as always, convey that they are way out of
their league.All of this made me want to turn off my TV and call it a day. But i
decided to stay and it was well worth my patience.As soon as the characters enter the tombs, the movie picks right up.
Making me feel like i'm stuck down there with them and all of their
fears being exploited left me as a paranoid wreck through the rest of
the film.The movie isn't that scary, but more intense than anything.The ending was well thought out and not clich√©. It also left me wanting
more movies that are written with this much thought.
