Pathetic!

I could not believe how bad it would be. It really was an imaginary
tale about a fictitious Moses and Ramses. It departed so far from the
Exodus Biblical text that it did not deserve the title. Anachronistic
in ideas and attitudes - eg, having Pharaoh discussing his decisions
almost democratically!! Moses had more than one wife in reality, but
Sarah didn't get a look in in the movie. The Pharaoh character was
weak, and the distortion of Moses' relationship with God was idiotic -
making God out to be an unwise brat. The miracles were watered down to
try and make them look like natural events, but much was missing. No
pillar of fire or smoke, no staff, no passover meal, no gold given to
the Jews as they were leaving, etc etc. This was much worse than the
recent Noah movie.
