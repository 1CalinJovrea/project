Piece of Crap

A few cheap laughs in this movie but ultimately it's a piece of
garbage. This is what you get from Hollywood, these days, when the
subject matter is "politics". The "film" is set in North Carolina so
you get the typical NYC/LA stereotype that everyone from that state is
a bible thumping, gun toting booger eating inbred moron. And Will
Farrell's obscene character? More of the same. I know this was intended
to be an over-the-top farce but it contains no wit, no real humor, and
nothing clever; just non-stop gutter jokes. Of course, the moral of the
story is that evil corporations, the republicans, and money are the
root of all evil. This movie accurately represents the intellect,
morality, and character of Hollywood today. It's basically waste that
should be flushed.
