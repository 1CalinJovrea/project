ponderous, pretentious and sleep-inducing

"Cloud Atlas" was the longest three hours I've spent in a movie theater
in a long, long time. Twice I had to hold myself back from walking out.
The theme, if you can finally figure it out, is that love and
relationships endure throughout time and the heroes or the spirits of
the heroes keep showing up in different times in history. But rather
show things in some sort of sequence, the movie cuts back and forth
from time and place without any warning. You have to keep track of
about a half dozen different stories, multiple characters played by the
same actors and finally you just throw up your hands and give up. Even
if you could figure out the storyline, there's nothing original about
it. Oh, and bring a translation book since about 25% of the dialog is
in some sort of pidgin-English invented for the movie.I don't mind movies occasionally trying to shake up the traditional
narrative; "Memento" was an outstandingly original twist on the
conventional storytelling. But "Cloud Atlas" is not only confusing,
it's ponderous, grindingly slow, gratuitously violent, self-important
and dull. It cost $100 million to make and it'll no doubt enter the
ranks of one of the most expensive flops in movie history. It's not
even forgettable---the story is so unintelligible that you really don't
have anything to forget when you leave the theater.
