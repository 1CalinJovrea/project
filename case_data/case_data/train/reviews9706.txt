Quite good superhero fare, but never great

THE WOLVERINE is a second spin off from the X-MEN franchise centred
around Hugh Jackman's titular character. The first, X-MEN ORIGINS:
WOLVERINE was a distinctly average viewing experience, although this
one's a little better. It's not the stuff of greatness, but it has
novelty value which makes it more entertaining than others I've seen.The story in a nutshell is Wolverine in Japan. The good news is that
this allows a cast of Japanese supporting actors to shine, although
most of them have very thin characters that seem based on clich√© rather
than experience. There's the damsel-in-distress, the evil black sheep
family member, the old man obsessed with immortality. However, I was
delighted to see Hiroyuki Sanada in a Hollywood film again (even though
he's once more given a one-dimensional role, just like in RUSH HOUR 3)
and surprised to notice Hal Yamanouchi (star of ENDGAME and a dozen
other trashy Italian sci-fi flicks of the 1980s) in a pivotal role.The film's execution is fine, although the story is never quite as
thrilling or expertly-made as I'd been led to believe. It's Jackman and
his love interest against various competing bad guys. Jackman is bulked
up but his acting is on autopilot. There's a ton of bloodless action
scenes, and they do feel a little grittier than in the usual superhero
outing, although the train set-piece has the same about of cheesy CGI
as in the Thai flick VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN. THE WOLVERINE does the
job, and if you're a huge X-Men fan you might like it more. Me, I
lightly enjoyed it, but it's not something I'd be in a hurry to watch
again.
