Great Movie, wrong audience

I took my nephew and niece to see this movie this past week, and one
thing was clearly noticeable. The movie is a bit to overwhelming for
small kids. However, if you don't go to this movie to see a funny and uplifting
'Hook' remake, but instead go to see a more deep and thrilling
retelling of a childhood tale, you will be most pleasantly surprised.
The movie, from this point of view, is fantastic. I feel bad that it has received such harsh reviews from parents that
apparently took their small kids to a movie without first at least
watching the trailer. Its a bit darker then its predecessors, but is
clearly shown that way through the trailer.Let me put it this way, if the trailer looks like a movie you want to
see, you will not be disappointed here.
