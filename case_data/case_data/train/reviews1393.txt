Creepy as Hell

And a simply wonderful throwback to the 1970s when horror was, well,
horror -- and not based on gimmicks like "found footage" but rather
genuine scene-setting, story building, audience engagement, and
full-tilt creepiness.Probably destined to become a classic.Brian Cox is this generation's Donald Pleasence, that is to say, a
character actor who could not give a bad performance if he tried yet is
destined to never actually stand out in any single production because
that is his style.Director André Øvredal is one of those rare finds -- an auteur with (so
far) a small body of work who is producing better and better films.
This suggests that over time he will probably give us bigger and better
treats to come.And while Ophelia Lovibond does not get a lot of screen time, the
exposure she does have will only add to her fan base. An American
accent so natural you would think she was trained by Hugh Laurie and a
performance so sweet you might not even recognize her (unless you
looked twice) as the very same actress that underpinned an entire
season of Elementary.Recommended? This is a must-see!
