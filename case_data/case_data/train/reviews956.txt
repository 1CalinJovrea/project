Don't let the star cast fool you into wasting 104 minutes.

Honestly, I wish I could give this movie a zero or less. I have never
written a movie review before but the level of disgust and pure
ridiculousness of this B movie inspired me. I like both Josh Brolin and
Samuel Jackson but I'm guessing only financial gain could have got them
to star in this movie after reading a screenplay! The trailer is very
intriguing and made me want to see what happens to this poor guy and
his beautiful daughter. The actual movie was idiotic. First off, how
does an alcoholic loser hustling lecherous salesman that is locked up
in a room by himself with very limited TV for 20 years come out on day
one a fierce karate expert! Did the only meal he ever receive over and
over again of Chinese take out automatically turn him into Bruce Lee?
How nonsensical is that? The movie continues into a sick incestual
pointless mess. I have never felt so moronic for wasting so much of my
time on pure deficiency!
