Fantastic Light Displays, Beautiful People and other Charms

Desert exile, a cult leader with an armed and pregnant harem and
roaming gangs of hungry cannibals, are only some of the worries for
solitary Arlen. She is very resourceful and open minded though. She
manages to make her way on a gnawed leg, to a frontier settlement of
free dealing outlaws. Arlen attempts to lay low in this town with an
apparently abandoned little girl and her pet rabbit. With the cult
leader showing interest in the pair and a burly cannibal searching for
his little girl, Arlen is faced with some difficult choices. There are
truths she needs to find for herself.There are glimmers of Amirpour's amazing previous film, A Girl Walks
Home Alone at Night, including funky music, fantastic light displays,
beautiful people, charming spontaneity, skateboards, gorgeous hot pants
and grisly encounters. Keanu Reeves makes a delightful appearance as
the harem loving cult leader and Jim Carrey as an impulsive and
sunburnt hermit. I wish there was more depth to the dialogue. Long
pauses work better with excellent actors, and the stars of the film do
not have this range yet. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film
Festival.
