Forgettable

Well what a waste of my time. I don't know if the movie is bad or not,
but i have seen this type of movies a 100 times. Very clich√©, very
embarrassing to look at times. Ryan Reynolds performing as a unsuited
Deadpool, cause that's what his character is, Deadpool without a suit.
We get it, he is suppose to be funny and sarcastic, but come on, not in
every single line of the movie. There is a scene "spoilers" Where he is
being torture, that it has the same feeling as when Wayde Wilson was
being held in the mutant x underground laboratory.On the other side, Samuel L Jackson, must have signed a contract to say
motherfuker. every time he can or the producing company made that,
because, well he says it at least 20 times. Really hard to finish
movie. Is a movie that you wont even remember that existed a couple of
moths from now. Watched in the cinemas. PLEASE Don't, wait for DVD
release or stream it.
