Dubious, vapid, trite, shallow, with nothing really to say at all

Trailing miles behind Pixar/Disney in the story department Illumination
doesn't seem to be able to deliver anything worthwhile to audiences in
terms of insight, laughs and meaning. They're still stuck in another
decade as far as quality animation with depth is concerned, and this
movie is not only no exception it pushes the bar even lower for them.There's nothing wrong with the look and sound of their productions but
the content is shockingly vapid, and even worse sends out dubious
messages to it's young an impressionable audiences.In this movie we have a gorilla family involved in organised crime
portrayed as normal. They of course are voiced with non American
accents cos crime is foreign, right? Then there's the mean-natured
mouse who cheats the Russian bears at gambling and ends up with the
tarty mouse and no repercussions for his mean-natured behaviour through
out the whole movie.The Koala steals electricity and water and cons his way to keep his
theatre alive, but this is just charming behaviour of course.The film is full of clich√© character portrayals and vacuous 'role
models' wrapped in the myth of singing stardom c/o the American idol
myth.There is nothing of real value for children here, let alone any real
depth for the average adult. The only thing going on here is a dark
cynical racist pastiche of the ugliness of the entertainment industry
played like it was a positive thing. Gee, thanks for your contribution
to society.
