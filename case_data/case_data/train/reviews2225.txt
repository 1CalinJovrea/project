9
Splendid

The reason for why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because I
find the movie so amazing that I felt the ending didn't satisfy me
enough. I had to see more. I want to know how the life of Adaline would
have turned out even later in the future. I have read many reviews where people complain that Blake's character
was too emotionless. Let me reassure you that that isn't the case. You
have to keep in mind that Adaline is 107 years old and at that age,
even though you have the body of a 25 year old, you learn to contain
your excitement. Adaline was born in the 1900's where discipline was
strong and parents were severe, therefor off-springs grew up to be very
well behaved compared to the young people of our current generation.
Which is why I come back to my point which is that Adaline is not
emotionless, she is well mannered and sophisticated. A lady simply
behaves that way.Anyways, I fully enjoyed this movie with tears in my eyes and I
recommend it to everybody.
