A very very poor film

Im sorry but if you consider this film to have been 'good' or
'enjoyable' then you probably should consider not writing reviews on
film. The film was truly awful, it was incredibly dull and had an
incredibly cheap feel to it. At times I heard myself groaning at just
how bad certain scenes were and almost laughed when the two males that
Tom Hardy dispatched with a knuckle duster, one whose throat was
crushed, the other knocked out cold miraculously were able to get up,
grinning and unharmed and then proceed to cut Hardys characters
throat?? As for Gary Oldmans role in the film Im at a loss? Friend of
the director possibly? Guy Pearces character was so outlandish and out
of place in the film that it was embarrassing to watch. The final
shoot-out scene was really the last straw for me, Hardys character
having just been shot in the shoulder reloads his pistol and walks
menacingly towards Pearce, teeth gritted, pistol aimed straight at
Pearce and yet miraculously Pearce manages to draw his own gun and
shoot Hardy god knows how many times without Hardy getting a shot off?
None of it seems believable to the viewer, its as if the director
thought he would get a great cast and then see if he could make a film
around them? Anyway the jokes on me as I paid to watch this
rubbish..gutted.
