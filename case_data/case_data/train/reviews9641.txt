Gore-hounds will be satisfied, people expecting a good horror movie won't be.

The Green Inferno is a standard Eli Roth fare - gore galore,
cannibalism, and occasional humor - set in the Amazon rainforest. The
acting is terrible right off the bat, but thankfully it isn't an issue
halfway through the movie when the body count starts up. The characters
themselves are paper thin, only about 3 of which are given actual
personalities while the others are just fodder for the natives. The premise of the movie is disturbing and will sound appealing to most
horror fans, including myself, but the execution leaves a lot to be
desired. Yes, the gore is done very well; as usual Roth uses great
practical effects to create some wince-inducing scenes. The problem is
that the first half of the movie feels like a student film. Really bad
acting, horrific dialogue, and the documentary style filming doesn't
help at all. It's not so much an issue once the characters are
captured, but you aren't able to get immersed into the world from the
get-go so you're never truly frightened or concerned for them when the
bloodshed begins.The biggest issue is that The Green Inferno isn't scary in the
slightest. Apart from a cheap jump scare near the end, there's little
to no suspense or tension in the movie. It's just a linear storyline
with characters getting killed off one by one with very little left to
the imagination. It also isn't funny. There's maybe two times I
chuckled at the tongue-in-cheek jokes. Most of them come across as
forced, partly due to the acting and partly due to the jokes not being
very funny. Roth tries for a darker, more disturbing atmosphere and he
succeeds, but he sacrificed the potential fun to be had with the film.
It's not terrible - Eli Roth fans will get exactly what they're
expecting - but it also isn't anything new. The Green Inferno is a
decent effort but a wholly mediocre movie watching experience.
