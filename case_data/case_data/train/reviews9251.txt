Nearly unwatchable.

My wife and I sat dumbfounded by how awful this movie was for its
entire duration entirely sustained by the hope that the praise it
received would be shown meritous at some point.Two hours later, at the end of the movie, we just raised our hands in a
silent "really?".It's long. It's slow. It's transparent from start to finish. The plot
is uninteresting and there is no suspense, there are no good
characters, the plot is nearly nonexistent, and the movie inspires no
interest in the audience.It wants to tug at your heartstrings so badly that it strains from the
effort and falls flat on its face. It then proceeds to ramble on for
two hours about nothing particularly specific or even novel while doing
it's best to ensure you don't accidentally forget that you should
totally be sad and immersed.I give this poop out of five stars. I want my rating to be a poop emoji
and I don't even like emojis.
