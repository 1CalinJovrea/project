American Pie at its best

Going to keep this short, because it's my first review, and I don't
wamt to bore people.Saw an early screening today in Amsterdam, and I was really excited
because the trailer promised a lot. And you know what? It was amazing!Simply because they made it as good as the original and the second
movie. (I liked the first two but I personally think that the third one
drifted away from the original theme a bit) I also liked how they made Stifler return to his original state. Crazy
as always, doing things the way he wants to do. The other thing that I
found good was that they briefly showed what everyone does after high
school and at what position they are at the moment.All in all, great film (what else could you expect from these guys),
I'd say go see it, definitely worth your time!
