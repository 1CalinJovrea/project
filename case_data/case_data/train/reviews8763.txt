Bar Far The Worst Movie of 2012

I am always leery of actors who want to take more control of their
careers by either writing, directing or producing movies. It is
painfully obvious Jason Segel is more suited to be given lines and
directed than to try to write his own scripts. This fell into the same
category as American Pie and had the same mean spiritedness as The
Breakup." It was just a train wreck from jump street. What I also found offensive was the buffoonery of the supporting cast.
He is supposed to be some up and coming chef working in a high end
restaurant in San Francisco where is co-worker, mind you simulates
masturbation with a carrot replete with a facial money shot in an
exhibition kitchen. How do you spell FAIL? His chef is depicted as some
crazy lesbian who is nothing but unhinged and the whole thing was
frustrating to watch since I've been in the industry for over 25 years. They depict these two as great communicators deeply in love but for the
life of them cannot work out their futures together and as stereotypes
in Hollywood go, Segel then proceeds to fall completely apart now
becoming a rabid hunter coupled with really bad ironic facial hair. We
almost turned this horrid thing off it weren't for the voyeur in us try
to see the movie could get any worse. It did. The two scenes Segel
actually uses the knife is to basically butcher the living hell out of
onions. Ugh. Laughs were to a minimum and crass and unrealistic gags were never
ending. I didn't buy the genuine connection between the two that the
writers were trying to create and frankly,I want my $5.99 back from
Comcast. What a complete waste of money.
