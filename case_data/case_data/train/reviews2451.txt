An extraordinary movie that pulls the rug from under you

You might call Derek Cianfrance's tremendous new movie "A Place Beyond
the Pines" a blue-collar epic or a tragedy in three acts; it's
certainly a drama in three acts. It runs for two hours and twenty
minutes and it covers a period of about 17 years and there are really
only about four major characters. To talk at all about the films
storyline would be to spoil what is really an extraordinary narrative
where even the coincidences of the third act seem to me to have
resonance of great drama and it is magnificently played by its four
principal actors.Ryan Gosling, continuing to cement his reputation as the finest young
actor of his generation, is Luke, an outlaw anti-hero worthy to stand
beside any played by Dean or Newman. Bradley Cooper, so much more now
that the light comedian of The Hangover movies, is Avery, the
idealistic young rookie cop who finds the consequences of a single act
of violence leads him down paths he previously may only have dreamed of
and relative newcomers Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen are sons in
desperate need of a father's love and guidance.This is bold and innovative film-making from Cianfrance with a strong
emphasis on plot development. It plays out like a great page-turner of
a novel but is in fact an original screenplay. After "Blue Valentine"
this marks Cianfrance out as a major big league player.
