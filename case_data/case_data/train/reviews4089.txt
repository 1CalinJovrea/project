Entertaining with suspense, nice plot twists

To me it was an excellent movie, for a horror didn't need to get all
gory but it did provide some of that for people who like a lot of that,
sometimes better to show just enough and leave the rest to the
imagination, we get the idea/picture. There was good suspense, drama,
and plot twists. Versus other horror films this is good as any other
ever made if not better, its a high school coming of age horror film,
about what you would expect a film like this to be. Like the diversity
in the movie and with an Asian male in it not being emasculated.
