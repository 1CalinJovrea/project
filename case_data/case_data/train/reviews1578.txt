Good story, bad acting

This is a typical movie that glorifies one party and demonizes another.
There are three sides of the story: party A, party B, and the truth.
Cops had just as much reason to target young black men as young black
men had reason to target innocent people in the streets. The thing that
should not be glorified encouraged in young people who are inspired by
this film is the terrible attitudes and general lack of respect for
anyone. Aside from the dominating racial theme of this movie, the truth
of the events that took place is stretched to put it lightly. Fact
checking any number of the scenes that were portrayed will lead you to
see that the facts were warped in order to convey the story that they
wanted rather than the truth. Along with the fictitious plot-line, the
acting is cheesy and not believable. There is no stand out performance
and one can expect that, as this is many of these young actors' first
big time film. This movie is a renter at best; the only saving grace is
the music.
