Cool Circle!!!

Call me the inevitable exception to the rule but I liked Circle. The
story is a familiar one - something seems too good to be true, and
winds up being so. In this case, it is a business called the Circle
that takes intrusive technology to the next level. Miniature cameras
are used to let others watch each other twenty-four hours a day, it is
as if the whole world has become one big family. At first it seems like
an excellent idea Â– people can be rescued when they otherwise would
have died, criminals that had gone "off the grid" can be apprehended,
life can be made simpler, more secure. Of course, there is the
inevitable down side namely the obliteration of privacy. No matter
where you go, you matter what you do, someone-body-thing is always
watching you. There is in inevitable argument over how much
surveillance is too much, is the security worth the price of freedom. I
noticed this movie has received several negative reviews. I will admit
this is not a conspiracy high-tech Jason Bourne style movie, there are
no international assassins or cold blooded corporate executives trying
to rule the world. Rather, the movie asks several questions. Is, say,
the internet good or bad? Should we increase our security or put a
limit on things. It makes you think.
