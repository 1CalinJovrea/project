couldn't be more disappointed

Never felt the need to review a movie before but thought i had to
spread the word that this reboot is beyond terrible. I went in with an
open mind and hoped jj Abrams would restore my faith in the franchise
after the terrible prequels. Instead i got another rehashed,regurgitated story like we have seen
recently in so many other rebooted franchises such as ;terminator,the
hobbit, spider-man etc.This was made apparent when it became obvious that the plot was
directly lifted from episode 4 and nothing new or original was created.
What was delivered was some lame sand planet which was a direct copy of
tattonine and a death planet that was 50x bigger than the original
death star but was still easily destroyed by a small group of xwings.Just like myself it seems the empire have not learned from their
mistakes about the problem with building death stars and i have learned
nothing about spending money to watch reboots.Han solo dies which as my friend mentions to me is a metaphor for
lovers of the old trilogy watching this piece of crap movie.
