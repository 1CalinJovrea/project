Don't ruin the Trailer by watching the Movie!

The best part about this movie was pretty much the name and the
concept... the movie actually ruined the trailer... literally one of
the worst and stupidest movies I've ever seen. The motivations for the
characters were unbelievably confusing and irrational. Basically all of
society has turned into psychopaths with the exception of a few poor
people and kids. I wish I could say that it was remotely entertaining
because I really wanted it to be. The funny thing is it wouldn't have
made a difference who was in this movie, the entire film needed a
makeover. Truly bad from start to finish... I am totally perplexed that
anyone can give this a good rating or review without a paycheck
following!
