If you like films, hate this.

If you like shocking films, then you will love the rating of this film, 

as the only truly shocking thing here is how on earth it has achieved a 

score of over 7/10.



This is the sort of rating that makes you think that the human race is 

genuinely a lost cause. That devolution is no longer a theory, but a 

reality.



What would be useful is to see an 'average age of user review' 

alongside this score. If it is above 14, then I wish to play no further 

part in this world.
