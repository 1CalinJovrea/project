Gone Girl without the tension, emotion or drama

First off, I will admit that I've not read the bestselling book that
The Girl on the Train is based on so my thoughts are based purely on
the movie adaptation.I usually love a fast paced thriller with twists and turns to keep me
metaphorically on the edge of cinema seat. The trailers had led me to
believe this might be the case for The Girl on the Train. How wrong I
was.The screenplay and direction were often sloppy while the editing was so
messy it often felt like scenes were pieced together purely at random.
I really struggled to warm to or identify with any of the characters in
a film where all men are portrayed as controlling and deplorable and
any sense of female empowerment is lost amidst the absurdity of the
relentlessly twisting plot.I have to call out Emily Blunt's stunning lead performance - she steals
every scene she's in with a nuanced, conflicted and honest portrayal of
a complex and intriguing character. Quality support performances from
Luke Evans and Haley Bennet help but don't save the movie and most
other characters are so slight and one-dimensional that they fade into
the background.The Girl on the Train felt like Gone Girl without the tension, emotion
or drama.5/10
