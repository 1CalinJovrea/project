A great tragedy , but...

The film accurately depicts the events after the bombing of the Boston
marathon, and a fine job is done by some very good actors. However
being a British serviceman who was in Northern Ireland during the IRA
terrorist attacks it is well to remember that those people in Boston
were at the forefront of stuffing Noraid collection tins with dollars
for decades which financed the IRA to carry out hundreds of similar
attacks in Britain for over twenty years.
