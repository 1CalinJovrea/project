The Best Musical Movie ever.

After I watched Pitch Perfect 2 I felt like I wanted to make an a
Capella singing/dancing group so much, Because I love dancing & singing
too. And I also want to win some awards like their group too. This
Movie makes me feel so happy and I enjoyed watching it so much. It has
many funny, romantic, dancing, and singing parts. I love every single
part of it. I'm not sure if you guys are going to love this movie or
not but if you love dancing and singing, I bet you'll love this movie
so much and you won't regret it after watching this movie. I rate this movie as one of the best musical movie. I always dance
performance at my school since 2010 so it mean that i love dancing so
much. Me and my friends are all enjoy watching it so much. The best
things and the best memory while watching this movie is me and my
friends also dance and sing along while watching it. And after we
watching this movie we all still singing and dancing like while we are
watching this movie again and again.
