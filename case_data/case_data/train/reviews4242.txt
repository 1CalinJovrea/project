A sweet love story for those who wants to get lost in the moment.

I admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, I
just HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a
late show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about
the movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it.
The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was
set somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and
beautiful stone walkways. We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is a
strong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current
life and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a little
mean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Will
disabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the other
needs. Even if they never really knew it. As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall for
them. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their roles
perfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I think
everyone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. It
is hilarious at times and yet sweet. I assure you that you'll feel
every emotion out there with this movie. It's so beautiful. Go watch it and judge yourself. For me, this is an amazingly beautiful
love story.
