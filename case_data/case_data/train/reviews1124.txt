When I was a child I loved to draw cartoons and was inspired by the 

many brilliant works of Disney and other classic animation. It was a 

lifelong dream that I would one day become an animator myself. How 

stupid I was, not thinking just how much the would change as I became 

an adult. Western 2D animation is dead, which is awful enough, but now 

they've come out with this brainless, mindless mess of 

pus-yellow-colored human waste. My dreams are dead. Everything I worked 

so hard at was a waste. A FAILURE. NO ONE in North America has ANY 

talent anymore. Last year we did have some decent stuff like Zootopia 

and Finding Dory, but this year it was two leaps forwards, a hundred 

gigantic leaps back. Now will someone kindly stop the world so I can 

get off?
