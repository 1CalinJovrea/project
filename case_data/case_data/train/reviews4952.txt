Tedious bore with no story

Overall a boring film in which nothing really happens - I feel Scarlett
must've just done this for a few spare quid as she is barely
recognisable compared to the magic she puts into Captain America.
Picture it paints of Scotland makes me wish they do vote yes for
independence to get rid of such depressing places. As for the music?
Enough to send an insomniac to sleep. The story - what there is of it -
offers no explanations or outcomes of the victims or what she is doing
what she is doing and the dialogue almost non existent. There were only
15 people in the screening on a Saturday night when I watched this -
only five were left at the end I wish I hadn't been one of them
