Sometimes you need to stick to the formula that works

After seeing the already poor IMDb rating for this movie, I thought I'd
still give it a go as I was a bit of a fan of the original. Boy,
disappointment is an understatement.It started off well enough, but the writer / director must've lost the
plot somewhere.. 'Good Movie Scripts 101' tells me that if you have a
significant event at the start of the movie, surely you don't just kill
off this main character after you've developed the story around her
right? It's just a recipe for disaster... unless you're Game of
Thrones. Perhaps they were trying to give the audience some shock value
or an element of surprise, but this has backfired completely in my
opinion.Somehow, another character (who really didn't have much of a background
story) became the protagonist. The moral of the story became something
about you shouldn't lie on an autopsy report. Really??!! Wouldn't it
have been more relevant if the tragic loss at the beginning of the
movie somehow tied into the ending, like uniting the 2 sisters that
appeared to be key characters... until they weren't. The message of
forgiving yourself would resonate a lot more with the audience this way
I'm sure.Oh, and don't get me started about why they brought Kiefer Sutherland
into the movie and did absolutely nothing with his character.Perhaps the plot wasn't so important, after all, it feels more like
just another not-so-scary teen flick, but if it was meant to be
something more, it well and truly flatlined... sometimes you just need
to stick with the formula that works.
