Unlike the first movie, this one's pacing felt choppy. And why did it
contain so many plot holes? I know they switched directors, but did
they change the screenwriter as well? The movie appeared as if it were
written by someone who took up screen writing the week before filming
began. Seriously, some of the scenes lacked proper transition, flow,
and some scenes were so damn awkward that they were almost too painful
to watch. The dialogue felt constricted and seemed unrealistic at
times. And unlike the first movie's intimate scenes, the sex scenes in
Fifty Shades Darker just felt flat and played out more like an unedited
video from Pornhub rather than a major film production. Had I not seen
the first film, I would've blamed the terrible execution of this movie
on the actors. But, it's obvious they tried and unfortunately failed
because they had to do the best they could with the meek script
provided.
