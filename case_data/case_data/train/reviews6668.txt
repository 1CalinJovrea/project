I was so looking forward to watching this movie. I've always been a big
Robert Redford fan, and like Jane Fonda as well. I wanted to watch it
because I am newly widowed myself, and thought I would connect with the
characters. I was a bit disappointed in the story line, but found it
enjoyable just the same. The acting was superb, filming was gorgeous,
but I found the writing a little choppy. Occasionally, I found the time
line of events a tad confusing, and overall the story a bit
implausible. I doubt anyone would invite a stranger to sleep with them
first, rather than suggest a cup of coffee, or lunch to start. Still,
it is worth watching, if you are a senior yourself. Younger viewers
would probably find it a little toward the pathetic side. I didn't
connect with Addie and Louis the way I had hoped to, but Robert Redford
is welcome to keep me company any time. He is my last surviving
Hollywood idol. All the others have either died, or fallen off their
pedestals!
