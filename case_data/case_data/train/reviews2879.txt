Don't think, just enjoy

Henry who was dead once was resurrected and became cyborg by his wife
and her mates, but after his 'boot', their facility was attacked by
Russian psychic called Akan. Henry escaped with his wife but she was
kidnapped by Akan so Henry and his cooperator Jimmy try to take her
back.First, I want to say that the story of this film is not good, but I
literally enjoyed this because most of footage and actions of this film
made me high. Most of scenes were shot through the GoPro so audiences
enjoy Henry's view like FPS games. The actions of this film go fast and
those are strenuous and GoPro were used well so I enjoyed those unreal
actions like through my eyes. Thus, I think this film is innovative
compared with recent other movies. However, some people must feel sick
so I strongly recommend you watch trailer before watching this.Like I wrote the story is not good so much but because of footage, I
felt adrenaline and high. Therefore, you should watch this movie when
you really want to feel satisfied without thinking difficult thing.
