10
Best movie i've seen so far in 2015

Wow, all the one star reviews are so sad. Im really glad i didn't
listen to them and took my kids to see the movie. It is such an amazing
movie and i don't think there was a single person in the theater who
didn't walk out with smiles on their face. Honestly, i prefer this
version to the 1982 version and Quevenzhane is an amazing singer and
performer. She's also a good role model for little girls to look up to.
The people saying that she can't sing or dance are being so unfair and
that makes me sick to my stomach! I normally never leave movie reviews
but will be rating this a 10 star review to hopefully offset the
jackasses picking on a beautiful talented little girl.
