Unusual Review Notes for an Unusual Movie

That the movie succeeds is a credit to Hunnam, who comes of age both
literally and figuratively in this movie with a performance of great
humility, charm, and grit. A far cry from his breakout role as a
motorcycle gang leader, and an even further cry from his awkward
performance in Guy Ritchie's unique (and hopefully
never-to-be-repeated) view of young King Arthur as a slum thug.Props to audiences worldwide who are connecting with a 2 hour and 20
minute opus that is as far from the new Transformers attempt as the
earth is from the moon. Shows that quality film-making will always find
an audience.Would have been nice if the script were historically accurate but
perhaps that is asking too much. Ironically, because of the internet, the amount of solid new
archaeological evidence being released each 24 hours in today's world
would be the equivalent of ten years of time in Fawcett's era. In
particular, I am referring to the material of late which suggests lost
civilizations submerged in both the Atlantic and the Pacific over
12,000 years ago (see Graham Hancock's lectures for more, most free on
Youtube) would explain how Brazil, centered between the two, could
indeed have hosted a "lost city" which, thousands of years ago,
entertained guests from both realms.Finally -- for hard-core history buffs only -- the written diagrams
preserved even today in the Archives of Rio de Janeiro ("Folio #512")
which constitute the last known "communication" from the ACTUAL final,
ill-fated, Fawcett expedition were discredited because "experts" of the
day claimed they contained elements of different language roots, not
one root, and hence "must" be fake. However, if indeed the area was a
centerpoint between two now-lost civilizations originating in two
different oceans, the multiple language roots would be expected and
natural, and not an indication of fraud.
