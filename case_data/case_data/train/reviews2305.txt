Not so a-maze-ing

I really enjoyed watching the first Maze Runner but I didn't think this
was quite as good.The Scorch Trials got some great and intense, action packed scenes,
good acting and cool environments but that's it. If you liked the first
movie you may like this too or you may get a little disappointed. Don't
have so high hopes on this movie.I still enjoyed it a bit but I think
it got many bad parts.I'm not a fan of zombies so I hated the Idea with zombies in the desert
or (infected people with a virus, Cranks). Everything is about Thomas
in this movie. Everyone knows him and he does not know them. He does
not even want to know who they are. That's so weird. I got tired of
everyone calling his name. It felt like there was never a scene without
Thomas in it. I think the most irritating part is that Thomas and the others do
everything they can to escape from the "WICKED", they go out in the
scorch and some of them dies. Later on one friend of his is getting
caught by the WICKED again and Thomas decides that he will turn around.
They barely even made it out from the scorch and now they turn back
after 2hours of the film because one friend got caught? (also because
he realized he wants to fight the WICKED now and not run away anymore).
It felt like a meaningless adventure. I think they could just skip to
the 3rd movie right away.
