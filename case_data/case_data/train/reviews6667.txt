Wahlberg, Goodman, and Williams are solid and believable in their roles. Not a bad movie

The Gambler is a poignant tale of a man who is in the grips of one of
life's worst addictions. The Gambler is moving in several ways in that
you find yourself feeling for the man's family and friends because they
are dragged into his dark world as he struggles with a demon that has
cost him everything. At the same time you are not only hoping that he
will do the right thing and get out as he is given opportunities to do,
but you are also fearing for the mans personal safety because he
squanders opportunities to pay off an ever mounting debt to men that
will stop at nothing to collect. Wahlberg plays the part of the gambler
perfectly as do John Goodman and Michael Kenneth Williams as a couple
of lone sharks who allow him to get deeper and deeper into the abyss of
his addiction. The ending is comforting in knowing that he finally
breaks free and will now be able to pursue a normal life with a new
love that he has found. Unfortunately, counting on that one last big
bet to get yourself out is seldom how it works in real life. The end is
dramatic yes, but realistic no. The Gambler is a movie that is well
worth watching, but it may hit home for many families who have a loved
one who struggles with this terrible addiction.
