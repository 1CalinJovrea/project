A terrible movie

Another useless installment in the TCM story. Lame special fx, even
worse and confusing story. Does absolutely nothing to the viewer except
just sitting there waiting for this dog excrement of a movie to end.Just fire the guy who thought it would be a good idea to have less
human bones for back rounds and even less disturbing scenes altogether.Did they make Toby Hooper the producer in this movie after his death ?Sweet baby Jesus now I know for sure they will never match the original
even if they use a potato for a camera and cows blood filming in the
same house as the original. Shows that whatever you budget may be high
or low you will never make anything interesting to watch if you have no
talent or respect to the original work you are trying to remake, copy,
reboot...whatever.Maybe the creators never watched the original...who knows...Skip this one even if your head is under a running chainsaw.Thanx but no thanx.
