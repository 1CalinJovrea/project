A masterful depiction of human piggishness

Martin Scorsese scores a huge hit in this seminal celebration of human
piggishness, rot and squalor. Sure one will face daunting challenges to
self-indulgence, but if he tries hard enough and stays the course in
dissipation and exploitation, he can become a King like Jordan Belfort,
with a fawning, obsequious following. And what's wrong with that?
What's wrong with living the good life, by whatever means necessary, if
you have the talent and only care about yourself? Human baseness and predation are honored in the film through Belfort's
graphic gluttonous sex and extraordinary drug use, constantly extolled
as giving the edge one needs to dominate and manipulate. That, with
unapologetic predation, are critical parts of the road map to the good
life in the Scorsese model.And with that, Scorsese proves a master in describing a modern day
Inferno (like Dante's) with the new paradigm that being bad is not so
bad after all if you win in the end.
