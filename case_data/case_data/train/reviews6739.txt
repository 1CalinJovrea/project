Just...don't

I'm not the kind of guy who nitpicks but, this movie has a mess of
stuff that I can't seem to comprehend. First they say that Carrie has
been homeschooled until high school. Then they say she has always been
weird...since 6th grade. Then the mother says "This is why we've had to
move place to place so much." So she was homeschooled while going to
sixth grade while moving place to place. -.-Next, they call her boobs 'dirty pillows.' Really? Did they need that
amount of filler that they through that into the final cut of the
movie.Chloe Moretz, I love you, but you should not have been in this. She had
this weird walk through the whole ending, as if getting covered in
blood makes you walk all weird. They tried to make you feel for the
character but no one was buying it. They kept calling her Carrie White
through the whole thing and...I FELT NO PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS
CHARACTER!!!Lastly, there is a part at the end where it rains rocks down onto a
pregnant girl who doesn't react like it's happening at all, yet earlier
a guy is killed by a bucket. EXPLAIN THIS! Firstly, why is it raining
rocks? Where are the rocks coming from? Why aren't they hitting the
pregnant girl? Why doesn't she even care that she's in danger? This movie is stupid. Go watch Sissy Spacek and give no more money to
this. It just sucks.
