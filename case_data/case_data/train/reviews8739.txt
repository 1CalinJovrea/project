Waste of time and money

This movie started off quite well, for a movie I had quite mediocre
expectations it caught my interest when it introduces some interesting
characters with mixed motives, unfortunately that and a few good
cinematic shots is where the praise ends for this movie.This movie had potential which only makes it even more
disappointing,we're first introduced to Tarzan as a British politician
and is then forced to rediscover his wildness but lacks any real
character and only comes across one dimensional with the traits of an
angsty teen who's marriage we're supposed to care about but I'm not
sure whyThis movie tries to incorporate way to many elements, the overall plot
about the enslaving the Congo and getting rich from a mythical city
full of jewels that we're not even allowed to see at any point combined
with fueds with passed foes that don't really come to any settlement a
tribe leader that had his son killed by Tarzan that wants revenge,
gorilla brother that wants him dead, trying for a baby and flashbacks
of a potentially better film we could have had, they rush through these
very quickly without really developing or keeping your interest Some really awful scenes, Samuel Jackson who I'm not sure needed to be
in this movie jumps off cliffs only to land unscathed on a branch,
combined with a very predictably unsatisfying ending that couldn't of
come fast enough and causally wrapped up with all the bad guys
defeated, they may as well have froze in the air jumping to the
backdrop of a sunset, with the joy of sweet release as the credits
rolled to only leave me with a face like a bulldog eating a wasp and
annoyed and frustrated that I have wasted time and money sitting
through another failed sequel that is sure to fade into obscurity Overall this movie lacks any fun or adventure, poorly directed as this
movie lacks any identify, wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other
than my worst enemy, all round disappointment
