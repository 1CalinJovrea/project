Why on Earth should this movie deserve an Oscar?

Poor screenplay, poor dialogs, extremely bad actors and some strange
and disturbing way of directing for a two hour and a half movie. The
film is boring, the plot is childish and Maya it seems to be a little
bit psychotic. Kathryn Bigelow tried the Hurt Locker recipe once again
but this time her way to shoot just couldn't make anything
understandable and bearable. Sometimes steady, most of time shaky, the
camera is so confusing, especially in small spaces that you don't know
what the director want to say anymore....And the script is as shallow as a B series movie...Please don't loose your time. You'd better watch Tinke Taylor Soldier
Spy or even Looper, at least you'll get entertain. Or if you want
something European (because Bigelow it seem to me that she wants to
copy some of the European ways to shoot images) take a look at Beyond
the Hills. ;)
