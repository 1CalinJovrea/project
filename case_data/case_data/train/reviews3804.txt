As real in the rear as it gets

I took my mother to see this film so that she may understand through a
movie what I could not share with her verbally but what she has
witnessed physically with me. This is not a war movie but a film of
what war does to you and how it affects you after you are no longer in
physical war but your mind stays in mental war and no one understands (
EMPATHY) except those there with you. After 3 combat tours I identified
with things that went over a lot of peoples heads but the movie moved
me and Dream Works did a spot on job with what we with PTS go through
and why its so hard to deal with and maybe if everyone saw this film
they could see the inner turmoil a soldier, a marine, a airman, and a
seaman goes through after experiencing physical and mental trauma.
Thank You for your service hits on all aspects from the ptsd sufferer
to the spouses and all around them. this is a must see to spread
compassion to all who served.
