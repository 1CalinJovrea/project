Dear me if I hear "authentic" one more time someone will have to die

Because if this is anything it's a fantasy by writers about writers for
people who think they want to be writers. Everyone is brilliant I
insightful charming warm caring and infinitely forgiving of the people
who screw them over the hardest. They even tend to the sick and have
hot chocolate with the black maid. Except for the Lilly Collins
character. She's a narcissistic bully trying to be Diablo Cody age 20
going on 55 trying to be 17. Everyone totally gets and loves everyone.
Girls will sleep with you before the first date. Anyone under the age
of 25 instantly knows every social and pop reference including all
literature for the past half century. And I don't know what smartphones
they have but they sound better than my home theater. Ms. Bell steals
the show with her smart funny role but her character is sadly not
realistic with the nearly 20 year difference of her "buddy". Kinnear
plays to type: depressed. Ms Connelly also plays to type; angry needy
clingy yet bossy and passive aggressive. But the takeaway is that if
you want to be a published novelist with your first and only book all
you need is to be smart and sassy.
