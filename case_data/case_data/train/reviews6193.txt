Gotta rant, as a lifelong fan of the original.

Number 1 rule of Horror! No origin story. What's this? An origin story.
As many said before, and I've said since seeing the amazing 1973
version at a 80's re-release drive-in, it worked because of the
mystery, atmosphere, and NO GORE. So basically, Leatherface 17
basically does every single thing the original didn't do to make it the
film it was. Are the filmmakers aware of that? Do they care? Do they know origin
stories are bad financial decisions for horror properties? If I were
credited exec producer Tobe Hooper (RIP), I would have made sure to
pass away before seeing this too. It is a better option. No, really,
die before seeing this.As Scorsese says as he continues to sell out "cinema is dead". This is
a mean, inept, nasty, badly overacted at every breath. It has more
production value than the 1994 version. Haven't seen all the TC films,
but somehow this makes the Matthew Mcconaughey film look like a gem. In
an attempt to be relevant, they added forced shock as there is a sex
scene taking place on top of a dead body. Lame. And this is a no-no to
say subjectively in a review, but there is definitely something wrong
with you if you like these kind of movies. And I've seen Henry/Cannibal
Holocaust/Serbian Film - don't condone those, but there's a point to
them, at least. These statements will make people outraged, but the
real fright is, nobody will be outraged that film content like this is
normal these days. Worst part is, all the imagination this property can
offer is fully drained from this Bulgaria filmed outing.Lili Taylor tries to underact. To think, she and Stephen Dorff had
respectable careers at one time in the 90's, and before. It doesn't get
too much lower than ending up in a Z-grade version of a 40 year old
horror classic, that goes direct to streaming and forgotten in a few
days.
