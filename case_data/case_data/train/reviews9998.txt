Brilliant

The Book of Henry is a beautifully layered movie about the joys and
sorrows of being a human being. No one in this brilliant story
overplays their part; it's such a pleasure to be introduced to each of
them as it unfolds. Just as in life there are starts and stops here
which captivate the viewer from the beginning and they are drawn in
until the ending. For those who say the story might not be plausible
simply pick up the newspaper or watch the news these days; anyone
involving the human spirit is possible. It would be too brazen to
explain the plot in detail because like a great book, a great play or a
great novel you simply know it when you see it. Unfortunately, the mass
audiences will not appreciate this movie as it will be well above their
mindset. I absolutely loved it.
