Dark times Ahead. BLOCKBUSTER

I love Christopher Nolan, He has simply changed the way
superhuman,extraordinary thrillers are made. Now everyone is just
following him. Most of the Directors are trying to show the dark and
more realistic environment in the movies and MATT REEVES succeeded in
it.It is a extremely well-made and enacted movie. What works is the
intensity of the characters. Caesar is the character taken straight out
of the last installment, Rise of the Planet of the apes. He is the
brains and the brass together. The movie is entertaining and includes a
surprising ending.The film has got some amazing graphics. The Apes look real and in every
way you sympathize with them. I would rate it 9 out of 10 just for
graphics,acting and the intensity of the film.DO WATCH !!
