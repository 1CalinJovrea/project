It's a blood oath and bloodbath,oh it's bloody alright

Let me be honest,this is my first ever review. Just felt compelled to
do so since this film is what we can call a sequel. If it's not
better,then it certainly filled the shoes of its predecessor.The action sequences are better, choreographed so well that it felt
authentic. The killings are logical, even though at some points the bad
guys became generic henchmen who can't shoot straight. But the world
created for this sequel is fascinating in every way, making it
impossible not to like the things that happened throughout the movie.Tldr, if you like the first one, then it's a no brainer for this next
chapter. And sharpen your pencil, you'll need it.
