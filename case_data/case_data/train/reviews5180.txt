I saw this film today OH BOY! It was very good. The acting was superb
the fight scenes authentic and there is humor in it as well. The lead
actor who I have never heard of was amazing and Michael Keaton is
always so solid. Very suspenseful. The professional critics will pan
this because it's about killing terrorists which we all know they love
being the left wing retards they are. I am goi8ng to save it on
Netflicks so when it goes to DVD I can watch it again.
