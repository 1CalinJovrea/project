it's OK...  funny but a bit boring

i wanted to love it... i really did... i love the first one... told
many about it... clearly lots of people saw it after it's theatrical
run and are excited for part 2... but i saw it last night and it is a
little dull... story is weak... predictable...spoilers the main plot is that gru has to find a villain so gru's a
good guy now... that's about it... not a bad idea but most of the movie
is him stuck in a mall looking for this villain who is one of the shop
owners... just not that interesting... and obvious and it just doesn't
feel like a lot is at stake.he points to the actual bad guy immediately... we all know this is the
dude but the movie keeps going... the bad guy is kind of boring and not
much is done... he's pretty generic... the villain (beyond gru) in the
first one was so much better.the oldest daughters thing for boys is cute... kristen wiig's character
is fun and while their romance is obvious it's still OK the minions
save the day... i mean the film.not a bad sequel at all... still funny... carell and wiig are great...
movie's just a little dull
