Ghastly

I thought this would be great to watch while the kids went to Star
Wars, it is an awful film and I have no idea why you would make it. I
regret going to see this, and should have instead sat in the car
listening to the radio. Natalies acting is great, but what a morbid,
ghastly story.The way the story is framed with time frames changing all over is
terrible, and the fake old film technique was a missed opportunity to
show the real thing.I feel asleep for a good 10 minutes and I counted at least 5 other
different storing types from throughout the cinema. I would not recommend going to this film for any purpose.
