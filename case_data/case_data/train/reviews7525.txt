Bring it on, BABY! Bring on the firepower and the mayhem. Keep it coming!

This sequel did not disappoint! Maximum star power, maximum firepower,
maximum excitement. "The Expendables 2" was a thrill ride that no one
will ever forget. Sly is back with his crew once more, but this time
they gain a new recruit: Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who's a top
notched sniper, and Maggie (Yu Nan) who is smart but very gutsy in
nature. They bring back all the ones who just had cameos in the first
installment. It got more fun when they got Booker(Chuck Norris) " The
Lone Wolf", and Jean-Claude Van Damme. There's one drawback, he's a
villain. The action in the movie was totally non-stop, there was also a
lot of humor, clich√©s, and one liners in the film. So long to list, I
can't catch up if I tried. "I''ll be back!", is a classic. Sly and Van
Damme? An unlikely battle in the making, however, it's a new epic
battle anyone can think of. Dolph Lundgren was known for his
intellectual talent back in the 80's. He really put it into good use
here. If you thought the first movie was something, you haven't seen
anything like this. "The Expendables 2" is a must see movie for years
to come. All star action, all star humor, and just enough adrenaline to
keep you alert at all times. Enjoy this movie! 4.5 out of 5 stars.
