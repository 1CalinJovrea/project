Forget the Critics

I may be one of the flock, but I am a big fan of the Terminator
franchise. This movie was appropriately delivered to fans of the
franchise more than the prior 2 sequels. Arnold was Arnold and
genuinely looked like he was having fun with the role. The story to me
was pretty well written and despite lots of turns along the way, was
engaging. There was plenty of comic relief. The battle scenes play
homage to the aesthetic and look of the future wars in the 1st two
movies.Emilia Clarke did a pretty good job of playing Sarah Connor although
she might have been a little softer looking than Linda Hamilton, I
think the justification of the plot makes you understand a little more
of how and why she is the way she is.I'll tell you what they didn't do in this film. They didn't go and
screw up the source material like the Star Trek reboots have. This
story plays out a different scenario but the characters both old and
new are familiar and this movie was done very well with respect to the
source materials. If you are a fan of the franchise, you'll feel like
you are getting more of what you might have had to imagine way back in
the 1984 film. You'll enjoy it. Any fan of T1 and T2 should go and see this and add it to your library.
