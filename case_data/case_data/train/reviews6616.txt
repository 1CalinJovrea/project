A great adaptation but a few minor flaws

OK first off, I'll put a spoiler warning, not because I'll give the
plot, but just a few things I didn't like. First off, the mini song
numbers. I felt that they were a bit tacked on and I found little
enjoyment out of them. Second............ actually nothing else was
bad. I liked how they put in references to their books one through
four, like the robot designs, and while I didn't laugh at every joke, I
liked enough to consider the movie funny. If you are a fan of the
series, go check out this movie, and I can't wait for the sequel,
because it is a book series after all, and I wouldn't expect less. The
only people who wouldn't like this movie are probably people who
haven't grown up with the series. However I do say that if you bring
your kids in and you yourself like animated movies, you find this OK to
great. Results may vary.
