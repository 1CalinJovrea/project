Awful

Most than half of the movie is about a misunderstood teenage rebellious
girl. Misunderstood spoiled brat. No, just a spoiled brat. Her actions
make no sense, her attitude neither. The plot not even close. Is like
they took out everything in the fantasy/horror movies and tried to put
it together in this one. Failed, failed miserably. What's with the
vampires or werewolves ? where did they come from? why vampires are bad
but WW are good ? What happened with the vampires ? who were they
working for since they didn't show at the grand finally ? The
characters have such a inconsistent background, one can't get their
role at all. They just pop out with no explanation, they harm then help
with no explanation, they do things without any explanation, and the
movie ends that way. Terrible. That little friend zoned sob is bitten
by vampires, what happened with that ? No explanation. I would stay
away from this series and the books also. One star for the so close
incest.
