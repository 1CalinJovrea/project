Terrible

This has to be an all time low for Adam Sandler, I get that this is a
parody but this doesn't even fall into the category of parody. Complete
garbage and a waist of effort. The sad thing is that Sandler has a
terrific cast to do something quite funny but instead rehashes old
jokes and scenes from his former films. The whole film Sandler seems to
be on autopilot. Taylor Lautner's "try hard retard" act should have
ended up on the cutting room floor(BAD). I will stop now before it
get's nasty. I think Sandler needs to go back to his roots and do some
serious soul searching and try to redeem himself after this failure.
BOO BOO BOO
