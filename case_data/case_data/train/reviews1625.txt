Awful, really awful.

The Act of Valour was the fact that I sat through what is one of the
worst films I have ever seen. At the end, someone should have handed
out medals to the six of us that actually endured it to the end. It
really is like watching someone play a very bad video game. They
complete a mission and are just looking forward to going home to the
wife and kids when they have to go on another mission. That completed
and yet another mission and then another. Are there no other SEAL teams
due to cut backs ? As with a video game, the baddies cannot fire
straight but the SEAL team never miss. Got hit by a dud RPG ? Just pull
it from your bulletproof vest, dust yourself off and walk away. Do not
waste your money or time on this film.
