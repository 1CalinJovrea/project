Riviting Authenticity

Riveting Authenticity is the first feeling I had when the movie ended.
After watching these events unfold. If you don't feel for these real
life men, soldiers, heroes, Americans.... You may want to consider a
frontal lobotomy. Or just stop reading and/or watching anything
political. This work is best viewed after removing the talking points/
talking heads. Only recount the actual time line of events from the
Bengasi hearings on c-span. This work gives a mega phone to those who's
voices where dismissed and a heart to those who can never speak again.
Michael Bay clearly did the right thing by taking direction from those
who where actually there. That is evident throughout the movie and
really gives a heightened authenticity. One of the best historical war
movies ever. Several emotions smack you hard throughout this movie. The
acting was very well done by pretty much everyone. John Krasinski
probably impressed me the most. I have not enjoyed much of anything he
has done since the office. This is a rare film in that I will want to
see again. I hope this work can help heal a country that was stabbed in
the gut by the attempt to muddle the facts from that day.
