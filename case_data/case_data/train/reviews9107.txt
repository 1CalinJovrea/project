A film of pain and struggle to get to redemption with courage and determination.

"Stronger" the new biopic film about Jeff Bauman and the 2013 Boston
marathon bombing is one tale of courage and dealing with pain and
sorrow before coming to terms with life thru determination. The film is
set from the beginning and deals with the marathon bombing to the
struggle and life changing days of one Jeff Bauman(in one of Jake
Gyllenhaal's best performances). The city of Boston from the scenes and
accents is captured just perfect and the pain and blood wounds seen are
felt and seem real like as the hospital stay that involves Jeff and his
struggle to get back up with family and friends is highlighted and
showcased with such pain and tough determination. This film proves that
one's life can be turned upside down with an unexpected event and can
change forever. Still with love, courage, and determination it can make
one stronger forever.
