Watchable

The Manzoni family is in Witness Protection in Normandy, France because
Giovanni Manzoni (Robert DeNiro), who is now Fred Blake, ratted out the
Luchese mob family. Don Luchese (Stan Carp), the old Don, now in jail,
needs to find Giovanni to whack him. This isn't exactly a comedy, not so much a drama, not really a thriller
and I would say it's light drama with comedic overtones, although I
didn't experience many chuckles. It's watchable and kind of enjoyable
until we get 16-yr old daughter Belle (Dianna Agron) viscously beating
up on a classmate with a tennis racket. Later Fred Blake takes a
baseball bat to a local plumber. And, still later Fred beats up on the
manager of a water distribution facility. The viciousness of the
beatings were too extreme for this movie and went too far in my
opinion. It was like watching someone beating a dead horse. Not good. Fred's wife, Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), blows things up when she gets
upset. I guess old habits are hard to die when one is attached to a mob
family. On a less violent side, the son, 13-year old Warren Blake (John D'Leo)
gets involved at school with black market cigarettes and prescription
pills. See, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Then we have FBI Agent Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) whose job it is to
protect the family. Later he learns that Fred is writing the story of
his life and if that ever got out wellThe acting by all is fine, but you somehow get the idea that all is not
as serious as it really is. In other words the door is left open for
somewhat comedic comments. The interactions among the family are good, supportive and genuine.
They have each other's backs and that will be needed when Don Luchese's
men find the family. You didn't forget about them, did you? (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, Belle and her tutor teacher against a door.
Nudity: No. Language: Yes, the kids too.
