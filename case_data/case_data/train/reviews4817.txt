Great movie

Greetings from Lithuania."I Origins" (2014) is a superb drama with sci-fi elements, that looks
closer to reality then fiction from recent sci-fi movies. Acting was
very solid, direction, script were superb as well as the music - great
stuff. This picture grabbed me from first moments till the very last
end - i couldn't take my eyes from screen and was captivated in the
story. At running time 1 h 48 min it never drags and is superbly paced. Overall, "I Origins" touches great themes, approaches them with more
sciences rather then fiction and does a great job of keeping you glued
to the screen during the process - what else can you ask from a motion
picture. Great movie.
