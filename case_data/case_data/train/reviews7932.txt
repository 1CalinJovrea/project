One major caveat, but this is an Oscar sure-thing for Natalie Portman

I saw this at one of my rare non-balcony screenings at this year's TIFF
with Chilean director Pablo Larrain (who had another film at the
festival, the Spanish language NERUDA) present and available for a
post-screening Q & A.First things first. If you thought Helen Mirren as THE QUEEN, Marion
Cotillard as Edith Piaf, and Meryl Streep as THE IRON LADY gave great,
deservedly Oscar-winning performances in biopics, know that Natalie
Portman as Jackie Kennedy gives a performance here that's every bit in
their league. This almost makes you wince at the thought of how much
talent was going underutilized in all those Star Wars and Thor movies,
but I'm glad that they made it possible for her to play a role like
this one. Truly out of the park.I can't see this film not picking up multiple nominations. Pablo and
the picture should both be nominated, but they'll have a tough time
taking home the prizes over Damien Chazelle and LA LA LAND (which I
also saw and am sure will be a big hit). The cinematography, editing,
set design, and ESPECIALLY the makeup are all first-rate and deserving.There may be a nomination among the supporting players: Peter Sarsgaard
is excellent as the thoroughly-broken Bobby Kennedy, and his
consideration should benefit from the contrast with his highly-visible
role as the head baddie in the remake of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (also
seen at TIFF) which is certainly destined for commercial success. (BTW,
he's just adequate in that role Â– no match for Eli Wallach in the
original.)About that caveat: The film leaves the impression that there was a
national day of mourning the day of the Kennedy funeral, so I inquired
of Larrain (who speaks only limited English) why the film didn't
address the controversy about the NFL playing a full schedule on the
same day. It turned out that he didn't know what the NFL was and had to
be informed by the moderator. I didn't really catch his reply,
something about things having to go on.Another quibble: The framing device is an interview Jackie gave to
Theodore White a week after the assassination, but White is not
identified and is played by Billy Cruddup, who looks nothing like him.
The familiarity Jackie had with him is nowhere to be found.Misimpressions aside, this is a must-see for anyone with a taste for
great acting. Let the aforementioned performances be your guide -- that
or a desire to see Portman one-up her Oscar turn in BLACK SWAN.
