Takes away the good from the original, turns into a dime-a-dozen action flick

The thing that made the old Total Recall so great was that it kept a
certain level of fun going throughout the whole film. It threw Doug
Quaid through several crazy challenges and turnarounds in the story. It
was enjoyable to watch, and totally intrigued the viewer. It was campy.
It was, all in all, a great movie.This remake forgot the entire element of fun, and instead replaced it
with what the producers probably thought people wanted to see: more
explosions. It's just, simply put, bleh.It's not very fun to watch. It's actually pretty boring in the scenes
where there isn't action, and the scenes where there is action, it
begins to get old very quickly. I don't ever feel like it's my place to critique another person's
acting, but there are a few exceptions. Farrell just doesn't seem like
a great Quaid. He kind of just takes everything that is thrown at him,
and gets over it. Schwarzenegger was thrown into the action and was
always surprised with what came next. He wasn't ever ready, and that
showed. It made it more exciting! Farrell always kind of keeps that
"yeah, I'm a secret agent? okay." attitude going the entire movie. The last thing: You have almost no doubt that Quaid is actually a
secret agent in this one. The old one actually had you thinking it was
possible that he was still back at Rekall; whereas the remake spells it
out in the beginning: He is a secret agent. That's it. End of story.
The point of the old Total Recall was that you were never really sure.
Is it all fake? Or is it real? The remake completely missed that
intrigue, which was a big part of the old one. It will entertain the people who like action, and nothing else. The
substance just isn't there, which is a bit of a letdown. I give it a
four, because it looked pretty.
