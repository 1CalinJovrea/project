Should be renamed The Lost City of Zzzz...

What was probably an incredibly interesting story has been turned into
an incredibly dull film. Charlie Hunnam's Fawcett is as flat as
roadkill and Robert Pattinson might as well have stayed at home in bed
for all he brings to the tale. As for Angus Macfadyen; he obviously
thought he was in a different movie entirely. Three times during this
film Fawcett travels to the Bolivian jungle yet we barely learn
anything about the place or his expeditions. The director skips hastily
from one badly written scene to another with all the depth of a
Stephenie Meyer novel. This film is an episodic series of set pieces,
many of which should have been left in a heap on the cutting room
floor; the entire WW1 sequence brings absolutely nothing to the story
except filling quarter of an hour of screen time with clich√©d dialogue
and hackneyed visuals. With Fawcett's final trip to the jungle you
might think that the fabled Lost City of Z might finally make an
appearance; you'd be wrong. The film fizzles like a damp squib and then
the credits roll, and not too soon either. Snore on.
