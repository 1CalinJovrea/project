I surprisingly didn't hate it

â€‹ Going into the Point Break remake I don't think I could have had any
lower expectations because I am a massive fan of the original, but I
came out of this movie actually quite liking it. The acting in this
movie is average and the story is very predictable and cheesy at times
but the stunt scenes! They are fantastic and i found I couldn't take my
eyes off the screen while they were happening. Unfortunately after a
stunt scene comes dialogue which with its bad timing and believability
pulled me straight back out of the film, I do honestly think they
should have taken the Point Break elements out of this movie and just
called it something altogether fresh, then I think I would maybe hold
this film a little higher. But even with all this I do think this movie
was very, very enjoyable and if you just want to kick back and watch a
mindless action movie this is a brilliant choice. I give Point Break
(2015) a 6/10
