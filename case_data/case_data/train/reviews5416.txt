This is terrible

I wanted this movie to be decent. But it is absolute garbage. I watch
his movie from start to finish without laughing at all, and find myself
cringing at the acting that was happening. There is nothing at this
movie brings that is worth sitting through an hour and 59 minutes. I'm
not quite sure what Kate McKinnon's character is supposed to be she
walks around like she's got some lame legs and she cannot walk normally
and if you watch closely you see her constantly smirking and laughing
at her own stupid lines. Don't waste your time
