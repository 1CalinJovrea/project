Pass on this one

This would have made a great 15 minute short on Portlandia or some
other show along those lines. Sitting through this movie was pretty
painful and the whole plot got old after 30 minutes. The premise of the
movie was movie was funny enough, but after a while you just wanted it
to end. Skip this one.
