The worst movie of the series

This is my first review on IMDb and I'm only writing this because so
many reviews are praising this movie! I knew it would be average but
within the first 10 minutes I realised how horrible this movie was.
From winning a race in reverse gear of a wrecked car to driving ahead
of an army without a single bullet hitting them. I know this series has
always had over the top action but this plain nonsense. As somebody
else said in their review the heists didn't need cars in the first
place. I only liked the action sequences between Dwayne and Jason, rest
were unwatchable! I feel bad for the people praising this movie.
