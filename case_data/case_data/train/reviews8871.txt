Another silly spy spoof saved by solid acting performances

I've got a thing for spy comedies, I've seen most of the recent ones
and many of the older ones. It's a genre so based on plot twists that
most of them can be seen a mile away, especially if you've already seen
some. This one is no different. No real plot twist is really
surprising, including the final joke. And still, I had loads of fun
watching it, because most of the jokes are actually character driven,
and the characters are very well written, and well performed by most.
That is, Isla Fisher, Zach Galifianakis and Jon Hamm, are practically
super. Gal Gadot got the warrior woman with the menacing looks nailed
to the teeth, but is a bit less convincing when she has to be sensitive
or subtle. It doesn't happen often during the movie, so it's not a big
issue, but there are a few moments in which she's off character. But
everybody else around does such a good job, the jokes work, and the
pace is fast enough for us not to care it's not so very surprising. I liked it, most of the people around me in the cinema liked it too. If
you don't expect a masterpiece, just plain simple fun - you'll find it
here.
