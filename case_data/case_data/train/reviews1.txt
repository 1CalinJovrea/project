So Pointless

On Halloween 1997, two estranged teen skaters embark on a surreal
journey through their memories, dreams and fears. At least, that is
supposed to be the plot. Really, kids just sit around and do nothing
for two hours.I have only one question: did they spend the entire budget spent on
music? Although the budget seems modest, they have just about very
major alternative rock hit of the late 1990s in here. How the heck did
they pull that one off? Although this film serves no purpose, is rather
boring and just does not work as a thriller or horror film, it does
have one small consolation: it is a very early role for Gulliver
McGrath, who went on to appear in "Lincoln" and "Dark Shadows", and may
yet become a bigger name.
