What a wonderful idea!

I went to see this movie hoping to get a brake from Hollywood
production. And I did. It was amazing, one of the best movies I've seen
on big screen in 2 or 3 years.Plot consists of different stories which all have one thing in common:
they are about revenge. Every single story starts rather boring. At the
very beginning I was thinking "What's so wild about it? It is just
lame" and by the end of the intro I was like "Holy God! No, they did
not just twist it like that! OMG!"And it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it
was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similar
to Russia. The views, the behaviour of the people, the insanity - all
like at home.You won't regret seeing this movie. Don't take your kid or your
grandmother though.
