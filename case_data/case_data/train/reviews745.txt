Entertaining

I liked this one. Normally I'd be critical of films of this nature but
they have done a good job with this one, ticking all the boxes and
ensuring that 'it does what it says on the tin'Its a fairly simple plot with a twist delivered as two fairly separate
themes within the story and its done really well. You have no idea
what's coming and when it does it's a little silly, but still exciting
and enjoyable. Its an entertaining film and I couldn't really ask for much more from
the fairly able production team. The two leads are superb and have
great presence on screen. Judah Lewis is excellent, I hope to see more
of him, and Samara Weaving is also fantastic. Aside from Andrew
Bachelor who's performance is below par the rest of the cast is pretty
good. Another good production from Netflix who don't always get it right.
There's no excess here but they've done very well with all the details
that mattered. OK, its a little cheesy. There are some good chuckles to
be had but no belly laughs or LOL's. The effects for the most part are
a poor rendition of old school horror, but its a throwback to horror
from the 80's so works well if a little camp. Definitely worth a watch, on an idle Friday night.
