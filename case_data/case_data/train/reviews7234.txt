Oh my...

Going to see this film was part of a birthday gift. (I want a birthday
do-over.) When one of my nephews heard we were all going to see it he
gracefully sidestepped the invitation saying he had trig homework to
do. HE is the family movie buff, so that was a major red flag. When another family member asked what the movie was about as we filed
in with popcorn, etc., we joked that the subplot was to help fund
Depp's recovery from his latest behind-the-scenes relationship woes
(not knowing yet how awful and lifeless the film actually would be). It's no secret that there's no real plot or acting involved in this
(final?) part to the series. I'm amazed they were able to get any of
the stellar cast members from the series back. I liked the earlier
ones. This... didn't do anything for me. People were actually walking
out of the theatre.
