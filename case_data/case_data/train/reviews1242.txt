This movie was awful, self indulgent and funny maybe twice in two hours.

This movie simply wasn't funny. It dragged on interminably, scenes with
little comedic value got dragged out for far too long presumably
because the directors (and main featured actors) were too high while
making this steaming pile of wasted time.We get it. You like to do drugs and are generally wastes of humanity
and oxygen on this planet. This movie isn't funny though. There have
been many funny drug movies made, and made by funny people on drugs.
Super Troopers was funny, Cheech and Chong was funny, Half Baked was
funny, this was not funny.This movie is a nauseating bromantic drama pretending to be a comedy. I
expected the two main characters to start making out at the end. Not
that there would be anything intrinsically wrong with that, in fact it
would've been cathartic since they so obviously were in love with each
other.The two funniest actors in the movie, Ansari and Cera, die within the
first ten minutes and all you're left with is a weak cast and weaker
script.I want Seth Rogen to give me my money back, though the two wasted hours
of my life are something no one can ever give back. Movies like this
make me not want to see movies in theaters anymore, because had I known
what I was going in for from trailers and the publicity, I never would
have bothered seeing this train wreck.I wish I could give this movie zero out of ten stars.I guess some people really like this stuff, but I'll be avoiding Seth's
movies like the plague in the future.
