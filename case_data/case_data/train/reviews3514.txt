Ticks all the boxes

I'll make my review short. Go see this. It has all the elements of a
great movie from the acting to the score by Alexandre Desplat.
Excellent script and delivery. It was well received at TIFF 14 where it
was named People's Choice. The cast members really gelled on screen. It
was well edited because the pace of the movie did not lag at any time.
When watching this you will quickly realize that these actors (Benedict
Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Mark Strong, Allen Leech)
will be around for a long time entertaining us. If you like A Beautiful
Mind or even Good Will Hunting, you will enjoy this. It comes out in
November 2014. Don't miss it. This one is Oscar worthy.
