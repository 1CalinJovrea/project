I actually really enjoyed this movie.

Sure it's still got some of the dated gooey-ness of the original movie,
sure Shrek's impact on savaging the Disney/fairy-tale formula can still
be felt years after release, but Cinderella is a beautifully directed
and cinematographed; and Kenneth Branagh did this? Why do films like this exist in today's industry? Well franchising for
one thing, and even though films like this are basically products in
Disney's pipeline it CAN be well done given that the movie's got a
determined director at the helm. And oddly, Branagh, the guy who
directed films such as 1996's Hamlet, was just the guy to make
Cinderella into a watchable film. It's pretty, has a good cast and has
some nice tid-bits of humor here and there. And it's an update on the
whole Disney-esque 'happily ever after' thing. Yes the story's the same
but it gives some much-needed chemistry to Cinderella's and 'The
Prince''s romantic charm. And... it works.You don't need to be a girl or a gay to like this film; just see it for
what it is: a harmless remake of an animation from the 1950s.
