Very disappointing

I felt compelled to write a review to counter all the excellent reviews
that this movie has received.It is not excellent, in fact it is dull, celebrates disobedience and
feels like two completely different stories taped together to make up
the time.I can't really see the point of the movie, young girls in Scotland
today (or the USA or even South Africa)are not forced to marry, in the
tenth century when they were it was accepted and not the great drama
made out in the movie.The whole movie reeks of feminist fantasy- wanting to live in a
romantic Scottish medieval setting, sorting out mother issues and
having modern rules and standards.I found it disturbing that every male character in the movie was
portrayed as at best, big stupid and loving, (King Fergus) at worst
violent and evil (the bear). They only males given any intelligence in
the movie are the triplets, who are constant thieves, conniving,
ruthless, destructive and very small! The basic story and message was
if you are a young woman with serious mother issues, don't worry. Do
something really nasty to your mother, then say you are really sorry
then your mother will change her mind and you can have it all your own
way! Don't worry about any men involved as they are too stupid to
understand what is going on.A lot of this I could have forgiven if the movie did not feel so
disjointed, and in the second half frankly boring. This is not "How to
train your dragon" with a female lead (that would have been great) this
is a feminist Disney "Mother bear" done very beautifully by Pixar, with
great voice acting but ultimately very unsatisfying.
