All style and no heart in badly directed 40'ies gangster-western

I vote: 10 idea, 9 the cars, 8 shooting, 7 footage, 6 cast, 5 humor, 4
excitement, 3 believability, 2 execution, 1 Sean Penn.And this is from a film lover which loves most of what Sean Penn
delivers on and behind the screen. The director really messed this film
up, obviously wanting Penn to be a Caricature of some lame gangster
here. I think he realized what an amateur the director was, and gave
up, to start playing like it was a joke Because this film is that - a
joke.I'll sum it up to a 4, for the wasted potential in a movie which
promises I certainly will keep distance to next time Ruben Fleischer
directs a movie, though I liked Zombieland, which was funny. Has he
tried making this like Zombieland? I just wonder...Even the kids and the births in this movie are violent, and there's put
quite a lot of nastiness and graphic violence into this flick, but the
problem is that it's far from what it wants to be. It's colorful and
quite beautifully shot, many of the scenes. It's almost like a comic
book.It's probably the most boring gangster-flick I've seen, and the cast
promises more. So far I'm glad I don't know what the budget of this is,
though it's likely to be more than a handful of millions, because it's
a waste of money and potential.If you love the Godfather, Tarantino, The Untouchables and LA
Confidential, stay far away from this. If you love good films, stay
away from this!The folks behind this don't deserve the money. Except Nolte, which
actually gives a good role as head of police. The trailer gives it all.
All style, nothing else, the film tries to be a bad ass movie, but
falls on the ground as a flying turkey.
