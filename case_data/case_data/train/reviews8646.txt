'There's a sickness in people that stops them seeing the truth.'

Sebastian Barry's brilliant novel SECRET SCRIPTURE has been transformed
into an eloquent touching film Johnny Ferguson and Director Jim
Sheridan. With moody cinematography by Mikhail Krichman and a musical
score by Brian Byrne (with a lot of help from Beethoven) and a perfect
cast of actors, this radiantly beautiful film should satisfy a large
audience  those who love period pieces, Ireland, sweet romance, ad
twists of plot. Roseanne McNulty (Vanessa Redgrave) must vacate the soon-to-be
demolished mental institution in Roscommon, Ireland that she's called
home for over 50 years. The hospital's psychiatrist, Dr. William Grene
(Eric Bana) is called in to assess her condition. He finds himself
intrigued by Roseanne's seemingly inscrutable rituals and tics, and her
fierce attachment to her Bible, which she has over the decades
transformed into a palimpsest of scripture, drawings, and cryptic diary
entries. As Grene delves deeper into Roseanne's past, we see her as the
young woman Rose (Rooney Mara), whose charisma proves seductive. We
learn that she moved to Sligo to work in her aunt's café, fell in love
with a dashing fighter pilot Michael McNulty (Jack Reynor), and that a
local priest Father Gaunt (Theo James) fell tragically in love with
her. The elderly Lady Rose is institutionalized because it was rumored
that she murdered her only child at childbirth. Dr Grene and a nurse
(Susan Lynch) are supportive of Lady Rose as the story unfolds in the
most sensitive manner.There is much to be praised in this film  the manner in which the
conflict between the Irish and the British altered personal lives and
relationships, the horrors of the early 20th century insane asylums,
the struggle Catholics priests at times endure with their celibacy
vows, and the beauty of Ireland  but the cast is so fine that they
shine with this material. This is a very fine film.
