Wow

I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening for this film. I had a
toss up between two films to see and I chose this one based on the
trailer and generally positive reviews (who likes to waste their time
with bad movies). Wow.This is one of those rare feats in filmmaking. The cinematography is
great, but see this for the acting and the story. Not often has a movie
made me cry, laugh, and shout out (aloud mind you) during the films run
time. I don't want to spoil much of the story as it becomes obvious
early on, what is actually going on. The magnificence of this film is
in how the director was able to tackle the difficult subject matter in
a way that doesn't leave you feeling like you saw an average
thriller/horror movie, but really out it in perspective of the child,
which I believe had a humanistic approach. It was amazing. Best movie
of 2015, by a long shot and they're were great movies this year. (Im
looking at you exmachina) Not only I, but I feel absolutely everyone who left the theater left a
better person for what they witnessed. Not often do I come out of the
theater with people being more polite than they were upon entering.
THAT is the power this movie has, I emerged myself in the experience
and I'm glad I did, because "No one is strong alone", certainly not I,
and I have a more profound idea of appreciation of my own life and
existence til death. I will continue on my quest but I know that I will
never forget this landmark film, what it taught me, and how it humbled
everyone in the theater.
