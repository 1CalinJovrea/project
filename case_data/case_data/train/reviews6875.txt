A Great Performance from Jude Law, But Little Else

Director Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects is a film that starts off
with promise, but devolves into a standard conspiracy thriller before
end. The concept of a woman murdering her husband due to the side
effects of a drug, and the ensuing nightmare that follows the doctor
that prescribed it, is a concept that is fresh and invigorating, but
unfortunately that's only the first half of the film. About midway
through the film, Soderbergh wants to deconstruct the idea that it was
the drug that caused the murder, and in fact makes the movie more
preposterous by making it a grand conspiracy cooked up by a shrink and
this woman. The shining light of Side Effects are the performances from
the actors, in particular Jude Law as the doctor who finds himself
under scrutiny. If you are an admirer of a great actor turning in a
great performance, then this film is worth watching, but be forewarned,
Side Effects has little else that's good.I give Side Effects a 6 out of 10!
