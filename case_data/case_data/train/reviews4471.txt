I don't know why they tried to use the point break name

obviously this heap of garbage of a movie was an attempt at a money
grab on the name of a mildly successful well known Point Break movie.
1st off, like the original the acting was pretty horrible. 2nd, unlike
the original the screen play was awful. Things are just pieced
together, no real story line of any realistic or logical conclusions.
They really tried way to hard in this movie and it flopped. You need
more than some extreme sport scenes to make a movie cool. This movie
lacked any sort of real character development, any interest to pull the
viewer in other than some nicely shot scenes. It's mostly Hollywood
drivel. It's a shame they wasted such a huge budget on this movie,
although I'm sure the extreme athletes who performed the stunts
appreciated the pay check from it. I would skip this movie. Go watch
the original it's better written, better acted (that's saying a lot)
and a more interesting movie.
