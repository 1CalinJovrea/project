Why why why!?

How can this movie have such a high rating? I went to see this one in
theaters tonight because I thought it would be good. Instead all I got
were some cheap loud sound scares. There was nothing really scary about
this whole movie. Every time I thought something scary would happen I
got disappointed by a loud sound effect and a flash image.I kept wondering the entire movie why certain characters would do
certain things like:Why go back in the room when they know it's dangerous. Why won't they
talk with each other whats going on in the house. Why go back in the
house after the things that happened. Why create an orphanage in a
house the owners know is haunted. And why stay there after the horrible
event that happened 12 years ago. Why sit in front of an open door
staring in the abyss shooting a toy gun. Why not unbuckle the belt to
free yourself from the chair? Why not freak out and flee while you can
after seeing the man of the house sucked dry and dead on the floor? Why
is there no lights in the house?The story writers probably think the people who go and watch this movie
are stupid or something. As viewer you already know whats going on, the
movie characters also know whats going on, but they all just stay there
and let it happen, making dumb decisions as the movie progresses.They are just lucky the demon is even more stupid then they are..
