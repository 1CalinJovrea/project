The worlds greatest superhero gets the movie he deserves.

I saw Man Of Steel last night at an advance screening and at no point
was I looking down on the movie.From the trailers and TV spots the
movie really gets you interested and dying for more.And the Movie
itself soars(yes I know ha-ha)above the expectations.First of all Henry Cavill is an excellent Clark Kent/Superman.He really
gives the character that "not wanted" or "don't feel like you belong"
feeling.The cast in the movie is excellent including Russell Crowe and
Michael Shannon.Russell Crowe really expands on Jor-el's character and
makes him more than just a voice helping Clark.Michael Shannon as Zod
is terrific.He was even better than Superman 2's Zod.The fight scenes in the movie are astonishing.It makes up for all the
lack of conflict Superman Returns had.The fight scenes are very
destructive yes but there is a very good story around it so it wasn't
just mindless explosions like Transformers.Man of steel was by far the
best movie of the year.
