Kids liked it OK, I thought it was forgettable

Animation is good (except surely not all Polynesians are so stocky and
have such large cankles???). I liked the Moana character and her outfit
was cute. Maui not so much, such an overblown caricature it was
ridiculous!!! My 9 year old granddaughter thought his moving tattoos
were silly. She and her 7 year old brother enjoyed it OK, but I doubt
if they would want to see it again. I know I don't!! The plot was
formulaic and none of the characters (except Moana) were memorable. I
don't recall any memorable songs, either. The movie needed a MUCH
better plot and more in-depth characters. Go back to the drawing board,
Disney!! Some of my granddaughter's old Barbie movies (like "Pegasus")
had better and more memorable stories!!
