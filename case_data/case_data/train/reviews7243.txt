This is the End of me ever attending a Seth Rogen creation

This was perhaps THE worst movie I've ever seen. Perhaps my wife and I
are simply too old for the subject matter (50s), but sex-oriented
jokes, drug use, and constant use of the f-word do not a humorous movie
make - and we are not prudish people, particularly my wife. I think I
smiled once, and I heard my wife giggle once, but I was as close to
walking out of a movie as I've ever come. I doubt there was much of a
script involved, and my guess is that all of the actors were told to
ad-lib the nastiest sex joke that could get an 'R' rating they could
think of. I mean a five minute scene about ejaculating all over
someone's house...??? Hardy-har-har. I now hate Danny McBride even more
than I did before this garbage, and what the hell was Emma Watson
thinking.There is absolutely NOTHING I can recommend about this movie, and I
think it's the only one I've ever given 1 star to. Complete garbage.
The only way I'll ever attend another movie that Seth Rogen is in is if
he shows up unexpectedly in a bit part. He and his pal Evan Goldberg
have no writing talent whatsoever, and I can't say much about Rogen's
acting either. How they make a living in this business is beyond
explanation. Thanks for this utter waste of time fellas. You got me.
