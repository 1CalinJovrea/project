This is one of the dumbest movies I ever seen.

It's so dumb, it's DUMBDUMB! I have to write three lines of text about
this movie, so here it goes. I saw a bunch of good actors in this film,
so that means the director FAILED in making this a good movie. I could
have directed this film a thousand times better than the director of
this film. Mainly because I love films. I realize that directors have a
certain time to make a film, but this film is the reason why they
should be given more time.
