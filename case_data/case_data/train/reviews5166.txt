Think this could be a Christmas Classic, someday.

So I read somewhere that Collateral Beauty does not have what it takes 

to be a Christmas Classic. I'm not sure about that, you be surprise how 

many Christmas Classic don't have what it takes to be Christmas 

Classics. 



It took a While for It's a Wonderful Life to become an X-mas Classic



Smith plays a man who is shocked to the core with the lost of his 

daughter and can't do anything else, but in an attempt to wrap his head 

around it he starts writing letters to Time, Love, and Death and things 

get crazy when they respond to these letters.



I think we were all expecting something more form big Willie and he did 

not deliver. They can't all be magical ones, but we were expecting pure 

magic.



I got to admit though, this movie should have been magic not just 

because of the Fresh Prince. He lead a very stellar cast of fine as 

wine actors. With such power houses at Ed Norton, Kate Winslet and 

Helen Mirren leading the charge 



So it's not a bad movie at all, possibly not as good as the cast that's 

in it, you'd expect more but you never known sometime down the line 

this could be a new Christmas Classic. Let's see how many people stream 

it on Netflix.
