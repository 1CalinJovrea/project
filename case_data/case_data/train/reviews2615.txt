A Very Entertaining Family Movie

this movie is a good example of how an animated movie could do what
Live action couldn't.lately i think animated movie are trying so hard to look real, visually
its okay to be real, but stories and effects should reach far more and
that is why they made it animated instead right?try comparing Brave and Wreck it Ralph, one story is simple and
realistic while the later is completely a fantasy.and The Croods follow the fantasy, the real story is about a family and
how it survive through changes in their world.i read some other people's review here in IMDb and it shocked me,
there's one woman who said the movie is unreal because it shows a baby
that could run like a wolf! well lady if you go into an animated movie
about cavemen who could speak English and expect logic, maybe you
haven't heard about a company named Disney that made duck and mouse
talk like human.its not that all animated are unreal, but thats the essence of
animated, it could reach beyond live action, where else director can
put in all their fantasy and made magical movie.if you watch this with family, i bet all your little ones will enjoy it
through out the film.
