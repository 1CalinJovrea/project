just when you thought the genre had completely sold out...

Since wishi washi pseudo horror films ala insidious and co dominate the
genre at the moment i never expect much when watching a new entry.And
much to my surprise Jane Doe is a REAL horror film in finest John
Carpenter b-movie tradition. Jane Doe starts out strong, builds atmosphere with genuinely creepy
scenes and manages to keep its mystery and secrets just long enough to
satisfy. Much of this is due to the moody music which probably made
half the film!Sure there is the occasional i-already-know-whats-coming-next/ clich√©d
shock scene, but such sins are easily forgiven within seconds since the
intense atmosphere of this film pulls the viewer back in mercilessly.If you appreciate classic oldschool flicks like John Carpenters 'The
Fog', Jane Doe will not disappoint. Go see it!
