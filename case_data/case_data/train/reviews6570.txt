The cheap scape d******s present: Gru and his h*****g brother(he h***s the golden car) featuring the annoying yellow t***s

** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS** Also before I start this review is
offensive in no way i blocked out all the bad words so person who
reported this should understand this is just a joke.Before I start this review I am going to be honest I am not a fan of
Illumination.I think since their great success of Despicable Me the
quality of their movies has gone down. Not to mention movies such as
Minions and The Lorax being awful in my opinion.So I wasn't expecting
too much watching this film.First of all the main plot is very rushed.First plot of Gru and Dru
doesn't really lead to anywhere as Gru has to bring Dru along to steal
the diamond.And we are brought from stealing the diamond to fighting
Bratt in space of 10-15 minutes. I find this very rushed and its not
enjoyable.And when Gru catches Bratt Dru would rather live in a smaller
house in estate with Gru rather than stay in his huge mansion with
dozens of fancy cars and his pool.Doesn't make any sense to me.Now on to the new and old characters. The characters that kind of
impressed I only think were Bratt and Lucy. Bratt in general was a
decent villain, we get info on his back story and at times he can be
kind of humorous(no surprise Trey Parker is f*****g awesome). But I
felt something was missing compared to Vector to do with how Vector was
portrayed.Lucy in general was OK. She took a responsible role of trying
to be a mother to her kids and finding out what was right and what was
wrong about being a mother(however this I find boring for kids)However
I felt she tried too hard and could have eased down on whole mother
thing.OMG my favorite part ranting about the bad characters!! Especially Mel
and minions. I always wondered why bother calling the minions they all
look the f*****g same anyway. I felt this character was pointless
nothing funny about him not developed at all like all the minions and
my god every time there was a scene with the minions it was absolutely
CRINGEYYYY. Literally boob and ass jokes everywhere this is I find is a
horrible influence on young children. Especially at time when two
minions walk past the women statue. If u think about it Illumination
are technically saying it is OK to laugh at women's boobs when it is
NOTTTT. And what is the joke about showing your ass in this movie. Why
does the minion in prison want a tattoo on his ass why not his back or
his arm (and of course Tattoos another great influence on kids)Of
course you would get sick of seeing the same jokes in movie all the
time.Overall this movie was very poor but will still make massive profit as
it has those annoying yellow t***s in the movie. Sadly judging by the
ending we probably get another despicable me movie not to mention also
another minions movie(YEAHHHHH *crys quietly to himself*. If you want
to watch a movie full of non funny jokes and boring characters watch
this.If you want to watch a movie with great adventure and clever humor
(captain underpants) don't watch this pleaseee.
