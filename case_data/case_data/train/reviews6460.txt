A missed opportunity.

Danish auteur Nicolas Winding Refn's first Hollywood picture Drive is
one of the best films of the millennium, hands down. His Thailand-set
revenge saga feels like a natural extension of that masterpiece, albeit
a very boring and pretentious one. Where Drive was slow-burning and
enrapturing, OGF is slow and uninteresting; where Ryan Gosling's Driver
was charismatic and compelling, his drug-dealing enigma here is dull
and vacuous; Drive's violence was impactful and meaningful, the
brutality in this is nasty and pointless. There are, however, two
shining lights that save this from being completely unwatchable. The
neon-lit cinematography is simply stunning and quite often disguises
the senselessness of what is actually going on, whilst the ballsy
performance from Kristen Scott Thomas as Gosling's reprehensible
white-trash mother is a terrific display of her versatility and
deserving of a much better movie. A missed opportunity that suggests
Refn is a hit and miss prospect.
