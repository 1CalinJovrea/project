Weird, dark humor, likely without wide appeal, but this is my review, so tough.

I'm giving this a solid ten, yet, at the same time, I'd hesitate to
recommend it to anyone I know. I went looking for a strange and odd movie and that's what I got. This
movie is a weird mix of light and heavy black humor with some pretty
serious violence mixed in. It doesn't neatly fall into any film genre,
and I'm not surprised that it was not successful at the box office,
since I can't envision it having a large natural audience. None of the lead characters are particularly likable (with the possible
exceptions of the daughter and the dog), and there's no real point or
moral to the story at all (as a matter of fact, it's extremely amoral),
but it proved to be exceptionally good at holding my attention and
maintaining my somewhat morbid curiosity from beginning to end. Even
though it was nearly two hours long, I was sad when it was over,
because I had found it consistently entertaining throughout--I was just
having a great time "at the movies." So, in summary, this film was pretty much exactly what I was seeking
that particular night, so I give it full marks; however, on the other
hand, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, my appraisal is a
very personal one, and, given how unusual this film is, I honestly have
no clue how others are going to feel about it.
