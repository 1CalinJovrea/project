This is a classic ghost story.I won't spoil anything, but for a haunted mirror movie, I found it VERY
effective.There are only really 6 people in the film. The parents, and the
children at 2 different ages. The film is not really linear, and it
took me a while to get the flow of the constant changing from today and
yesterday. Once I got it, I found it very clever.What impressed me the most, however, is that there is hardly any blood,
no nudity, no profanity, no sex, no gore and it scared the crap out of
me!No, it doesn't reinvent the genre (can you even really do that with the
haunted mirror genre?), but it is a well crafted, well acted movie that
really kept my interest all the way through.The young girl was especially effective.The film starts off slow and methodical and really hits its stride
about the half way mark.We need more films like this. Smart, clever "little" films - a few
characters, a few props and lots of chills and thrills.Please see this!8/10
