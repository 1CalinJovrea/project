Eternal Love

In the abandoned Detroit, the depressed musician Adam (Tom Hiddleston)
lives in an old house in the middle of derelict buildings with his
musical instruments and books. Adam has been a vampire for centuries
but is tired with the fate of the world taken by wrong decisions of
mankind. He has a confidentiality agreement with Ian (Anton Yelchin)
that provides rare instruments to him and does not ask questions to
him. Adam poses of Dr. Faust and buys blood bags from Dr. Watson
(Jeffrey Wright) in nearby hospital. His wife and lover Eve (Tilda
Swinton) lives in Tangier, Morocco's, and is also a vampire. Her best
friend is "Kit" Marlowe (John Hurt) that supplies blood for her that he
buys from a French doctor. When Eve calls Adam from Tangier, she feels that he is down and she
decides to fly to Detroit to meet him. She meets Kit to say good-bye to
him and Kit tells Eve that he had a dream with her younger sister Ava
(Mia Wasikowska). Eve and Adam reunite and spend the nights making
love. Out of the blue, the wild and reckless Ava comes to Adam's house
and turns their lives upside-down. "Only Lovers Left Alive" is a stylish and original vampire movie with a
story of eternal love and music. The plot has no clich√©s and is
developed in slow pace, with charismatic characters, great performances
and entertaining dialogs. I dare to say that "Only Lovers Left Alive"
is in 2014 what "The Hunger" was in 1983. Fans of gore or conventional
vampire movies will probably not like this feature. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Amantes Eternos" ("Eternl Lovers")
