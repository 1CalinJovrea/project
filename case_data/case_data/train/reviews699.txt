How to be a successful movie in 2017: Explosions, clichés, CGI & Gerard Butler

I don't know who keeps asking movies about natural disasters, but
Independence Day: Resurgence, 2012, San Andreas, among others, proved
that it's not a very good idea. But as long as the majority likes it,
who am I to judge? OK, let's begin. Gerard Butler plays a man who saves our planet from
natural problems, storms, cold winters, with the help of a space
station, zZzZzZZzzZZz.Geostorm is so full of CGI, that at one point you start to get
headaches and you'll never understand what's behind the desire of
destroying the planet. It has something to do with the White House, I
didn't catch the idea because I felt asleep for a short period of time. If you want a film full of disasters that are also eye-candy, Geostorm
is not the best idea. The movie is the same as other disaster flicks,
nothing new. I believe the writer wrote the script in 2-3 days. If you want something mindless, with a total waste of talent, full of
clichés and loud sounds, Geostorm is the perfect choice.
