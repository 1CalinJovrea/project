Good source ruined

How can a DECAMERON TALE be rendered so lifeless, joyless and entirely
lacking in healthy bawdry. The note says that the dialog was ad libbed:
obviously, none of the cast was up to the job and fell back on insipid
comments and over reliance on variations on a common vulgar word
rendered meaningless with repetition. Somebody said that this is
supposed to be comedy in the style of Monty Python That might convince
somebody who's never paid attention to MP's inspired zaniness. I
usually have great patience with badly done movies but was bored and
walked out after 20 minutes. I know that my response to some things is
a function of age. I've been in academic classes with 20 year olds who
thought films I dismissed were simply grand. This one is simply dreck.
