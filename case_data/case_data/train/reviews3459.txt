This movie knew exactly what it was

I think people going to see this movie are expecting wayyyy to much
from a slasher movie. I'm rating it based on what I expected, and I was
certainly impressed. This movie wasn't trying to be anything more than
another murder movie, but what made me want to see it was the idea of
taking Groundhog Day (which it fully admitted to ripping the idea from)
and turning it into a slasher film. I was actually surprised it held
back on gore and blood. I was fully expecting it to be all the tropes
of gross-out killings, but it was instead focused more on character
development and the story. I admit the characters are a bit
one-dimensional, but again, it's a slasher movie. It's trying to win
any academy awards here. In many ways I think it's parodying those
one-dimensional characters of college trope characters and the "last
girl" in horror movies because it goes all-in on establishing the main
characters as somebody you're meant to hate at first. The ending
genuinely took me in a direction I didn't anticipate, and then it took
me back to what I was expecting, but did it in a way that I felt fresh.
All in all, I had fun watching this movie, which I think what this
movie was meant to be: Fun.
