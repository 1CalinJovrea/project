If You're Thinking About Seeing This Film...

...lie down until the feeling goes away!Or better yet, go rent the first three Terminator movies, watching only
the cool action moments and immediately fast-forwarding past every
scene where anyone demonstrates anything resembling personality or
acting ability. Because really, that's all this movie ever does.Seriously -- over and over again, every time sometime cool or
interesting happens in this movie, a moment's thought will remind you
that they're simply apeing a scene or shot from a prior film, and did
it better with technology from a quarter-century ago! Hell -- they even
stole the "quantum frequency matter" bit from Jim Cameron's treatment
for his proposed (but never filmed) version of "Terminator 3"!Add to that the neutering the film underwent in order to squeak into a
PG-13 rating, plus handing key roles in the story to the complete
charisma-vacuums that are Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney (how do you
even pronounce that -- does it rhyme with "die", or with "oy vey"?),
and it becomes clear that the real disaster that we need to invent a
time machine so that we can prevent it from ever happening, is this
abomination on celluloid...
