Well acted, but drawn out

I go to the movies nearly every week with a movie group.  This group of
guys is notorious for checking out every sports movie that comes along,
so when a film about Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza was announced, I
knew that this would be on the docket.And, I'm glad it was, for the most part.BLEED FOR THIS tells the remarkable true story of a Boxing Champion
who, after winning the championship, suffers a broken neck in an auto
accident.  Doctors are concerned if he 'll ever walk again.  Pazienza
is concerned with something else - will he ever fight again.  It's an incredible story, one of true "triumph of the human spirit"
that was just waiting to be told on screen and with the intense Miles
Teller in the lead role, this movie had the makings of something
special.  Joining Teller with strong performances are Katy Segal (as
his mother), the always good Ciaran Hinds (as his father) and my new
favorite actor, Aaron Eckhart, off his strong supporting performance in
SULLY , with another strong supporting performance as Pazienza's
trainer who sticks with him the whole way.With these ingredients sitting there, this film was poised to be very
good and since it was written and directed by the same person - Ben
Younger (Boiler Room) - it was going to have a very specific, personal
focus.And that's where this movie falls short.Younger, I think, fell in love with his script and was duty-bound to
put every word, every gesture, every thought on film - and this drags
it down.  We are treated to long periods of Teller, as Pazienze,
struggling, thinking and working out on his own.  Not the items that
make for great drama and by the time we get to the climactic fight at
the end of the film (name me a boxing movie that doesn't have a
climactic fight at the end of the film), I just didn't care enough
about the outcome to be excited, I just wanted it to be over.Overall, a "good enough" time.  If you enjoy sports films - and
especially if you like boxing films - then you'll like this.  If you
like fast action and stirring conflict, you might want to look
elsewhere.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)
