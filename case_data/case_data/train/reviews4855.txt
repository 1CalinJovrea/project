Forced situations, shock value & "Never go full retard."

The premise and subject for this movie gave the writers the opportunity
for an entertaining future cult film. It could have been an
entertaining political satire, the possibilities were endless.
Additionally the media attention could have made for a legendary movie.
Alas, no such luck. Lazy writing turned this film into a waste of a
good afternoon. The entire film consists of forced situations,
stupidity and shock value humour. Forced situations; When done smoothly
situational humour can be very entertaining, but here the writers seem
to have been too lazy to set up each situation smoothly. Instead they
just force each situation into existence. Full retard; Some stupidity
can often be humorous, but never go full retard. Here the main
character Dave here cannot recognize a tiger, and describes it as "a
strange big stripy orange dog". Apparently that's supposed to be funny.
Shock value humour; Shock value is seldom entertaining, and it's a
hallmark of lazy writing. When Dave isn't "going full retard" he is
yelling profanities like how his genitals smell like guacamole. Aides
from these themes there is nothing humorous in this flick. Save your
time and money, watch something else.
