Visually stunning & constant tension

The movie has a rapid pace from the first 2 minutes. You start to have
ideas of who can be the snowman and with each scene you will change
your mind. Loved the fact that it's not that easy to understand the
action with back and forth pieces of the puzzle.Not many will understand it! But those who will will appreciate how
stunning the scenes where created.
