Thank you Mr Del Toro !

This is the kind of "horror" movie that I like! Well "horror"..it's not
really scary, no violence (compared to SAW, HOSTEL, VACANCY, DESCENT
etc.), not even gore (compared to EVID DEAD 2, BRAINDEAD etc.).So what is it? A marvelous movie with beautiful picture, sets, actors
and special effects. Everything lies within the old fashioned climax,
like a clever revival of HAMMER FILMS. It's as classy as Coppola's
Dracula.. It's everything The Haunting (DeBont)and Wolfman (Johnston)
failed to be. It reminds me of the good "Woman in Black" and "Don't be
Afraid of the Dark", with Del Toro behind the camera.Well, Hammer lovers, Del Toro fans..just run to see this movie!
