Lacks the Required Grittiness

This would have been much easier to remake if the director had stayed
true to the grittiness of the original. It's stripped clean here. From
the cinematography, to the acting, the music and more, there is an
overall lack of desperation. It's as if everyone making the film has
never experienced desperation or addiction of any sort, which I know
can't be true. Even the music is inappropriate and sounds like someone
randomly picked tunes from their favorite alternative rock radio
station. The romantic subplot is mere fluff and also lacks grit from
the casting to the photography and inappropriate music making me feel
as if I was suddenly watching a romantic comedy. Why did this UCLA
beach blonde love interest work in a underground Asian owned casino?
Huh? Shouldn't she have been Asian? And what would a young college
student even see in this loser? Some choices just made no sense and
were out of date, out of context, and simply not the right tone. I
would say even Mark Wahlberg was in over his head and the role was not
the right fit for him.
