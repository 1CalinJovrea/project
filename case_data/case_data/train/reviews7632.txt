dear god what a mish mash of trash

first off let me start by saying I was looking forward to watching this
film after all the mysterious hype. the acting is forced and without
sense of direction, the structure of the film is totally confusing and
at times annoyingly so. the story line is so pretentious it is
bordering on offensive. not to give anything away the basic story is of
a couple who have uninvited guests of varying annoyance ,well that's
the films story in a nut shell. save your money and read a book from
the bible its a lot less confusing and annoying total and utter waste
of talent because these are talented actors and deserve better and so
do we.
