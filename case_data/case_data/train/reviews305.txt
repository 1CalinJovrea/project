Very original but for what audience

Well I went to see this movie last night with a friend and I think for
children under 10 the movie is to complex. The main human emotions were
very original but the movie never got me in. The story was also not
that good. I would not take my daughter to the movie and it is that my
friend liked it, otherwise I would not even have finished it. I think
this is not what we are used to from Pixar. All the other Pixar movies
were watchable for adults and children but to be honest I thought it
was pretty awful. The beginning before the movie started made me
already feel that it would not be good. I can see why some people like
it but I think there should have been a better storyline.
