See this on the big screen - it's worth it

This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more
serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this
on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move
naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from
Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been
a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other
landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread
out to accommodate the monsters.The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in
the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link
to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the
monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson
isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of
things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado
here.Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every
day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why
didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend
solid support.Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear
enough for relaying the plot through dialog.Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster
monster movie that deserves a big screen watch.
