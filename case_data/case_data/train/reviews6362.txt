A great send off for Paul

I saw this movie a couple of days after it had been released. I have
noticed over the years the Fast and Furious franchise has become more
about the action scenes (especially Fast and Furious 6) than the actual
cars and street races of the original Fast and Furious films which many
of us love. Furious 7 creates a great balance of stunts and action
whilst also focusing on the cars and the driving skills of the
characters. I feel James Wan and the writers made the correct decision
in not killing off Paul's character even though the plot had to be
changed because of his unfortunate passing. The acting was up to it's
usual good standard as in all of the movies. Great film 9/10. RIP Paul
Walker
