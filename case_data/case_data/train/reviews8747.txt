Very dark, very funny, extremely realistic

Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes) is perhaps the darkest and funniest movie
I saw in years; but is it really a comedy ?. No it is not. Six tales
about human that are obviously related to the Argentinian reality
(abusive government, corruption, people indifference) but certainly can
be applied to many other countries in the world; USA included.Telling about each tale will cut the impact and somewhat surprise of
each one. Let's just say that the outcome of each tale is sometimes
predictable; but driven by logic not clich√©s.As always happens; some histories are better than others; but even that
will be different for different viewers.In brief; an excellent movie that deserves to be seen by people with a
brain and a will to think.
