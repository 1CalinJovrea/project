Go for it, if you're a fan of psychological thrillers

One of the best psychological thrillers. This is (I think) marketed as
a horror movie, so if you want cheap jump-scares, it will be
disappointing. This is NOT a horror movie. The plot is that a married couple go out on (some kind of) vacation.
The woman is trapped terribly and must rescue herself. The story is
very intriguing and quite metaphorical. And if you don't like metaphors
at all, you will hate it. The script was good, the direction was very
good. The director has executed the metaphorical part carefully. The
storytelling, character development and the gore scenes are handled
perfectly. The gore scenes are the like the ones used in unnecessary
gore scenes of certain horror movies, and those scenes are something
that I love to thrash. But I won't in this one because it is a
compelling part of the story. Actors have given fine performances,
especially Carla Gugino and Chiara Aurelia. To sum it up, it is a very nice movie. *** SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT **** THE ABOVE PART IS SPOILER FREE ****
THESE ARE MORE OF EXPLANATION, RATHER THAN SPOILER REVIEW **** THE
SCENES DESCRIBED MAY NOT BE AS PER THE SEQUENCE IN THE STORY ****This is actually more of a character study rather than a thriller. The couple are on a vacation to spice up their marriage and on the way
to their destination, they find a scavenging and starving dog and the
woman tries to feed him, but the husband prevents it from happening.
Then, they go for a physical relationship and for which, the woman is
handcuffed on both sides of the bed. Then, after some harsh exchange of
words, the husband dies with a heart attack, leaving the woman in the
"handcuffed position". There is nobody to help her and is trapped. And,
she has to rescue herself. Now, from this point on, the movie starts to get metaphorical and more
of a character study of the woman. So, this is a psychological thriller
as well as a great character study. She sees the same dog, now, feeding
upon her husband's corpse. Then, the husband gets up, and shouts at her
and calls her a "life support for a f**king c**t", for not saving his
life. This is actually her guilt for not being able to save her. Then,
the tensions and conflict begin to build within her mind, the
"positive" thoughts being represented by her own imagery and the
"negative" ones by the husband's imagery. Then, all of a sudden, the
husband calls her "mouse", something that her dad used to call her.
Then, she remembers the incident during her late childhood, of being
raped by her father while watching a solar eclipse and she promised to
keep it a secret. This is in her dreams I guess. This part establishes
the character of the woman. The memories she can't suppress during
tension. Also, she sees a strange looking guy, referred to as "death". Her
husband tells it will come for her, and her imagery says you can get
away, both metaphorically. There is a scene, where she talks with her
young being about the secrets and not to hide it. Metaphorically, a
self promise. Also, the red "eclipse" sequences are the metaphorical
representation of her terrible past and are mostly a part of her dream.
The dog is also (somewhat) a metaphorical representation of a man. The
dog searching for fresh flesh means the man searches for a younger lady
for physical relationship, no matter who she is. The "death" is
haunting her even after she rescues herself. She then realizes that he
was no spirit or "death" but a disfigured cannibal who eventually
spared her, towards the end. The handcuffs are also somewhat a metaphor
to she getting married and her father asking her to keep the secret. All of these were executed very carefully and properly. The scene I described is the one where she breaks the glass and rips
her skin to get out of the handcuffs. The scene is ultimately gore, but
unlike in many movies, it was necessary.
