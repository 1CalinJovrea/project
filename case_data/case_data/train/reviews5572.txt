Dull, boring, unimaginative, just watch 'The Exorcist'

'The Possession' was incredibly boring, I found myself almost falling
asleep. The film's dull, unimaginative and has no substance whatsoever.
The film is cliché and really just took too long to 'get into it' and
by the time it did I had already lost interest. The acting is the only
good part about this film really, apart from the Jewish guy who was
hard too take seriously (you'll see what I mean). The editing is the
most annoying thing about this film; it's very choppy and unorganised.
The film will have an incredibly loud scene which will then cut to a
silent scene and then a cliché horror movie soundtrack plays, this
annoyed me so much. It probably happened over five times. Also the film
isn't even scary, which really does just say it all, honestly I
wouldn't bother with 'The Possession' it's dull and lifeless, you're
better off watching the actual Exorcist.
