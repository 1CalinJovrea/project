Ran out of ideas

Lets get this straight, I had low expectations for every single one of
these films, but was pleasantly surprised each time by the first three.
Not particularly inspired stories, but great script and performances
all round. This one felt, almost from the first scene, like the writers
had already used every idea they had and none of the actors really
wanted to be there. The teenagers were annoying, imagine Sweet Valley
High annoying, the new characters were not needed and were so poorly
acted, they'd have been better off leaving their scenes blank, and I
mean a fews seconds of blank white screen with no sound blank, it was
that bad. The only exception was granny, although she was fairly
annoying, but at least she was intended to be. The worst part was the
idea, lets include some pirates, cause their in fashion. When they
first appeared I hoped they were just a quick nod to the genre and move
on, but no, they occupied almost the entire second half of the story.
In my opinion the first three films were so good because despite the
inherent need to add new characters with each new sequel, they centred
on the main characters who made the original so successful. Basically
put, more Sid, less teenagers.
