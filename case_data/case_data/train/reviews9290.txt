A Fantastic Apocalypse

A little late with this review. I saw this the weekend it came out but
did not have time for a review until now. The world's end marks the
third film in Nick and Simon's trilogy. This time around the boys are
battling an army of killer robots. Simon and Nick have switched roles
for this film in which Simon plays the bumbling idiot. Simon recruits
his old high school friends to conquer an epic night of drinking that
they failed to do years prior, however now everyone is grown up except
for Simon's character who still lives in the past. However they soon
realize the town has been taken over by a sinister robot army. Basically if you enjoyed either Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz you will
love this film. Hot Fuzz is my favourite comedy of all time so far,
however i would rank this movie right up there with Shaun of the dead.
The humour in this film is very subtle compared to their previous two
films. They try some new things with this film and the result is a
crazy mass effect inspired ending. This is a great film to end the
summer, and while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it will surely
be a cult classic in time.Rating: 8/10
