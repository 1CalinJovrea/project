Good in action but same old, same old plot

Okay, Wonder Woman is now a huge success and not only that but the new
front of the DCEU. The action is spectacular, the fighting is nice but
what this movie fails in is the loopholes of the plot. Ares was cast
down by Zeus and the Amazonians were isolated into a tropical paradise
yet we are not clearly given a connection between the two incidents as
to why. Then, we get a lousy plot about how Wonder Woman leaves of to
London just because she thinks Ares is the reason for the war. Diana's
mother confides with someone else to not tell Diana that she is a god
killer, but this is said when she leaves so what's the point? Then
starts a typical war story where the heroes win a battle, then again
see innocents die because of a man's mistake and the man sacrificing
himself so the other's can live. Okay I get that they were trying to
make him a hero but come on, this is it? The plot stinks... so many
typical plot points are used uselessly to bring out a stubborn biopic
of a god, at least the scenes are interconnected but other than that
its useless. It's not BvS bad but it's near Fantastic Four bad...
Definitely another DC movie to evade, not different from Suicide Squad
when it comes to clich√©s..
