good entertainment, but certainly a chick flick

I took my girlfriend to see this, mostly as she cant miss a love story
film.... she wasn't disappointed with this. She loved every minute of
it. As a male, I thought it was a bit wet, but still enjoyed it. Hough
was an easy actress to watch, not only pretty, but accomplished at her
art. This was seemingly written for her girlish look and persona. The
scenery and cinematography were nothing short of amazing... Locations
were perfect, id live there in a heartbeat.... Duhamal was frankly
excellent in this role too, he played his part perfectly, and was the
perfect choice for this film.The script was given a twist, and I sat through most of the film not
quiet sure what was going to happen next, it definitely kept me
intrigued, although I found it a little slow at a few points, i still
walked away liking the film as a whole.Definitely worth going to see, certainly on the big screen, as the
locations were amazing....
