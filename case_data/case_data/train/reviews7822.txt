One of the worst movies

I love Harry Potter and I enjoyed to watch every movie about this
beautiful universe. But after watching this film, I felt violated. The
only connection with the original HP was the opening title with the
famous HP melody. The rest of the movie was a complete incomprehensible
mess. Not only the plot was bad, but the whole acting of this amazing
cast looked fake and unprofessional. I couldn't stand seeing frozen
face of Eddie Redmayne for two hours, who never looked in the eyes of
his companions during the talk and was always smiling. His crash,
Katherine Waterston was a gray mice, can't remember much of her. Her
sister (Alison Sudol) was beyond fake. Thanks god there was a funny
muggle Dan Fogler who saved me from falling asleep. The appearance of
Jonny Depp was quite ridiculous. Dude, go retire, please.This movie contains too much of special effects, that was absolutely
unnecessary and it didn't help at all. I can not understand why it has
such a high rating and why there are so many people who loved it. Then
again, Brexit and Donald Trump, what do you want from the mass...I do not recommend it even for a home screening. Peace and love.
