The Bull Does it Again!

And I will wager you will love it.Like all love stories, good and bad, it is predictable. And like all
love stories good, it makes you laugh, chuckle, and tear-up just enough
to leave you with a warm feeling at the end of it all.The voice acting is good and the direction is crisp and the dear Del
Toro was awesomely impressive and proves that he still has that pizazz
that makes his movies so anticipated.A lovely animated parable that hits all the sweet spots with a couple
of really soul stirring songs (one is during the end credits).And, here is one more line for IMDb to accept the review :)
