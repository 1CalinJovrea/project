Have mercy!!

One of the worst movies i have ever seen. One hour later after the
movie started, my wife smiled at me and said she was sorry for dragging
me to that movie. I like watching these kind of movies with the company
of my wife, but not this time. A few minutes before the end, i had the
feeling that the film turned to thriller, but the end was so.... I
mean, come on guys!!! Sofia (Coppola), what the hell!
