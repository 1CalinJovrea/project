Total Disappointment overall

I can go on and on about how disappointing this movie really is, I am
very upset I spent a full 2 hours and 14 minutes watching this
overdrawn slavery documentary. I will start by saying I only gave this
movie an overall rating of a 2 because of the acting, it would be a 1
without it, and would be a 3 if Brad Pitt didn't ruin it with his
Inglorious Bastards accent(he honestly cant change it? and has to be
the hero in a movie he produced, ridiculous).So this movie is clearly just another slavery movie showing how bad
slaves were mistreated, as if everyone doesn't already know. Yes you
feel bad for Solomon throughout the movie but who cares, he had his
freedom and then got it back!!! what about all the other slaves who
suffered an entire lifetime, from birth until death, no, instead lets
focus on one man because he wrote a book about his struggles. The
director, Steve McQueen is in fact a Drama Queen. Seriously did we need
that sad music as if we were watching the Titanic sink again. More than
half of the movie are scenes of someones face(usually Solomons)With his
glossy eyes and depressing music playing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who has already learned or
heard about slavery, yes it was wrong, yes it was brutal. But most
everyone already knows that. It seems almost as if this movie was
created to rile people up and again create hate, especially in the
minds of younger viewers.
