The Limehouse Golem: A Victorian who-dun-it

Story of catching a serial killer. Set in the late 19thC in a dark
smoggy Victorian London, this is in the time before Jack the Ripper.
This is a murder, mystery, crime, drama. Cert15 due to graphic gory
violence, but probably should have been a C18 in my opinion. Bill Nighy does a really good job of playing himself (again) Â– this
time his character is Detective Inspector Killdare, he's been
especially brought in to investigate the murders, although he's also
aware that he's probably being setup to fail. There are 2 simultaneous intertwined plots, 1 - piecing together the
evidence to catch the killer and 2 - following the trial of Lizzie, who
is in court for the murder of her husband. Killdare is there determined
to prove her innocence. To keep you on your toes, all the possible suspects are slowly
introduced and we see numerous 30 second clips of each performing the
murders, everyone a possible perpetrator!This is a well-made film with great production design and great
costumes, though Alan Rickman would have been a 100% better Killdare.
