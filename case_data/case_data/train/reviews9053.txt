'Interstellar'

'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were
all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen
in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a
little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some
parts that were definitely in the "fi" part of sci-fi. But the thing
is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about.
We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would
be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's
fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea
what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent
writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will
no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent,
though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films
('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score
was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all,
'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is
Nolan's most beautiful film to date.
