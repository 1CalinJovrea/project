Useless movie but very good lots of gore

This movie could not have been made and it would not have made any
difference honest, it brings absolutely nothing new to the Texas
chainsaw legacy.Its far better then the last 2, i was very surprised at the graphic
violence and the gore, this is the most gory TCM of the series.Now i don't know who writes these movies but they should get there act
together, Leather face went from wearing human skin mask because of
2003 skin disease, 1974 he was mental and now 2017 because he got
disfigured by a bullet......Also where was the family cop that we see in all the movies? they sort
of edited him out, and last but not least the family always changes
with new member so its kind of weird from one movie to the other.This movie should be seen as pure entertainment if you like gore and
graphic violence this as it all the people in this movie are all sick
and as expected no one survives and the justice is never truly seen.
