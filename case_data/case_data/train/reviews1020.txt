Wait am I in the Right Theater?

The thing I found out (to my dismay) that I did not know before going
to the theater was that a lot of this movie was shot in the long
over-used and abused "home movie/shaky cam" format. If I had come in
the theater in the middle of the movie, I might have assumed I had
accidentally wandered into the 7th, or whatever, sequel to Paranormal
Activity. And to add insult to injury M Night is about 8 years late to
the party for that trick. Or was it suppose to be some type of irony or
mocking of the standard horror movie fare? Perhaps this once creative
director has finally succumbed to audience expectations --if all you
want is cookie cutter, unimaginative, thematically barren, shaky cam,
scary movies then here you go...... Another let down for me was that in his earlier movies there were
always a number of positive sub-themes running through the movies that
I found as interesting, if not more so, than the obvious scary movie
theme. I failed to find any such redeeming parallel plot lines in The
Visit. Again maybe he is just simplifying his movies to match his
audience's wishes.On the upside, I did find this movie to be something of an improvement
over his most recent efforts. There were a few good chuckles. There
were a couple of OK jump scenes. There was some tension here and there,
but overall still a disappoint for me. Of course, I eventually liked The Village and Signs a lot better after
I had watched them several times on DVD. Maybe there is a jewel in the
rough hiding here, just waiting to be found. Rating a 5.5 of 10 on
first impression though.
