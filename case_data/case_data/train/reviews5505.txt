Boring, empty and forgettable

A very boring, empty and forgettable movie. The characters are
caricatures that do not instill empathy, anger or admiration. There
came a time when I did not care one bit if the hero and the girl
finished devoured by giant. And then, when a character dies there in
the middle of the film, and others cry under their symbolic grave, I
could not care less. The film did not offer enough time for to know
better that character, and so, I can't have felt sorry for him.Moreover, the only female character throughout history is just a
"damsel in distress" - In other words, a useless woman - and this movie
is 2013, which shows how uninspired and unoriginal this film is.Here the giant creatures are one-dimensional, no depth, and too stupid
villains to gain some kind of reverence to the public. What the hell
was the giant rip-off "Gollum of two heads"? It was supposed to be
funny? It was supposed to be scary? And why the hell there are only
male giant? How the hell they reproduce? How they emerged as society
with only males? Why are there no giant children?Yes, if they wanted to show many giants, not just one, they should have
been concerned about these simple questions. As we see, this film is so
weak that not bothered to bring a credible society to the viewer. This
movie It's very bullshit, even for children.
