Jam & Jelly. Gripping stuff.

The first film was genius. Everyone loves the bad guys, & there were
plenty of them in the first film. Squid gun.. Oh Yeah! But this film
not only had no purpose, but it destroyed the personality of ALL the
characters. It starts off rather promising, with the mystery crime taking place. A
giant magnet? Genius idea! They could have gone somewhere with the
technology of that concept. Stealing the Eiffel Tower, ships at see,
Rockets & weapons. But we never see or hear of it again. We don't even
know who the villain is until the film is almost over. The first film
was bold, edgy, had great ideas about the style of being bad. And Gru
was a mad genius who was different, self aware, & refused to conform.
He took advantage of how dumb other humans were, & he had a deep
passion for his concepts. ALL that is gone in this film, & he is
reduced to a bumbling idiot, desperate to get hitched. He is made to
look a fool by an annoying woman from the start, & everyone just makes
fun of him for the rest of the film. The eldest girl was smart, mature,
responsible & lovable in the first film. In this film, she leaves her
two youngest sisters on their own in a mall to go & have it off with a
young boy who was taken straight out of the book of clichés. That's
what this film is.. one long list of endless clichés. It's an insult to
all who made the first film so intelligent & unique. It was a clever
spy mad professor movie. I hate how it has been reduced to a soap opera
chick flick. It puzzles me how this film has such a high rating. I suspect that IMDb
is now fixing ratings for promotion techniques. And can no longer be
trusted. Either that, or people have lost their standards today. After
all, the films being made today are the worst kind of disposable trash
imaginable. This one is no exception. AVOID.
