Made Me Write My First Review!

What a beautiful, beautiful movie, what an amazing story, and what an
amazing man. I was hesitant to watch it at first, I read some reviews before I
watched it, all positive, but even when I started watching, I didn't
expect it to be this good! Boy, am I glad I decided to watch it, it
honestly just made my day. I really loved it. It says "comedy" in the
description, and I thought it would be more of a drama, but this man's
life sure had funny moments. It's funny, heartwarming, and plain
inspiring. There are some goosebumps-moments in there. The main actor
did a splendid job, half way through the movie he started looking like
the real Paul Potts, that's how good he is. The director did a
fantastic job too. All-in-all, it's a fun watch, even if it's not your
type of movies, you'd like it. It makes you think, how a simple
everyday man's life, can have so much adventure, and so much to be said
about it. It's a story about a dream, about following that dream, and about
reaching that dream.So what's with the 6-star rating? VERY underrated.
