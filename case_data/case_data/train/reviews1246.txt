Disappointing

I really really wanted to like Frances Ha. . . indie film, good
critical reviews, black-and-white homage to Manhattan/Woody Allen,
something different from the usual summer blockbuster movie fare. . .my
wife and I left the theater feeling flat, however. Greta Gerwig does a
fine job acting as Frances and portrays the malaise of young adults
trying to find their way in life quite accurately, but. . .it's just
not that funny, people. A comedy needs to have more laughs, and a drama
needs to have more compelling characters and more action. I've not seen
the TV series "Girls" which this is being compared to, but it does have
the flat failed sitcom gestalt, the one that lasts half a season before
cancellation. Caveat emptor, folks.
