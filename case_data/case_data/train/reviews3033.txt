Good looking movie with unbelievable plot and mediocre characters

The Good:Believable, big budget special effects. Some decent jump scares and
squirm-in-your-seat horror.The Bad:The characters were generic and boring. The acting was often spotty and
not consistent with the situation (more poor direction than bad acting
I think). The Martian creature came from the soil on Mars where it had
to hibernate to survive, yet it could survive freezing cold, burning
heat, no oxygen, space vacuum and everything else the crew could throw
at it. And it pretty much ate everything (including cooling fluid).
Lazy science to aid lazy plot sequences.The Ugly:Unrealistic behavior from professional astronauts and scientists. Every
scene seemed to be a result of a poor decision putting the crew at
risk. Everything seemed predictable and there was little-to-no tension.Unlike the brilliant Alien - where you felt the protagonist (Ripley)
and crew did everything right, yet fell victim to a horrifyingly
believable alien (except for Ripley and the cat of course) - the crew
in Life pretty much seemed to randomly do things, forget things, then
remember things, and generally make the worst of the situation, while
terrorized by the "super-alien-jellyfish" thing. I spent most of the
movie thinking "wait... what? why?". Mediocre film from a mediocre
Director.
