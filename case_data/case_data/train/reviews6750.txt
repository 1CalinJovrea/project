I must be missing the point somewhere???

This movie was built up to be one of the best of the year. It couldn't
have fallen shorter in my opinion!From the first minute of the film you are subjected to people shouting
at each other with some scenes incomprehensible! The sheer chaos of the
dialog and filming was enough to make me physically ill to watch (my
wife couldn't even sit through the entire film).There was a thin story line with Cooper being obsessed with getting
back together with his wife after leaving mental health care, but this
story was both unbelievable and uncomfortable! She has taken out a
restraining order on Cooper (Pat) and yet the police officer who comes
to each scene seems to do nothing and leave with no real purpose in the
story. If you are looking to see a movie with lighthearted humor and great
acting (as we are led to believe by the trailer and reviews) the AVOID
AT ALL COSTS!!! 1 out of 10 for the dancing.
