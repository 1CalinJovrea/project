Complete Hilarity........

I absolutely LOVE this movie! I am stunned that people are rating it so
low. I found it very entertaining and was surprised at how much I
laughed. Just when I thought it had hit the funniest point and would
slow down it got funnier. All of the characters were perfectly
portrayed in my opinion.You have your lying sneaky guy who has a great
wife whose soul purpose in life is to support his career. The
girlfriend who just adores him is clueless he is married. Someone plans
a big surprise and the roller-coaster of hilarity begins. I won't give
away any of it but if you miss this one you are doing yourself a
disfavor!!! The antics the characters engulf themselves in are such a
riot. The scenery is great. Every situation so well planned out this
movie ..in my opinion..is simply flawless.Keep your remote handy because you will laugh so hard you'll need to
rewind to catch something else that just happened it is DEFINITELY a
MUST SEE!
