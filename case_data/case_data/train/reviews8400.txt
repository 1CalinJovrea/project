Oh dear...

What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation but
this is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthy
successor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time if
there was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors were
moving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. As
for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of
replicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human body
from scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thought
introducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. I
could go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother.
