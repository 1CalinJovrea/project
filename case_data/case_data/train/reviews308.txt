Not the very best!!

Having watched the Child's Play series from the beginning. This one to
me seemed a little off from the original. The plot was somewhat
mugged-up if I may say. If you're a fan of the series, then my advice
would be to skip this one, as it is not that intuitive as the rest.
After the first 3 franchise, it seems the movie has moved from a
standard horror melodrama to a bloated gore experience. Good for casual
watch.
