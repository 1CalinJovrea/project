Very tense & makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I say B+.

"It was supposed to be easy. I take over ship, get paid, no one gets
hurt." In 2009 a Somali named Muse (Abdi) is in trouble and needs to
get money for his boss fast or face the consequences. His plan is to
hijack a cargo ship and hold it ransom until he gets his money. When he
boards a ship captained by Rich Phillips (Hanks) he thinks he found his
answer to his problems, but things only get worse for all involved.
This is a true story. It's always more fun to watch a movie that is
also a true story and even better when you see one that you remember
the events when it was happening. As far as the movie goes it starts
off pretty slow but grows more and more tense as it goes on. As great
an actor as Tom Hanks is I found myself thinking that this is really a
part that many people could pull off. Then I watched the last 20
minutes and realized why they got Hanks. Much like the movie Apollo 13,
when you watch a movie that you know how it ends but still end up
shedding a tear it is because of great filmmmaking. This falls into
that category. A movie that builds momentum the entire time. Starts off
slow but by the end you are hoping for more. I liked it. Overall, tense
and makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates
were really evil or not. I give it a B+.
