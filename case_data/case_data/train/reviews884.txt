Bad scripting, bad choose of actors

The scripting of the father being shot is so bad. Why couldn't a bear
bite him or something similar to really make it look dangerous, but
instead a funny and pathetic gun accident. The son was nothing like his
dad, he is not the kind of actor to actually hunt some animals. Why
would the dad have to die on the end, that's just really sad man, they
could've made it alive. It was a nice act and pretty cool scenes, but i
didn't enjoy the movie at all.
