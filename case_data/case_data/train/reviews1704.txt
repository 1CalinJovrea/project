Somewhat overrated

I usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy
Story being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me.
There's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics
are what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the
humour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole
film had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The
ending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it
based on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if
I don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the
'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children
commented on this.
