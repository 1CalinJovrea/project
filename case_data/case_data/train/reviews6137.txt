The Critics are Wrong

Book of Henry (2017) The tale concerns a plan hatched by a young genius
to save the girl next door from abuse. His mother takes on his plan
when his health deteriorated. Critical reviews have been bad, claiming
it just didn't know what it wanted to be. Even so, the general publics
reviews have been quite different, with many enjoying it. I actually
enjoyed this film for the most part. Critics shouldn't be excessively
hard on films like this. If they do, the film industry will continue to
churn out the same old cookie cutter films with profit motives
completely overtaking good story telling. Sure, this film needed to be
tightened up a slight bit. It may have tried to be too much.
Adaptations are difficult, you have to nail it, for it to work. Still,
I don't believe this film completely botched it either. They attempted
to tell this story through multiple styles. They just fell a little
short of the mark. Give this one a chance. If you aren't enjoying it,
you can always turn it off.
