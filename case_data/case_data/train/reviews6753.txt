awful

Fortunately I didn't take my girlfriend to see this mess because I got
up and left an hour into it and had she gone with me it would've been
twice as much a waste of money. The movie is just a lame reenactment of
some of the original Stooges' shtick but adding in a bunch of insults
towards Catholicism and "updating" the routines with more scatological
references than could've been done by the original Stooges. And
Jennifer Hudson, an Oscar winner, consented to be in this mess? Most of the anti-Catholic bashing is done by Larry David who is Sister
Mary-Mengele (ha ha! Let's name a nun after a Nazi war criminal!). The
Farrelly Brothers have had a lot of success with past movies like
"Shallow Hal" and "Me, Myself & Irene" but they might've run themselves
out of the business with this dreck.
