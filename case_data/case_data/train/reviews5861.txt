What was going on in there

I am giving it a 4 rating because i really don't know what the hell was
going on or what that movie wanted to be.When you have scary movies like Annabelle creation and the Conjuring
that scare the bejesus out of you.I understand it was made by the people who made beetle juice, which is
more dark comedy then horror, etc.First off what was the Sheriff daughter doing living with that family
instead of him and is wife? lots of weird stuff.The story as been done a zillion times but why did those spirits come
back from the dead to take revenge? was that place a special place?
haunted? In part this movie makes no sense at all, the special effects
where very good but the rest was confusing.The acting was very good too.
