Beautiful and Deeply Touching

I don't usually write a review, but I feel compelled to defend this
film against critics who, I feel, have unfairly given it a low rating.
While its premise is not necessarily unique and it has its fair share
of clich√©s, The Judge is a deeply moving film that showcases the acting
powerhouse that is Robert Duvall and the undeniable versatility and
magnetic screen presence of Robert Downey Jr. There are also strong
supporting performances from Vera Farmiga (she and RJD have great
chemistry), Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Jeremy Strong. I
dare anyone who has dealt with family issues not to be affected. Forget
the critics - they don't know everything - and do yourself a favour and
watch The Judge. You won't regret it.
