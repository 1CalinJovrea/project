Love triangles are always a hard sell, but you may like it.

Love triangles are always a hard sell, but you may like it; I can say I
managed to get past the hang-up I have with the idea, though I did like
the sex scenes with Blake Lively. There are no real good guys in this
movie, unless you romanticize drug dealers. If you do, then the movie
to see is the 2001 movie Blow with Johnny Depp; I've seen just about
all the drug dealing based movies and few come close to it. Getting
back to Savages, I have to say that despite a not so original scenario,
the movie keeps the pace upbeat enough and has sufficiently interesting
scenes to garner a slightly better than average rating (by average I
mean a 6). I watched it to the end and to be honest, it was because Benicio Del
Toro played a supporting role. For some reason, I watch all the movies
he plays in even if half have been a disappointment; the good ones seem
to make up for the bad ones. I have nothing much to say about Travolta
anymore, not until he starts acting; he hasn't since Primary Colors,
though he's had a bunch of terrific parts that made him look good. In
this movie, you may realize that Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Taylor Kitsch
who play the two lead men are talented enough. I recommend it if have
the time and watch an inordinate number of movies; if you don't, you
can skip it.
