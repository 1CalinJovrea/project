The rating must be a joke, one of the worst films in years

I rarely write reviews it's been ages since the last one but am writing
this to vent out some frustration. To think this film currently has a
6.3 rating and generally favourable reviews elsewhere is really
strange. There is booze, sex and drugs but you need something of
substance to make even a half decent film, this doesn't even come
close.Acting is poor, girls are largely annoying and there is nothing
happening whatsoever, it makes no sense, it just dwells on the over
importance of spring break, there is no character development and it's
a total waste of time, I was bored. It plods along pointlessly for an
hour gets decent for 10 minutes and finishes off with a meaningless
ending.I haven't seen After Earth and yes it may be disappointing but it will
never be this bad, it's a shame a film like that would get such bad
reviews, I mean at least they have tried something, Spring Breakers
doesn't even do that, the plot has more holes than a string vest.If I was to think about a top 10 worst films list this would most
likely be on it, it is definitely one of the worst I have seen in years
I would have gave it a 1 but it does have a catchy soundtrack for the
younger crowd, some scenes are well shot and James Franco does pretty
well for his part which does however start becoming repetitive like
everything else due to the poor script. Very overrated not everyone
will agree but I'm sure some will, especially if they have seen or
watch after this review.
