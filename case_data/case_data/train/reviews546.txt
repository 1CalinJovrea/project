Did I see the same Collateral Beauty movie?

My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the reviewers.
I thought the acting was excellent, the story asked some questions, the
theatre audience chuckled in the right places and people were carrying
their tissues as they left the movie. So I guess for audiences (at
least the audience I watched this with) - a success. Of course this
more sensitive category of movie lays itself open for cynicism and I
would not go to see this with a bunch of mates, but with this type of
movie I try to sit back and let it gently flow. And it flowed nicely
for my wife and I. And we were rewarded with what we thought was an
excellent, satisfying ending. If Need For Speed is your favorite
franchise this is not for you. But I would give it a chance if I were
you, it's a better movie that some of the other reviewers claim but get
the tissues ready.
