A film for pubescent teens

Watched half and gave up. Not sure who the target audience was? Seems
like the plot and the script/lines were put together quickly. Why film
makers seem to think that if they get some actors that get really well
paid- this will be enough to carry a film, i just don't know. Its not
easy to make a good comedy,i think, and its lazy to make a crap one
like this. It's just another dick/vagina movie that maybe they hoped
teens going through puberty might like. Life is too short to watch junk
films. Please spend more on paying people to write well and funny
lines. Melissa Mc is just another Adam Sandler type of character who
needs to be retired after 10 minutes.
