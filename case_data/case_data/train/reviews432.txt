Gives Silent Hill a bad name. (spoilers).

DO NOT make another Silent Hill Movie Ever.... Revelations was so
bad.... you are better off making movies that are not silent hill
because you cant even begin to come close to what Silent Hill really
is.... And DO NOT take Silent Hill 2's story and turn it into one of
your piece of crap movies.... YOU ARE BUTCHERING THE SERIES!!! You have
literally ruined one of my favorite video game series. And if you dare
try to introduce Your Harry Mason character into the Silent Hill 2
Story as James Sunderland and make Harrys Non existent wife as Mary
Sunderland You will literally upset every Silent Hill Fan in the
World... You had to have seen what happened when they Made the HD
remake of Silent Hill 2 and screwed up the voice acting.... The Fans
will be on your case. Also don't connect Travis Grady to a story that
he doesn't even belong to. Also one more thing... If Murphy Pendleton
is on that Prisoner Escort Bus.... I will literally flip out...Sincerely from one of Silent Hills greatest FansMichael Harbin
