A brave and beautiful delight.

Breathtakingly original. THIS is what I want in a movie. Takes you by
the scruff of the neck and drags you non-stop, from lush Korean forests
to dark and grimy torture chambers.It snuck up on me. Lulled me into an understated, Disneyfied stupor.
But there is so much more to this move. (I may even renew my Netflix
subscription based on it).I see many complaining about the ham acting of Tida and Jake... but
their caricatures serve to emphasize the understated Mija. It is a
cultural contrast as well as a social commentary on the all American
way of greed is good and the truth is whatever the men with the deepest
pockets say it is. Maybe these lampoons ARE how quieter cultures see
Americans? And there are no pretty platitudes to tie it up. We are left feeling
helpless, hopeless and not at all happily ever after. Can we in good
conscience, rejoice in the freedom of one giant pig (and piglet), while
the rest are tragically left behind to be slaughtered?Opens up many more questions than it answers. A conversation starter. A
meat-lovers emetic. A brave and beautiful delight.
