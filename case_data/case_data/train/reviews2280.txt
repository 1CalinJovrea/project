One of the most important movies of the year, and rightfully so.

In this politically heated year of 2016, the release of two films give
voice to American heroes-13 Hours, Michael Bay's film about the battle
of Benghazi; and Snowden, about controversial whistleblower Edward
Snowden who is currently a fugitive in hiding. I am proud to say that
Oliver Stone, of Platoon and JFK fame, delivers justice to the story;
and it's one of the best movies of 2016.Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays Edward Snowden. In two or three scenes;
Snowden is strapped to a high tech lie detector, he is asked the
question "Is America the greatest country in the world?" to which he
replies yes. This is what drives Edward throughout the movie, as he
transitions from Special Forces dropout to CIA computer analyst. He
works on various assignments across the country and learns the means
that the Government uses to intrude on the privacy of the American
people. He also has a relationship with Lindsay Mills; who loves social
media but is also affected and disturbed by Edward's paranoia and
resentment towards the Government. She's also the most static character
in the film, and she should've been given closure considering her real
life counterpart is standing by Snowden today.The ending is spectacular and delivers it's message without being
overly sentimental. All the important characters are relevant and
brilliantly acted by the likes of Rhys Ifans, Nicolas Cage, Tom
Wilkinson, Zachary Quinto, etc. The film features excellent
cinematography with good use of color schemes in various scenes to make
it's universe feel like our own.Snowden is a thrilling and entertaining Drama that is crucially
important for people living in America today. Always questioning
authority, and standing up for what's right.Grade-A.
