Gyllenhaal is perfect !

I went to see this movie without really knowing its pitch or genre.
Increasingly, I feel this is the best way to enjoy a feature film, as
trailers reveal more and more of the story, going as far as basically
spoiling major plot points and leaving nothing to the imagination. A
movie trailer should reveal as little as possible but still tease your
interest. Good trailers are works of art in their own right : they have
their own story and may even use footage that won't appear in the
finished movie.Anyway, all I knew about "Demolition" was that it tells the story of a
guy who has to cope with the loss of his wife and, because of that
title, I supposed that he was going to loose his mind and that his life
was slowly going to spiral out of control. Kind of like 1993's "Falling
Down" with Michael Douglas.While it is true that there is a fair bit of demolition (literally) and
quirkiness involved, ultimately this movie is about a man
deconstructing his life, demolishing his prejudices in order to find
his true self. Once again, Gyllenhaal truly inhabits his character and
delivers a remarkable performance, almost as good as his Oscar-worthy
role in "Nightcrawler" (which was inexplicably snubbed by the Academy).
Gyllenhaal is slowly becoming one of the most talented actors in
Hollywood these days! Although the rest of the cast is quite good --
especially the young Judah Lewis -- I'm not sure this film would have
worked without him.All in all, a strange yet interesting film. 7 out of 10.
