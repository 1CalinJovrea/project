Yet again a musical, but not indicated

This is getting extremely tedious from Disney. Neither in the trailer,
nor the description is it indicated that this movie is a musical! I
detest musicals with a passion. I am not saying musicals are bad not
enjoyable, by others, however I HATE, absolutely HATE them. Yet only
Disney does not indicate clearly that their movies are musicals. The
other one was Frozen.
