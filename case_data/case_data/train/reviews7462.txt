Clich√© and underdeveloped

There was no plot twist although there were several places for a plot
twist. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. Also, the break from
the period setting to give modern values with no point. The
introduction of a sister to Brad Pitt's character, who is openly a
lesbian. This would NEVER happen in the 1940s as homosexuality was
against the law and they were greatly disdained by the public. It is a
completely pointless distraction from the period setting. Another goof,
German Army officers wearing Nazi armbands. I was beginning to think
Quinton Tarantino made this movie. Another example of how Hollywood
cannot make a period movie without sabotaging their own production.
