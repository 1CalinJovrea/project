A fun and action-packed sequel!

I loved the first Kingsman movie. The over the top action, the comedy
and of course the (main) characters. So I was really excited for this
movie. And does it live up?Yeah! It's not a masterpiece of any kind but it's a great sequel and
actually how I wanted it. It has the same vibe as the original but
simultaneity adds new elements to the table. Exactly how a sequel
should be done! But how does it hold up to the original?Well, the characters has much more to them in this movie and it does
have some emotional scenes. However I did feel the villain was kinda
weak. Valetine whilst the way he talked was kinda annoying, actually
had some charm. I did not feel like the new one had. Instead it's more
of a over-the top villain you find in the James Bond movies. However I
think it's better to have main characters with depth and a villain
without instead of having the opposite. So they are pretty equal but
The Golden Circle is slightly better.Overall I think it's a great movie. If you want a goofy, fun movie with
great action and humor I do really recommend it. If you're going into
this movie expecting a masterpiece I think you will be somewhat
disappointed. But if you're just going into the movie just have some
fun, I think you will!8/10
