A rational plot that is very realistic

No irony in the above. The irrational and immensely stupid human
reactions are more than realistic, and paint a bleak future while also
explaining why we are stuck here today. People are scared of human
evolution and advancement, and do their utmost to prevent them from
happening. Think of religion or populistic yet unreasonable laws that
are based on religion or similarly unfounded assumptions. This film is great, the possibilities outlined are very real, and those
hurring it down have absolutely no knowledge of science and have no
imagination as to what the future may realistically hold. I would expect that Transcendence will do better in countries where
there is more critical thinking, such as Japan or most of Europe.
