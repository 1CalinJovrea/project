Amazing film and this is coming from someone who may face the same fate

I loved this yet I was already very aware of Snowden's actions. I do
believe this was dumbed down a trickle but that is always the case with
these kinds of Docos/Film/Series but that was quite minimal in this. My
summery comes from being a hacker for 10+ years. I have worked high up
in government sectors for cryptography, steganography, cyber warfare
and much more. I have pending cases for the courts on my cyber
espionage on the 13th of April 2017. I am not afraid... You are afraid
is you lie or show immorality. What I released was to help the world
and contains no degrees of deception so why be scared? I think this
film really hit my soul as a hacktivist for so long, I found myself
laughing and breaking down crying! Anyone who seeks freedom of
information will love this. The message I always follow is People
should never be afraid of their government... The government should
shed fear from the people. Cicada 3301 ops signing out. Peace everyone!
