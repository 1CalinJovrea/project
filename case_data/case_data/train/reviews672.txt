It's like 2 different movies

This was the strangest movie I've seen in a while. The beginning is
?close to an hour? of some AMAZING flight crash sequence scenes. The
rest of the movie is about a man's fight with alcohol and drug abuse.
Get it on Netflix, watch the 1st hour, go to an AA meeting, come back
and watch the last 15 minutes. You won't have missed a thing! The
acting was good - but the story is advertised as being about a plane
crash, when it's more about man's struggle against himself.The beginning scenes are supposed to depict a man with deep feelings
for a stewardess - instead it looks like he's hired a hooker, so it
doesn't quite jive later in the movie. More details on the
reconstruction of the jet, show some of the simulator footage of what
may have happened when other pilots tried to land, show NTSB reviewing
the black box etc, would have kept it more in line with the advertised
plot. The correct advertisement would be "An egotistical,
self-centered, alcoholic, drug addict makes an amazing jet plane
landing - see how he feels about that!"
