Unnecessary, but not Bad Remake

The outcast teenager Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) is bullied by
her mates at high-school. Her mother Margaret White (Julianne Moore) is
a pious and paranoid woman that sees sin everywhere and the need of
self- inflict punishment. When Carrie has her first period, she does not understand what is
happening to her and her mates humiliate her in the changing room. The
spiteful Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) videotapes Carrie with her
cell phone and posts in Internet. Their teacher Ms. Desjardin (Judy
Greer) punishes the students and Chris challenges her and is suspended
and consequently she can not go to the prom. Meanwhile Carrie discovers
that she has telekinesis and leans how to control her ability. The popular Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) feels bad with her attitude
towards Carrie and asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to
invite Carrie to go with him to the prom to make up for what she did to
Carrie. But Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) plot an
evil prank with her friends to seek vengeance for Carrie with tragic
consequences. "Carrie" is an unnecessary remake of the 1976 classic directed by Brian
De Palma. Sissy Spacek is unforgettable in the role of Carrie, but
Chloë Grace Moretz does not disappoint. The dramatic story of Carrie
and her relationship with her insane mother is engaging especially
because of Julianne Moore, who is one of my favorite actresses. The
conclusion uses state of art special effects and it will satisfy the
younger generations. In the end, I have to eat my words and agree that
"Carrie" is not a bad remake. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Carrie, a Estranha" ("Carrie, the Weird")
