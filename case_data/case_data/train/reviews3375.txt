Amityville in title only.

Amityville the Awakening is finally here after many, many push-backs
and delays. Was it worth the wait? Well like many films that use the
Amityville name, not really.The cinematography is fine, the actors are okay. One of the biggest
issues with the film itself is the audio, there are plenty of scenes
where dialog is drowned out by background sound. The film starts off on a good step, using what looks like old police
footage to explain about the Defeo murders, unfortunately from there
the movie makes a steady decline into worthlessness. Instead of making the movie about the house, murders and haunting, they
choose to focus on a bratty girl and her vegetable of a brother. The
haunting takes a back seat to the family drama, which makes the movie
even worse. Poor pacing, poor writing, the movie is less than
thrilling.Let's put it this way, there's a reason why they opted for a limited
theatrical release and putting it up for free on Google play in October
through December. It's a film even the producers and directors can't
stand behind.The reality is, the original Amityville was popular because it was
portrayed as a true story, so the family drama was more humanized. With
these other films, it's about the horror and this film completely
ignores that.
