The Gift that keeps giving? Not quite

I'll start by saying I really like the 3 main actors in the movie and
think they give off good performances. This is a very different role
for Bateman and one that I think he does well to play quite
convincingly. His wife is brilliant and Joel Edgerton as Gordo the
Weirdo is excellent. The slight issue with this movie is the premise is
one very similar to that of many films and this movie doesn't really
tread that far into new territory. Also while the story and acting is
good I don't think the characters are built well enough for us to care
that deeply about the outcome. The supposed bad guy isn't bad enough
and the good guys aren't really good enough. There are some decent
twists and turns but nothing jaw dropping. I did enjoy the film but as
you can tell from my review I think it could have been so much more
with a few changes to the script and a bit more suspense. However I do
recommend you give it a try for yourself as the acting is great and it
is still above average for a suspenseful thriller.
