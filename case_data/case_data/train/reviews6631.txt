7
Not perfect, but a solid film.

In the same grain as "The American" and "The International", "THE
(notice a trend?) Gunman" is a international thriller/action. Where the
former 2 films focus more on the thrill, and are overall failures,
Gunman is more action, and much more entertaining. If you are looking
for a fairly low commitment to a 'smart' action movie, then you can do
worse.In 2006, Terrier (Penn) works for a global corporation (that might as
well be called Umbrella Corporation) and is asked to kill a high
ranking diplomat. The movie then skips ahead to the present where
Terrier is not being chased down by unknown assailants. Nothing
original there.Terrier (Penn) is a likable character. Penn tends to be an actor your
either hate or love, but he is does a good job as a grittier, more
realistic Jason Borne. The movie ties to humanize him, but that side
plot is mostly a thud. After Penn, the cast is stellar - however
underutilized. It really is the peak of 'hey that guy' British actors.
Unfortunately, Elba who gets second billing is in the movie for 2
scenes total and less than 3 minutes screen time, a role that has so
little to it that I might as well have played the character. Winstone
and Bardem exist, but their talent is mostly wasted.The movie is a step sideways from a classic action movie. If you like
the Borne series and its fast paced action you likely won't enjoy the
more 'realistic' violence of "The Gunman". Unfortunately, if you are
not interested in the Borne series, this likely won't be of any more
interest. I give the movie a 7, because I enjoyed it. It is far from
perfect, I feel the movie definitely 'left sometime on the table' in
terms of directing and acting, it misses often in character
development, and the movie kind of devolves into clich√©, but there is
enough substance to watch.
