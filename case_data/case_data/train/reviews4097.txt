If you love soul-crushing disappointment, this movie is for you....

First of all, anyone expecting this to be as good as the original....
You can forget that idea.Every single thing that made the originals cult classics is totally
gone from this remake(if you could even call it that). This movie was
turned into another copycat Hollywood "horror".Lets start with the characters. The only characters name I remember is
the junky girls, Mia, but only because she was pretty much the focus of
the whole movie. She was the only credible actor in this whole
clusterpuck of a film. The male lead, whatsizname?, was nothing like
Ash (Bruce Campbell w00t w00t!!) and in fact, he was the complete
opposite. Ash = badass with a chainsaw, whatshisface = complete wussy
through the entire movie. He literally did not man up at all in any
way, even when he got hold of a shotgun.As for the other characters, there's nothing to be said because they
were less than nothing. Just more meat for the Hollywood grinder.The plot was incredibly hollow, the Necronomicon looked like a history
textbook on the inside, the infamous "chainsawing the hand off" in this
version was boring, and a lot of the effects clearly had continuity
errors, not small errors mind you, in-your-face cant-miss-it errors,
which shows in the last 10mins of the movie mostly.You're better off going and buying the original trilogy and have a
night in with friends, beer and pizza. I urge you not to throw money
away at the cinema on this horribly disappointing rotten tomato.
