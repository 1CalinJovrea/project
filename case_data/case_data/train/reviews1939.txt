I have just about given up on Nicholas Sparks

You know there was a day when Nicholas Sparks's movies were actually
good, like the notebook. But this movie really set the bar to a
horribly low standard. The acting was disgraceful, the acting was like
something out of a cheap Hallmark movie. The script was boring and
bland just like the plot line. Also, there wasn't really a lot of
chemistry between our two romantic leads. I have not gotten a chance to
read the book the lucky one, but hopefully it was a lot better than
this! Gosh this movie wasn't sweet or cute or romantic, it didn't make
me feel good, I really miss the notebook! I wish that he still made
movies like that. Blithe dinner was actually one actress that I enjoyed
and the Pham, her performance was really the only part of the film I
liked. In fact she's the only reason that this film got a two instead
of a one out of 10.
