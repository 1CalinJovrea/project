Awful acting, awful story, awful - awful - awful

Not worth watching. Everything was awful in this movie. I feel almost
cheated. I am sorry to say this but this is the worst movie I have ever
seen. It was so bad acting. So bad story and so not funny. God damn
messy plot and no meaning in the way the movie was built up. I got so
disappointed by all the actors. Only one advise from here. Don't waste
1,5 hours of your life seeing this movie. Simply not worth it!! One
thing more. The movie is totally making a big joke about movie making.
Whomever made this trailer must be good, because it actually looked
funny and okay there, but man you have to look long time to find a
worse movie!!
