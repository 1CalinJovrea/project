One of the worst films I've seen

The big problem with this movie is that none of the characters are
likable. Chappie's "family" is made up of criminals who raise him to be
a "gangsta" / "pimp" complete with bling. I don't know if this was
supposed to come off as heartwarming, but it's just stupid and corny as
hell. I kept hoping they would die the entire movie.Chappie himself is like an annoying little kid who does stupid things
and lacks common sense. The worst part is the accent. I don't know if
that's how real South Africans talk, but it just did not fit a robot at
all and was really obnoxious to listen to. It was like the movie tried
too hard to be cool.Combine all this with a plot that is nonsense. For example:Chappie's maker is like the next Steve Jobs, yet he works in a cubicle
in what resembles a run down warehouse.The computers look like they came from the 80's, complete with DOS.
Seriously? Did South Africa not get Windows?The gangsters let Chappie's maker go free repeatedly for no apparent
reason when he could obviously have gone to the police at any point.
Are these the dumbest criminals in the world?These are just a few examples of the idiotic script.Another thing is people keep mentioning how great the director is. I
honestly don't care what he directed in the past. This movie sucks.
