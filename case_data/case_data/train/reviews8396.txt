One of the most dishonestly over-rated films of all time. 1 of 10.

Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive
recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay
forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous
WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French
troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are
the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of
everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting
their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to
rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He
kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the
entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German
bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three
RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all
the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they
did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what
they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c
it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap.
There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of
my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time.
