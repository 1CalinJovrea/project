Sweet, quirky not just romantic not just comedy

The unique Zoe Kazan wrote and stars in this quirky, fascinating, and
original film about a writer with writer's block (Paul Dano, Kazan's
real-life main squeeze) who invents the girl of his dreams, writes
about her, and watches her become real.While this film has been billed by reviewers and marketed by publicists
as a "romantic comedy," in many ways it's not. It's both more and less.
Less predictable, certainly, as the endings of modern romantic comedies
are notoriously pat. More ... what? Strange? Edgy? Depressing even (at
times)? Maybe all of the above. But ultimately upbeat.The gifted Paul Dano has created a character - a young woman - who is
exactly who he wants, or at least so he thinks. It's not until he meets
his ex at a party 2/3 of the way through the movie that the audience
really begins to understand what's going on. And it's not just hearts
and flowers. But no spoilers here.That Kazan pulled off both this original idea AND the ability to end it
in a way that made sense yet left unanswered questions that should be
unanswered is testimony to her screen-writing talents. Her roots here
are strong: both of her screen writing parents and her famed
grandfather Elia. But Zoe is also extremely appealing as the film's
title character, showing a range of acting skills that could make her a
star.And for fun, we get Bening, Banderas, and Gould, all enlivening the
proceedings.Original movies are hard to find, and when you find them, often hard to
watch. This film is both original and very watchable.
