Ridiculous

Certainly the worst film I have seen this year and contender for the
bottom 10 of all time, this was uninteresting, poorly directed and
frankly rather annoying and pretentious. The acting was okay and could
have been good if they hadn't had such poor direction. The music was
intrusive, particularly at the beginning (you should never notice a
good film score, but you couldn't escape from this one), the storyline
was non-existent and the characters unsympathetic - a pretty lethal
combination. When Phillip Seymour Hoffman started singing and all the
females in the scene suddenly appeared naked, I just had to laugh and
from then on, each idiotic new "sensational" set-up just made me laugh
more. And it DRAGGED - the longest 137 minutes of my life. I would have
walked out well before the end, but I was with my wife, who said the
only reason she didn't walk out was that she wanted to see me suffer as
payback for making her sit through "The Tree of Life", which oddly
enough we both thought of as we endured this "Modern American Classic"
- I suspect that the silliness on the beach brought it to mind. Why
can't modern Directors (a) learn to edit properly and (b) entertain us?
Appalling.
