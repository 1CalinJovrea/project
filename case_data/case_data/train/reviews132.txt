Save your money .. Don't feed the Bay

Worst of the transformers movies. Was okay until about a 3rd of the way
through. Mark Wahlberg was better than Shia, but the movie was bloated
with too many similar scenes.Enough chase scenes and slow motion explosions for the whole of 2014.
It would be nice to see some sort of characters developed for the
transformers. Because they are created as one dimensional punchlines
there is no possibility to have any interesting story that involves the
transformers interacting with each other.Wait for the DVD if you must see it, but you wont be missing much if
you avoid it all together.
