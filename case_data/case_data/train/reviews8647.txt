Predictable bore.

What a God awful film with wooden acting from a wooden story. They will
no doubt churn another couple of these rotters before we meet our
apocalypse but I for one will not be watching them. Lots of overly loud
screams that's not very scary in fact every time we see our friendly
ghosts they seem to just scream at our protagonists which fills me with
the desire to shout back or assault my television. I don't know why we
as the human species are obsessed with crap sequels but in movie
history there are a handful of films worth the effort of making more of
because them films (which I'm not listing but u know the ones) had a
story worth the effort. Now I understand why they do it because the
sheeple will watch any old crap if it was OK first time round and sold
a few tickets. In conclusion it's a long winded screaming contest with
predictable story and bad acting.
