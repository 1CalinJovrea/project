The movie was so sickeningly political that I couldn't even settle down
and pay attention to the plot. Let's take a skinny dark skinned
president with a perfectly idealistic and altruistic persona and
juxtapose him to a right wing extremist speaker of the house, utterly
void of decency, willing to hire right wing extremist white supremisist
thugs, kill all who oppose his warmongering agenda and destroy national
landmarks in the process, all without a shred of honesty. Could it be
any more blatant? Who paid for this flop? I certainly didn't. I saw it
at a friend's house, who had rented it with a promotional code at Red
box. Don't waste your time and listen to this very extreme political
drivel. Is it possible that both sides of the aisle have valid points?
That members of both parties actually desire peace and good will? Of
course not! The right is just plain wrong and evil. Now you know the
whole story line. Spoiler!
