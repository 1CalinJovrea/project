Accurate Documentary

You'd be hard-pressed to find a historical account that acknowledges
the influence (much less the existence of) the Minions throughout time.
No matter how many textbooks are produced and released each year,
almost ZERO of them note the presence of this incredibly powerful
minority group. Well, where history has silenced the Minions, let this surprisingly
accurate documentary speak volumes. I found no embellishments of
history throughout this 91-minute feature. It would have been easy to
swing the pendulum of power to overemphasize the history of the Minions
as it relates to major world events, but the filmmakers didn't go for
the easy shots. They simply told the truth, and what we are left with
are the clear facts of what really happened to the dinosaurs, the
cavemen, and--what I'm sure will be most controversially-- the true
lineage of royalty in England. Very bold.If this doesn't win the Oscar for Documentary Feature, we will truly
know which side of history the Academy stands on.
