Impressive vehicle for Mr. Hardy

I went to see the movie because the review of the movie said that it
would change what you thought about film making. This would be true if
you've never seen a movie before, but that is not the case.Not to say that the movie is not good. It acts as a sort of one man
play starring Tom Hardy as Ivan Locke, a man who made a mistake in his
past that threatens to unwrap his perfect life when he tries to do the
right thing. The movie totally relies on the actor playing the role and
Tom steps up to the challenge nicely.But I've seen this kind of one man play with Buried starring Ryan
Reynolds and Brake starring Stephen Dorff. I can even mention other
movies like 127hours or Phone booth that have a similar concept.What makes Locke different is that the pressure of life and death is
not there. In those movies the leading (and only) men were threaten
with the proposal of death, While in this movie, Ivan Locke's way of
Life is threaten with change, and it's this change in the concept that
made the movie Quiet and low key, but the filmmakers were still able to
make if fast pasted and kinetic (having it take place in a Car going
down the highway helps).The movie had the same pressure of a ticking clock about to explode and
the lead character attempting to talk himself out of the situation, but
the filmmaker does not force the tension or thrills on you. Ivan
Locke's situation is very down to earth and every day to day. Watching
him attempt to deal with this situation could have come off boring
after a half hour if not for Tom Hardy showing his mental acting chops
(versus how physically intimidating he seemed as Bane in Dark Knight
Rises, he's a small man in real life).Though the movie was good to watch I could have gotten the same effect
streaming it at home on Netflix. Recommend you do the same.
