9
Classic drama between father and son but great twists and beautiful setting

I can't think of a reason NOT to give this film a 10 but I resist
giving them out so it's a 9. Great story, strong characters AND
relationships. Incredible tension and drama. I was on the edge of my
seat for most of this film. The locations were stunning and the music
really unusual (and that's a good thing). And Bill Pullman is just the
right touch in his small but important moments. A good story, well
told. What more can you ask of a movie?
