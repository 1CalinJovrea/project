Oh. My. God. Awful.

Stupid. The antithesis of what the movie purports. The final line "Life
was given to us . . . now you know what to do with it." Yeah. Don't
waste your time on this spew. Remember Altered States and all the
philosophical claptrap they put forth as plot and dialog? This is
worse. First the premise that we only 10% of our brains is BS. We use
it all. The 10% is nonsense that you can debunk on Snopes. Understand
that the writers didn't even go there for their information and didn't
even bother to read Wikipedia on this concept and you now know how weak
this is. Steer clear, folks. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING to see here.
Even the special effects are bad, low grade CG. Morgan, you've fallen a
looong way since Shawshank.
