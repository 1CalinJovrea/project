Boring boring boring!!

4 of us went along to this movie yesterday after thinking it looked
action packed from the trailer. The only action scenes were the ones
you saw in the trailer!!! All the back and forth talking between Mel and Wanderer drove us nuts!!
It felt like we were listening to a couple of young teenagers arguing
whether to kiss or not to kiss the boy! Shiny silver cars, bikes and
helicopters did nothing to excite us as there was no exciting car
chases!! It was just a big dull teenage aimed romance!!Im so glad we had free passes to see this movie or we would have all
asked for our money back!
