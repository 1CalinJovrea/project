Impossible to sympathize with the main character

Most of the other reviewers who gave it 1/10 have already nailed it.
Yeah, the CG was beautiful, but the story and physics were awful.But also, what was up with the "woman of science" going all religious
when faced with death? "oh lord if you are up there... oh wait". What's
more she always seemed to need a man around to tell her what to do.
What does she do when she doesn't have his guidance? Tries to kill
herself. Great.Sandras character just spent the entire time messing things up. You
could cut together her bumbling about, add yakety sax and a laugh
track, and title it "Sandra Bullock is a klutz in space!"And don't get me started on the imagery. They were really trying to hit
home on that fetus thing... that shot went on forever. How dumb did
they think the audience was? Pretty dumb I'm guessing if they all
believed the reviews and threw their money at it. Yes we get it, she
was reborn and overcame the grief of losing her daughter. But now we're
secretly hoping she gets eaten by a camel or something. That would have
made it worth the 90 minutes.
