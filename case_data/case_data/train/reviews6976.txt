Something Missing

A very well made, well put together movie. It was beautifully filmed
and competently acted. The character development was a little light,
but no more so than in most ninety-odd-minute offerings. The plot
itself was an interesting take on the time loop, Groundhog Day story.The film progressed nicely, although it was extremely light on action,
with only one short scene. There were some gaps, rather than plot
holes, in the story, but nothing noteworthy. It was a slick-looking,
stylish movie. So, why only four stars? Well, something was missing. I
do not know what it was, but it was absent. A full thirty minutes
passed before anything really happened, and then the conclusion became
obvious at about the seventy-minute mark.I am genuinely baffled as to why I found it so incredibly boring.
