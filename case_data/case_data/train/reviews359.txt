A Chick Flick with Dudes

Well this is complete and utter excrement. And yes, I wanted to use the
other word but IMDb wouldn't allow it. This is like some lame chick
flick but with the twist that it's dudes instead of girls even though
they still act like girls. This movie's a contrived mess. Guys don't
act like this with each other. They don't talk to each other about
their feelings and relationships all the time. They don't show each
other their privates. These guys were more like girlfriends than guy
friends. This is some Sex and the City garbage.Listed as the director and writer of this is Tom Gormican. No clue who
that is but I hope this is his last film. I feel sorry for Mr. Gormican
that he apparently has no straight male friends. If he is going to
write a story about straight guys perhaps he should be familiar with
the subject somewhat. Here's the first clue for you, Tom: straight guys
do not whip their wangs out in front of each other nor do we discuss
them with each other or want to see each other's wangs. We're not
always thinking about wangs. That's just some gay fantasy that's as
authentic as straight guys thinking that all female sleepovers end with
sexy lesbian pillow fights. We also don't talk about our feelings with
each other like we're on Dr. Phil. This is just a complete crapper.
Skip it unless you like movies that are terrible.
