A stunning love story between two undying souls

This is Jim at his utter best. The balance between emotive writing and
gentle quiet spaces within the script are total perfection. The
characters are well rounded and very easy to empathize with, which is
surprising for a couple of centuries old vampires. There is none of the
usual gaudy over the top vampiric crap that usually fills these types
of movies. It's a love story at heart and one that does a fantastic job
of balancing itself so that the intimacy shown on screen is divine
taste of these interesting characters lives without falling over the
top into some strangely perverse romcom. There is humor and and satire
in abundance, though it is never cheapened or thrown into the mix to
fill a gap. No this film in entirety is sweet and humbling. The sets
are rich and perfectly put together, the performances are flawless from
each and every member of the cast no matter how long their involvement.
This movie is the type that causes you to want to crawl into it's story
and settle down to live within it.
