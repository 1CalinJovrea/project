Delightful

"Saving Mr. Banks" is an exquisite film. It draws you in with the
delightful reality of Disney as well as the triumphantly stark reality
(inasmuch as it is reality; I do lack her background) of Mrs. Travers.
I purposely leave out parts of the film for the sake of the movie-goer,
but let me say how delightful the songs are, the people are, the
displays of emotion-- my part as well, as I nearly cried and fully
laughed at certain points throughout. The film speaks to me and it
feels complete in its currency-- tuppence, if you will-- in taking Mrs.
Travers' story and embellishing it with the truth of the creators'
(both Travers and Disney, for the part he has in the creation of the
film) lives. The lives of the characters-- and I do mean most people
seen on screen, in particular the driver and Mrs. Travers' mother-- are
well-told and well-lived, and spark a certain comfort and warmth, even
in the cold of their realities and harsher backstories. I believe the
film has done its job beautifully, and I wouldn't change it for the
world. Even the animated penguins, although for me there is still my
deep and abiding love for their real counterparts.
