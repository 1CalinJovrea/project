The Sweetest Arcade Villain

The clumsy Wreck-It Ralph has been the villain of his video game for
thirty years, destroying a residential building while Fix-It Felix uses
his powerful hammer to rebuild what Ralph has destroyed. During the
celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the game, Ralph is not
invited to the party since nobody loves him. Ralph decides to win a medal to become a hero and he goes to the game
Hero's Duty, commanded by the tough Sergeant Calhoun, where he sees the
chance of winning the medal. Ralph collects the aimed medal, but when
he is returning to his game, he brings accidentally one enemy Cy-Bug
with him. Ralph accidentally crashes his plane in the kart-racing game
Sugar Rush and loses his medal. When he is ready to retrieve it, the
annoying glitch Vanellope von Schweetz takes the medal and uses it to
dispute a kart racing in her game. Meanwhile Felix is seeking out Ralph to tell him that their game will
be shut down since he is missing. Felix meets Sergeant Calhoun that
tells him that the Cy-Bug would destroy any game and he immediately
falls in love with her. Ralph helps Vanellope to build her own racing
car and becomes her hero; but soon he is convinced by King Candy that
Vanellope is just a glitch and she may destroy Sugar Race. Ralph
destroys her car and her dreams expecting to protect Vanellope. But
when he sees her picture on the cabinet of Sugar Race, he learns that
something is wrong in the explanation of King Candy."Wreck-It Ralph" is a delightful animation by the Walt Disney studios
with the story of the sweetest arcade villain I have ever seen. The
clumsy Ralph and his existential crisis are hilarious and the animation
is a great tribute to the fans of the early video games arcade. Despite
my age, I am a fan of animations and "Wreck-It Ralph" is another
entertaining release by Disney, with a beautiful message of friendship.
My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Detona Ralph" ("Detonate Ralph")
