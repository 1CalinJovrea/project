Pitiful cash-grab.

Horror is one of my favorite movie genres. I really wasn't expecting to
hate this as much as I did but it is astonishingly terrible. Really. I
loved The Conjuring - this is nothing like The Conjuring. At all. It's
a blatant cash-grab and a terrible one at that.There is zero tension throughout this movie. Zero suspense. Everything
is reliant on close ups of the dolls face to "creep" us out and really
long periods of time where NOTHING HAPPENS. Literally, it's about this
couple that we do not care about and their stupid problems which we
care even less about. I don't know if they were trying to build
suspense in these scenes but in order to build suspense you actually
have to care about the characters. Or at least have, you know,
suspense; a lingering sense of danger. This had nothing. And holy hell
that ending. The positives of this movie: The lead girl is beautiful. She's easy to
look at. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. That's it. The characters
are horrendous and the acting is even worse. Seriously if you're going
to make a movie this awful at least have the decency to take an acting
lesson or two. It's a dreadful watch. Please, don't waste your time
with this cash grab sh*t stain. Don't give them the satisfaction. Watch
something good like Sinister or 1408 - haunting movies done right.
