Not impressed

Went to watch this movie, and expected good things as the trailer and
read up on this film looked all positive. However the story line was
really bad, and little happens throughout the film. Very boring and
would not recommend it, for anyone who thinks it might be a great
action/crime, you are wrong. A very simple story line, and little
insight into the brothers lives, its as if you are waiting for the
movie to start getting tense, but next thing you know, its the end. The
last 20 minutes are probably the best bit of the movie, however not
much makes sense. Very disappointed and cant understand how this has
gained a high rating.
