a roller-coaster of disturbing

when the movie was over the audience sat there somewhat stunned and
completely silent... was crazy... crazy is the literal word to use.the main character is so vivid and sad and real.the film is a roller coaster ride of drama and comedy... of awkward
humor and goofy then disturbing.the use of flashbacks are done seamlessly and works well to tell the
back story of this amazing character.there are a few things that maybe don't work here and there but 80
percent of this film is cate blanchette and she really is perfect.at times it's woodyy allen-ish and at other times you forget and are
sucked in by blanchette.rest of cast is great... andrew dice clay is awesome in a very toned
down role, louie ck is great is a small part... sally hawkins is
awesome in her own way and very different from her sister jasmine...
bobby carnivale chews some scenery.if this movie sucks you in you will have a hard time forgetting it for
a while... it hangs with you.
