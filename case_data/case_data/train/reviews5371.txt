Unrelenting Brilliance

Ben Affleck is a brilliant actor (who knew) and this movie is his
masterpiece. Didn't know Ben has this in him but damn was I ever wrong.
Watched this off of my DVR recently, really not expecting much.
Honorable mention to Kendrick, she was really good in her role and the
chemistry between her character and Christians was palpable. There are
honestly no bad actors in this film but Ben knocks it out of the park.
So intense and over the top was his performance, exactly what it needed
to be, I was mesmerized. Oscar worthy, in my opinion, an acting master
class.
