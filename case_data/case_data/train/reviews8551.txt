I hope you can stay awake.

The reviews on IMDb give this film a reasonable rating. Given that I
went to see on the big screen. Sorry folks but it is 100 minutes long
and seemed like a week. There is nothing good I can say about it, to
say it was awful would be about right. Keira Knightly is so bad in this
film, it makes me wonder if she has any acting ability at all. I am yet
to see her give a decent performance. If this film had to be made, then
she was miscast. It is a straight to DVD TV film, in other words a
waste of nearly two hours.There are thousands of better stories and better actors out there, I
just get annoyed when one pays good money to watch this slush.
