Must watch for both anime and non anime fans.

So I just had the pleasure of enjoying "Your Name" in the cinema and
though I could share some thoughts.(May contain very minor spoilers)I've seen many movies trying to pull off the "two people mysteriously
change body with one another", but I've never seen a movie doing a good
job with it. Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai's "Your Name (Kimi no
na wa)" has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deserved
rating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies of
all time, "Your Name" delivers us anything we could ask from it:A terrific artwork, the movie's animation is extremely well made, with
beautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack;
the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing and
mesmerizing to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scene
halfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeply
touching. Just like in every of Mokoto's movies, the characters are
extremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with them
after 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound to
the story. The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (which
isn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasant
to see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touch
of non-linear movie structure. It's the type of movie that will make
you laugh, cry, laugh while cryingÂ… The movie's perspective constantly
changes between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch and
it's not something you see very often.For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even for
non anime fans I'do recommend to give it a try!
