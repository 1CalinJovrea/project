I'm surprised

When I was going to see this movie, i was thinking that it gonna be
another teen movie about a girl that's discover the natural identity of
her boyfriend, but it wasn't like this, it was so much better, with
alternative focus and interesting events this movie comes with a brand
new type of history, a very well produced time line that will keep you
with your eyes opened until the last second, it's simply awesome, great
for family, adaptable for all ages, and will touch even the youngest
and the oldest person that goes to see it, it's not a reflexive movie,
that will be in your head for a long time, but it's a huge font of
entertainment, i recommend it for all the people in the world. Of
course, this movie has a lot of existing elements, that make it a
little boring to see, but it's a great film for a Saturday night, to
see with your friends. Thanks all of you, and sorry about my English,
i'm from other country.
