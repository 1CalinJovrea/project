Not as it seems, in a good way

My first glance towards Paper Towns I had high hopes, and after
joyfully watching the movie I feel fulfilled. The ending is to me
utmost fitting and appropriate. My last glance shows the movie rating a
7/10, and Im not sure why. Acting was terrific and I believe the
casting was a hammer hitting the nail on the head. I believe once you
put your phone away and any distractions and focus on the emotions of
the characters in depth you will feel many feelings you have hopefully
felt in your lifetime.The movie seems like something teenagers would flock to in high school
with their sweethearts on a first date trying to find a romantic movie
but someone for an example 25 years of age having experienced all those
feelings can hopefully watch the movie and recall memories of love and
trying to find your place in life.*(THE GOOD) Casting great, movie pace well kept, no major "now how in
the hell would that happen", and ending realistic and honest.*(THE BAD) Nothing, go watch it.
