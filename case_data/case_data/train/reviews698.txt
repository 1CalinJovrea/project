A simple, silly, but funny and enjoyable family movie.

What should I start with ? Oh, yes, I don't really get the mediocre
score and reviews for this movie. Yeah, it's not another Holymollywood
show (thank heavens!), it's not amazing in any way, but it does great
at being a simple, enjoyable and funny movie to watch with your family.
Both Simon Pegg and Kate are lovely to watch here. You can just sit, relax and have a fun time. It clearly doesn't try to
be smart or serious, people should understand this. There's also a tiny
but nice message in it, that once understood, makes a better image of
it all. If you enjoyed "Hector and the search for happiness", you
should give this one a try. We need more movies like this!
