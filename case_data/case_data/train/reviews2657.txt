Mortified Instruments: City of Bores

It has been said many times, but it bears repeating: this is a clone of
every hit teen/young adult series of the 21st century. It genuinely
tears scenes from other books and movies and mashes them together into
a disgusting movie casserole.I have written a full review that summarizes the major issues with the
film itself (not even touching the blatantly obvious plot-holes and
terrible scripting, but just basic issues with the film itself). The
review contains spoilers, but here is a non-spoiler list of just a few
issues with the film.1. The attractive and intelligent Lily Collins is reduced to a
stuttering, whining, heartless whore.2. The film tries to justify dressing everyone up like a hooker.3. The story features a token.4. The movie ends. Twice.5. The story glorifies selfishness and hormonal decisions.6. Every popular film series is robbed for this story.7. Clary's eyebrows (just has to be said, guys).If you want more details on these issues, check out my full review,
which does contain spoilers, here: rinnovato.wordpress.com/cityofbores
