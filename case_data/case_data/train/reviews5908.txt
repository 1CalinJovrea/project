Snook is Amazing!

The one of a kind thriller is destined to make a mark. It is not only
entertaining in its own right but pretty sets the bar for the ultimate
trans-gender film, the ultimate time travel paradox story, and the
ultimate riff on a popular insult which suggests that the target of the
insult perform an un-natural act...Sarah Snook is astonishing. I need to use a thesaurus to find a better
word. When you consider that they given Oscar nominations to films like
TOOTSIE, you have to wonder what this performance is worth? Because her
performance here is in a class by itself, so engaging, so empathetic,
that the viewer would like to have lunch with both characters at the
same time, if such a thing were possible.The Spierig Brothers deserve additional praise not only for handling
this so well but you have to realize how much backstory and exposition
they crammed into the first 30 minutes. Most film-makers would have
choked on this but because of the aforementioned Ms. Snook, the film
takes flight and soars.
