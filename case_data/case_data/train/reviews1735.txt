Hour and half of my life has been stolen away!!!

Disgusting movie... please read the reviews and save yourself... I
never post any movie reviews, but this was so horrible that I had to do
my part to save some unsuspecting human falling in the trap and being
convinced that the 1.5 hour of their life could not be better utilized. Please, do anything, sleep, go to a park... just stare off at the
ceiling, anything is better than this... wasting my time on this movie
has made me so mad that I am making the effort to review it, just so
that I can vent somewhere about this convoluted piece of ****Honestly, I had no idea what the movie was, the only reason I watched
because it popped up as suggestions on Hulu (I have half a mind to sue
them to promote this movie on their top banner!!!) and that Keanu
Reeves typically does decent movies. I was horrified within the first
half hour itself, as to the unexplained bizarre behavior by everyone...
but then it was like, oh I have already started watching it, let's see
how it ends, hoping there is some closure... believe me, there is no
******* closure, there is no sense and there is no explanation! Run, I tell you, run in the opposite directions when you come across
this movie, else you would feel like taken your revenge on someone who
conceptualized, created, promoted this piece of garbage.
