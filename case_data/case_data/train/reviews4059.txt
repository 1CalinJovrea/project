Honestly DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY

I cannot believe I actually paid to watch this utter tripe. It is
possibly the worst film I have ever seen in my life. If you've any
sense do not waste your money like I did. Some of the scenes are just
ridiculous. Donne Yen must have been totally desperate for the money
considering some of the great films he has made in the past. The female
characters are as you would expect very attractive but do not make up
for the awfulness of this film. Vin must be sat at home thinking OMG
why on earth did I actually make that film as he probably doesn't need
the money. The only good part of the film was near the end. The best
part of the film was when it had finished and I could get out of the
cinema. Honestly I repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
