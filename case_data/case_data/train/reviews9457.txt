Not so good

In the Ad's It looks Like a Pretty Scary and funny movie. But it wasn't
Scary A few jump scares Thats about 40% of the movie is a Kid rapping
swearing And making no sense or want to see a old woman's butt then
this is the movie for you The most scary thing in this movie was seeing
a naked old woman. it was a Little funny but it was mostly weird and
awkward. Some may like it but to me its just very weird. It looked WAY
different in the ads in the ads it looks like a REALLY good movie but
Before the kids even get to the grandparents house its already getting
awkward so if you want to wast your money go and see this movie. Or if
you want to see a shaky camera Or a grandmother clawing on the floor
and scratching on walls Or grandpa Pooping and putting it in a boys
face And Getting dressed every day in a suit or hiting a guy walking
down the street.
