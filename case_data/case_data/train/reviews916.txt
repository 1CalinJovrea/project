Feminist garbage

From the onset this was promoted as a sort of a feminist retake on the
original classic comedy, a "women can do better than men" attempt. It
is a horrible premise to begin with, attracting a lot of negative
publicity before the movie was even out. And it delivered.. badly.
Mediocre acting, bad script, lukewarm jokes. It does not deserve a
further analysis for being so mediocre, a five out of ten movie that
gets one star for promoting a pointless gender competition. Next feminist projects could be: "The Terminatress" , The Blues
Sisters, Beverly Hills female cop, Fay Buller's day of, Iliana Jones,
Billie and Tess's excellent adventure , etc, etc..
