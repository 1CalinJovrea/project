A disgrace

Congratulations, some jacka** of a director thinks he's so amazing that
he can pull off recreating a classic but instead has single handedly
ruined what could arguably be one of the best franchises of all time.
What proves it, is its done in 3D like every other piece of sh*t to
attract attention from every idiot with the money to afford a movie
ticket. And that clip after the credits? What the hell... do you really
think copying marvel movies will make your poor excuse of a remake any
better? Well fu**ing done, There are so many floors in this movie that
if I were to sit here and spell them all out id be here all night long
and breach this 1000 word limit. and that would only be the first
quarter of the movie.
