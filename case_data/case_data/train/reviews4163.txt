Not a Hollywood shoot em upper - that is a NICE change!

I never noticed as some here have said, that, this was a low budget
movie.Not that it shows anywhere. The actors - Cornish, Bell and always
delivering a GREAT performance - Mark Strong. I have never seen Strong
give a bad performance on screen - most know him from the Kingsmen.
Some may say the Iranian embassy situation marked the beginning of
international based terrorism for England,although in the past the
country had many domestic situations of a dire nature - the IRA and
their campaign.. I watch closely for technical details got right - or
more often - WRONG - this movie gets it right - at least for the layman
like most of us are.I have a friend who was S.A.S - he pointed out more
- humorously - but he gave this film a thumbs up. So, when a real life
hero I am privileged to know, who has lived these types of things says
the movie is good - WATCH IT!
