Iphigenia in the 21st century

Not one single deer gets killed in this film, let alone a sacred one.
But by choosing this title Yorgos Lanthimos lets us know where he got
the inspiration for this film: in Iphigenia, a character from the Greek
mythology. After having seen the film, I took one of my old books from
high school (1978!) to find out what this myth is about exactly.Iphigenia's father, King Agamemnon, is ordered by the goddess Artemis
to kill his daughter, in order to atone for his killing of a sacred
deer. When she hears what is going to happen, Iphigenia agrees to being
killed, because this would be beneficial to the Greeks.In Lanthimos' version, Artemis takes the shape of a creepy teenager,
who terrorizes a successful heart surgeon he considers responsible for
his fathers's death in the operating theatre. The surgeon and his wife
(Colin Farell and Nicole Kidman) have to witness both their children
getting paralyzed. This, announces the teenager, is the first stage of
a slow and painful death that can only be stopped when the surgeon
kills a family member.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a horror thriller, not so much
different from other movies in this genre. The otherwordliness that
made his earlier movies 'The Lobster' and 'Dogtooth' so special, is
less prominent is this film. There are still some familiar features,
such as the strange, deadpan way of talking by many characters. But the
surgeon clearly has emotions and is increasingly desperate when he
realizes that medical knowledge is useless in this case.'The killing of a sacred deer' is a decent thriller, with a nice weird
edge. But the typical Yorgos Lanthimos-style is less prominent, which
was a disappointment to me.
