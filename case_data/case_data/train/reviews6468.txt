Consistent quality, wide spectrum

Well produced anthology, with high values on direction, camera, acting,
editing and sound.The first half seems more coherent, with a scarier vibe and what looks
like an editorial rule of having screen shots of Romero's classic in
each one. There's a definite theme of Grimm's fairy tales running
through it, as kids get sucked into the weird world of Halloween. My
favourite was Ding Dong, about a child-craving woman, mostly because it
has Pollyanna Macintosh. But the Lin Shaye story, although stylish,
seemed a bit unpolished. The first story has a pretty good take on the
Exorcist III jump scare, this time running from right to left.The second half goes more campy head-banger with loads of blood.
Eventually the tongue is pushed so hard into the cheek that a little
bit comes out the other side.There's no wraparound, just a silky female DJ voice with a few nods to
The Fog.Overall, enjoyable and something for everyone - but I prefer creeps
over chuckles, and felt in the end this was pitched at the Budweiser
crowd. Rice beer is such a downer.
