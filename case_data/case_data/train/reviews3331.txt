Your cheating heart

The Other Woman is an unfunny, bland and messy romantic comedy that
still finds itself sunk by its wafer thin characters and other better
films that dealt with cheating husbands/boyfriends. Director Nick
Cassavetes is far removed from the talent of his father.Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) finds out her rich, successful businessman
boyfriend Mark is married. When she meets the wife (Leslie Mann) they
find out that they actually awkwardly like each other in an odd couple
way. Later on they find out that he is cheating on them both with a
younger and more buxom Amber (Kate Upton) so all three women team up
for revenge by humiliating him.Just so the audience finds the discomfort that Mark goes through is OK
such as pooping in his pants because of secretly added laxatives they
also make him someone who is framing his wife to take the rap for his
dicey business dealings.A tired, contrived and laboured film.
