Well Executed, Unreal but Excellently Crafted

This has to be one of the most unpredictable movies that I happen to
see in a long time. The feel of the movie is the real hero. Movies shot
in Italy has its own charm. The direction is superb and a constant pace
keeps the movie interesting throughout. The story line is unique- its
like a fairytale bottle of romance with a pinch of
horror/myth/supernatural. Till the first half of the movie you will not
know what's the base. During the half time you think its some ordinary
horror movie but as it unleashes it grips you till the very end scene.
The last scene in the movie is the winner. Acting parse- The newcomer Nadia Hilker is spontaneous and has got the
role totally under her skin (i mean literally too). Lou (the male lead)
is decent and its good that the story gives him only one set of clothes
in the entire movie and he carries it well. I can't say its a must watch but definitely recommendable. If you
girlfriend like twilight or any vampire stuff, show her this one and
add a tag - Thats how I deal:)
