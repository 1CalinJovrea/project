Home Alone set in a mall !

I fall for it every time. A film I've never heard of that's starring a
couple of respected actors which has been released straight to DVD .
When am I going to learn that there's a bloody good reason why these
films come out of nowhere with little or no publicity ? Antonio
Banderas is a shopping mall security guard who has to protect a child
trial witness from a psychopathic criminal and his gang of soldiers
looking to stop her testifying against them. In recent years there have been a few actors who have reinvented
themselves with hard guys characters. Sadly I don't think this film is
going to do anything for the career of Antonio Banderas or Ben Kingsley
come to think of it. The film starts with the criminals attacking and
killing a convoy of US Marshalls yet as the film progresses they
ridiculously get taken out by a bunch of overly stupid shopping mall
security guards as well as Banderas who is ex forces of course. Not
heard that scenario before! At times it feels like Home Alone with
their homemade booby traps but sadly nowhere near as entertaining. Once
you get past all the juxtaposition and unintended comedy it isn't that
bad but I still wish I hadn't bothered.
