F1 finally has an amazing film

This is an amazing film. I can't recommend it highly enough for F1 fans
like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e.
something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out
each year.All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They've done a
fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two
memorable F1 drivers.James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving
talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking,
technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters
are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also
acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe
this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when
we have something to beat or overcome.Do yourself a favour and see it now.
