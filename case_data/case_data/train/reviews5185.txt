20+ nitwit (deadbeat) survives her own bumbling ennui in NYC in an homage to W. Allen and French film

Just saw "Frances Ha." Uh...why was that a movie at all? Depressing to
see that much youth and beauty be that dull and boring. And the concept
was not at all anything new. Which is what I found the most annoying
aspect to it all. I saw Slackers back when I was one. I've seen every
Woody Allen, made, I saw all french film back in the day's when they
weren't vintage and liked King Of Hearts so much that I bought the
soundtrack on vinyl when I was in elementary school.So...I was pretty disgusted that the director took other filmmaker's
ideas (with more originality and artistry) and tossed those into his
"Frances Ha" soup and hoped it might pass as something new. I believe
there is a word for this?....What is it?...Oh, yeah. "Derivative." Frances Ha is derivative of a lot. And lacks unique wings of it's own.
Sorry. It doesn't.Main character was a 27 yr old nitwit w/out enough braincells to
inflate the leaden balloon the narrative already was = a sad, pointless
ramble about a kid who kind of gets her act together enough to complete
something involving "real art skills" while shuffling papers at a dance
studio with a diminishing degree of self loathing by the end. That was
so amazing. Audience was supposed to be charmed by her "nutty" approach to logic. Director stole music soundtrack to King of Hearts (1960's) and played
it over and over hoping the music's wacky charm would make his flick
appear "more whimsical." Fail. On the plus side: You get to watch Meryl
Streep's daughter say "Where the F___ are you going?" -- That was
awesome!Seriously. Blech. Very similar to "Girls" but sans humor or wit. At
all. Not sure how that got made. Gave it a 2 stars because I finished watching it.
