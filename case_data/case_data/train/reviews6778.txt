The Hangover pushing 70

Four childhood friends who where like a good old gang back in the day,
now 58 years later they all(Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Michael
Douglas, and Kevin Kline) have grown apart and living separate lives,
and all pushing 70. But get a call to go to Las Vegas, for a friends
engagement. Will these four old friends have the time of there lives?All the great actors here have great chemistry and appears to be having
fun being in the film together. The Las Vegas setting is awesome, and
seems to take on a life of it's own. It was also very funny seeing the
adventure and misadventure these guys get themselves into. It's also
quite heartwarming, an enjoyable film for men and women.
