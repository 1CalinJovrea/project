Avoid at all cost

I like cars, dogs and computers. To be or no to be, that's the question
I ask myself all the time. Did you know, that the other day I had a
cold beer at home?Like the previous lines, this movie made no sense. Jumped from one
thing to another. Wait, then actor who looks like he's in his mid 40s,
informs us that he will be 30. That was the first sign.4 words: This movie is awful.
