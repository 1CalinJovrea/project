Graceful, popcorn filled thrilling and tense, taught and energetic. This trilogy gets much better as it goes on.

Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world
after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still
the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and
so was the plot line. As the time passes on, the visuals get more
artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's
welcome, I wonder what they will think of nextÂ… Jurassic Space? I hope
this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling
popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the
dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on
and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours
of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent
behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!
