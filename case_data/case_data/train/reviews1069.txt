Overrated...but maybe I'm missing the point

I saw a lot of critics referring to this movie as in the classic
grindhouse style. Its a term I'm not really familiar with so I looked
it up. Urban dictionary says it refers to a movie that "sacrifices the
traditional film-making concepts such as good acting, character
development, production values, creative directing and an
understandable plot outline in favor for sex, gore, nudity, violence
and other shocking themes."Maybe if I grew up watching a lot of B movies in this style there would
be some nostalgic appreciation I would have. However, I didn't, and I
typically like movies with good acting, character development,
production value, and understandable plot outlines. Sacrificing all
that for some sweet action and nudity? Cool. I do enjoy indulging in
well made action movies, like the Bourne trilogy, but the action/gore
in this one wasn't very exciting for me either. As someone with some
experience in martial arts and boxing I found the fight scenes
ridiculous. Maybe the fight scenes were intentionally ridiculous but I
much prefer realistic fight scenes. Overall, not my cup of tea.That being said I really enjoyed the opening 10 minutes of the film.
The scene when he comes home after work is great.
