An overly hyped film and a very unfortunate disappointment

Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the
hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept
that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some
reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number
one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in
coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in
developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage.
Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some
points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a
great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't
make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that
none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total
failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so
flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of
the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis,
Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I
really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would
be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick
Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for
Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have
been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie
than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A
weak six stars and a onetime watch.
