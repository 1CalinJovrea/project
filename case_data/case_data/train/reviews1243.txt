I did not expect it to be this good.

I'll be honest. When I saw the trailer, I was madly excited. It looked
fantastic. But then, after a while, I remembered, that the main point
of a trailer is to do just that. Hype the film, while revealing
literally all the main plot scenes and parts. I didn't know if it was
the case with 'Safe House', since, hey, it's Denzel Washington. That
man doesn't just do any role.I just got back from the movie theater, and am I glad that I was wrong.
The movie is fantastic, electrifying. Do know that I don't just 'get
off' on any action flick. In most cases, I just watch and forget. This
was actually, fantastic. I don't have a single bad word to say about
it, the way it was directed, acted or anything else. Everything was
simply fantastic.I realize my words sound absurd, and the score looks the same, but it
really is worth it. I didn't see an action movie this well written, and
this well acted in a really, really long time. Of course, by the end of
the movie, any experienced watcher will figure out the ending by
himself, but even though you 'get it', it's still extremely fun to sit
through and see how the pieces connect.I really hate long reviews, so I'm trying to make this one as short and
sweet as possible. Lastly, have in mind that not one cast member failed
his role. Ryan was fantastic, even better then I could've imagined (a
nice showing of his acting skills after Green Lantern and Change-Up),
and Denzel, what to say that hasn't been already said about that man's
acting. Phenomenal doesn't cut it.Go and see it. It's much better then anything else thats currently
'showing'.
