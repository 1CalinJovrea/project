Please give a standing ovation for Vince Vaughn

I watched this without having seen a trailer. When I saw Vince Vaughn
in it, I expected a comedy of some sort. I'm glad to say that I was
wrong. Vince Vaughn delivers like I've never seen him deliver. His
acting is beyond excellent. He portrays Bradley in a sincere, intense
and beautiful way. The movie is written well, dialogue is excellent.
I've become a fan of VV with this one movie.The movie leaves one satisfied on all levels. Highly recommended and
brilliantly executed. Well done S. Craig Zahler, well done Vince
Vaughn. PS: Not for the squeamish.
