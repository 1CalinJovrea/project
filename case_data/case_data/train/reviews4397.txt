Adds nothing to any genre

I went to watch this movie in 3d in Mexico based on some video reviews
I had seen that said it was an "experience" that had to be lived. How
far was that from the truth.Love in 3d, which is the title the film had in Mexico, is a tedious,
unnecessarily long film that has no real story, statement or
message.Its a long porn video with a bad script. The film is supposed
to pose a question about what love is, but never really addresses it or
takes any kind of position about it. Furthermore, it extends its scenes
way past it should. The ending sequences, for example, are just endless
quasi-reiterations of the previous scenes that add nothing to the film.
You think it is over, and boom! another sex sequence, and then another
and another. The "cuts" the film uses are also poorly executed. I understand using
the cuts for when you jump in time between the scenes but if you do
not, why do you still use it? Half of the time the cuts are used, the
movie does jump in time,but the other half is just an annoying blink of
the screen to come back to exactly the same point.If this had been a 15 minute short then it might actually had made
sense, but a 2 and a half hour long movie was definitely way more than
a stretch. Save yourself the time and money.
