One of the worst movies ever made

If I could give this piece of crap 0 stars I would. This is easily one
of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even cheesy 80s action movies like
Cobra had better writing. So many other reviewers already pointed out so many of the completely
terrible plot holes, nonsense, and idiocy that I'll just leave most of
that out of this review. That being said, there's terrible video games with better stories than
this movie. You'd be better off staring at a wall while punching
yourself in the side of the head for 2 hours than watching this piece
of crap. Skip it.
