Dull and underwhelming, not directly bad, just barely OK.

This movie in itself is not exactly bad. It looks alright, has some OK
gore, decent acting for the most part, some slightly interesting
characters. It doesn't suck. But as a origin story to one of horror's
biggest icons? Eeeh, yeah. It's not great.Actually, right off the bat the biggest problem with this movie strikes
me. When you're making an origin story to such a famous character, you
should make sure that the story you make up and make into a movie is
really awesome. Unfortunately, it's not. We see Leatherface's family
and stuff, and it's just meh. The opening scene is just not very
interesting. What follows though, isn't bad. They have some kind of
story to tell here, not relying too much on TCM- lore, and I thought it
was somewhat entertaining.You wouldn't have to cut a lot here to make this movie totally
unrecognizable as a Leaterface origin-story, though. That's a shame.
And it's also pretty tame, I'm sorry to say. Actually really tame. Like
I said initially, the origin story to such a gruesome character should
really be a lot more horrific, gruesome and ghastly. It's not. It's
pretty watered down. I think the die hard fans of Leatherface will be
disappointed with this. But who knows, I may be wrong.
