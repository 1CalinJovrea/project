Very funny movie; would highly recommend

Overall: This movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone who's
up for a laugh.Good: It is consistently funny with cool and interesting heroes. The
music is great and keeps in touch with the tone the movie attempts to
set. All the cast do fantastic jobs acting wise and you seriously
believe their character. Melissa McCarthy's rants are hysterically
funny as is her unbelievable 'spy mode'! The cinematography is great
and works very well. It is a well directed, edited, composed and acted
movie. The actual action scenes â€‹were very well choreographed to feel
bad ass. Jason Statham is a personal favourite character and his
insane, egotistical attitude contrasts to Melissa's pre-spy mode.
Miranda Hart and Jude Law do good with there performances though Jude
feels like more of a plot device. Peter Serafinowicz did a good job of
acting within acting; his mini-twist at the end was surprising and also
funny.Bad: The villains were not that interesting or unique or even special.
They just shifted the story along. Jude Law was just a plot device over
an actual character. The twist at the end felt forced and just wasn't
that interesting. The slow motion action parts were just annoying and
took away from the pace. A much more fast paced action with little
breaks would fit better.Best Part: Any Melissa McCarty rantMVP: Jason Statham as Ford.8/10
