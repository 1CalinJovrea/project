I loved it

I truly loved this film. It was heart warming, fun and had me laughing
several times. Yes, it's totally predictable but that can sometimes be
OK. You know what you are going to get, the freaky children and the
inevitable romance. I like these two when there together and I like
Sandler despite what the critics say. He is someone you can relate to.
A great movie to chill out, relax or just something to make you happy. The children's antics were annoying at times and the transformation
from tomboy to beauty was slightly abrupt but I did like the the way
that each parent dealt with the issues of teenage boys and girls,
especially the constant 'self service' that the teenage boy was
participating in while imagining his babysitter. After all, most blokes
can remember that time in their life.
