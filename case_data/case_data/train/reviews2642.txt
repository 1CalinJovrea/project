Seeing the reviews as almost overwhelmingly positive, I had high
expectations. I figured, even if it only hit on a few notes, it would
be entertaining. Alas, I was led astray, once again, by the Intertubes.At the 1 hr mark, we finally had enough and walked out. Browsing carpet
samples at Lowes was infinitely more entertaining than this piece of
garbage. The only way to see this movie and feel any entertainment is
to be completely stoned. I cannot fathom the source of all positive
reviews I've seen online. I guess it's because there's some attempts
early on at self deprecating humor as they make fun of all the cameos.Some people must see it that way, but I do not. To me, it was nothing
more than 107 minutes of a self-indulgence where the actors were so
caught up in their awesome idea for a film they forgot to actually
WRITE SOME WITTY DIALOG! Seriously, the scene between Franco and
McBride about leaving loads all over the place was humorous for the
first 5 seconds, but hey...why not stretch this 7th grade humor out
another 2 minutes? The audience will LOVE it because WE think it's
funny and WE ARE SO AWESOME! I found it offensive, not for the subject matter, but for how they
treat the audience. Rogan thinks his jokes about 'playing the same
character in every movie' somehow make it excusable to sit back and do
it again? This is a lazy sophomoric stupid humorless pile of stinking
garbage that makes me feel bad about losing the 60 minutes of my life I
lost before coming out of my coma and walking out.Rogan and crew, even though they DO play the same characters all the
time, can at LEAST feel good that they have some witty dialog in their
movies. In this movie, I was waiting for that but it never came. When
the sinkhole opened up, I wished I would've been able to fall in and
surrender to the sweet release of death rather than endure any more of
this circle-jerk ego trip.
