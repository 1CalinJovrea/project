Don't waste your money

Total disaster! I can not think of one redeeming reason to see this.
I'm glad it was a matin√©e. I can suspend belief with movies but this
was just a bridge too far! The script writing was clunky, there was
little to no chemistry between the main characters. I'm not exactly
sure why William DaFoe was even in the movie. Stay away!
