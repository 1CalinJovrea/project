Had potential, but ends up a pretty average horror movie.Horror movies are easily the worst, least original genre of movies.
Really very little room for originality and tend to fall back on the
same clich√©s.The Babadook seemed to have potential, though was never that original.
The tension and intrigue were built well. However, it pretty quickly
fell back on standard horror formulae, and ended in a random, chaotic,
confusing, pointless mess.Good performance by Essie Davis in the lead role. Noah Wiseman makes
for a very irritating kid, though that might be the director and
script's fault. Even in the beginning, when the movie had potential and
hadn't fallen apart yet, the kid was the thing preventing it from being
enjoyable.
