Mel Gibson Does It Again

Based on the true story of US Army medic Desmond T. Doss, a man who
refused to bear arms, yet was awarded the Medal of Honor by President
Harry S. Truman for single-handedly saving the lives of over 75 of his
comrades while under constant enemy fire during the Battle of Okinawa
in World War II. If you've seen Braveheart you know that Gibson is one
of the few directors who have mastered the art of film making. If you
want further proof than look no further, As this is a another fine
example of his work. What stands out even more then the story line is
Garfield's extraordinary performance. I wouldn't be surprised if he won
his first academy award from this. As he is the heart and soul of this
movie, perfectly cast. Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of biographies
and I rarely make exceptions. However when I heard that Gibson was
overlooking this, I was ready to make that exception and I'm glad that
I did. As this might win him his third academy award.
