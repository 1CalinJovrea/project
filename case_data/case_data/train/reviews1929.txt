Much Worse Than I Could Ever Have Imagined

No suspense. No Horror. A permanent stain on the franchise that makes
you feel dirty after having watched it.I had pretty much no expectations going into this film. I had avoided
much of the marketing material beforehand and knew very little about it
other than it being a sequel to Prometheus, which I actually thought
was a half decent film and a worthy prequel to Alien.I'm not sure what went wrong with this film, but it is no exaggeration
to say it is one of the worst films I've had the misfortune of sitting
through. There is not one redeeming scene. The story is disjointed and
quite frankly a complete mess. The editing is horrendous, the score
completely forgettable and the cinematography is weirdly terrible.Even Michael Fassbender cannot save this awful dirge. The CGI xneomorph
will haunt my dreams for quite some time. Not because it's an imposing
and scary alien in this film, but because the CGI is some of the worst
you'll see from a movie this year.Alien and Alien 2 were as close to cinematic perfection as you're going
to get. Please avoid this dreadful film.
