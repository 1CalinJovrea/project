What Driver Should Have Been

This spare, stark, simple double-cross story is hung on the bones of
some of the best road-action camera work I've seen since the 1980s. The
chase- scene shot sequencing hearkens back to the early giants of the
genre: Bullit, The Driver, The Blues Brothers. The makers spend plenty
of attention on watching the Wheelman manipulate the controls of his
car and presenting realistic, easy-to-follow driving choreography.
Nothing in this thing breaks your suspension of disbelief... unlike
other multi-million dollar, CGI-choked car-chase franchises I can think
of. Yes, as some reviewers have complained, most of the conflict is
advanced through cell phone conversations, but that merely serves to
throw the many actions sequences into even sharper relief. The director
never pulls you out of the car to set you safely on the sidelines as
the action goes whizzing by; you're in the seat with the bullets
flicking past your head. Sit down, listen to the dialogue, and you'll
like this inexpensive little jewel.
