This movie commits the unforgivable sin...

It's outrageously stupid. I have read all of the bad reviews currently
posted for the Kingsman, and none of them hit the right mark. The movie
is violent, raunchy, campy, sexist, racist, and vulgar. And that's all
OK! But does it have to be so incredibly stupid? Honestly, does it? And
why is the CGI so incredibly terrible. Last time I checked this is
2015, not 1985. I usually don't care too much for special effects, but
there is a given level of competence which I expect a film to achieve,
before it just becomes distracting. Kingsman has CGI on the level of a
cheep SyFy channel special feature.The acting on the part of the star, Taron Egerton, is terrible. Every
time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face,
especially every time he opens his mouth. Same is true about Samuel L.
Jackson, who played Valentine. That entire performance felt like Samuel
L. Jackson asked him self, "self, how would SNL pay this part, if they
were trying to make fun of me?" Then he used his fertile imaginations,
imagined it, and played it exactly like that. It's Samuel L. Jackson
acting out a caricature of Samuel L. Jackson playing the role of
Valentine. I think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this
point.Truly a terrible movie, not unlike the The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen, only with UK hoodlum playing the main role.
