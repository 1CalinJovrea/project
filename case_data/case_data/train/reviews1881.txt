In American hands this would be another Hard Candy.

But thankfully its a British film. Although they had to have an
American name as one of the stars i guess to get the requisite amount
of funding. No matter as rooney mara was brilliant. She plays the adult
una who just cant move on from her past. She seems to be hiding so much
and its quite thrilling to realise that you just don't know what her
character is going to do next. Whether she will soften or go full on
psycho. Some things didn't work, like setting so much of it in the
warehouse. I didn't know going in but it quickly became obvious the
film had its roots in a play. Whats the point of that? They are making
a feature film, not another play! Overall though this was highly
watchable, tense and dramatic. 8/10
