Very well done and incredibly fast paced

This film has as many words as a three part six hour miniseries.I wonder how many pages of dialog it has for a two hour movie - i bet
it sets a new record.This is Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut at 2017 Tiff.We know him for brilliant scripts and this is another.What sets this film apart is its frenetic pace. I don't know if the
dialog was sped up or if the director said to the actors over again
"that was great, but lets try it again - faster".Particularly noteworthy was fast paced rant from Idris Elba that I
believe was the fastest he has ever spoken before.What also is amazing is that every word is perfectly pronounced and
understandable, more so than many other films I saw including Idris
Elba's other film at TIFF.
