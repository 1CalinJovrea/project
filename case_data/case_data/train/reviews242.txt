Avoid Like The Plague

I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as
bad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this
movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the
characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to
achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An
unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved
classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances
I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like
something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular
the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the
movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film
has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a
major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.
