Pet Lover's Delight

It's a "Despicable Me" reunion (don't let that turn you away), as
director Chris Renaud, writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, along with
director Yarrow Cheney (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 2018) gather to
get inside the hearts and minds of our little furry/scaly/feathered
friends. With fun music by Alexandre Desalt (The Danish Girl 2015), a
list of Who's Who cool VO actors (Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin
Hart, Dana Carey, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell -
the list goes on), and realistic animation courtesy of Illumination
Entertainment, new, old and foreseeable pet owners (young and mature)
will find great delight in this easy and entertaining to watch
animation production. To the credit of the writers, all the obvious
"pet jokes/mannerisms" and current society references aren't forced on
the viewer at one time. Thus, the film keeps giving throughout. Sure,
about 3/4 the way in the idea grows a bit old, but the cuteness factor
quickly returns for a rewarding finish. FYI: Don't let the less than
funny "DM" Short that pre-empetes the film cloud your judgment. While
Children (and there are plenty in attendance) really enjoy all things
"DM," there were few adults enjoying that experience. Illumination
Entertainment is pre- viewing "Sing," due out in 2016, which also looks
promising. Ruff, Ruff!
