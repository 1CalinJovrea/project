Probably the worst movie I've ever seen

I signed in at IMDb because I had to write a review about this movie.
It is, in one word, -terrible-.Not only does the director not seem to be able to build up a storyline,
but the actors also don't seem to be putting any effort in playing
their roles. The movie is boring from beginning to the end. It lacks a
storyline, it lacks excitement and it lacks good acting. It was so
boring, I fell asleep not once, but twice during the movie! One could
probably summarize the movie in only 2 minutes of screen time and you
wouldn't miss anything. My advice would be to not spend your hard
earned money on this movie, but to go to a near coffeeshop and enjoy a
nice cup of coffee with a blueberry muffin instead!
