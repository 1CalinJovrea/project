"Fun" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means "not art" or
"lacking drama." And the word "funny" likewise doesn't negate artistic
integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great
filmmaking or "true art" simply doesn't know what they're talking
about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor,
comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art and
expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedy
and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than
straightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun and
comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add
levity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I even
need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about
storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrow
personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing
corporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking --
turning everything into "us versus them," but the extent to which it's
devolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or
isn't "art," is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of so
much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre
storytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it is
also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and
it is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those
statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up
