Netflix Got this one a bit better

Well the story portraits 7 siblings trying to live at an overpopulated
world. Each one of them a day of the week. I haven't read the book and the story is not so distant. At first seems
kind of boring but then gets quite intense and thrilling. The final is
not what you'd expect. Maybe the story is not so accurate with real problems, but come on!
it's Sci-Fi, not a documentary. The acting is wonderful, if Oscars were
not preconfigured to drama, Noomi Rapace at least would be nominated.
She portraits seven different personalities, seven different aspects,
virtually seven different personas in one set. Which even though has
some slight flaws is quite an acting showcase. And that needs to be
applauded. (Trust me she did better than Legend, the Tom Hardy one with
the twins). Directors, editors and photography did a great job mixing one person
into seven, again, had some flaws but was good work and needs to be
applauded. Supporting actors were not that great, excluding Marwan Kenzari who did
a good job. Is not a must watch either a blockbuster for the summer,
but it will be a story that you may enjoy any given day.
