What a sad ride.

Seriously... haven't see a movie that make me laugh this much.. What an
awful movie. I usually never write review, but i have to this time.
What kind of mom act like her? I have to turn off the movie halfway
because it would give me stroke to continue watching.Her action as a parent weird. we have a situation when she was talking
in the phone. Was it hard to turn around and watch your kid when you
talk?and then we have the police in the radio, who for some reason were
looking for a red van. Why the lord name would you look only for a red
van when everyone clearly saw that there was also a blue car that:
created traffic accident by speeding thru red light, throw a lot of
stuff and tire out of its car to create massive car collision. and seriously I started to laugh uncontrollably when that dude came out
of the car did a stare-down and flip out the knife and look all
serious. man.. if someone who kidnap my kid, ran down a police, I would
just ran him over without much talking. would love to write more but I
stopped watching there.
