Light hearted action comedy

I enjoyed this for some stress-relief. Yes, it is very vulgar quite
often. But I adore Miranda Hart, Jude Law is some suave damn eye-candy,
Melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action
role. Stratham must have needed something as light relief from his
usual British crime seriousness; he does idiot well, it turns out. And
Rose Byrne was an adorable, lethal, spoilt brat. Just some fun. Maybe I could have done without male porn bits. That
'thing', I don't know if it was real but it was repulsive. Eww.
