Not great (warning spoilers)

Great idea that unfortunately fell short of what I expected. Both lead
characters are made to purposefully fall short in their ability to
outsmart one another by simply being mediocre at being the killer and
the obvious survivor. So you're not so much glued in anticipation to
the outcome, but more so find yourself waiting for the inevitable. The
film loses its ability to scare you as the killer reveals himself too
early, and when he does his face lessens what was already a non
threatening mask. I didn't see any twists or turns and nothing made me
feel surprised or shocked. Which was a shame as I felt the core of this
movie was a fantastic idea.
