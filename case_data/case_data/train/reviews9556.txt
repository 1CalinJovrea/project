can't stand the comparison to SOCIAL NETWORK

Well, plain and simple, to me this has been a fiasco. People not
acquainted to Job's life will have the feeling they're missing
something, and people who have read the book or simply know a little of
Job's life will conclude the movie missed a lot.We'll see Steve bullying on everyone as a dictator running Apple, right
after picturing him as some clear minded wise man with a strong
meditation and spiritual background.The story would have been so strong if only the characters took their
time to develop, and not just showing them to the camera, say their
names and on to the next clip of Jobs and his illuminated doing. I'm
thinking of Wozniak, Job's daughter, Mike, etc.And all that speeding through the story of his life to just finish
halfway of his real success, and end credits appear just to let you
down with all your expectations blasted.
