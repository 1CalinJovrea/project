You won't miss anything..

Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris (Anthony
Mackie) have been friends since childhood, and for a decade, their
yearly Christmas Eve reunion has been an annual night of debauchery and
hilarity. Now that they're entering adulthood, the tradition is coming
to an end, and to make it as memorable as possible, they set out to
find the Nutcracka Ball - the Holy Grail of Christmas parties. The
Night Before is a film that i had a hard time to connect with and trust
me i know that Seth Rogen is not an amazing actor but i've seen some of
his movies and they were at least funny and watchable this one tho it
wasn't and i feel bad about Joseph Gordon Levitt because at that year
he starred in the film The Walk and it was a fantastic film and then he
starred in this, really? Even Anthony Mackie in this movie you know the
Falcon from Winter Soldier and Civil War? Yeah he is in this film too
and there's a bunch of other actors who have cameos like James Franco
(who figured), Tracy Morgan and even Miley Cyrus but to be honest i
didn't know that any of this actors were in this film because i lost my
interest in like 15 minutes and i skipped the whole thing because the
movie was simply boring and dumb.
