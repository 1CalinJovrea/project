miserable

Dark, boring.Most of the movie consists of someone staring into space during gloomy
music contemplating a ridiculous disease.Hard to imagine the long drawn out scenes of nothingness generating
empathy from any thinking person. Will make you feel miserable and waste 90 minutes at the same time.Filling your mind with nonsense like this is no way to go through life. A brain dead movie for the brain dead.So many better ways to use that 90 minutes ;)*****
