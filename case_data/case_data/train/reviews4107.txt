Don't believe the hype - This ones a snoozefest.  Stiff acting, very bad pacing.

The trailers were great, they got me interested, had me excited to
finally see Snow White And The Huntsman but my excitement quickly
turned to disappointment. The movie starts off well showing you how the
Queen came to power and did a good job of introducing her to the
audience but it fell apart soon after that.The acting was very stiff throughout the film, I believe Kristen
Stewart was miscast for the part of Snow White, she doesn't have the
acting chops to play even a semi serious role like this one. She should
stick to the Twilight series.The pacing of the film also just felt off. Their are a lot of anti
climatic scenes such as the ending, it just leaves you wanting more or
wondering what they could of done to make this a better movie.Dialogue throughout the movie was pretty bad as well, people in my
theater only laughed once or twice and that was during a scene that
wasn't even intended to be funny.Most critics praised Therons performance, but she really just whined
the entire time and was over the top, she didn't really deliver, but
she was the best part of the film.4/10
