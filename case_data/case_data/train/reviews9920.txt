Just Not an Underworld Movie. . .

This movie was, at best, mediocre. The action was good, I suppose, but
it simply wasn't as good as its three predecessors. The plot was
underdeveloped and unsatisfying. Also, without Speedman, it was really
just missing something.The story was, quite simply, lacking. It's difficult to explain this
film's shortcomings without spoiling it, but, to say the least, they
ignored elements that could have made a good movie and skipped to
rather simple, unsatisfying plot devices. This movie was also absurdly
short, testifying to its lack of content.In the end, it just didn't feel like Underworld. I would compare this
to the way I felt about The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Indiana
Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and Pirates of the
Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - just an out of place fourth movie of a
series. I really wanted it to be good, but it just wasn't.
