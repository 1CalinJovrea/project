The Re-birth of Horror Genre!!!!!

Going into this movie I expected much less than what the typical horror
movie Genre is today in this generation. Well I will be damned!!! I had
tickets to go see an early screening of this movie and let me tell you
from Men to Women everyone was tense in the audience. Lots of people
jumping in their seats and screams as well. This movie hit the spot
from the acting which was sub-par from the evil entity. I give this
movie a 10 out of 10. Most people should really give it a try it is
worth the money for sure. The film is only 85 minutes which was a
downfall but I will take it versus a 2 hour horror movie that is boring
till no end. If the media is calling Conjuring 2 horror then Lights Out
must be in a different horror category because it is def. SCARY!!!!
