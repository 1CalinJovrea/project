Effects!

What was with the visual effects? They were garbage! it was like they
threw the Creeper into a bad SyFy channel movie. Some times his wings
looked awful and the crows looks like Halloween store props. What was
with those overly cartoony Mario Cart balls? Overall, I am glad to see
the Creeper back. But i am very let down with the movie. Especially
with how long we waited for it. I hope they learn from this and make
the 4th HUGE and this is just a bridge to set it up. Also, most of the
acting was laughable.
