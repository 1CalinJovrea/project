A perfectly crafted mystery & thriller from Spain

A very exciting thriller with many interesting and surprised
fluctuations which probably even had puzzled Hitchcock but also made
him proud.The film is very classic, almost old-fashioned, and it flirts healthy
and often with particularly mentioned the horror master. The story
moves very smoothly between Film Noir, and more traditional
contemporary thriller."The Body" is about a woman's dead body disappears from the morgue. The
husband of the deceased woman, quickly becomes a target of both, the
murder of his wife and stealing the body. He was called to the scene to
assist with the investigation. The interrogations led by the right
shady Commissar, with his own dim past and hearings interspersed with
flashbacks of the couple's life, which is played in various flashbacks.Everything takes place in a proper rainy night in the morgue and the
surroundings could hardly be more nasty and claustrophobic. The film
really works admirably well and fooling with the viewer, exactly where
it wants. The script is well written and although certainly a gap or
two can be found, don't bother to look when you are in the middle,
instead of being frightened and follow the clues presented.The film is directed by Oriol Paulo, who two years ago-wrote sovereign
"Julia's Eyes" in which Belen Rueda plays Julia and in "The Body" she
plays the unsympathetic Mayka (the deceased), an incredibly believable
performance. There are good actors in all roles and although sometimes
the commissar is near the border of caricature so successful balancing
act and it never gets too much.The last scene when everything unraveled is somewhat contrived.
Everything needs was not unfolded and some unanswered questions are
good to keep a little spice, but despite the somewhat pedagogical
explanations in the end, everything leading up to it wonderfully
confusing and nerve wracking as well, as I really hope to get jump-to
more such films by Oriol Paulo ahead.7.5/10.
