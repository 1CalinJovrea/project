Best movie I've seen all year

Intrigued by the trailer, I was expecting, as usually, to be let down
by the actual movie. Didn't happen.I really liked it's non-linear progression, which managed to not be
annoying and made sense. But didn't give the whole game away either.The pace was engaging - not too fast to where it's just bash-bang- boom
and no time to pull you along on the journey and not so slow that
you're staring at characters .Also, a big question in the movie is the main guy's motivation for his
actions - various characters wonder and ask him directly. While
typically the reveal would form a big emotional piece of the plot or
would do a 4 second cutaway to a simple explanatory scene, the makers
of this movie managed to resist the easy answer and instead left us
guessing as well. Thus, making the guy seem even more of a mystery and
making the mystery of his motivations itself a theme.Even the relationship with his son - an unavoidable theme - was
surprising and seemed fresh.It was also interesting to see the idea of how a good guy turns bad and
enters the underworld in such a compelling way - the wannabe
psychologist attraction.
