Snyder misses the mark yet again

Just as with every previous film, Snyder's grandiose visuals supersede
and essentially suffocate any opportunities for intriguing plot,
character development, or anything beyond CGI extravagance. The film
presented too much and not enough simultaneously. The visual effects,
dream sequences, and other traditional tropes of an action drama stood
in the way of getting to know or care much about what is going on in
this "universe."PROS - Ben Affleck was a decent Bruce Wayne / Batman. - Henry Cavill
remains a solid choice for Superman. - Aqua Man was barely shown. -
Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburn, and Jeremy Irons were all solid in their
minor roles. - If you're into special effects, you'll probably enjoy
the absurd amount showcased in this film. CONS - Jesse Eisenberg - Snyder apparently forgot that Batman does NOT
kill people - The "battle" between Batman and Superman lasted
approximately five minutes of the 151 minute run time. - Batman's
origin story is repeated and used to accent a major point within the
film. - Far too much focus on Lois Lane (three heroes and she still
shows up and plays a role in nearly every major battle sequence) - Lack
of story and character development - Various plot holes - Ad naseum...This is likely the last superhero film I will waste my time viewing, as
the superhero "team" concept is already abysmal. Showcasing numerous
heroes / super humans in one film takes away from the development, and
therefore, the connection to the hero. "Oh well" says Hollywood; we're
still making a killing!
