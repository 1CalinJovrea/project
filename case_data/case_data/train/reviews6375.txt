worth seeing for so many reasons

When I saw the trailer of Atomic Blonde I really wanted to see it but
being on holidays it was out of the theatre as quick as it came in,
strange, because now that it is available in the shops I really liked
this action flick.But of course I am not a normal person, i mean, look, some will tear
this down for so many reasons because it isn't your average Hollywood
flick. Therefor the lighting and the way it was shot doesn't fit in for
the 'normal viewer'.But if you are open minded for special way of editing with the score
used then it's worth picking up. For me it was a trip down memory lane.
Seeing Berlin back with the wall, but the soundtrack used was really
making me happy, Siouxsie, Flock of Seagulls, Bowie, Nena,...if they
should used Einsturzende Neubauten it would made it complete. Naturally there's the flick itself. I liked it a lot, Charlize Theron
is stunning again, and knowing her age she is worth seeing here. But
not only that, all acting is superb. Of course Charlize in a flick
means mostly seeing her in her nudies and she does it a few times even
in a steaming scene with Sofia Boutella (Delphine Lasalle). A new
actress worth noticing. Just coming out of Star Trek Beyond (2016) and
know moving further in The Mummy (2017). The story is believable and
has a few twists.Worth picking up especially for those who had their youth in the
eighties. Tear down these walls is a sentence you will recognize from
then, I liked this flick a lot. Gore 1,5/5' Nudity 1,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5
