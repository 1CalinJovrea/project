Crashed but didn't burn

Flight is one of those movies where the trailer makes you feel like you
know what you're in for, only to find out the movie has nothing to do
with a plane crash or planes in general.Sure the plane does crash, and the premise of the film starts off with
revolving around what actually happened with the plane. However, even
the opening scene starts to fill you in on the main characters
intentions and moral standing throughout the film. If it wasn't for
Denzel playing Whip, his character would have gone nowhere, since by
all accounts he is a very unlikeable guy. Denzel does bring some warmth
and a friendly face to the uncomfortable crass moments of Whip. Finding
out this screenplay sat around in Hollywood for awhile until Denzel
sparked interest is not really a big surprise. Other than Denzel and a
few moments of Goodman's always enjoyable on screen moments, this film
is flat. It's about a drug/alcohol addict "hero" who never seems to
really give us what we want as an audience (a moment to cheer for
Whip).This film is a by-the-book redemption film, but done better by Johnny
Depp in "Blow". The cast sort of just deflates around the script, and a
lot of unnecessary "Jesus" moments which start to feel like a hidden
agenda for the writers. The female lead, a recovering drug/porn
star?/lost her way, is also very boring. She offers little to no real
connection to the audience, only aiding in predictable "my life is now
saved" pictures on Whips jail wall at the end of the film. The film itself is watchable, it's not a total failure in the technical
aspect. There is a rise and fall and entertaining moments. But it is
very boring, this is one to watch on Netflix when there is nothing else
to do. I would really like to see Denzel in a much more compelling and
interesting material. The guy is incredible, hence his nomination, but
very obviously under utilized by this material.
