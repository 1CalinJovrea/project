You could rename this movie Final Destination 6 and no one would know

This is probably the worst TV to Movie adaptation out there, and I
watched the Last Airbender. Tried too hard to be edgy and just turned
into a Final Destination rip off with bad effects, choppy editing and a
death god who looked more like a burn victim. The Charatizarion and
motives were all awful and completely wrong and the stupid twists were
cheap and predictable. Just do not waste your time.
