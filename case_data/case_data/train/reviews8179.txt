Absolutely Excellent

OMG WOW! This movie certainly took me by surprise! I was left with no
words by the end of it for how well Ben Young executed this. The story
of a predator couple in the neighborhood blended brilliantly with the
characters chosen to execute their role. The movie was an edge of the
seat thriller that burns into your mind on how dangerous human thoughts
can be. The camera work, location, dialogues, characters and the music?
OMG the nights in satin song at that moment when her drink was drugged
was like dope! Pure Dope! There is never a moment in this movie that
doesn't leave you drowsy, you're curious about the next part every
moment. All I can say is for a Director who I know nothing about and characters
that I haven't even heard of, this movie can take on any Hollywood
thriller by the neck! If you're a fan of thriller movies, especially
one's that melt you into the mind of the characters, then this movie is
for you! I will watch this again for how brilliantly it was made. Ben
Young and team, KUDOS!
