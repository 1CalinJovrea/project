Patrick,

I was impressed with the overall tone of your film - so much so that I
checked out your credentials at Wikipedia. A few things just didn't add
up for me with this movie and perhaps these can be addressed in future
installments. 1. Where is Josef getting his money from? Trust fund
baby? The call from his sister added a nice layer of tension but if
such a danger, 2. Why is Josef not in a psychiatric hospital? Did he
escape, buy a cell phone, call his sister and she's then calling him
back? Again, where is this money coming from?? I'm going to assume that
Josef obtained Aaron's address via the towing company but this is also
a question that lingers. Finally, Aaron is spooked enough to sit in his
car upon first meeting Josef and yet he doesn't sit in his car for
their final meeting after everything has gone down -and- he sits so
comfortably on a bench that he can't even be bothered to look to his
left or right. What is that? I would like to rate this movie higher as
I think it's original and indeed creepy - just wished it had been
airtight.
