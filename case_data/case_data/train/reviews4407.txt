Moar like Notso Hidden Agenda....amirite?

Let's be frank here. They could have made the three black, female leads
read out the telephone listings for two hours and this hokum would have
been nominated for an Oscar. It is extremely clich√©d, agenda-driven,
pedestrian twoddle. The movie's devoid of any feeling with its filmsy,
cookie-cutter characters and hackneyed, tedious plot. It's just a
typical throwaway blockbuster splurged out by Hollywood without any
creative thought applied. There's no humour, excitement, originality,
nothing, nada. It reminded me of last year's similarly banal Oscar
nomination Bridge of Spies, in that it should be nowhere near any
awards, but it is far worse. It took me countless hours and about 8 attempts to persevere through
it. I'm not quite sure what the mental capability is of the intended
audience, but it would take something at the larva stage of
metamorphosis to find this in any way engaging. Everything about this
is forced, with the music trying to squeeze emotion out of the
audience, but failing miserably. It also rams down the audience's
throat the interesting revelation that everyone at NASA (i.e. all the
white people), aside from these three women, were incontinent
ignoramuses. After watching the magnificent Lion, which has real
feeling permeating through every scene, this was just a complete
disaster. 1/10
