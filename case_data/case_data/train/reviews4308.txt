Comic-book cinema how it should be: fun!

So often, the third movie in a blockbuster series such as this proves
to be a disappointment, but I found Iron Man 3 to be just as
entertaining as the previous two films, if not more so. It's full on
entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden
set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to
take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.Most importantly, perhaps, it's laugh out loud funny, which, in turn,
means it's a lot more fun overall than many a recent superhero movie. I
came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought
to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought
provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's
light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more
outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is
turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money
than ever before.I do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that
they might not be making a part four. As far as I am concerned, they
could keep on making Iron Man movies indefinitely just so long as they
are as enjoyable as this one.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.
