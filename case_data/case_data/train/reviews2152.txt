A bad film is a bad film

I like the idea of this film, go back to the original and continue. The
idea is exciting after a bunch of mediocre sequel/prequels.This movie is good for around ten minutes... and then you are
introduced to the main actors (if you can call them that).They look good, hot bodies and the camera man definitely focuses on
cleavage and butt shots.That is the only positive I can find. The negative: There is no talent, the actors have no chemistry, the
idea is wasted but worst of all there is no pace to the story, no
suspense or anything of the original movie that made it good.Avoid at all cost.
