Why?

Why would they remake a film by the master? The whole idea behind
remaking films is to remake something that was maybe a good idea but
had bad execution. The original Oldboy is a 10 top to bottom, story,
script, action, actors, direction, why did they try to remake
perfection. Josh Brolin is good but when you start comparing him to the pain and
anguish Min-Sik Choi convaed in the Korean version there is no way to
compare the two. Also I like Spike Lee and some of his work but he was
the wrong choice for this. Still not sure who thought this was a good idea, it's like eating a
McRib when you can have Korean BBQ, which one sounds better to you.
Watch the Korean version.
