Good quality sci fi horror

Just got back from seeing this and I have to say that I thought it was
a really good film.I see that RT only has it at 65% and it's being made out to be a cheap
Alien clone but I think that is doing it a dis-service. I felt it was
intelligently made, set characters and situations well and created a
palpable sense of tension. Criticism that it's a blatant re-run of
Alien are unjustified. Granted, it's about an alien life form in space
but that to me is where the similarity ends.Alien isn't the only scary film set in space that is allowed to be made
and if Prometheus is anything to go by, Ridley has no right to be the
only person allowed to make sci-fi horror films. It captured well the
excitement of discovery, the wonder of space and the precariousness of
facing any problems up there.The effects were good, you could see what was going on, there was
unease and dread and it kept me thoroughly absorbed and entertained. I
don't want to elaborate anymore for fear of giving away spoilers but if
you like a bit of tension with your sci-fi, it's worth checking out.
Try to avoid the critic reviews if you can as I think going in a little
blind will help your enjoyment.
