no suspense, predictable outcome

Sorry for the wasted time. No idea where the good ratings come from.
Repeatedly we see women taking a shower but unlike in "Psycho" they are
just taking a shower - o.k., the girl masturbates, obviously turned on
by the killings (or started the killing aftewards?). Its not worth
talking about so I will not go into detail. Just another bad movie. To
make it 10 lines (that's the minimum length, I've just been told): Is
there or is the not a head in the freezer? How does the boy get on top
of the girl (rape!) after he's been tied up by the uncle and kicked by
the niece - did they just arrange it to make the neck-breaking more
spectacular? So, that will be 10 lines if I manage to finish this one -
I refuse to add anything more about the film.
