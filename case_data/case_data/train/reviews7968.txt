One of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time

I was very excited to see this movie both because of the style of the
film and because of Tarantino's endorsement of the film. After much
anticipation I saw the film and was more than disappointed. The entire
film just felt like it lacked a director.The movie begins with an hour long introduction of the plot which has
nothing to do with the character it is named after. It was extremely
cheesy and not in the fun obvious sort of way but more like it was done
by mistake. The movie felt like it was filmed in a month and all of the
characters were never given an opportunity to develop. It was a very
busy movie, especially when it came down to the action scenes. Although
there is plenty of action, I felt like I was watching a "Bourne" film
due to the constant shaking of the camera and the sloppy transitions.The fighting was not technical. The typical Kung Fu-esque flying
through the air was clumsy instead of smooth and elegant. All of the
lines in the movie were awe full. The plot was stupid and forced. The
Chinese David Bowie villain could not be taken seriously.And the worst most annoying part of the movie was the digital blood
splatters. Every time someone was stabbed, digital blood would squirt
out of the wound completely enveloping the screen in red but not
getting on any of the characters or furniture in the movie.I hated this movie a lot and others in the theater seemed to feel the
same way as throughout the movie people constantly kept walking out and
not coming back. Please don't watch this movie.Thank you
