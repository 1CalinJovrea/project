Dull as dull can be

Like watching paint dry. Boring to a mind-numbing degree. How many
times can we see Katniss be horrified and/or emotionally distraught?
Maybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their
characters. Well, they were wrong. Instead we, the audience, sit
through one scene after another in which really nothing happens at all.
This whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes
and then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the
film. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they
could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with
these franchises. Not good storytelling.
