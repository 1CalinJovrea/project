Genius.

I can't actually understand why so many people rate this movie so low.
It has everything. Just, everything.It starts light, introducing the characters, it starts building
storyline, gradually the humor and comedy between the characters
becomes more and more fluent.After the build-up and introduction, there is the storyline. And the
storyline just unfolds so brilliantly. I love how every character has
it's own unique differences, it's like a family not made for each
other, but completely lost without each other.The ending is just undeniably great, it's one of the better movies I
have seen in a long time. Jason Bateman by the way, was born for this
role. The movie would have been one big flop if that man wasn't in it.
Jason Bateman just makes everything seem a little better.
