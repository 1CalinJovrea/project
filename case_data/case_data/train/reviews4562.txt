Is Amy Shumer supposed to be funny?

Is Amy Schumer supposed to be funny? She IS sophomoric, juvenile,
vulgar, and crass. Seems Schumer's character, "Amy", was only
interested in the number of anonymous guys she could bed and how many
times she could say the F word. At times it tried to be a romantic
comedy other times it was just about how raw it could be and wandered
aimlessly.Schumer wrote this literal "Trainwreck", which was most appropriately
named! My wife told me to quit looking at my watch, but all I could
think about was the end of the movie and where I could eat afterwards.
Maybe it would have been more palatable if I wasn't so hungry, even a
large popcorn couldn't help! Bill Hader was the sole light in this very
dark tunnel. LeBron needs some acting lessons, he was really stiff, as
well as all of the other sports "cameos". Colin Quinn was OK, but he's
never been one of my favorites. Vanessa Bayer played the good stooge,
their male counterparts at S'nuff were just filler and added little.
Swinton's character was just a clich√©.And John Cena, what the H, he and Schumer's sex scene seemed to just be
there for the "R" rating, as if this would save this Trainwreck! I
mean, a thing the size of a p-nut because of roids, really, would the
slut Amy have put up with that? All around, a huge disappointment and
waste of time.
