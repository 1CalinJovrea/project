Not enjoyable, not funny, poorly acted. Great time waster

There's nothing funny going on. I love open or subtle humor but this
has nothing. Cant believe the performance by Daniel Craig in James Bond
and now the work in this one was really kind of bad. There is nothing
clever about the heist, they take time during a critical point for him
to explain what he is doing and writing a formula on the wall. With
timing being important in any such movie, these guys can waste more
time then waiting at the DMV. The prison scene also is unbelievable,
people just carry things out without ever considering that they might
even be compensated. No one gets screwed everyone is happy in lala
land. These actors who were good in other movies just cant pull
anything off in this one. I guess you have to be from the areas
mentioned to think this movie is any good.
