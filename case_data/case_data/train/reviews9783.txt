Brilliant and creepy

I had no idea what to expect from 'Maniac' i had never seen or heard of
the original movie, i came across this remake whilst checking out other
users watch lists and the title alone had my interest.Honestly though i had my doubts about this movie because when i see
Elijah Wood i instantly think of Lord of The Rings i was intrigued to
see if he could pull off the role of a psychopathic killer.So what did i think?Epic! Firstly the music throughout the movie is awesome, there are moments
when the soundtrack sounds like something from 'A Clockwork Orange' its
dark and really creates an atmosphere of sinisterness.Elijah Wood is perfect for this role his voice and delivery of the
script is great. The movie is shot from the killers point of view (POV)
but the moments when you actually see Elijah Wood he looks perfect for
this role, strange, disturbed out of place and mentally unstable.The violence is not excessive in its amount but it is extremely brutal
in its detail, it wasn't easy to watch the scalping without cringing
and i have a strong threshold for movie gore, this was just brutal and
in your face, it was great because very few films get to me in this
way.If you like psycho movies and brutal gore then you'll love this movie
like i did.'Maniac' is easily one of my favorite psycho killer movies of all time,
my girlfriend (who actually loves horror and can handle gore) has vowed
never to watch 'Maniac' again because it made her feel so
uncomfortable... aw!
