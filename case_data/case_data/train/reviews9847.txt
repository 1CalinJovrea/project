Simply Awful

In short, a comedy without any comedy. While I regularly enjoy
disgusting remarks in movies, I was often laughing at how bad the jokes
in That's My Boy were rather than at their humor. Between Adam Sandler
jacking off to an elderly woman, and the uncreative quips made about
the statutory rape involving him and his teacher, I felt embarrassed
for the actors who had to deliver the ultimately atrocious lines. And
just when I thought the movie couldn't get any worse, it threw a
horrific curve ball with the incorporation of incest to heighten the
conflict between the bride and groom-to-be. The insertion of this was
not only distasteful, but a weak attempt to add originality and
intrigue to the already ridiculous plot line. That's My Boy is yet
another representation of Adam Sandler's downfall as an actor, and
modern cinema's desperation to push the limits too far past socially
acceptable. An overwhelming disappointment.
