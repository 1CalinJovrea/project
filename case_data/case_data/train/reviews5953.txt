Funny !? Really?

After a misleading Trailer I gave this "Comedy" a chance. To be honest
this is the worst movie I have ever seen. You can only laugh about the
"jokes" if you still have the humor of a 14 year old who is just
reaching puberty. Seriously. Every joke is based on penis, pussy, flat
sex and even shitting on your partner. Even the allusions towards other
movies are so horribly done that there is no way to compare this level
with a Tarantino style.If this is how the Hollywoods "Crème de la Crème" defines self-irony
they have lost all my respect.In Short: A Vicarious Embarrassment
