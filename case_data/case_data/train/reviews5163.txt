Intense, Emotional, Controversial and yet Engaging

When it comes to true story films, there are times where film-makers
try to add more or less into what really happened in the event being
told. In this case, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper has already
contracted not only positive acclaim but a stir of negativity and
controversy that surrounds the way Kyle was really like in life. Some
say he had lost his mind in the war for peace while others say he was
caught up in the emotional aftermath after service but Eastwood has
stated that his film is "the biggest anti-war statement any film can
make," and said that "the fact of what war does to the family and the
people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did"What AS tells is the true life figure Chris Kyle who served as the
American military's 'lethal sniper' who has made more kills in his duty
of tours during the Iraq war period after 9/11. It chronicles how Chris
became a true American to protect his homeland and the aftermath of
serving his tours when he came home to his small growing family,
leading up to the final hours of his life.Pros:+ Bradley Cooper's portrayal of Chris Kyle is indeed a new height for
his career, he gives a performance that can be described as gripping,
tense and at times+ The action sequences are all done well, but at times it can be tense,
violent and confronting for some.+ The emotional connection between the main character and his family,
that the final scene that will either break you or make you undecided.Cons:- The controversy that surrounds it, it can make the film an
exaggerated lie or truth to what Kyle was like in reality but again it
is showing what war can do on people on the front-line and home.OVERALL: Despite the controversy it has gained by writers , the film is
indeed a strong acting showcase for Cooper while leaving audiences both
open and more aware of the effects of war on human kind. Go in with an
open mind and see for yourself for what you would think that made Chris
Kyle a 'lethal sniper' for this country. If you had liked The Hurt
Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and Machine Gun Preacher (not a war film but
somewhat similar to Kyle's story) you will enjoy this.
