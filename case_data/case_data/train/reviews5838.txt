The Guest is coming back home.

David Collins is a charming soldier who has recently been discharged
from service.He befriends the Peterson family claiming that their
deceased in action son Caleb was his friend during war.The loss of
Caleb turned the Peterson family into dysfunctional group of people.At
first David tries to help each member of the Peterson family to solve
her/his problems-even with the use of brutal violence.But there's
something not right about the family's new guest.Writer Simon Barrett
and director Adam Wingard obviously are in love with 70's and 80's
action movies and slasher flicks."The Guest" mixes elements of intense
action thriller,black comedy and slasher flick.It's obviously
influenced by "Halloween" series,"The Stepfather","First Blood" and
"Rolling Thunder".The cast is exceptionally good but Dan Stevens steals
the show as David.The electronic soundtrack is excellent and there are
some classy songs of The Sisters of Mercy,Front 242,Hocico and Clan of
Xymox playing during various film scenes.8 killing machines out of 10.
