How somebody can think this is a good movie is beyond me

This movie is absolute trash. I am a huge fan of the franchise,
including the first two installments of the reboot. This film was
incredibly disappointing. The plot was almost non-existent, the pacing
was all over the place, the tone kept juggling and the development was
forced. It felt like they had no clue how to end the trilogy, so they threw
together a ton of walking inserts, and landscape shots with sprinkles
of action sequences sparingly used throughout. Slow movies do not
bother me but pretentious garbage like this film is entirely not
watchable. The solid cinematography and good use of CGI to not make up
for the nonsensical plot. Do yourself a favor and wait on this one. Believe all the bad reviews,
I was anxiously awaiting the release of the film, only to be let down.
Biggest disappointment of the summer by far.
