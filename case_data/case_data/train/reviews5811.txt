Unique comedy

To me, Absolutely Anything is a very unique comedy. This didn't seem
like a film I would normally like, I figured aliens in a comedy would
be pretty stupid. The 6.0 rating was also kind of off putting but I
decided to give it a go as I generally like Simon Pegg films.Simon Pegg plays schoolteacher Neil who lives home alone with his dog
Dennis (voiced superbly by Robin Williams). Neil is chosen by a group
of aliens as part of an experiment and is given the power to do
absolutely anything. Chaos ensues as Neil begins to use his power.There are a lot of very funny moments in the film such as walking
turds, the dead rising and Neil changing his body while looking in the
mirror. However most of the laughs come a little later on in the film
when he gives his dog the power to speak. Robin Williams had me in
stitches at various points with the way he described certain characters
and kept talking about biscuits and sh*#*#* Kate Beckinsale plays
Neil's neighbour with a lot of charm but thankfully the film doesn't
focus too much on making the two of them a major love story. I came
solely for laughs and that's what I got.Overall it's a very funny & enjoyable film with a unique story. I feel
it could have been explored further as there was plenty more that
could've been done with the power. Could've easily been 30 minutes
longer and I'd still find it funny, perhaps even a mini series could
work but for now the film is very good as it is. Highly recommended for
those in need of a laugh, as long as you don't take it too seriously
and look for negative points. Just simply enjoy it for what it is.8/10.
