A Feel-Good Comedy That Reminds Us That BFFs > Bros

I love love love this movie! I figured that it would be fun to watch,
because you can't go wrong with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann as the
lead characters...but it exceeded my expectations by like 2-3 stars. My
boyfriend even caught himself belly-laughing out loud a handful of
times during this movie. It was just what I needed: a lighthearted,
feel-good comedy that ultimately becomes a story about female
friendship and self-empowerment. If you're a girl who's ever been
betrayed, felt insecure, down in the dumps, or felt like you've lost
the upper-hand in a relationship, go see this movie! It will pick you
up, dust you off, give you a pep talk, and remind you of how important
it is to have good girl friends that make you laugh and pick you up
when you're down. It might also make you paranoid that your perfectly
charming husband is having a secret affair... but try not to let it
have that effect on you. :)
