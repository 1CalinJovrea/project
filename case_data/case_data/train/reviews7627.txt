A farewell with a bang.

I saw Furious 7 at a SXSW screening. The sudden death of Paul Walker
shocked his fans and the people who were setting hopes for another F&F
movie. Well, James Wan and his crew managed to pull it together using
CGI and stunt doubles. I have to say, it was a bigger stake here than
Furious 6, which felt more bang- bang than a GOOD movie. If you are
looking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and
violence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in
Dubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars
being driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah!
What wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious
and Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes
with a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez
feels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson
is the worst, with his "cool guy" attitude and "bad boy" clich√©
character. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is
refreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be
watched.
