The Beguiled is a yawn-fest. Or, act two is a great time for a nap

Honestly, I can appreciate a slow building drama that takes its time to
build characters. Unfortunately, this remake of the film gives us very
little in the way of conflict or tension after the setup and
introduction of the characters.There is some decent acting here from the cast, but I found it nearly
impossible to see any detail in their faces due to the choice of
shooting in very low light or artificially creating the effect in post.
While I can't place blame entirely on the film as our local theater may
have had issues with their projection system. Still, I prefer to see
the expressions in actor's faces, otherwise I might as well be
listening to a radio play.The film could have been a full stop brighter and adding some fill
light on the faces still would have allowed the look to be dark and
drab as it was apparently intended.By the time we get to the third act we still aren't rooting for our
protagonist and frankly it's not completely clear until the climax that
it's supposed to be Kidman's character. The editing is unimpressive.This remake of "The Beguiled" isn't anything special. I suspect the
jurors who awarded Coppola "Cannes Best Director Award" must have not
have seen the film. For me it was best summed up by a phrase I
overheard by a nearby audience member, "Is that it?". Yes... I'm afraid
so.
