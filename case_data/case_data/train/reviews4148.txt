most definitely overrated

the first half hour of this film is very good if a bit slow, once the
pig is taken away and our little heroine goes after her it all goes
downhill, it then turns into a pretty standard Disney/kids film, the
difference is the really bad dialogue, everything is overstated many
times, this is a cultural thing as it is the style of films from the
east, subtlety is not their thing. the acting by Tilda Swinton and Jake
Gyllenhall is so over the top, that and they have to spout really bad
clich√©d dialogue, i don't understand the rave reviews here and by the
critics, it is not original in any way, it is far too long and drawn
out, shame as it started out quite well.
