Totally under-rated

While many have claimed this title does not offer much that the others
of this particular genre do, I have to disagree. This is a heartwarming
story with genuine dialog between characters. Some of these
conversations and interactions I have experienced firsthand. The
cinematography captures the specific details that both add to the
dialog and allow you to pick up more the second time around. The acting
is very believable albeit a little over emphasized for comedy at times.
The first time I saw this I had wished they rewrote a few of the lines,
but after my second watch they seem fitting for the character and what
they were going through at the time. I really did not like Phillip, and
now I have come to realize he is that juvenile person frequently found
in families. I approached this film without any prior knowledge of it
and was pleasantly surprised. I concede it was not amazing, and given
the cast list may spark high expectations for some, but going into any
movie that way will leave you disappointed.
