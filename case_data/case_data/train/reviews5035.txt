What a Spider-Man movie should always be

Let me start by saying Spider-Man Homecoming is an absolute blast. It's
everything you could want from a Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland did a
fantastic job as Spider-Man. He was an interesting, lovable Peter
Parker and an absolutely classic Spider-Man. Michael Keaton was an
exceptional vulture. You couldn't ask for a better actor to play him.
This also had a lot of very comedic moments so if you enjoy comedies,
this would be a good movie to see. This is how Spider-Man should always
be. Lovable, funny, kind of awkward and witty and that's exactly what
we get from this movie that we didn't fully get in The Amazing
Spider-Man movies. I noticed some people were comparing to Spider-Man 2
and saying which one was better. I think they are both awesome but they
are also very different in certain ways. Overall, this is a fun flick
for the whole family to watch. Not much more you could have asked for.
