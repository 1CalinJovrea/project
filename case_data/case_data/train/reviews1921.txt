been there; done that

I have to start by saying that I was looking forward to this movie. The
first previews hinted at a great story. I mus say that I was sorely
disappointed by this flick, today. I would warn you that there are
spoilers in this review, but someone spoiled this movie long before I
got here.The characters are flat. The story itself just doesn't pull together.
For example, Tom Cruise's character is a human "technician" that must
somehow be required to repair machines that were originally built BY
machines to destroy humans. How does THAT make any sense? So imagine an unimaginative Tom Cruise movie that took a dab of 2001: A
Space Odyssey, a pinch of the Borg from Star Trek, a bit of post-
apocalyptic mankind from Mad Max, a smidgen of pod racing from Star
Wars, a bit of The Matrix and a dash of Independence Day. Mix well, let
steep until rotten, project on a screen at $8 or more a pop. Trust me: you've seen this movie done better. Avoid until it's on Blue
Ray for $1.50. You won't be any less disappointed, but you'll still
have the cash in your pocket to risk on a movie better than this one.
