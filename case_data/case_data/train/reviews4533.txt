All Too Obvious Oscar Bait

As Jack O'Connoll was getting acclaim for his performance in Brit
thriller '71 towards the end of last year his star was beginning to
burn even brighter by getting the lead role in Angelina Jolie's
upcoming UNBROKEN . Cue lots of interviews with Jackie boy along the
lines of "so what's it like working with Angelina ?" along with hints
the film was going to be a major contender at the Oscars . Of all the
films from last year this was the obvious Oscar bait . So obvious in
fact that there's an element it might have alienated the voters in to
searching around in independent cinema for its winners O'Connoll plays Luis Zamperini an American from an Italian immigrant
family who becomes an Olympic athlete . While he's at the peak of his
career war breaks out and enlists as a bombardier of a B-25 and finds
himself flying missions in the Pacific where he's shot down and spends
several weeks in a life raft where he's captured by a passing Japanese
ship and put in to a brutal POW camp This is the sort of movie that has the Oscar academy falling over
themselves to throw awards at - an epic true life story of the triumph
of the human spirit . Or rather it used to and for many years the
Academy has been rather unpredictable and somewhat surprising in what
its tastes are and what films they nominate and give awards to and
there's a strong element in UNBROKEN that it's maybe trying a little
too hard , almost as if it's looking at prospective awards ceremonies
with sad puppy dog eyes pleading for prestigious recognition . There's
also an element that nowadays the second world war is almost as well
remembered as say The Napoleonic or Crimean wars and war films
featuring WWII need to bring something a little bit different to the
table such as the outstanding technical achievements of SAVING PRIVATE
RYAN , the no holds barred war porn of FURY , or the post modernist
lunacy of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS . In comparison UNBROKEN comes across as
being traditional almost to the point of being painfully old hat Not to be too negative UNBROKEN has a well structured screenplay by the
Coen brothers , the sadistic brutally of the Japanese is emphasised ,
Roger Deakins once again shows us he's the best cinematographer working
today and O'Connoll is Luis Zamperini and never thought for a second I
was watching a young British up and coming actor playing an all
American hero . That said it its motive with having one eye on awards
means there's something missing that makes it an outstanding film and
it's never better than being a competent tale about surviving against
all the odds
