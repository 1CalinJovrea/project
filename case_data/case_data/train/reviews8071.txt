Very dull action movie by Sean Penn.

I don't think I ever saw Sean Penn do an action movie.Not sure if he's at that point in his career were he does not care or
he just feels he can't be a well diverse actor without having this on
his resume.Either way he does a good performance as one, and was impressively
built but not overdone for the role.The movie does go over some political satire with his character playing
a Metaphor of the guilt we all should all feel about our own
involvement in what's going on in the Congo.Guess he felt this will be a better way to spread his word to the
masses. Penn was wrong about that. I got very little from this flick.Although the movie is mostly laid with espionage and sprinkled with
action, neither elements got my pulse pounding.Javier Barton is good in this movie. He's a great actor and it's fun to
see him on the big screen as Penn's rival for the affections of a
woman. But if you are fans of Idris Elba, like I am, don't let his top billing
fool you. He's barely in it, and his role does nothing to help the
film.I like the film but I snoozed though it. Penn brought nothing new to
the genre and I was hoping he would but he did not. Catch on DVD.
