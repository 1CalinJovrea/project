Awful and very offensive movie!

Waste of money, waste of time watching it in the cinemas. But apart
from that, it was so embarrassing and offensive to go to a movie and
get frustrated for seeing so many commercial for apple products and for
being forced so see unexpected scenes with the hard use of cocaine
being snorted by Cameron Diaz herself like she was paid for trying to
brain wash people watching the movie with such killing stuff for our
society nowadays. If you don't want to feel bad after a movie so please
don't watch this one which is not at all funny. I didn't know companies
such as apple would get their brand involved in such a negative movie
with no sense of what the world really needs. Our world has already a
lot of negative things happening killing our kids, teenagers and our
society so to come to see the things you are not expecting is not a
pleasant idea . Our society needs inspiring movies that could teach who
is watching good behaviour and not what this movie sold that was like
the use o cocaine was fine and normal, etc. Please World let's wake up
and not be brain washed by the Hollywood industry. Apart from that all
the vulgar and offensive scenes being played by such big names like
Cameron Diaz.... Terrible, Terrible, Terrible! I want my money back! So
sorry!
