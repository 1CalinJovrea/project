Not Bad At All

What is there to say? This is a musical comedy about love, rock, music
industry absurdities, complete with aging
god-of-rock-at-the-very-lonely-top, with the cast actually singing
quite well... I enjoyed every minute of it.Ignore the bashers. Ignore the thin plot. Ignore the complaints about
the movie not being what a musical should be - when compared to such
and such another movie. Just sit back, take it with a grain of salt,
and enjoy, the very nicely mixed-into-medley 80's Rock 'n Roll hits;
all extravagantly presented for your entertainment.The movie is worth your time; if only for the breath of fresh air that
it provides, and of course, that priceless Ga-Ga-puppy-eyed-look of
Julianne Hough when up close and personal with Tom Cruise's Stacee
Jaxx. That was money all by itself.Tom Cruise was excellent as rock-god; Julianne Hough did a believable
sweet & innocent-small-town-girl-in-love. Alec Baldwin's character did
slightly weird me out, in a funny way. The movie rocks.
