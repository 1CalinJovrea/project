Propaganda with a bow on it

Olympus Has Fallen was a far better movie. I'm tired of seeing the
nuclear football being used over and over again in films. The president
was immature and idiotic. When the president of the united states says
"hands off my Jordan's!", something is wrong. The writing was
amateurish and honestly - if you don't think it was propaganda,
democrat or republican, you don't know anything about politics. What
are the messages: We should get all our troops out of the middle east
Republicans are crazy terrorists who don't want peace All it takes is a
nice guy who is willing to listen to the middle east, and all our
conflicts can be solved. Also, the acting of that little girl was
terrible. I kept hoping she'd get killed... no such luck.
