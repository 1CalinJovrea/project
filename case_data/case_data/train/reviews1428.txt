American Made is one of the WORST films of 2017

Tom Cruise was once one of Amercas biggest stars but lately outside of
the Mission Impossible franchise his star has been in decline with one
bomb after another.In 2017 alone Cruise starred in the awful Mummy reboot and now the
equally awful American Made.Someone needs to find Cruise a new agent because this film was AWFUL so
bad me and my wife asked for a refund.By the way a scene with future president Bill Clinton in a stript club
was deleted. It should have stayed in because he worked with Barry
Seals as governor of Arkansas where Seals lived. Clinton did after all
get Seals out of jail several times in the film.
