Well, that was a surprise

Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to
date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly
Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related
outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3
dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films
that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore
further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud
humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best
superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently
the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!
