Kate Beckinsale Must Be A Vampire

Underworld is one of the most underrated action film series. Even
though the sequels open with a synopsis, you have to watch all the
movies in succession to fully understand and appreciate the storyline.
The third film, Rise Of The Lycans, was a prequel. The fourth one,
Awakening, was okay, but this fifth installment, Blood Wars, with a
different writer-director team reminds more of the first three films
that I enjoyed the most. Kate Beckinsale still looks fantastic for her
age. Or she could be a real vampire. I look forward to the next chapter
in Underworld.
