franchise ruined

Horrible movie......Duke dies in the first 30 minutes, storm shadows
resurrection is never explained, destro is off the team??? then why
does cobra commander save him in the first one. Zartan really killed
snake eyes/storm shadows master in a plot to turn storm bad? how old is
zartan then? plus when storm shadow does the unspeakable and joins the
joes and kills zartan,shouldn't he still be alive despite getting
stabbed due to the nanomytes? he only cuts half his face off in front
of the pres. then to make things funnier bruce willis out of no where
has a team of old timers to join their mission to save the world. oh
yeah, and firefly gets killed, one of the coolest cobra villains. aside
from all of that garbage, the movie seemed liked it jumped too much,
the action didn't tie in well and when there was action, it was minimal
with no big epic joe/cobra scenes. not even worth renting...
