Very Enjoyable

This is for rightwingisevil - You are confusing Billy Whistler played by Donald Sutherland for Robert
played by Jim Sturgess. Billy knew all about his collection as he helped him acquire it. The painting Virgil received was painted by him...thus the note on the
back.Absolutely splendid movie.The best I have watched so far this year.
Geoffry Rush was excellent, however, I am not much of a Donald
Sutherland fan, the arrogance that he carries around in real life comes
through in all the roles he portrays. Kind Regards, Eirene
