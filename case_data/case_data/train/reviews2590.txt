Finally a credible piece on post-apocalyptic survival

Extraordinarily well executed, fresh, replete with lots of smart
details bring it all to life. The characters are believable; raw and
wild, running on their baser instincts, struggling to be civil in a
world where gnash-toothed animals survive and civility only gets you
dead. They try to be civil! Oh bless their hearts they try.What I loved the most is the transformation you see in the characters;
they go from feral, viciously unlikeable creeps to slowly warming up
and right before your eyes they bloom into something like humans again,
full of love and empathy and hate and greed and loyalty and all the
paradoxes of the human condition. The setting is well fleshed out, with
enough mystery regarding the details of society's breakdown to suspend
any disbelief you might have about the premise. You feel like it's
real. The characters further help you sense the desperation and anxiety
of the world portrayed here. It's very somatic; you feel the hunger,
the distrust, the anger and the violence of revenge.I was left feeling grateful for the world I live in, which is the
purpose of theme I suspect. It really could be worse. Watch this movie
and feel intense gratitude for your humdrum life. Enjoy!
