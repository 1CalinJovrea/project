Definition of Banality

If you can enjoy boring, tawdry, clich√©, airless, pointless dialogue;
if you can tolerate characters with no purpose, no dimension, no
development; if you can put up with story arcs that jump through time,
with no regard to cohesion or logic, much less flow; if you expect
and/or desire any of these things in a film, then this is absolutely
one-hundred percent the movie for you.If on the other hand, you, like most, are on the market for a film that
makes sense (preferably on one or more levels), presents believable
heroes and villains, and tells a story with more depth than a sheet of
paper, stay as far away from this film as you can.
