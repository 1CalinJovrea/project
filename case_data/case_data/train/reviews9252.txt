A Film Among Films

Superb should be the opening word. And as it is usually the case, not
everyone is bound to agree. The confidence of Paul Thomas Anderson is
out of this world. In "Boogie Nights" he gave us an unrepeatable Mark
Whalberg, here is Joaquin Phoenix's turn. Amazing performance that will
go next to three other performances that revolutionized the art of
acting and create characters that were unique in every way. James Mason
in "Lolita", Anthony Perkins in "Psycho" and even Colin Firth in
"Apartment Zero" Coincidentally or not none of those three landmarks
were nominated for Oscars, let's hope Joaquin Phoenix this time breaks
that tradition. Everything about this film will make your jaw drop and
I don't want to tell you anything about the film itself because part of
my delight consisted on the fact I didn't know anything about the
story. Don't miss it. See it in the biggest screen you can find.
