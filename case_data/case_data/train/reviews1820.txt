This movie gave me cancer

This past summer my best friend and I had the fun idea, being ladies of
the single variety, to have a girls day topped off with Magic Mike XXL.
We went into the theater with high hopes, lots of popcorn, and the last
of what we would later discover to be our sex drive. What promise Channing Tatum's face brought, was completely robbed by
this whiny, over- emotional, plot-lacking, and labedo-murdering film.Come the second scene of the movie, you start to discover this movie
wasn't made for you at all; seeing as you're not a fat, middle-aged
woman who secretly dreams of being a drag queen. This movie was clearly
intended for the LGBT and love-lost community and I have to applaud
them in trying to reach the love-less audience, especially seeing as
they surpassed their goal tremendously and succeeded in making the
entire audience asexual. Half way through the film my ovaries shrank and fell my out my butt. At
which point I grew a penis, which also fell off. This film was by far
the most sexually confusing, life-unsettling experience I have ever
had. I went in with what was my best friend and upon leaving, we were
strangers with no desire to move on. We could barely even leave the
theatre.My skin aged ten years and I lost the ability to bare children, which
was actually fine since I won't be procreating any time soon anyway. All the male strippers were whiny and annoying the whole movie,
complaining about penis size and lack of romance in their lives. What
do you expect? You decided to make a sequel.It's no wonder Alex Pettyfer wasn't in the film (the only redeemable
character from the first). I'm sure he's off somewhere living a happy,
stress-free, sex-filled life. Lucky him. I mean, I would have even
preferred to see a Mathew Mcconaghey's leathery ass doing anything. He
got wise too. Now I'm here, with cancer, no sexual organs and a life of
regret. Overall I would say an amazing movie 10/10 would recommend.
