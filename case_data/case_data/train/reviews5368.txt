Could be a better movie.

First of all, I am so happy to see The Rock and Bruce Willis joining
the cast, the movie suddenly looks so huge with them. But I still hate
how they trimmed almost all of the original cast, I like Ana and
Scarlett, and it definitely will be more amusing if Ripcord is in this
sequel. Luckily they kept Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, they are just as
awesome as they were in the previous film, really enjoy the rival show
of these two character.The story line is average, the plot is weird, doesn't have ups and
downs, only a parallel line from beginning to the end. There is no
climax in G.I Joe: Retaliation, but if you say the movie is excited at
all time, it would be hard to argue.There are not much advanced and cool weapon stuffs in this sequel,
probably to fit the story, I'd say it is actually kinda boring compare
to the previous G.I. Joe movie. However, some of the scene is pretty
entertained tho.Overall, with good actors and good special effect, G.I. Joe:
Retaliation only needs a better screenplay to be a better movie.
