The worst four hours of the year.

I could not stand watching this film. It took four hours of my life to
get through it as I was so bored, I would pause it to do other things.
There was not one laugh. The acting was one bad joke after another. The
good reviews for this trash are beyond sane. Do not waste a minute of
your life on this garbage. I thought the first version was OK and got
through it, even though this kind of film is not my taste at all. It
really bothers me when filmmakers, and I do include the actors in this,
assume we will indulge them in their silly inside jokes and amateurish
bits that get recycled over and over. I don't think that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have much to offer,
but sadly this may be them at their bestÂ…..one bad sight gag after
another. I just wish that I was warned about just how bad it could be.
