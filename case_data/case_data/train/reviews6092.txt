Mumblecore Goes Mainstream

Director, writer and producer Noah Baumbach bought cheap, recycled,
has-been, big-name actors (Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Adam Sandler,
Judd Hisrch, Candice Bergen, Ben Stiller, and even Sigourney Weaver) to
play in this over-talky, uncinematic, chintzy soaper. A blur of words buries thinly drawn, superficial stereotypes, little
more than the gossip of a New York City yachne. Oy! Tiny, half-jokes
are sprinkled throughout, as if to be "smart." This is little more than
over-written, stultified, self-conscious mush. And it's laced with the
poison of ideological liberal propaganda, identity politics. How
derivative of Woody Allen's later schlock can you get?Baumbach has graduated from lo-budget, literary bumblecore to Upper
East Side art house, just like Woody Allen. He has become the expert of
running in place, of going nowhere.PS. Never trust reviewers who rate a movie 10 stars so their review
will be at the top of the list.
