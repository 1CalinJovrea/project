A fantastic movie, not ashamed of its little flaws

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is without a doubt the best surprise
for me in these holidays movie season. Even if it's not a major
cinematic achievement in any particular way, it is incredibly confident
with a clear and universal message. In time when movies always try too hard and tend to be excessive, 'The
Secret Life of Walter Mitty' seemingly effortless delivers a timeless
story to its audience. The movie is beautiful, charming and funny, yet
it achieves all that without taking itself too serious. That's its real
trick in my opinion.It is unfortunate the movie wasn't off to a great box office success,
but I'm sure the movie will find it's audience. You probably won't find
any Oscar worthy performances, but that's not always everything. From
time to time we just need to be reminded how beautiful life can be, and
the movie does just that brilliantly.
