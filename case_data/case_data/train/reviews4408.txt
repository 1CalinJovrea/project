And those perks would be...???

I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it
all before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded
for it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve
it. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set
in a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is
never stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it
tries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters.
Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY
end of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend
most of the time thinking "I thought Joan Cussack was in this?" But I
guess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan
Cussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh,
and wasn't alive in 1990.
