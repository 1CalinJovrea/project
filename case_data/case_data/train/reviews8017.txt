If you like cheese this is out of date Stilton !

Imagine Big mommas house as a multi vehicle traffic accident, involving
a clown, some extras from the walking dead. Story synopsis (dont worry no spoilers):A car driven by a stupid writer, careers into the path of a lorry
loaded with out of date unoriginal material. The ensuing commotion is
truly unremarkable and easily forgettable. This is one of those films that sounds funny (ish) when you try to tell
others about it. But, in reality, is just cheesy stupidness.It actually looks vaguely familiar, a sort of de ja vu experience. Then
you realize that much of it, is rip off of other (and much better)
films. If your feeling suicidal, go see this. You may conclude that perhaps
your life is not actually that bad after all.
