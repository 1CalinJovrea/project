The name GOLD is perfect.

It has suspense if you are a business person or a risk taker in the
financial world. The exotic Indonesian scenery is well worth watching
and the suspense of making then losing , then making money again is, as
I said, good if you read the financial websites and invest. Otherwise,
just enjoy the performance of Matthew as he plays a likable? , smarmy
renegade risk taker who should encourage us all to expect more of life
than a 9-5 job and benefits. This world is not for the faint hearted as
GOLD shows us some risk taking is needed to make our lives count.
Matthew left me wanting more of him.
