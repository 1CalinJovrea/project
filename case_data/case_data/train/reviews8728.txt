Bold, Beautiful and Incredibly Sensual

First and foremost a confession: I have not yet read Anna Karenina and
therefore can't judge how well Joe Wright's interpretation captured the
spirit, style and message of Tolstoy's novel.What I do know is that I have just seen a daring and immensely powerful
film. Clever use of tableaux, surrealist elements and breathtaking
visual images bring out the character's emotions so strongly that
halfway through the film I felt like I wasn't a mere spectator anymore.
I WAS Anna, so completely and utterly was I engrossed in her world.Knightley performs well. For years I was convinced she could only play
one single type of role - the pretty girl who stands around and bats
her eyelashes - but "A Dangerous Method" and now "Anna Karenina" have
changed my mind. Knightley's matured as an actress, and now manages to
give a depth to her characters that makes them utterly believable.Though many have criticized him, I think Aaron Taylor-Johnson works as
Vronsky. He's charming and seductive and it's easy to see why Anna
cannot resist him.And as for Jude Law, his portrayal of passionless, prudish, but oh, so
decent Karenin was nothing less than Oscar worthy.Wright's "Pride and Prejudice" is mediocre, his "Atonement" is good.
His "Anna Karenina", however, is sensual and stunning and I can only
recommend it.
