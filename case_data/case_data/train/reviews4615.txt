Review

I saw this movie a few days after it came out on theater and I had
really high expectations (uhm Bridesmaids helloo...) and to be
completely honest.... I LOVED IT!!!!!! Its a total chick flick with
comedy through out the whole thing it is such a fun movie to watch with
anyone. Leslie Mann was awesome I didn't think he could play such a
goofy role :) I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh
and wants to see some ho and talented actresses!! Its start off with
Cameran Diaz and the SOB their all lovey and what not soon after were
introduced to the WIFE she's a total dork so sweet but na√Øve. It
becomes obvious that the SOB is only using her for his own good (you
will learn what I mean if you watch it) but Kate Upton aka boobs is not
introduce until waaaaaaaay later one and shes the young one with not
much to say lol ooo and nicki minaj mini role was also a killer for the
movie felt like total DIVA CONTROL MOVIE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
