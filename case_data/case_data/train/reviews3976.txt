A Pretentious Bad Movie For Porno Lovers.

This movie is pretentious.It contains scenes with explicit
pornography.I did not find anything interesting in it.Nothing is
artistic about a whore who blows a man and the obscenities of explicit
sex & vulgar masturbation can't be classified as art.Most of my friends
who saw the movie could not handle it because of boredom and incoherent
monotonous dialogue without any action.Those who regard Lars Von Trier
as the master of European cinema are bias for most of his movies are
commercial with explicit porn dominating them rather than being artful
and useful.It is weird to see the heroin Joe( played by Charlotte
Gainsbourg) as an insatiable whore who constantly craves for sex and
does not seem to enjoy sex.Nymphomaniac is a very dull movie and I
could not see it anything good except cheap nudity and some dirty
porn.See it on your own responsibility,you are free!.
