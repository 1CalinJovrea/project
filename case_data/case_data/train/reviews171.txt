The film takes place in the 20th century, where British explorer Percy Fawcett journeys into the Amazon to discover evidence of a previously unknown civilization.

I'm sad to say that I was disappointed by this film in almost every
aspect. It seems to me that the biggest problem it has is the pacing.
For a two and a half hour long film, pacing is important to keep the
viewers engaged and this movie just gets it completely wrong. It feels
like three movies clumsily stuffed into one, and as if that wasn't
enough, it adds a bunch of utterly irrelevant scenes which could have
easily been cut out of the movie entirely. I, for one, was expecting to
see at least some beautiful cinematography, but the movie fails to
deliver even in the aesthetic aspect. I was also expecting to see a lot
more of the actual journey to the Amazon, but instead we got scene
after boring scene in England, where nothing of importance really
happens. After about an hour and a half I was left wondering how so
many critics found this movie watchable, desperately trying not to fall
asleep. To make matters even worse, Charlie Hunnam delivers an awful
performance and makes for an overall uninteresting lead. Surprisingly,
the only performance worth watching in this film was, out of all
people, Robert Pattinson. I'm certainly glad he's moving away from his
Twilight years and I hope to see him in more roles like this one in the
future. Overall, this was a forgettable, boring, mess of a movie.
