Easily the worst film of 2014 so far

I had a glimmer of hope for Vampire Academy. The faintest bit of
optimism that the film might actually be something that Ender's Game
and Beautiful Creatures was not. I knew nothing of the books. Seven in
total I am told from my vampire novel-loving partner. But surely it a
major studio release couldn't be as bad as the Twilight films. Surely
just out of blind luck, a vampire film targeting the tweens might
actually be watchable.Nope.Vampire Academy not only fails to exploit my flicker of faith but it
pulverizes any rational reason as to why the screenplay was greenlit in
the first place. A monstrosity of a mess, Vampire Academy is a clear
front runner for worst film of 2014.I could attempt to educate you on the script, but I am not quite sure I
understood it all myself. In the first five minutes alone we see a car
crash, get introduced to a vampire and her half-vampire/half-human
guardian, force fed the supernatural bond between the two, learn that
vampires can control the four elements and are given a description as
to dhampirs, Morois and Strigoi's. Whew.Zoey Deutch (looking very much like a young Rose Byrne) plays Rose
Hathaway. She is a dhampir who is protecting Princess Vasilisa Dragomir
(Lucy Fry) from Stigoi Â– an evil vampire breed created when a vampire
takes a human life. Maybe more evil still are Vasilisa's classmates at
the Vampire Academy who resent her return after being in the real world
for the past year. It's like Mean Girls with fangs.There is some sort of plot. Vasilisa is tormented by someone or
someones in her school who sacrifice wolves and cats in an attempt to
gather her attention. Vasilisa seems less concerned about those trying
to kill her than she is about the boys in her school and her desire for
acceptance. That brings a few Robert Pattinson look-a-likes into play
that add nothing much else to the story than doing just enough to get
us to the next DVD chapter without displaying any real character. There
is also a love interest for Rose, large wolf dogs, more vampire
mythology and Gabriel Byrne trying his best to ensure that he is not
overlooked by next year's Razzie nominations.The screenplay by Daniel Waters is the film's largest obstacle. The
dialogue is Aaron Sorkin fast but written with a Uwe Boll sense of
direction. Characters talk quickly to each other and then the scene
will just cut as if we came to the end of a chapter and the director
didn't know how to transition to the next scene with any sense of flow.Those holding out for strong action scenes to be the glue that holds
you between naps can forget about it. Poorly choreographed and
uninspiring hijinks are the norm as the film stumbles towards a final
shot that suggests a sequel (it will not happen).Vampire Academy might have worked as a television series. Why not.
Dirty Little Liars Meets True Blood on CW. But this mess is easily the
worst film of the year. At least until the next Adam Sandler film is
released.
