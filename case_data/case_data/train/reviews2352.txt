Pretty Awful

Having been interested by the previews and ratings on IMDb, I went into
this movie expecting some fun. But what started out as an interesting
movie fizzled out in no time. In about 20 minutes, the interest was all
POOF -- GONE ! To start with, a lot of characters in the movie are very shallow. You
hardly get any background info about them and what drives them to do
what they do. The makers try to add romance, action, suspense, drama and all of it
fails. It went to the point where you just wait for the movie to end. Lots of good actors and all of them have been made to play cartoonish
roles in a movie that takes itself quite seriously. I wouldn't
recommend this to anyone. The street tricks on TV are way more fun and
enjoyable. At least there you know the magician/illusionist/trickster
is doing it to entertain or make a name for himself and a quick buck
unlike this movie which tries to show them off with personalities like
superheroes. Tip: Sit back at home, sip on a summer drink and watch/do something
else other than going to the cinemas for this.
