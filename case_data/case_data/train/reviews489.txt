The Woman In Black lacks one thing...

I feel like I am the only person to feel this film was just okay. I so
desperately wanted to like it but I couldn't get over one thing. First of all, let me say how beautiful I think the film was
technically, the visuals were a lot of the time stunning (despite
children killing themselves left, right and centre). However, I
struggled to get past the fact that it all seems done before, not that
I mind this greatly, no but it really did hinder the film from being
truly original. When it came to the fact that 'The Woman in Black' was killing
children, that's where I have a problem with this film. Whenever I
watch a horror film, one of my favourite things is that visceral feel
you get, feeling the character's feelings, being scared at the right
points. Very early on in the film, it felt, we were told and realised
that Daniel Radcliffe's character was effectively in no danger at all
and that this 'ghost' was not after him at all. This to me, made it
less scary, yes I did jump when the music became deafening and a
woman's scream howled out to the audience but is that what really makes
a good horror film?Overall, I did not dislike this film but I fail to acknowledge the hype
that has been built up around it. Daniel Radcliffe's performance is
decent but nothing extraordinary, well done him though for continuing
on in acting and not trying to be known just as Harry Potter, although
that is already the case. The film offers many jumpy moments, which is
to be expected but my favourite moment was the beginning, which to me,
was the creepiest of them all.
