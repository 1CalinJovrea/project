Human connection

Robert Redford and Jane Fonda are perfect for their lonely and flawed
characters. What a sweet unfolding of two complex lives that crave
connection and love. It begins simply with wanting to simply sleep
through the night and then we get to know all the good and the hard
parts of their lives and in the end it is about talking to each other.There is a bit of all of us in these characters.
