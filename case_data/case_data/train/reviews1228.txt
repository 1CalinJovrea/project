Better Than Expected

After paying to watch it I at first regretted not watching the preview
as the beginning suggested it just might be too sophomoric and unfunny.
But the film actually turned out to be fairly witty and definitely
engaging. Yes, it was predictable but the dialogue and scenes were
lively enough to make it not matter. To me there was only one major
flaw in the movie and that centered on Adam Scott's character of
Matthew. First off, he was so unappealing and unattractive, at least to
me, that I couldn't understand the attachment of Lainie to him. Why
him, and why for so long? Also, to somehow equate Lainie's attachment
to Matthew with Jake's philandering really didn't make much sense. But
overlooking these discrepancies I was still able to enjoy watching this
romantic comedy, just as being able to predict the ending didn't stop
me from smiling at it.
