Kids ONLY!!! Sober parents BEWARE!!! Drop the pizza and walk away slowly!

Josh Hutcherson has to be one of my LEAST favorite main characters
PERIOD!!! Watched this with my son who asked me after the movie was
over... "Dad, they ran out of people to play in movies?" Yes son, they
apparently did. This, coming from a kid who watches The Disney Channel
all day, has GOT to confirm this movie sucked just by him being in it.
The Rock is one of my favorite "fake" athletes who went the way of the
mainstream but he couldn't pull this movie out of the gutter. Plot is
disturbingly bad and the "Why did they do that?!?!?" factor was WAAAAY
over 10 so I would say PLEASE wait for the ABC premier to avoid
spending ANY money of this trash! Special effects were cool to a
certain extent but hey, even trash has value. The CGI crew should have
been paid more than the actors. ;) Overall, I wish I had 2 more arms so
I could give this garbage 4 Thumbs down!!!! Jeeeah!
