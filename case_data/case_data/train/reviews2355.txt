Hollywood finally gets it right

When Hollywood gets it right and stops making movies for children they
can actually make a beauty like this one. My wife and I just returned
from such an accomplished film some minutes ago: American Made. We have seen Tom Cruise in a number of his previous films (not
necessarily by choice) and both of us kind of cringed at his screen
presence. He delivered his lines well enough, but we did not see him as
a genuine character; he seemed always to be playing his roles rather
than living them. The exception was the movie we attended this
afternoon; Cruise "stepped into the role", he became Barry Seal and us,
the audience lived his demise with him from airline pilot to cocaine
courier to arms smuggler for the American government.This movie could not have been made while Ron Reagan was alive and the
other principles like Ollie North sat in positions of decision-making
power close to the Oval Office. This movie was about Barry Seal, Drug
Smuggler and tangentially about the evil and stupidity that lurked in
the minds of people that ran the American government and caused the
deaths of many thousands of people in Central America.This is a brave and thoughtful film that all lovers of America should
see; besides its political strength see it because of it is a high film
making aptitude.
