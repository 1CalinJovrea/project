Wish it were better

Like the real mountain, this movie is stunning to look at but a little
painful to watch. I kept longing for the voice-over guy from The
Deadliest Catch to chime in with some compelling back story about the
characters or the situation, just to ramp up the tension a little. We
don't get much time to get to know the characters; most of their lines
are designed mainly to give us information rather than developing their
individual personalities. We are left with archetypes: the Loudmouth
Texan, the Humble Mailman, the Brash Adventurer, the Careful Tour
Guide, the Taciturn Journalist. And then there's the annoying Keira
Knightly, on hand with her squeaky mouse voice and her runny nose, to
make sure everyone in the audience has a good cry.I wish the movie had been more about Rob Hall--his hubris and his
heroism is really the heart and soul of this story. But you can't have
everything in two hours, can you?
