An Engrossing Murder Mystery That Respects Its Subject _ and Audience

"Wind River" is a gripping murder mystery-thriller written and directed
by Taylor Sheridan (Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominee for "Hell or
High Water") starring Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Graham Greene,
featuring an unusually strong supporting cast that includes many fine
Native American actors. Renner and Olsen play a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker and an
FBI agent, respectively, attempting to solve the murder of a young
woman whose body is discovered by Renner under mysterious circumstances
as he patrols the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.The film scrupulously avoids clich√©s and is tightly edited with nary a
wasted moment, yet never feels rushed or artificial in performance or
plot. Everyone and everything is there for a reason, and best of all,
the audience is given credit for being able to keep up and connect the
dots.The violence, which is absolutely necessary, is kept at a bare minimum
as a narrative device, explaining and clarifying rather than assaulting
the senses.Every character, even the most heinous, is portrayed as a fully
developed human being rather than as stereotype. We learn how the Native American culture is victimized in a way that
takes us inside their world and their souls, but the journey is
skillfully handled and never heavy handed.The photography is perfectly rendered, celebrating the icy Wyoming
scenery in a muted style consistent with the mood of the story.Renner, Olsen and Greene are excellent and believable, but in no small
way this is an ensemble piece whose potency and effectiveness derive
from the palpable passion and belief of everyone in front of and behind
the camera.This is an engrossing story well worth your time and money, and kudos
to everyone involved for having faith that a discerning audience will
find and appreciate it.
