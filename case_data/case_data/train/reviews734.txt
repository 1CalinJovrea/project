Unstoppable tension

After Evil Dead's well-made remake, a lot of us felt that Fede Alvarez
was a director to watch. With Don't Breathe, he definitely became a
director I'm very excited to see future projects from.I admire his knack to generate tension. After the film kicks off, there
is really no stopping. It became almost unbearable at the end, nearly
reaching the point of overkill. When you have a thriller filled with so
much tension throughout its running time, there's only so much you can
do before you start yelling "you gotta be kidding me" at the screen.The cinematography was beautiful and moody and the performances were
fine, except maybe Jane Levy, who I felt was too wooden, making her
character a little bit unlikable.Don't Breathe was a solid effort and a great addition to the home
invasion genre with a little twist.
