The all star cast couldn't save this OK cliché'd film

Great cast, great acting, decent directing and editing but the writing
was all over the place. Even the all star cast couldn't save this OK
cliché'd film, and full of clichés it was. Had the story been a little
tighter with less (and unnecessary) surprise (barely) plot twists
(predictable), I would have enjoyed it more. Would I watch it again?
Nope. It's a 7/10 from me.
