Whitewashing for the isheep out there.

Don't get me wrong, I use and like apple products but I have enough
freewill to explore other phones and laptops. So I'm not hating on
Apple products here. This film however, reminds me of those annoying
poser hipsters who worship Steve Jobs like a god. The man was flawed,
but this film does nothing but enable Apple fanboys (not Apple fans,
there is a difference), by pretending there was a method to his madness
when he treated his daughter like sh!t. Or how Steve Jobs demanded
Apple stop giving to charities. Or him abusing his employees on a daily
basis. And basically this movie covers all that stuff up. Even the
Ashton Kutcher Jobs movie had the balls to sort of tell the truth. This
film however is a cop out. Michael Fassbender plays an awful Steve
Jobs. He has the look but his voice is totally off and distracting at
times. Seth Rogen pretty much plays himself for the hundredth time, no
surprise. The film is shot well enough but the story is way too
fictitious. His daughter is using a cassette player in the late 90s? Is
this movie seriously trying to claim the world didn't have MP3 players
before the iPod came out? I could go on and go.
