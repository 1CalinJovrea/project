A writing masterclass with an outstounding performance from Hardy

For Locke's true power as a film to sink in you will need a few days to
sit and ponder upon its small yet intricate construction, for in a film
that is set almost entirely within the confines of one man's car, Locke
deals with many an issue and does so by uncorking a powerhouse Tom
Hardy performance and a downright believable script by Brit Steven
Knight who here makes up for his dreary directing debut Hummingbird.There will be many out there that have no time for Locke due to its
setup and in a way this is not an unjust decision by them for Locke
requires much of you as a viewer and does not look to find a way around
this. Not perhaps since Ryan Reynolds found himself in a tight
situation in Rodrigo Cortes 2010 film Buried has a film relied so
heavily on the audience to bear with it and a performer to hold our
attention with nothing more than a phone (or Bluetooth) to act
alongside with. Locke's tightly focused pacing and realistic scripting
are both hugely successful but it is in the performance of Hardy that
the film finds its true power and ability to stick with you days after
release.Oft cast as the hulking or manic presence within a film as seen in any
of Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises or Bronson, Hardy hear is a steely at
times inwardly reserved Ivan Locke, a man whose world is crumbling
around him despite being sheltered by his luxury ride. Playing Locke
with a welsh accent and with a vulnerability within both his eye, Hardy
showcases a rarely displayed side to his acting talents that Knight
uncovers to great effect. Whether Locke is demanding or pleading, Hardy
is in control even though his character is slowly but surely crumbling
from within. It's one of the year's best acting turns, unflashy yet
utterly commanding, Hardy achieves more with a singly look than some
actors do within an entire role. It's worth also mentioning the voice
work (the only other people you will hear during the entire movie, no
one else is ever seen) of the cast here in Locke, from Olivia Colman
through to The Impossible's Tom Holland as Locke's son Eddie, all voice
performers give soul to the voices we hear on the phone.A movie to be watched in the tightest surrounds available to you, Locke
isn't an easy watch due to its setting and not a movie made for overall
public consumption. Locke is however an incredibly smart and
well-constructed film that is the perfect showcase for the increasing
acting prowess of Tom Hardy, an actor that continues to stake a claim
as one of if not the most interesting and diverse performers in the
business today.4 Bluetooth calls out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com
