Big Disappointment!!! - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!

I have NEVER posted a review on IMDb before and I'm so sorry to inform
you that this movie was so bad, I HAD say something! It might have been
watchable but there was absolutely NO way that I could get past
Charlize's horrible HORRIBLE British accent! Thank God for her beauty.Next, KRISTEN STEWART was just terrible! How she got the lead in this
only God knows! Completely emotionless and a very laughable "pumping
up" speech at the end. And WHY oh WHY does she always have her mouth
open? Every time she was on camera, she had an absentminded look with
her mouth hanging open showing off her horse teeth! Its NOT pretty! It
was just too awful to watch this movie, all I could see were Kristen's
teeth the whole time.And William? Take him out of the movie and it would have worked out the
same! His character was pretty much useless in the movie.
