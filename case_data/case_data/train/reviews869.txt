A must watch movie

Suburra it's one of the best crime / drama movie of the last year. The
story is settled between Rome and the suburbs and it's a web of
relations between politics, mafia boss, prostitute, criminals and
normal people. But it isn't a movie of gangster or mafia boss , I mean
there are a boss and criminals but it's more a movie about how the
common people from the richer to the poor interact with the criminality
in some ways for their pettiness. Solima is the same director of
Gomorrah the series, so the style is pretty much the same..the movie
starts with different stories that start to became a dense plot with a
common story. I don't want to spoiler too much about the story and the
character because I think it's a must watch movie. Bytheway the cast is
great and works very well, the direction it's sublime and some shots
and cinematography are really greats. It's definitely not suitable for
children since some sex act and nudity, drug use and violence. The
soundtrack is done by french M83. If you liked Gomorrah the series you
have to watch this movie.
