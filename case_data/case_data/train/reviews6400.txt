A Visual Feast and a Solid Pixar Film

Brave is a beautiful and moving new fairy tale that fits seamlessly
into the genre; Princess Merida is a wonderfully multi-facted heroine;
the film shapes itself around problems that are familiar and
understandable and will be well-understood and appreciated by kiddos
and parents alike; the supporting characters that are given the most
attention are well-crafted (but too bad for those others that fall by
the wayside). The visual effects are flawless, in my opinion, the best
if all Pixar films.Brave is at its best when it's smartly and charmingly changing what we
think think a Disney Princess can be, but it wavers when it tries to
somehow reinvent the Pixar wheel. The film lacks the trademark Pixar
wit we've come to expect from the animation studio's productions, and
some humor feels shoe-horned in for the sake of having some laughs; the
directorial kerfuffle that took place in the middle of production is
not overwhelmingly obvious, but there is a distinct laugh of singular
vision driving the film and its tone wavers throughout. It may not live up to the incredible standards of the Pixar brand, but
Brave offers young audiences a lot of entertainment and adventure.
Highly Recommended.8/10
