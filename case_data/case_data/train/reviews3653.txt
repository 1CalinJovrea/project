"Nothin but a good time"- !LIES!

A small town girl and a city boy meet on the Sunset Strip, while
pursuing their Hollywood dreams.All I wanted was a good time. But the movie disagreed with me. The
movie is just a glee episode longer than it needs to be. The good stuff
about the film, I really got nothing. The music, just some songs. But
the rest, were do I begin. Let's start with the acting, it's bland like
Diego Boneta,Milan Akerman, Julianne Hough & Mary J. Blige.Or it's over
over the top like Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russel Brand, Alec Baldwin,
Paul Giamatti & the most over the top, Tom Cruise. The plot of the film
is just basically the journey song "Don't Stop Believing". All the
jokes fall flat on their faces. The characters feel forced like Tom
Cruise's Stacee Jaxx character. Predictable plot points through out.
I'll be OK with the predictable plot, if the movie was fun. If you like
Rock of Ages, explain to me why. As is Rock of Ages is one of the
year's worst film's, F.
