Genuinely enjoyed this movie.

It might have been because I hadn't seen a movie in this vein for a
while, but it was extremely entertaining! For all its flaws and tropes
it's still a very entertaining movie with a huge performance by Noomi
Rapace. I would recommend it just for her acting! Oh, and the end; It
all comes together very cleanly for the septuplets... storywise, at
least, not in the fluffy unicorn parade happy ending you secretly hope
for them way.
