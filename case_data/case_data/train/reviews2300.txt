Better than i thought

This film is what i want in a film, it's like Quentin Tarantino meets
Resident Evil. I do hope this film turns into a trilogy as it has
potential to do so, it's a very dark version of the Stallone attempt
many years ago and in my opinion this is much better. I didn't know
what to expect before i watched it as i have heard mixed reviews, but i
would definitely not listen to any bad reviews until you have seen it
for yourselves. Both leads in the film (Dredd & Anderson) we're epic to
say the least. The camera work in this film is some of the best i have
seen in a while, the slow motion scenes are to die for and the film
will explain these reasons of slow motion. This film is an easy 8 out
of 10.
