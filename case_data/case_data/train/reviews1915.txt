Not as good as I expected

So, we are getting magical now. From the trailer I was hoping for a
thrill ride of a movie. I saw the movie in 3D and the Inception-like
effects were the most anticipated by me to see. To be noted that I
never felt sick by 3D but those effects were so 2005, like in a bad
computer game, that a felt a little sick. The effects in Inception are
top-notch compared to this version. I mean, Marvel Studios has now
enough money to make great special effects, why are all the effects in
the mirror dimension so bad? Remember Legolas from LotR jumping around?
So bad were the effects. The other special effects of the movie were
OK.The story was OK, but not great. There was never a real villain. Mads
was great, as usual, but the role was not interesting enough. The
Ancient One was not good at all, just annoying. This was a very bad
role for Tilda, who was always great, but now... she is just not
convincing. She was just there, stiff, forgettable and bland. Forget about the plot holes, just focus of the fact that Dr. Strange
saves the Earth just a few scenes after he learns how to open a door to
another dimension/ place. Maybe his photographic memory is helping him,
but he has no time to practice, he just beats wizards that practice
magic for some years now, and he also is smart enough to save the
world. As the movie unfolds you have the feeling that from the learning
of spells stage, Dr. Strange jumps directly to the saving the world,
and it just feel like there were a lot of missing steps, or scenes.
Maybe they will release an extended version, because like this, the
movie feels chopped.I know that people are going to praise this movie, because everything
Marvel is gold, but for me only the first movie of every superhero in
the MCU was good. All the sequels were just bad, and cashed on the
success of the franchise. Now Dr. Strange was not so good from the
beginning, so there is place for improvement in the next one.
