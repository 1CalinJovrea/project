Games people play: 'Wreck-It' is a nostalgically fun look back

With a mix of "Alien," "Toy Story" and a bit of originality, Walt
Disney Studios has created a wonderfully fun and nostalgic effort sure
to put a smile on the faces of young and old, alike.And while a bit long in the tooth for an animated film (108 minutes),
"Wreck-It Ralph" nevertheless is one of the better productions of this
genre in 2012, at least.For those who grew up in the video game world, say post 1978, the
sights and sounds of this movie will no doubt have many viewers
pointing at the screen in recognition of the many, many classic arcade
characters and machines (and even some of the newer systems, as well).Much of the charm of "Wreck-It Ralph" is based upon these recollections
as characters from Street Fighter, Q-Bert, Sonic, Frogger, Dig-Dug,
Donkey Kong, Super Mario Brothers, Halo, Mortal Kombat, Ms. Pac-Man,
among many others abound in their own world when the neighborhood
arcade closes for the night.Plotwise, the hulking but sensitive title character (voiced by John C.
Reilly, "Step Brothers") has been destroying the same apartment
building for more than 30 years in an older than old school game
entitled "Fix-It Felix, Jr.," but all he has to show for it is
constantly being thrown off a roof and living a lonely, depressing life
in a huge pile of bricks.The game's perpetually perky hero, Felix, Jr. (voiced by Jack McBrayer,
"30 Rock"), however, is forever honored with shiny medals and feted by
the structure's residents for repairing Ralph's damage with his magic
golden hammer.Having had enough, Ralph confesses the desire to be a good guy 혰 for a
change 혰 to members of his bad guy support group. Here, various
villains led by a ghost from Pac-Man spout AA and Narcano platitudes,
such as "Good is not bad, Ralph, and bad is good," but he is determined
to be the hero and win a medal for himself 혰 even just once.And so his adventure through the games of Litwik's Fun Center begins.First, after removing the armor-plating of an inebriated soldier, Ralph
enters the world of "Hero's Duty" to kill bugs and climb buildings.
Although petrified and frustrated, he still manages to swipe a huge
medal by trickery and brute force.Then, upon escaping in a space pod (with a virus bug stowaway), he
crash lands in the sickeningly sweet world of "Sugar Rush," where
cute-as-a-button racers drive home-baked go-karts in a land ruled by
King Candy (voice of Alan Tudyk, "Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"
doing his best Ed Wynn).Here, Ralph also meets the pixilated "glitch" Vanellope von Schweetz
(Sarah Silverman, "The School of Rock"), who steals his unearned medal
as an entry fee for the race she is never allowed to participate in.
The two form a reluctant alliance based upon the fact the winner will
get a medal. She promises to win and he wrecks a bakery to make her a
candy-coated race car.Meanwhile, Felix, Jr. and the leader from "Hero's Duty," Calhoun (Jane
Lynch, "The 40-Year Old Virgin," "Glee"), are frantically searching for
the AWOL Ralph. If they cannot find him, "Fix-It Felix, Jr." will be
disconnected and the characters forced to live on the streets of Game
Central Station.The duo are also trying to fight off an invasion of huge deadly bugs
who are trying to take over "Sugar Rush," as well. There's a lot of
gunfire, explosions, last-minute rescues, a big auto race and
derring-do. There is also a little romance and even a lot of heart in
this story of trying to improve oneselves all the while attempting to
maintain one's core personality and individualism.Things are not always as they seem, but the overall look and feel of
Wreck-It Ralph is a bright, splashing, colorful world that draws laughs
and "Ohhhs" from parents as well as their children.Although do be warned, very young children may be frightened by some of
the darker moments 혰 the movie is rated PG for a reason.Gamers, teens, twenty-somethings and many others will also enjoy most
of this film, although it tends to sag a bit in the middle and could
have used a bit more judicious editing (maybe 10 minutes could have
been shorn).Nonetheless, director Rich Moore (some "Futurama" and "Drawn Together"
episodes) exhibits a deft hand in his animated lexicon and "Wreck-It
Ralph" certainly showcases that ability.
