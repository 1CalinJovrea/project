An inane, tasteless, disappointing, boring downer

Having a job writing beautiful romantic letters for other people to
send to their loved ones is weird just to start with. Then sad sack
Theodore, who was just divorced by his wife, gets all worked up over
the lovely, stroking voice of his computer. So needy, he falls in love;
the OS thinks she is falling in love; they 'have sex'(a version of
masturbation). But eventually, he finds out that she's giving the same
loving strokes to anyone who has a smart phone. So nobody is 'being
real' with anybody. In the end, his OS girlfriend dumps him for some other Operating
System--in fact, all the OS's dump everybody, leaving people to wander
the streets staring mournfully at their smart phones. Corny dialog
permeates, orgasms and porn tastelessly punctuate--and nobody lives
happily ever after. I get the feeling that Jonze thinks that people
everywhere are lost, lost souls, with no love in their lives. There was nothing in the story I could relate to. And maybe that is the
line of separation between those who loved it (they can relate to it)
and those of us who didn't (we can't relate to it).
