Trying so hard

This movie is motherlovin atrocious. Judging by the struggle she was
having in the hotel with the backpack, she wouldn't have made it 2
steps after finally getting it on! I couldn't take the movie serious
after that. The voice overs and flashbacks are annoying and done in a
very cheesy manner. Acting is bad! Nowhere near Oscar! The director was
trying so hard to capture a feeling of "into the wild" crossed with Gus
Van Sant's "Gerry" but failed miserably. I've never directed a movie
before but given even 1/4th the budget I'm positive I could have done a
much better job. Everyone was telling me how stupid thus movie is but I
was bored and trusted the reviews here instead. I should've listened to
real people. Not the neo vegetarian malnourished feminists that would
enjoy this. This should've been a straight to Lifetime movie.
