Horrible sequel. Just awful

Kick Ass is one of my favourite films. It's clever, funny, original and
gets all of its various elements just right. It scores on every level
and is in my view the very best superhero film there is. OK, it's not
as good as the Dark Knight films but you know... it's different, it's
self aware. It's the anti-superhero film par excellence.This film is about as far from the original Kick Ass as it is possible
to be. It should be called "Sucks Ass". I have no idea what happened in
the writing and production of this film but they managed to lose almost
every semblance of wit that was in the first film and they have
replaced that with a load of over the top Tarantino-esque violence, and
a few knob gags.I had heard this film was not as good as the first, but nothing
prepared me for the turgid awfulness of what I watched tonight. I was
watching the diabolical end "fight" through my fingers as the sheer
mind-numbing terribleness of it had me involuntarily face-palming. I'm
not even going to bother mentioning the plot (was there one?), but
let's just say this film veers haphazardly from mindless blockbuster
action smash right through to cheesy teenage school chick flick and
back without ever managing to entice a giggle.Remember "With no power comes no responsibility"?! Yeah, that made me
guffaw with laughter too. Even the opening suicide smash of the
original Kick Ass has more humour than this entire film and all it's
terrible "jerk off" jokes combined.Awful awful awful. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of
one is erm... well I don't even know. I guess the stuff that has been
shamelessly copied still half works, such as the music (songs all used
in exactly the same places etc) but aside from that there are almost no
redeeming features.I now see very clearly why Jim Carrey wanted to disassociate himself
from this film. It wasn't because of the violence. It's because its a
terrible, terrible film.
