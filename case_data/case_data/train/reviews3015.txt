Shakespeare - it's about the language, stupid!

I wanted so much to love this movie! A stellar cast, wonderful source
material, what could go wrong. What went right was the visuals; the
film looks great. Locations, costumes, cinematography, all are just
splendid. But all that is spoiled because most of the time you can't
understand what the actors are saying! Other critics commented on this
issue but I went anyway, hoping they were wrong. They weren't. And
there is simply no excuse. I've seen all these actors in other roles
and they know how to enunciate quite well, so what went wrong? It's
Shakespeare, people! The words matter! Now, I don't know if this was
sloppy sound editing or deliberate obfuscation, but the result was that
a movie that worked magnificently on every other level was totally
spoiled, a disappointment to viewers and I'm sure an embarrassment to
the cast and, I hope, the filmmakers.
