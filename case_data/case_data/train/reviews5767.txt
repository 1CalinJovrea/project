Found footage's finest so far - an intense cop thriller that feels real

If I were to pitch you a movie about two police officers who are
partners on patrol in South Central Los Angeles, one of your first
inclinations might be "not another buddy copy comedy." While "End of
Watch" is often funny, the newest film from "Training Day" writer David
Ayer, is no comedy.Ayer, who spent a lot of time in South Central, takes the found footage
approach to his latest film featuring the LAPD in the spirit of modern
trends and perhaps the show "Cops."It's hard to tell if Ayer's exaggerating, but a lot of dangerous stuff
happens to Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) despite
being beat cops. So much so that they get involved with the wrong
Mexican gang, and their attempts to go above and beyond to protect and
serve put them in the line of fire.Gyllenhaal and Pena have incredible chemistry as two cops who are best
friends as well as partners. They epitomize the modern "bromance" in a
number of ways, joking around, giving each other a hard time, offering
love/dating advice with hyper-masculine sarcasm, etc. Ayer takes time
to show these men out of their blues frequently to humanize them in a
critical way. On the job, they are often cocky, proud and reckless,
pushing the line of appropriate police behavior and protocol. They jump
back and forth between making laudable, responsible choices and
borderline police brutality.The portrait that this paints of law enforcement feels so much more
authentic than we're normally treated to in cop films and police
procedurals on television. They are heroes and good, honorable men, but
that doesn't make them beacons of morality. No matter how much you
believe in the quickly escalating plot of "End of Watch," there's no
disagreement to be had over the authenticity of the characters and the
environment they operate in. Although we do get independent "episodes" in which Taylor and Zavala
respond to calls and find more than they bargained for, there's a
through-line involving a powerful Mexican drug cartel and the gang that
enforces it. Ayer glamorizes these thugs a little bit, but it makes
them formidable villains in the story. As things come to a boil, the
realism of the film really unravels in favor of a more compelling,
heart-pounding finale.Ayer takes certain liberties with the found footage style as well. The
premise involves Taylor filming everything for a school project or
something. He has a hand-held camera but also cameras positioned in the
squad car, and ones that clip onto their uniforms. The gangs also carry
cameras around to film their violent escapades. At times, however, we
can't tell who is supposed to be holding the camera Â— like when Taylor
starts making out with his girlfriend, Janet (Anna Kendrick). Neither
is holding the camera, so that's a bit strange.Still, that filmmaking style does more good than harm to the film. Say
what you will about the found footage trend, but this is an appropriate
example that really works. The extra layer of realism and authenticity
that the technique gives to a film really goes miles in favor of "End
of Watch." Humor is an unexpected benefit of this film as well. Michael Pena has
failed to be funny in films including "Tower Heist" and "30 Minutes or
Less," but he succeeds in territory that blends it with the dramatic in
this very organic way. It would be impressive if most of the dialogue
in this film, at least between him and Gyllenhaal, weren't improvised
given how natural it flows. It sounds like a stretch to consider this one of the better acted films
of the year, but Gyllenhaal and Pena should've been considered for
awards contention. The nature of found footage detracts from what we
tend to associate with/look for in an Oscar-worthy performance. We
expect authenticity from found footage and only comment when it goes
poorly, not when it's done exceptionally well. Having seen enough films
made in the found footage style, no other two actors have done better
in this genre."End of Watch" offers an intense look at the life of L.A.'s finest and
a harrowing portrait of life in the barrios and gang-ridden parts of
L.A. Although exaggerated at crucial points, it shows what can happen
when officers try and step out of their clearance level. At the least,
it's one of the best films found footage has given us to date.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more
