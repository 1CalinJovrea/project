Not what you think it will be

This movie is funny once you get it. There is a big dip in quality the
middle of the film (cliches and ridiculous scenarios) and it gets below
average, but the writing upkicks again and it end well.The overall trouble with this film is the characters and friendships
are not established very well. As a result, it takes a while for the
viewer to believe the premise of the movie (ie: why are three popular
girls going to the unpopular girl's wedding as her bridesmaids?). The
aspect that I struggled to understand the most, is that the
director/writers do not make clear WHY the women remain friends. Yes,
we know they went to High School together, obviously, but WHY have they
remained in contact? Considering that two of the women now live in New
York, and two now live in LA, and the three main characters barely
disguise their contempt for Rebel Wilson/ the Bride... so why are they
in the Bridal Party again? This movie clearly wasn't marketed well - it is not Bridesmaids, and it
is not a rom- com. The poster is awful. What is that composition,
honestly?! In the end, if you go into this movie knowing it is a DARK
COMEDY WITH UNLIKEABLE CHARACTERS, you'll probably enjoy it. Once I
figured out the characters are assholes and are MEANT to be assholes,
then it was pretty funny in parts. Not all women are "nice" and "sweet"
and "kind". And they don't have to be.
