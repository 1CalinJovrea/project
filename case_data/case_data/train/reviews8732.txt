Remarkably, no one in this movie actually jumps a shark

After watching the first Hobbit movie, I didn't want to think that
Peter Jackson had jumped the shark, but he was certainly gunning the
engine and racing towards that ramp next to the shark tank at full
speed. With "Desolation of Smaug", he's over the tank and has crash
landed hard on the other side.The first movie took a lot of liberties with the original book and
changed the tone entirely. The second one might as well not have
claimed to be based on the book at all. It races through the few scenes
that actually came from the book at breakneck pace just so it can get
to the overlong scenes with characters who weren't in the book, or the
scenes that beat the viewer over the head with the idea that this is a
prequel to Lord of the rings, or the many, many, many ridiculous action
scenes. For example, the chapter from the book that tells of the
company's stay with Beorn comes and goes in what feels like about three
minutes at the beginning of the movie, and bears (no pun intended)
almost no resemblance to the book. Meanwhile, there's at least ten
times that much footage of elves who weren't in the book beheading orcs
and goblins throughout the film.As many others have stated, I watched the Lord of the Rings movies many
times in the theater and on DVD, but I have absolutely no urge to
re-watch either of the first two Hobbit movies, and probably won't even
bother seeing the third one.Personally, I'd like to see films taken away from Jackson and given to
a decent editor to see if he could make a two hour movie that's
actually based on the original book.
