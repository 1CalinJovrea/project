Good Film

Three days before Christmas, a suburban family gets together to
celebrate the holidays. One child named Max wants to continue the family's Christmas
traditions, but tensions between members of the family keep everyone
from having a good time and the family lose their Christmas spirit,
especially Max, who rips up his letter to Santa and throws it to the
wind after his cousins read it out at the dinner table Shortly
afterwards, a severe blizzard appears and cuts out power in the entire
town and Christmas will never be the same. Now Despite it's Christmas Background this film is anything but cherry.
In fact this film is one of the best main stream horror films produced
in quit some time.In this film we get a cross between "Night of the Living Dead" and
"Gremlins". If your fans of those films then you will enjoy this movie. If you have small children please do not let them watch this.
