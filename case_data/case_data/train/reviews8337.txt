Rehashed crap.

This was one of the worst examples of Hollywood smearing money on
something until a room full of idiots gives texted approvals.A brave, muscle bound man rescues his soon to be ex-wife, who just
happens to be marrying a real Snidley McWhiplash billionaire played by
one of the dingus's from fantastic 4... by commandeering a coastguard
helicopter and basically doing whatever the hell he wants with it which
apparently is to fly over literally millions and millions of people in
immediate need of rescue to save his wife and daughter. Both of which
are horribly cast, plastic coated Californians lounging poolside and
enjoying the finer things in life and then... Disaster strikes! There
is no connection with these characters and you just don't care if they
live or die, I was hoping for the latter in every case.Oh, and there's the "expert" quoting countless geologists from the
discovery channel who conveniently and of course, narrowly escapes
death dozens of times only to unfailingly "know" what's about to
happen, sadly, just after it happens. This is a perfect example of Hollywood, being Hollywood and should be
avoided by anyone who's been hollywooded before, which is anyone
watching this kind of crap over the last several decades. I would have
given it a 0 but IMDb, sadly doesn't give that option.
