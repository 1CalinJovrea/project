the secret life of pets

I went to see this with my sister and my cousins and we enjoyed it. It
was funny silly and my favorite illumination movie it's worth a watch
and it is definitely better than minions it is fun for the whole
family. I could not stop laughing at this movie it so many great
characters. the cast is pure amazing my favorite character was Kevin
Hart's character snowball he was the most funniest character in the
movie I don't know why this movie has a 6.8 it should have at least a
7.8. It brought me laughs from beginning to end. This movie will
hopefully inspire illumination to make make new franchises next or you
know despicable me 3 it's defiantly going to be that.
