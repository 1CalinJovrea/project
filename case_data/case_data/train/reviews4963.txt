Just put politics aside and watch it

As polarizing as this movie is just put your politics aside and watch
it. The attack is a part of history that deserves to be put on screen
in as grand and well produced manner as can be. And in that sense it
succeeds. The filming in Morocco and Malta captures a really on
location feel. The battles are well done and engaging, not over the top. It was a bit
confusing at times distinguishing the main characters. Maybe they
shouldn't have had beards for the movie because it made them look
alike. Jon Krasinski and James Badge Dale, Max Martini and Dominic
Fumusa are all good as the heroes. There is just enough background with
kids and wives shown to put a human element to the people. Whatever
your politics is, they were brave. Liked Jon Krasinki's characters
statement about dying over there at the end.The journey under fire from the embassy to the annex was gripping. The
prolonged gunfire and mortar attack on the annex was quite scary too.
It was chaotic but as long as you kept the 2 compounds separate in your
mind it was okay. Initially, a little bit less back and forth between
scenarios would have been better. There are the "bad" good guys - the incompetent CIA people especially
the chief who gives the infamous and disputed "Stand down" order. Wish
they had shown a bit more of the Ambassador's death and recovery of his
body but maybe it was just too disheartening for the screen. Some people against the movie are probably just unhappy it was made in
the first place. Apart from the stand down and request for air support
it isn't too directly critical of the administration. There might not
be a way to make a movie about Benghazi that actually could make the
haters happy. Watch this movie.
