I can't remember the last time I cringed so often

I usually (and quite easily) hand out 8, 9 or 10 stars to a film. In
fact, the majority of movies I watch receive good-to-excellent scores
from me. This one however, does not.The jokes often feel exaggerated and forced, and are embarrassingly
childish with far too much profanity. I can't remember the last time I
cringed so often. Sure, there was the occasional joke which received a
giggle from just about everyone, but the majority of the humour was
replied to with silence and head-shaking. It seriously felt like it was
a movie thrown together quickly to make a decent enough trailer to lure
an audience. So, don't fall for it. You've been warned.3.4 / 10
