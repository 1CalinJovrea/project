Great Name for the Film!!

And what a trainwreck it is! I have actually watched a few episodes of
'Inside Amy Schumer', laughing a few times and sitting there confused
for most times. I understand how hard it is for a stand-up comic to not
only star in, but write a comedy that lasts at least 90 minutes.
However, with all my understandings I just didn't like this film. Small
parts of it were kind of funny, but the rest of it was like a mashup of
ideas that were trying hard to come together.Hader was the only redeeming factor of the film. He acted with intent
and knew the role he was playing. All the celebrity cameos (especially
from some of the sports stars) seemed strained at the best of times.
Amy herself is unrelatable. I don't understand why people are going
crazy for her?? Is it because she is a female in a highly male
dominated industry? I'm sure she truly is a funny person, but maybe
test run these things a bit more before sending them out into the
world.
