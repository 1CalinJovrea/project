Very Y.A.- poorly written

Better writing should have been implemented for the strategies,
dialogue, and the awkward romance element forced to fit in. The first movie was the best of the bunch, this being the finale... to
say it was disappointing in its execution would be an understatement.
Too much focus is spent on special effects while attention to good
substance is lost in this installment. In short, it's as if Michael Bay
oversaw this tragic mess. The acting (If most of the dialogue is
excluded) was not bad at all and clearly the costume designer had fun
with these well put together looks. Characters were perfectly made up
to look suitably roughed up. I appreciate that they weren't more
focused on glamor in the action scenes than grit. The writing is still
what I have a problem with and that is the meat of any film. The issues
I have with this film would have turned a much better book worthy of
the silver screen into a silly soap opera with guns. As it stands the
book even as a y.a. novel needed improvement but the film could've done
well what the book did poorly, enhancing it to be even more exciting.
