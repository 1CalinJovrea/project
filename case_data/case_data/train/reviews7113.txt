Critics vs Gamer

I'm going to come out and say it, the critics are right, but there is a
big but here. If you have played this game, you are going to truly
enjoy it. The big problem that I think is not going to brake the video
game curse is the fact that it isn't possible to cover the whole story
in such a short amount of time and appeal to critics and people who
haven't played the game and never will while satisfying gamers in a way
that won't scare them away from the video game itself. So if I'm
talking right now to a gamer, I would say that this movie has it all,
but if I'm not, you will probably dislike the movie or simply just
enjoy it as a C grade movie that got you entertained for two hours and
you'll forget about it in a few more. Now that's out of the way here is my fan review. The parkour, the
animus, the outfits, the scenes and the story was all an amazing
representation of Assassin's Creed. It made justice to the game
completely. If you are a fan of the games, you'll truly enjoy this film
to its fullest potential. Lastly, Fassbender's performance was amazing
and the assassin girl was crazy good. "Nothing it's true, everything is
permitted." Cons: one eagle flying scene could have been enough and the
last shot was cheesy, but other than that I loved this film for the
same reason I love the videogames.
