Hoping for the next movie

I love the Percy Jackson books, it's one of my favourite book series.
Thought the first film was alright, but a mediocre version of the
books. When I heard that there was going to be a second one, I was very
skeptical that it would work considering the number of bad changes
they've done to the Lightning Thief. But once I learned that screen writers Scott Alexander & Larry
Karaszewski were hired to adapt it (who aren't credited for some
reason), I began to feel hopeful for the Sea of Monsters. Alexander and
Karaszewski had previously worked on the bio-pics Ed Wood, The People
vs. Larry Flynt, and Man on the Moon. I thought that they'd look up the
books and do justice to Percy Jackson.Just came back from seeing it and I really like it, thought it was
better than The Lightning Thief. I didn't think that it was a great
film, some of the dialogue felt awkward to me, but overall I had fun
and felt some justice was done. Yes, there was some changes made to the
Sea of Monsters but nothing as bad as the previous film. I enjoyed
watching Stanley Tucci (Mr. D), Anthony Stewart Head (Chiron), and Ron
Perlman (Polyphemus). Definitely see it if you like the books. Now I'm hoping to see the next
films in the series!
