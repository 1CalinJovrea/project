When you mix some good ideas with bad ideas

Simply it was not the role for Chris Evans. The actor really has never
established completely to the romantic movies, and proof of it is the
final scene of this movie, the dialogue between Evans and Monaghan
could have been more romantically convincing." Playing It Cool " is not a bad movie but it definitively could have
been way better. Probably another cast assemble or to avoid leaving
unfinished parts in the story.The film is predictable, there will be times when you will be anxious
for what will happen, and some other times you will feel boredom and
impatience. The perfect movie for a curious audience who really don't have nothing
to do but watch a new movie with any type of expectations.
