Drifting Further Away From The Charm Of The Original

The Ice Age series is one of the more endearing animated franchise from
the past decade. The first was a heartwarming and genuinely funny
adventure taking place during the time of mammoths, sabertooth tigers,
and clumsy sloths. The first sequel lost a lot of that magic, but Dawn
of the Dinosaurs did do some fresh things with the series. However,
generally, over time, the films have gained plenty of characters, but
lost most of its charm. The fourth in the series, Continental Drift, is
the least exciting, least funny, and cheapest of the bunch. That's not
to say that Ice Age 4 doesn't have its moments: the main characters
still have their appeal and there are a few good laughs, but it is
clear that the Ice Age train is running out of steam here.Continental Drift kicks off with the lovable rodent Scrat causing the
continents to drift apart. The trio of Manny, Diego, and Sid are soon
embarking on an adventure adrift on the open sea. They meet up with
pirates (and a whole collection of new characters) and try to find
their way home. The plots of the Ice Age films have gotten simpler as
they go, instead relying on introducing as many new characters as
possible.The problem with Ice Age 4 is that none of the new characters are
memorable, funny, or charming. The effort just seems to be down here.
Ray Romano, Dennis Leary, and John Leguizamo, still manage to breath
some life into the picture, but the passion is clearly not there like
it was in 2002. The animation is also less-than-stellar. Ice Age
Continental Drift could be a TV movie and I wouldn't know the
difference. It's just cheap.There are some moments of wit and excitement in Ice Age 4, but on the
whole, it is an exercise in diminishing returns. Most of the passion
and effort of the series is gone, leading to a generic and, dare I say,
boring animated adventure. Look elsewhere for family fun.43/100
