Greed Hollywood

The Huger Games has clearly grown up in Mockingjay. Social criticism is
much stronger than previous movies. Films theme is much more brooding
and ominous than before. But that doesn't save this picture totally.
Dividing the movie in two parts is clearly a huge mistake. Many scene
are way too long and some of them are clearly just vain. Topmost
feeling is just making more money. It would be much better to make only
one movie instead of two. One three hour long movie is much easier to
keep together, than two over length movies. It is clearly Hollywood's
greed to capitalize on movie (and book) series fans. How many times
more the audience will accept that? Jennifer Lawrece is great at her
role as Katniss, but somehow Josh Hutcherson as Peeta's role as
brainwashed puppet doesn't convince. There is a lot of good elements in
this movie so it is a shame that Hollywood want just get few more money
from the fans. Mockingjay part 1 is despite that quite eligible movie
that end up in green money making. Good movie ends up to mediocre
action flick and that is shame.
