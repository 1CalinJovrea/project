The Worst Movie Ever

this movie is brutal. I cannot believe anyone finds it the least bit
entertaining. Jonah Hill is even worse then he was in 'The Sitter' and
Channing Tatum is even worse. If anyone wants to see a "Buddy Cop
Movie" go rent 'Lethal Weapon' tat herd is not one scene that makes me
even smile ( let alone laugh), and the action scenes are not exciting
either. Mercedes might be the lamest villain ever ( she makes a 'Scooby
Doo' enemy look sinister ( the fist fight between her and Jonah Hill is
especially stupid)). I really cannot see any purpose, rhyme or reason behind this movie,
because it neither excites, makes me laugh or anything else.?it just
might be the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, and I have
seen thousands.
