Borderline to insulting (screen)

So this movie was among the hottest unproduced screenplays in 2008. So
there is indeed a conspiracy going on because the movie that i watched
in 2017 was just awful !Honestly, i live in a state of emergency since 2015, i watched it just
after the Manchester attack and what you seen on screen leaves you
angry for all the victimsHere the movie is just like a game : the plot is so silly that nobody
can think the real ones are like this : the biological pathogen comes
from Russia (who else!) and is given to an English convert who awaits
the green light of an Imam before hiding it into Wembley Stadium by
accomplices ready to explode with a remote control turned on by the big
dark conspirator after he did his endless villain speech ???? Does the
writer actually check news or just imagine what he wants ? For sure, at
this level, he is very, very faraway from Clancy, Forsight, Le CarréNext, the action happens in London (and Paris) but it's about the firm
I always thought that the firm operated in evil countries... Now I see
that their agents work in friendly ones as well... So if our own
national agents are schmucks, there is no better way to say it... In
addition I don't like smug and what happens inside it is shocking : the
big chief played by poor Malkovich is a clown making jokes and ugly
faces That's really somebody who cares about fellows...So, one more time, i wonder why Noomi picked up this new stinker :
actually she was rather good as a social worker or as a little soldier
and interrogator but as soon she has to be super agent firing guns, all
the movie goes to the toilets. And honestly, i was already tired by
the poster with Noomi pointing a gun because for me, it's a proof that
our culture goes down!And ice on this acid cake, the final scene is totally outrageous : you
see Noomi killing in cold blood the runaway mastermind walking in
eastern Europe streets and then she is welcomed by aforementioned
stupid smiling and joking Malkovich : my feelings : 1) this firm has
really a wicked sense of justice without a judge ! 2) More values
movies taught you that killing an enemy is bad and that's a tragedy
because you become after the bad guy (Star Wars Episode III)
