So much potential, so little satisfaction

I should start by explaining that I am not a fan of comic books, movies
made from comic books, nor movies that have a comic book type story,
with the utter and complete lack of plausibility in every single scene.
I do like magical realism, and fantasy though. This movie had a few
good elements. Some of the giants were cool, and the costumes were
probably the best part of the movie. But, the movie was so overwrought, so chock full of hundreds of
different elements, it would have been nearly impossible for even a top
director to bring all of that together. It turned out to be a wish
mash, a jumble of elements. Toward the last 45 minutes it was nearly
entirely incoherent. I had no idea of who the players were, and it
became a tangled mess. At the beginning of the film, I thought there were enough elements, to
create a satisfying story. At the end of the film, my two friends and
myself all looked at each other, and felt the same way.There were several occasions during the last hour that I was compelled
to walk out. The only reason I stayed, is that I am currently overseas,
in a location with few theaters, and few English films available.
