Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor

This guy is great, his career got of to a bit of a slow start with some
of his early work but he still seem to catch a few decent ones. Now it
seems he will disappear for a while then come out with a smash. This
guy is up there with the best of them and he is in my top 10 favorites.Normally i don't fallow movies very close, i spend time tinkering or
reading on line and if a movie catches my attention then i get into it.
This one grabbed me from the start and held on to the end.They kept the suspense with the station wagon and it kept me wondering
on who it my be and their intent but it wasn't what i thought and was a
nice surprise.
