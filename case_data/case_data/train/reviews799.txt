OK, I'll say it...

I've been in the industry for almost 20 years and I had to create an
account to say this: This movie was bad. This was a bad movie. This
script should have never seen a screen the way it stands. I don't know
if Steve McQueen or someone else screwed with it so much that it no
longer worked, but someone murdered this script.Characters appear and disappear for no reason. Plot lines are thrown
in, rolled around and pulled out. Then there is the miracle ending
that's not foreshadowed in any way - a total Hail Mary - like the
producers suddenly said: 'Yo, Stevie, you're sitting at over 2 hours...
End the thing already before we run out of cash.' Ugh... Never have God
(or his human counterpart, Brad Pitt) save your movie in the last 10
minutes. That's first-year film school stuff.I was hoping for a film like 2001's Conspiracy
(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266425/) but instead I got this. What a
total shame. This story should have been a masterpiece. It should have
been a classic.The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because it is
beautifully shot. It betrays a grade-school-level interpretation of
history (Northerners were beautiful and cultured while Southerners were
drunk whore-mongers who rolled around with pigs), but at least it was
nice to look at.
