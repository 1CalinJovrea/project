Kind of messed up, but artfully done, so ... yeah

Usually these movies should never get green lit by a studio, since it
basically puts bad ideas in already crazy people's minds. But hey, it's
art, right? So let's make a movie about a serial-killing couple that
abducts young girls for sexual abuse before murdering them. Yeah! That
being said, it's interesting albeit too predictable at the end. The
cinematography is good; the acting by the two leads is amazing. The
primary teen at the heart of the film ... the acting was mediocre there
at best, but what else can you expect from someone chained to a bed for
half the film? Emma Booth is amazing, and Stephen Curry (no, not THAT
basketball guy) is pretty stunning, too. The soundtrack really works,
both the songs and the background music. Using both Cat Stevens and Joy
Division to set moods has to be some kind of artistic feat hitherto
untried. Wow! In truth, you'll really want the movie to end long before
it does, but it's worth staying until the end, even if it sort of
"craps the bed" at that point -- pun intended!!
