Good, but not as great as i was hoping.

This movie is a charming little film from a very exciting new talent,
Zoe Kazan, who i think is going to excel with her next foray into
screen writing. While watching this movie it's rather obvious that it's
written by a first time writer, that's not to say that it's not well
written because it is, it's just a little underwritten, some characters
are underdeveloped and at times it lags without any type of direction.
It may sound like i didn't like this movie but i did, it's quirky and
very indie which is the kind of stuff i like, it has two leads who are
excellent in their roles (it does help that the audience knows they are
in love in real life), and it has a wonderful supporting cast, in
particular the always excellent Annette Bening and Antonio Banderas who
impressed me in a role i'd never picture him in otherwise.One particular part of the film i like was the realistic portrayal of a
modern day relationship, it's not all romance and love every day, there
are dark parts to a relationship and it's portrayed here very well, the
relationship ups and downs are some of the best i've seen in a film in
a very long time. The production and all that jazz is done very well,
it's impressive how low budget indie films are made so well and stylish
these days, i guess it's a good indication of a director knowing how to
make a movie well.Little Miss Sunshine it ain't, but it is a bit of fun for a Sunday
afternoon, it's nice to see a new girl on the block taking on the
quirky side of cinema, MOVE OVER ZOOEY DESCHANEL, THERE'S A NEW ZOE
ABOUT TO TAKE YOUR CROWN. ;)
