Colossal but didn't grown up enough

A disappointment. They tried to market this film as something far
better than it really is. even though the original premise had some
real potential, the awful character development (mainly Gloria and
Oscar) managed to empty all that potential to a point that's almost
nothing left.Gloria and Oscar are a pretty unlikable pair of human beings. They
appear as hard-to- connect-with and with non-adequately presented
trajectories, at least to the point one could really identify with and
care about what happens or not to them, or merely understand more
clearly why they are as they are.Gloria's character tries to gain some sympathy through the charisma of
her actress, but instead of succeeding on this, she makes you think
something like "What's about this girl, anyway?"... And Oscar lacks a
serious lot of depth, at least something to make more clearer why he
starts to show from a certain point so many strange an widely
incoherent attitudes with the character's own trajectory in the film
until that point.What you see for a good part of the movie: two adult human beings with
jerky attitudes (childish in most parts, in other just plain jerky)
towards life, without knowing exactly why. That can be pretty annoying.
Even with a (very, very, weak) explanation ahead in the story,it fails
in stop the damage.What could be a far better movie ends as a cheap metaphor about the
huge incapacity of a whole generation of adults in behave as well,
clinging to an somewhat ridiculous immaturity. The final product,
albeit well produced and with technical and direction in the right
places, is something with a narrative depth as closer as a SNL sketch
than a proper motion picture.In the end, it resumes itself as an whining generation movie of the
sort "I suffered bullying from a mean boy at school and now, 25 years
after that, I'm a loser adult woman that cannot stand my life unless I
drunk my sorry ass out in a daily basis. Just because the boy stomped
all over my school project!"
