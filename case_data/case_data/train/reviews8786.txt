Absolute garbage!

I used to love horror movies. I've decided they are basically extinct
and have been for a long time. Insidious 1 was decent and I made it
through the entire movie because I was engaged with the story more so
than the cheesy cheap scares(that we've all seen a million times and
are actually exhausting to watch). With that being said, I just rented
#2 tonight and turned it off half way through. What absolute garbage
--- exhausting. I am done with Hollywood junk..DONE DONE DONE! I wish I
could get my 1 buck back. The acting was awful. The scares were not
scary but super cheesy. The story, boring and they just tell it to you.
Urgh. Don't even waste your time!
