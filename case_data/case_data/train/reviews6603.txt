A visually stunning and harrowing futuristic thriller

Haunting post apocalyptic tale. Sublimely acted, directed, and
photographed. May not be for everyone, but a must for anyone who loves
film and is bored of the spate of fantasy and YA dystopian dramas that
are all too prevalent. This movie can be seen as both a futuristic
nightmare and as a cautionary tale about our wasting of our resources
and the dangers that loom. Martin McCann provides the heart and soul of
the film in the title role and he is certainly destined for stardom.
All the performances are brave and gut wrenching. Given the darkness of
the film and its graphic visuals I am not sure if this film can find a
wide audience but it is guaranteed to become a festival favorite and
cult success.
