Embarrassingly bad...

Watched this based on the fact it had an interesting, original idea and
good ad campaign...The reality is that 'The Purge' is one of the worst movies I have ever
seen - an original idea is ruined by huge plot holes, annoying, clich√©d
and unbelievable characters, bad acting and scripting, and an absurdity
that goes beyond 'Sci-Fi' or suspending your disbelief...Rather than being scary, tense or exciting it was just incredibly
irritating - watching characters doing the most stupid things
throughout that made you repeatedly ask the question "WTF did they do
THAT for?"... The woman sat next to me in the cinema was chuckling to
herself throughout and at the end climax everyone in the cinema was
laughing at how ridiculous and absurd it had all become - was it
actually meant as a thriller or a comedy? It started off promisingly
and went downhill very quickly indeed...As soon as you pick through the plot holes and how dumb the purge
killers are for cutting off the power to the Sandin's house when they
have just asked them to hand over the homeless guy they are harbouring
inside you can no longer take any of it seriously at all... Maybe it's
because had they NOT cut the power and the lights in the house there
would be no movie left and this ordeal would have ended even more
prematurely than the 85 mins I had to suffer... The actions of those
involved make no sense and the whole feeling of the movie is that as
long as you have money then screw everybody else in society...
