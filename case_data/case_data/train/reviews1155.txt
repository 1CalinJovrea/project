Trite story, bad direction, poor casting, barely redeemed by performances

Good romantic films are almost as rare as good comedies. I really did
not ask for anything special, as I like "chick flicks" and Hollywood
has such a love affair with action movies, Hollywood has almost stopped
making them. Nonetheless, I really disliked this one; because, even
with the clich√©s, this movie had so much promise. The movie opens with
a fine action sequence; and James Marsden is a really watchable actor.
However, as soon as the parallel love stories begin, the movie falls
apart. First of all "young Amanda" (Liana Liberato) not only does not
look much like "older Amanda" (Michelle Monaghan), their body languages
and acting styles are completely different. There is even a bigger
disparity with "young Dawson" (Luke Bracey) and "older Dawson" (James
Marsden). Thanks to terrific performances by Liana Liberato and Gerald
McRaney, the flashback sequences are much more entertaining than the
present sequences, even though Michael Hoffman's direction is much
better in the present sequences. Hoffman shoots WAY too many of the
flashback sequences as medium shots, when closeups would have been far
better. Even the ending seems tacked on and trite.Except for Liana Liberato and Gerald McRaney, "The Best of Me" is
anything but. I give "The Best of Me" a "5".
