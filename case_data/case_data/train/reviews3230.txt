Eminent Science Fiction

Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must
reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading
the uniformly negative critical reviews. But I was surprised. The movie
is plausible. It is more than plausible, it is realistic. And the
acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what
you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to
figure out what is going on.Granted, there are no alien horror creatures, no protracted fast-action
sequences, no superficial technical nonsense to cover a thin plot.
Maybe this is what the critics were missing.There is only beautiful scenes, eminent acting, a plausible plot and a
surprising ending. But that was enough for me.So go watch this movie and decide for yourself how implausibly stupid
the film critics are.
