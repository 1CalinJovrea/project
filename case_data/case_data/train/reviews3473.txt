I went last night 8/7. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because
chase credit card has a buy one get one free movie ticket on Fridays.
Why everyone is raving about this bore shows people are paid to write
reviews. How can anyone say 10 out of 10. MI 1 was and still is the
best one of the franchise. The airplane scene? Big frigging deal why is
that everyone's high point. It was 2 hours and 10 mins too long should
of been a 1 hour 25 min movie. Was so drawn out. There was laughable
scenes when cruise gets out of the car that had just flipped 10 times
at 100mph. When he crashed the motorcycle with no helmet at 120mph he
gets up with no damage like the terminator after being shot 20 times. Save your money unless you get a buy one get one movie pass like I did.
My chick and I walked out 1hr and 35 mins in. We couldn't take it
anymore. The audience actually laughed a few times during this. Why?
There was no comedy in this. A monotone bore. The first hour not 1
action scene after the stupid plane one in the beginning. I went out to
a rock concert after that was more entertaining than this drivel. Some
others walked out as well. The only good thing was the sour cream and
chive popcorn and the fact the theater sells alcohol to numb the pain
of this movie. San Andreas was better. On that note I'm off to play
Xbox 360. It's more entertaining than this lame flick
