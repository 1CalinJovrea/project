Excellent action thriller

5 people are shot dead and incontrovertible evidence leads the police
to immediately pick up sniper James Barr, who simply asks for Jack
Reacher. Reacher, an ex-army policeman of shadowy background, tells
defence attorney Helen Rodin (who appears to have taken the case simply
to spite her District Attorney father) that he believes Barr to be
guilty because he got away with something similar while he was in the
middle east. But he starts investigating anyway.Based on what I have read in the press, I find Tom Cruise the man to be
an odd individual. But as a performer, there is a reason why he has
been at the top of the pile for a long time - he makes good films, and
he is good in them. Jack Reacher is one of his best.It is a very good part for Cruise - a macho protagonist, well able to
handle himself, but not infallible. The story is strong, if a little
familiar. The script is good fun, the action is handled well, Rosamund
Pike provides solid support, and Robert Duvall, in a part which is
little more than a cameo, is wonderful.But this is Cruise's film, and it is one of the best action thrillers
in recent years.
