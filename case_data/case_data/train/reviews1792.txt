Hope springs eternal

Jake Gyllenhaal gives his fans his best work since Brokeback Mountain
as light heavyweight champion Billy Hope who suffers a horrific
personal tragedy beyond any I've ever seen in a boxing film and comes
back from it. For what he goes through Sylvester Stallone had it easy.
As Brokeback Mountain got him an Oscar nomination maybe Southpaw will
do the same.Billy Hope is a kid raised in an orphanage as a foundling as is his
loving and supportive wife Rachel McAdams. They have a daughter played
by Oona Laurence who is their whole world. When McAdams is killed in an
unspeakable tragedy, Gyllenhaal's world falls apart and he has to make
one long comeback.As a kid who was raised by the social welfare system it's the system
that decides what he must do to gain back his child. Gyllenhaal is
wonderful as a man who successfully conquers the badder angels of his
nature to gain it all back, title, child, and self respect.McAdams should be singled out for a moving death scene ranking up there
with some of the screen's best. Also Forest Whitaker who trains the
ex-champ for his comeback should also be singled out.Watching Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope put me in mind of heavyweight
contender Hurricane Jackson when I was a kid. There's no science in
Hope's style, he just wades in and brawls. Hope will take two or three
punches to get in his shot. As McAdams points out he'll be punch drunk
within a few years. Whitaker puts a little science in his boxing
persona. Hurricane Jackson was very much like Billy Hope and did in
fact end up punch drunk.This is a fine boxing film and Oscar nominations could come for
Gyllenhaal and McAdams.
