Not Very Necessary. ...

The original film adaptation of the novel CARRIE has creepy atmosphere, 

laudable acting, excellent story development and the perfect 

tension-building pace. This film has none of those things in common 

with its predecessor. This one also lacks the character development and 

chemistry between the principle characters that was present in the 

original version. The characters seem very two- dimensional.



The director has stated that he wished to make the story more 

accessible to a broader audience. Translation: This is a dumbed-down 

version of the original, for the legions of lameness out there. Film 

critic Beth Accomando said that it "makes obvious all that the original 

film made subtle and does so with less complexity." I could not agree 

more. If you are going to remake something, especially something so 

well-known, you must have something to change or add to it to make it 

your own. In my opinion, this film failed to do so. Any of the changes 

that were present actually weakened the resulting product.



I can't see how the original is rivaled in any way. Even if I hadn't 

seen the original first, this would have been average at best for me.
