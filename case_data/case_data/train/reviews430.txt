A huge letdown

I love watching a good Sci-Fi flick. I'm always up for enjoying a
cheesy film like Starship Troopers. This film looked like it had real potential in the trailers. It seemed
to have a bit of a Riddick style and a bit of a Star Wars story.
Unfortunately it doesn't live up to any of the promise from the
trailers. By the end I was painfully bored. There were so many problems I don't
even know how to articulate them all without wasting a bunch of my time
ranting. The love story didn't make any sense at all, she basically
falls for the first guy to hold her hand and trusts him implicitly from
that moment. We watch as an established futuristic society full of
rules and protocols moves things along only to witness how they ignore
all those same protocols later. Why spend 15 minutes of a film having
us watch the actors wait in lines to obtain "citizenship/title" only to
have all the rights of those titles ignored and fought over....
Couldn't you have just given them automatic citizenship and moved the
story along???What was the point of the massive battle scenes with so many
characters? We never got a chance to learn the backstory for their
universe so we never got emotionally invested in the story. I'm done. Don't see this movie, it's a waste of your time. Time is the
one thing we can't get back and we can't buy more of. Time is the most
precious resource we have.
