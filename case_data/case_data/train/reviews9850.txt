Good satire of politics.

The Campaign is a good satire of politics. The Campaign shows why the
public has lost faith in the USA political process. The satire of the
movie shows how candidates do not answer questions, but skirt issues
and use generic themes like freedom etc. The Campaign shows there is no
discussion of the issues and the two candidates deteriorate the
campaign into the Springer show. One has sex with the other's wife as a
campaign ad. The Campaign shows that the special interests run both
parties, which is the reason why there is no real debate, and interest
in what is good for the community. The film is funny but has some low
ball comedy on Religion, sex, and people. I give The Campaign a seven
out of ten.
