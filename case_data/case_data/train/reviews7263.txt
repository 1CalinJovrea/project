Worth the wait, time and money...Brilliant!

I have been following this movie for a while now. Largely because of
the two main actors Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba and I have to say I
was not disappointed at all. Watched it in 3D (I have always strayed
away from 3D before because I just didn't think it was worth spending
the extra cash) but this time I do not regret my choice at all. It was
a visual feast.Action was on point. The story flowed well (this is a blockbuster after
all, we aren't going to compare it to an art house film). For me the
actors embraced their roles very well and the visuals were magnificent
(thank god once again for the 3D). Everything just felt right!Being familiar with Guillermo's past work I would say this is his best
yet. His imagination is wicked. So if you are looking for great
entertainment and a little something to wow you, this is the movie for
you. Bravo. Two thumbs up.
