What I Wanted to See

In a world where most of the films are boring and predictable, The Last
Witch Hunter was a joyful surprise. Most of what i see, in the realm of
non indie or non blockbuster, the Halloween or summer movies realm, is
the same formula, and while TLWH relies on a old one, still manages to
safe a few surprises in the plot, that i didn't expect, and there's
what makes this a better entertainment than the others holidays films.It's a movie where you can sit, watch, get some popcorn with your
friends, and enjoy one nice evening on home or cinema. The acting is
not the best from the actors, Michael Caine and Diesel are what the
movies needs, and is where lies the goal of this flick, is not the
best, but do what propose to, be a good time, there's nothing else we
can complain about it, a good time movie is way better than a boring
ultra deep, 3-hour, intellectual film that goes nowhere, and is easy to
say that the enjoyable is worse than the art for the sake of art.In the end of TLWH i was very satisfied, i wont remember forever, it
wont won a Oscar, but the times i'm home ate Friday night with some
friends, probably this will be in the list of movies that i mighty see,
so don't mind the reviews, if you like some time without a urge to be
smart and cool, grab a snack, see this film and enjoy what the
entertainment world has to offer, entertainment.
