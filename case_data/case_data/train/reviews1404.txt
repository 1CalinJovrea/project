Oh gawd please make it stop !!!!

Oh dear, oh dear.Just goes to show that squillions of dollars and a shed-load of cgi
effects can't make up for a totally loopy, over-blown,juvenile 'plot'.It wasn't all bad - Spock and Harrison/Khan were actually pretty good,
and the aforesaid cgi was exciting (albeit in a derivative kinda way).But...Pine was hopeless (except when being 'bad ass' he just looked
goosed),whilst the excellent Urban, Soldana and Pegg were woefully
under-used.The story made no freaking sense, having more holes in it than a Tetley
teabag. There was little in the way of dialogue and less in the way of
character development. The 'climax', with Spock and Khan going three
rounds on the back of a flying dustcart, came straight out of a 1950s
'Flash Gordon' matin√©e.The musical score was of the DAHN-DAHN-DAHHHHHHNNNNNN variety, heavily
underscoring any emotional sub-text that we dullards might have failed
to notice.Please tell me JJ Abrams has left the building.Please make it stop.Perhaps then somebody good could take on the Trek franchise - Joss
Whedon anyone?
