Where the journey is better than the destination

I saw this one against the critics' recommendation at Rottentomatoes,
and it was because of Amanda Seyfred, to be honest. She has those
beautiful big blue eyes and blonde hair that one cannot look away from.But after watching her in this movie, it is clear to me that she is
much more than a pretty face, and she can carry a movie on her own.I can see why the critics would hate it, though. The plot is overly
simple, the cops have a cursory role, and none of the characters other
than that of Amanda's are well-developed. And, the big 'confrontation'
is dealt with as if the director wanted it out of the way as soon as
possible.But, to be honest, in retrospect, the film is about none of that. This
is a suspense thriller, not a horror. There does not have to be a big
confrontation, and there does not have to be jump shots. This is about
the journey of the protagonist against all odds, and how she uses her
alertness and her resourcefulness and her charm to get to the person
she believes has her sister.In this, it succeeds. I would watch this one again, and if a movie
makes me think that, it has succeeded for me.
