Unoriginal but still entertaining horror film

Originality is a hard thing nowadays because it feels like everything
has already been done in horror films before. So I am not going to
complain too much about it. There have been a host of films made
recently which reminded me of earlier films. In a similar way,
Honeymoon reminded me of movies like Invasion of the body snatchers,
Communion and other such films. Once you have seen these type of films,
you know the direction that the movie is taking and the ending isn't
too much of a shock.But still this movie has the atmosphere part in place. I did think that
the acting was superior, the interactions between the couple were
interesting to watch. Frankly there are not many incidents so to speak.
But despite that, the interactions, the fear, the bewilderment are all
portrayed pretty well by the two actors. The first 15 minutes or so
were annoying with the lovey dovey stuff but once it settles, the
characters become more interesting. The little things matter obviously,
like the usage of the wrong word and so on. The fact is that there are
only two characters for 75% of the movie but they still pulled it off.
For that I appreciate the actors.I liked certain scenes in particular like the scene where Bea gets tied
up. There is an intensity to these scenes even if it feels repetitive.
It feels real, the reactions and the confusions. One thing I did like
is that they don't really try to throw red herrings to confuse you.
They just let the story go down the predictable path but make it as
creepy as possible. There are not many loud scares as well (Infact I
don't remember any).Truth to be told, that woman freaked me out. That may be a reason why I
like the movie despite its unoriginal nature.7/10
