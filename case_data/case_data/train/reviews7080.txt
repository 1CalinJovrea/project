This Youth is wasted on all ages.

If this was the first movie you saw in a theater, you would never go
back.Kudos go to the cinematographer for making something so bad look good.
The location photography and stunning visuals are not enough to
overcome this cinematic dribble.It is dialogue driven with constant walk and talks, sit and talks, eat
and talks and lay around and talks. Some of the dialogue is about the
ending of a movie planned in the movie. Good news that one won't be
made.Performances are subtle as in wasted. The exception is a tea bag drop
in of Jane Fonda who has a great three minutes. Of course she like
everything else in the movie is more then slightly askew. There was no
need to rip her wig off as if the audience didn't know it was a wig.There are good moments. The conducting of the cows was fun. The mass of
the directors leading ladies on the hillside was interesting. There is an annoying redundancy including crackling of red cellophane
and one to many shots of the wife at the windowIt is always amazing that movies that are too long and too slow have
time for a complete song before before the fade out to slow overly long
credits.The movie is in limited release and you'll be lucky if it doesn't come
to a theater near you. If you see it in a theater for free you will
demand your two hours back.
