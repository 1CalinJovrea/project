Ignore the hate and give it a go!

I've seen a loooot of bad reviews for this movie, the primary reason
for the hate being that the plot was 'unrealistic' or
'implausible'........ uhm.........what the f**k, haters? If you want to
watch a sci-fi alien monster movie that's 'realistic', go watch some
NASA documentaries, don't come to the cinemas.Another reason for all the bad reviews seems to be that it 'tries to
imitate Alien but fails'. Well, f**k, then no one else should ever try
to make another space monster movie ever! Lets just keep watching the
1979 'Alien' again and again........seriously.....So, why do i think this movie is so much better than all the negative
press it is getting ? Well for a change it's set on the ISS, not a
fictional planet or space-ship floating around 100s of light-years
away.....(implausible they say). It has people who seem to be
astronauts, dealing with a growing life form, rather than space heroes
shooting space guns at space monsters (unrealistic, they say). The
horror, suspense and intrigue (which critics say stems for unrealistic
situations) is in my opinion a near-perfect example of Murphy's law in
action. Then, the acting (another prickly point for the critics) is
actually very well done given the situations the characters find
themselves in. Reynolds, Gylenhaal & Ferguson all deliver solid
performances in an era where all the 'acting' talent is reserved for
sentimental Oscar-bait movies. As for the plot? strong, fast-paced yet
coherent enough for us uninitiated every-day astronauts. And a SOLID
twist at the very end.So, all-in-all, ignore the hate and give this movie a try \m/
