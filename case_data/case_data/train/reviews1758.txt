Chilling and Sad.Ignore the One-Stars!

Never written a review before. Haven't felt the need. But after seeing
the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled. Firstly,what this is.I would say a cross between The Shining and We Need to talk about
Kevin. This film is desperately sad. A woman who is haunted,first by
her husbands death,then by the Babadook all while looking after her
young son. This is a creepy, no jump scare, fantastic psychological
horror. A rare gem that plays on all those fairytale fears that you may
have had as a kid.Second.What this isn't.Well,not "The worst horror in years".I get that people have different
opinions.I do.But this isn't a film that can justify that sort of
nonsensical comment. It isn't a dull jump scare-filled blockbuster. The
characters are not hot teenagers. They are believable, disturbed and
this makes the film the slow,creeping horror that it is.If you are a fan of horror,it really is a must see film.
