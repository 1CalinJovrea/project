This is so much better than people give it credit for

Don't listen to the people saying it doesn't make sense or it doesn't
have an ending or whatever. Look, this film isn't really for everyone,
because it's slow-paced and not a lot is happening all the time, but
certain things are undeniably great about this film, like the acting
and the cinematography and the soundtrack and the REALISM. This film
really surprised me in it that it's not at all "hollywoodized". It's
purely just real. It reveals human nature in a way that not a lot of
films do, as in, people are more complicated that we give them credit
for, and they act certain ways for a number of reasons that we just
won't know on the getgo. In the beginning of the film, you'll probably
find yourself annoyed with a lot of characters, but as you learn more
about them and realize that there's more to them than what you first
saw, you kind of feel bad for judging them. My only small nitpicks
about this film is that some scenes I wish they had long static shots
of the characters, like in Shame if you ever saw that film, because it
would've fit better than cutting between the faces of the people, but
other than that, this is a well made film. Don't go into this film with
any "pre-judgements", because it's likely not correct. All that I can
say is this is not an action packed film. It's not really a thriller.
It's not a fantastical plot. It's slow and steady and real.
