Victoria and Abdul: Grey Audience Special

BBC Films. Based on a true story (mostly). This is a film about the
controversial friendship between Queen Victoria and a Muslim 'coin
carrier' Abdul. Abdul is awarded the role of presenting the coin at a
Royal banquet simply because he is tall, a friendship develops and he
is promoted very quickly within the household and much to the annoyance
of the other staff. This is Britain doing what it does best, great performances, great
costumes, and great cinematography. Judy Dench is amazing as always. I was not expecting much humour, but this film so funny in places,
particularly during the first hour. The downside is the politics at the
time, which can obviously linked to current political affairs,
especially Brexit, the BBC can be so left wing!
