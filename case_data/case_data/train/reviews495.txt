8
If you love the Eighties and video games! YOU WILL FREAKING LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!

I grew up on the Eighties because I was a kid in the Eighties. I had
few friends. But I loved the music of the eighties like Olivia Newton-
John,Duran Duran,Spandau Ballet,Michael Jackson,Lionel Richie,Huey
Lewis and the News,Robert Palmer,Debbie Gibson,George Michael and Rick
Astley etc. And I loved my Atari 600XL computer. My personal favorite
video games were of course Pac-Man,Q-Bert,Space Invaders,Donkey
Kong,Frogger,Pole Position and my personal favorites were Star Raiders
were you fly your ship across the galaxy and wipe out enemy ships in
other sectors and Star Wars the Arcade Game. I really liked Adam Sandler as well as Kevin James and Josh Gad and
Michelle Monaghan in this movie,and I loved the part where Pac-Man eats
his creator's arm off. If you love the eighties and video games. This
one's for you.
