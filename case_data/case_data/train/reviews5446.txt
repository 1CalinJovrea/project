Lousy, Loud, Unfunny Garbage

If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems
almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual
humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame
satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators'
desire to make the first "adult" 3D animated film. The interpretation
of "adult" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe
porn--in other words, "adult" in the sense that you wouldn't want
children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much
sophistication.I have nothing against gross or low humor. But that's just it. There
aren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually
someone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want
something more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not
induce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many
celebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet,
sex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans
out. There are characters taking drugs and talking about "getting
baked." HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and
simulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve
people yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA! HA!News emerging since the opening suggests that the artists working on
this project were treated cruelly and unfairly. That's how I felt as an
audience member.
