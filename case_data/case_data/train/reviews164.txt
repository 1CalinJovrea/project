It hurts...

This is the most powerful drama I had the fortune to experience this
past year. It's up there with Michael Haneke's AMOUR, but this
definitely made me *feel* more. When, near the ending of THE HUNT, we
have some hope for the protagonist, a kindergarten teacher who has been
unjustly accused of child molestation, I actually thought something
like "I hope the movie ends right now!" This because Thomas Vinterberg (director of movies like FESTEN and DEAR
WENDY) makes us feel each and every moment of the great injustice that
is shown in the screen. Yes, we feel for the protagonist Lucas
(top-notch performance by Mads Mikkelsen) but also for his family and
friends, especially for his teenage son. Obviously the, really wished,
"happy ending" is highly unlikely as this is a realistic portrait of
human nature. In the beginning of the film we have a group of Danish hunters (Lucas
included) sharing good times, drinking, talking, just having fun.
Apparently they're a real "family" of friends. The little daughter of
Lucas' best friend is the one who begins the sexual abuse rumor, by
telling the kindergarten director that Lucas showed her his penis. The
parents of this girl didn't give her the enough attention; finding more
important to be arguing than taking her to school, for instance. And
Lucas was there to help the girl Â– it's a really ironic film. The way the families of the supposedly victims react; how the behavior
of a family affects their infants; the general thought we have about
children; and also those subjects of violence and friendship.
Everything is shown here in a very credible way. The violence really
"hurts" you; and I think if a film like THE HUNT doesn't provokes you
*rage*, well, none will. Highly recommended, and for sure one of my
favorites of 2012. *Watched it on 26 December, 2012
