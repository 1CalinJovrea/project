Seven Psychopaths toils with too much intellectual tripe

With the release of this film; Hollywood has claimed its latest
casualty in Martin McDonaghÂ—writer and director of award winning
British comedy, In Bruges.Seven Psychopaths is a parody of McDonagh's life as a screenwriter;
tasked to develop content for a new movie titled (no prize for
guessing) "Seven Psychopaths". It begins with handsome alcoholic; Marty
Faranon (Colin Farrell) living in his cosy, sunlit property overlooking
the coast of Santa Monica. But all is not fine and dandy in Marty's
life--writer's block. With a looming deadline; best friend and unemployed actor Billy Bickle
(Sam Rockwell) steps in to help, hoping to provide inspiring material
for Marty's research. And it is this desire to produce compelling drama for the script, that
predates a string of crass and horrifying murders that Billy
orchestrates for the rest of this film.As if bizarre motivation for a killing spree; the twists and turns that
follow aren't ridiculous enough to throw us in for a vapid loop...
enter Billy's involvement in a crime syndicate that kidnaps doggies for
cash rewards. To complicate things EVEN further; Billy abducts Bonny The Shih Tzu--
prized possession of psychopathic mobster Charlie Costello (Woody
Harrelson), who subsequently vows revenge.It would have been possible to examine the merits of this film's
originality; and McDonagh's attempt to infuse a dose of situational
parody without comparisons to metafilm, Adaptation. But awkward
smugness involved in Seven Psychopath's jibes (at Hollywood's political
correctness about animal cruelty and misogyny) border on too much
intellectual tripe for it to work. The witty verisimilitude required to pull off such a stunt, is sorely
missing.Seven Psychopaths also toils for slacker-stoner hyperbole with baffling
results. Save twelve dollars and wait for it to air on TV.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com
