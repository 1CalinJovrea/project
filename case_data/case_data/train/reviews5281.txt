Interesting - not action packed but different from the usual thriller

People looking for an action packed thriller with a high body count
won't find that here. This is a true story so things are realistic not
full of bravado and death defying heroism. The siege lasted 6 days so a
lot of the story is about planning by the rescue by the SAS and the
role of the negotiator (Mark Strong) and the government policy behind
the rescue. Unlike action movies where one guy would take down all the
terrorists it's refreshing to see the planning and the uncertainty
about planning a rescue mission. Jamie Bell despite being small sized
plays an SAS person quite convincingly. From the negotiators point of
view the lack of knowledge and being caught between the different
interests is quite interesting too. A rather round looking Abbie
Cornish plays a reporter for the BBC although her role is not pivotal.
Couple of faults. Not that much was shown about the cause of the
terrorists to understand their motives better. The point of view of the
hostages is also insufficiently shown. Worth a watch.
