Surprisingly Excellent!

Jake Chambers is an 11-year-old adventure seeker who discovers clues
about another dimension called Mid-World. Upon following the mystery,
he is spirited away to Mid-World where he encounters a Gunslinger,
Roland Deschain, who is on a quest to reach the "Dark Tower" that
resides in End-World and reach the nexus point between time and space
that he hopes will save all existence from extinction. But with various
monsters and a vicious sorcerer named Walter o'Dim, the Man in Black
hot on their trail, the unlikely duo find that their quest may be
difficult to complete.In North America, The Dark Tower was released alongside Kidnap, as well
as the wide expansion of Detroit, and is projected to gross around $20
million from 3,451 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1.8
million from Thursday previews at 2,770 theaters, which began playing
at 7:19 P.M. as an ode to the 19:19 of Stephen King lore present in the
book series.Some people were forcing me not to see it,but I saw this film and
surprisingly found it excellent.
