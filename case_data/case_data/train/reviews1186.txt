Not as 'edgy' as it tries to be

'Stick in Love' is a romantic comedy which desperately tries not to be.
And, it succeeds to a degree. For a start... it's not that funny, so
maybe we should refer to it as a 'romantic drama.' However, what it
really wants to be is 'different' and 'unconventional.' The film-makers
(probably like many viewers) have obviously had enough of the tired old
'boy meets girl etc.' cliché and set about trying to make something
different. I say again... they succeeded (to a degree).They create a deliberately dysfunctional family, all of which have very
jaded and bitter takes on 'love.' The situations we meet them in all
start off as refreshing as the film-makers probably hope they will be.
It's not just the situations that are different, but it's the
characters themselves that make it that way - and that's no bad thing.However (and it's a big however), throughout the course of the story,
all 'different' aspects are ironed out in favour of turning it into the
same old clichéd rom-com still without the 'com' aspect though). So,
what starts out as edgy and different, ends up feeling as generic as
any other 'boy meets girl' story.Don't get me wrong... it's certainly not a bad film. All the actors
play their parts well, so, if you like rom-coms (minus the 'com')
you'll probably love this. I enjoyed it; I was just enjoying it more
when I thought it would be really different ALL the way though.
