Simple plot but incredible execution with impressive performance by Banderas

Simply not a home alone movie but more of a assault on precinct 13 set
in a mall. The negative reviews simply don't do this movie justice. I
saw this movie after Transformers 5 with my 12 year old and wow it was
refreshing and entertaining from start to end the complete opposite of
Transformers for which I switched off after 25 minutes and was on the
phone searching through eBay adds. Lol. Great execution by director and an impressive performance by all the
cast. Very impressed by Antonio Banderas who shows his worth. He has
returned to his roots from when I first saw him in desperado. Again
good casting all round and acting was above par. The story is simple with good pace and execution. Good TV movie that
keeps you wanting till the end. I have reviewed this 9/10 just because
of the budget and it's really made for TV
