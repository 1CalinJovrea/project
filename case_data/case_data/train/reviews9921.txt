Dark, Disturbing....Hilarious

I really do not want to give away any important plot points to the
movie. Getting into anything specific would spoil a fun element of
surprise, so I have to stay vague.All the actors nailed their parts. It transcends into many different
genres. You will laugh at times, feel queasy at others, but it all
wraps up nicely in the end.It is a lot of fun. I was a big fan of both these kid actors when they
co-starred in M Night's "The Visit." The actor who played Luke did a
great job as well.A fun, quick ride. 8/10
