Sing is the most enjoyable of the musical computer-animated movies we've seen this year!

This is the third computer-animated movie in a row that features actual
singing by the characters after Trolls and Moana. The title basically
means just about every character is singing something because it's
about a singing contest being produced because the producer wants
something that brings the people to his theatre, not like those
previous shows that didn't do much for his career. Seems like all
genres of music from various decades is represented here. My movie
theatre-working friend was especially enamored with the gorilla singing
a song associated with his favorite singer, Elton John. This movie does
show the struggles of putting on a show and possible disasters that
happen when risks are taken. I really don't want to reveal any more so
I'll just say that me and my friend highly recommend Sing.
