Candy coated perversity - directed at an age group that should not be watching

What is this? Horror for kids? This movie convinces me that the world
has gone mad. This is entertainment for what age groups exactly? If its
for adults, why is there so much childish humour and dialogue appealing
to the sensibilities of an age group that should not be watching this
level of blood, guts and graphic murder? The story line is directed
towards a certain mentality, which is not of appeal to adults, at least
not mature adults. Why on earth is this so popular? It failed to scare
me on so many levels that I found myself imagining better scenes. How
is it acceptable that kids of 12 years old were in the audience,
looking at images of even younger children in the movie having their
arm torn from their body, a man with a knife right in his throat? What
the hell?! As soon as it was revealed that all the horrors were their
imaginations, it was a pointless exercise. What happened to all the
kids that were floating down at the end? Where was the main characters
brother at the end? Wait for the next episode? No thanks. I would have
enjoyed a psychological horror, but gore is not what I was expecting.
Shows a lack of imagination by the director that he had to resort to
this level of candy coated perversity. What a shame.
