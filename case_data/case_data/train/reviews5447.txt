EPIC! Why Not Just Enjoy The Ride?!

I knew very little about this film before seeing it.My 20 year old daughter had just seen it, crowned it 'AWESOME' and
wanted to take me and her 15 year old sister. My daughters both know
about my wild youth, as I know about theirs...Well, I have to concur with my daughters - it was 'EPIC'. To the
naysayers who are calling this trash, I say, too f'in' bad for you
guys! You obviously have never been to a real party! Sure, it may go a
little over the top - it's a movie! Get it?! People don't really fly
either, Einstein! I am almost hittin 60 and I remember some kick ass
parties. FUN.Loosin' up! You're gonna die anyway.Everyday I'm shufflin'...
