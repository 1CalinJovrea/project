Did I watch a different film to everyone else?

I read the reviews, the constant applause and praise for this film. How
good the fights were and the great acting. WHAT?! What film has
everyone watched because what I see was a B movie (at best) with
terrible acting, a story line that was predictable and the fight
choreography has got to be the worst I've seen. Vaughn cannot do fight
scenes, he is extremely awkward and very slow, and considering the film
hints he has a history of fighting I would've believed that Mr Bean was
a UFC fighter more!
