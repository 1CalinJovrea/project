One of my two favorite love story movies of all time

Shunji Iwai's 1995 movie 'Love Letter' is hands-down my favorite love
story movie of all time. Then Professor Marston And The Wonder Women
jumps in and now I have a tie.I was expecting a steamy, almost X-rated movie about a man and the two
women in his life, but as it turned out, there's ZERO nudity in this
film, and it actually made me get teary-eyed in the final scenes. This
is definitely a film I can watch over and over again. The main
characters are extremely likable and in this age of LGBTQ awareness,
this is an honest-to-goodness wholesome love story.The movie is barely over 100 minutes long, and the ties to the actual
Wonder Woman comic book character, while brought up in the beginning of
the film, don't actually congeal until the 90 minute mark. So almost
the entire movie focuses on the relationship of the professor, his wife
and their lover. When the Wonder Woman comic comes into focus, the
whole movie pulls together like someone lassoing in their catch. You
see how the professor's view of the women in his life form his
fictional heroine.I think Logan should win movie of the year. There's talk of DC's Wonder
Woman movie winning, most likely because the academy is being handed a
movie directed by a woman about a strong independent woman. If Logan
doesn't win, I would be happy to see Professor Marston And The Wonder
Women take the trophy home. This is the real Wonder Woman movie.I was literally blown away by this film. Did not expect such a
beautiful work of art. I really feel honored to have seen this in the
theater.Can I have two favorite love story movies of all time? Like professor
Marston and his women, yes. Yes I can.
