Intergalactic Blockbuster

Another win for Marvel. Phase three shows no signs of slowing down. The movies itself is a great stand alone film, but also does its part
for the wider MCU. Thor has evolved from the serious, god-like
character we knew after spending some years on Earth. His new found
humor fits well without throwing away the development that has occurs
in previous appearances. The dynamic between Thor and Loki continues to
flourish; the latter remains a key factor into the franchise success.
Hulk/Banner gets enough screen time to warrant a spot in the title. No
one will ever tire of seeing Hulk smash on a scale as large as this.
Stand out performance from Valkyrie. Excellent portrayal of a
lesser-known character that shall no longer be lesser-known.
Grandmaster goes full Goldblum. That should be enough to sell you on
that character. Hela does not fit the mold of weak antagonist roles
from past Marvel movies. Too powerful to disregard with motives to back
her actions. Epic actions scenes on a larger than life scale. Worth a watch in IMAX. Some overuse of comedy but it's what you come to expect from a
blockbuster appealing to the masses. Not once does it distract you from
the threat at hand. A nice set up for Infinity War without seeming like a prequel. 9/10.
