This movie isn't just a waste; it actually hurts!

This is by far the most pathetic movie I have watched in a long time!A guy gets an intimation from some mysterious cousin of his for a hotel
he inherited. He visits the place with his friends. OK, makes sense..
what happens next is boring, confusing and not interesting at all.Acting is pathetic, CGI is funny, the plot doesn't make any sense and
there is no character development whatsoever. Thats why the viewers
remain indifferent to whoever dies in whatever way, which is a huge
failure of the movie above everything. Then there are a lot of scenes which have nothing to do with the movie
at all! I couldn't know why a camera was being focused so much, I have
no idea why the deer hunting scene was relevant, I especially have no
clue why the old woman had to die if she had nothing to do with
anything in the movie. The funniest thing I found in movie was the promptness with which the
main protagonist got on board with its new 'clan/family'. A drink and
sex with a weird woman was enough for him to turn on his friends
without breaking a sweat. It was this moment I knew I have wasted a
good 90 minutes of my life.I can write a 100 page journal about absurdity of this movie but I will
just advise the reader not to watch it unless then are looking for out
of place sex scenes and laughably unreal gore! Cheers!
