Made my Saturday Better with Many Laughs

The smalltime drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is robbed by a
gang while helping his nerd teenage neighbor Kenny Rossmore (Will
Poulter) in an assault. David has to pay a large amount to his supplier
Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms ) that offers a chance to David to quit his
debt and raise some money. David should smuggler a large shipment of
marijuana in Brad's nickname of Pablo Chacon from Mexico to him. David offers some money to the stripper Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer
Aniston) and to the juvenile delinquent Casey Mathis (Emma Roberts) and
invites Kenny to travel with him posing as the Miller family on
vacation in an RV to not call the attention of the authorities. After a
couple of incidents in Mexico, they befriend the Fitzgerald family that
is traveling on vacation in an RV and they cross the border back to the
USA. Soon they discover that Don Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman) is a DEA
agent and David leans that he was lured by Brad and the real Pablo
Chacon (Tomer Sisley), who owns the shipment, is chasing them with his
right-arm. "We're the Millers" is a politically incorrect comedy that made my
Saturday better with many laughs. The story is very funny and most of
the situations are hilarious. The conclusion is very well resolved. For
those that have not seen this movie yet, watch the credits that there
is a joke with Jennifer "Rachel" Aniston. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Fam√≠lia do Bagulho" ("Family of the Pot")
