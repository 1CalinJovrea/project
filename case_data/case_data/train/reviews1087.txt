thoroughly enjoyable

Strongly recommend watching this, very strong performances from all of
the cast. Good score, solid cinematography and a story line that got me
hooked from the start and one that I don't doubt for a second has
happened numerous times around the world. Will watch again (because that's what i do when i like a film).
