Not the "love story" you want to fall in love but a very annoying one.

If this movie was based on a true story, sorry but the main character
is a bitch! I agree with other reviews that she's just so selfish. She
lost her memory alright but that won't justify for being a bitch. Story
is so boring and predictable. It's like watching a brat with amnesia
and you want to punch her in the head to gain her memory back and so it
will finally over.
