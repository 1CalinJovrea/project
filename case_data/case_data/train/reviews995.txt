Brilliant, funny, heart wrenching and beautiful

Brilliant movie. Kate Winslet as the star lives the role so perfectly
you forget she is not a native born Australian - her accent is
flawless, her acting is raw and beautiful. The movie is heart
wrenching, darkly funny, shocking and confronting all in a delightful
way. Judy Davis is brilliant - irascible as Mad Molly, you gradually
discover her depth and beauty. Again flawlessly played. Hugo Weaving is
fantastic as always - several laugh out loud moments with him. He is
the consummate actor and where someone else playing this role would
have just been a plain unlikeable weirdo, Hugo makes you love him and
his quirky nature. Liam Hemsworth is sweet and very watchable. The
townsfolk played by many notable Australian actors are well played
also. All in all a wonderful movie that will touch your heart in many
ways. Liked it so much, I will definitely go and see it again. It's
THAT good.
