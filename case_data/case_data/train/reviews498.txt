Go for it. Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!

This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics
and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may
be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often
and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino
decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work
thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a
legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in
his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would
still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful
Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness,
snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. Go damn watch it and be prepared to be a told a western story Tarantino
style.
