A movie that doesn't care, though it tries, and that's just beauty.

Inherent Vice just doesn't give a f@#k. I don't mean that as anything
more than an observation, and understand this as you watch the film
because otherwise you'll be a little lost. The film just doesn't care
whether you think this or that is good acting or a funny joke. It
doesn't care what you think is happening. It will go on. Despite any
perceived awkwardness, it will continue to be itself... and there is
awkwardness.Fortunately, "itself" is absolutely beautiful. P.T. Anderson has
mastered that Jacques Tati style wide angle and mixes it in with his
earlier Boogie Nights fluidity for a confusing and awesome new style.
He's done this before, of course, (The Master) but this time is pretty
different. You'll notice it the moment that beautiful first shot
appears. While I'm at it, I should mention the cinematography. There
are colors in this film that I never thought I'd see again.From a story telling perspective, Inherent Vice almost seems like a
Terrence Malick movie at some points. The narrator comes in and out
like hypnosis and there's this air of evil always lurking behind all
that beauty. There's love too, and the ultimate message, if you can
call it that, falls within the great rule of pop: it's best when it's
bittersweet.
