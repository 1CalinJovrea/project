3 Areas of Disappointment

My areas of disappointment : 1) Bane, 2) the threat on the city
(nuclear), and 3) the Mr. Nolan's surprising lack of storytelling and
bleak cinematic visual (even though he seemingly had the best filming
tools to deliver so.). 1) I only wished the Mr. Nolan did not abruptly reduce his newest
villain, Bane, to something so insignificant and small. The menacing,
intelligent, "brute force" was indeed a towering figure throughout the
movie until he presents himself as secondary towards the end of the
trilogy.2) And the threat on Gotham City, a nuclear one, was surprisingly
unoriginal considering how innovative the poisonous vapor threat was in
"Batman Begins" or how chaos forced the protagonists of Gotham to make
extremely troubling decisions in "The Dark Knight." 3) Something breathtaking was so suppose to happen in either the plot
or in the IMAX grandeur. However, Mr. Nolan surprisingly failed to
deliver in both areas. Mr. Nolan did not make us hold our breath like
he did in the "Dark Knight" nor did he captivate our focus with his
playful plots and mind bending cinematic visuals as he did in
"Inception." In other words, I could not help but looking back at his
past films while watching the "TDKR." There were a few other things that caught my immediate, negative
attention. But who cares. It is really over now. This was how Mr. Nolan
decided to end this truly life defining story. With that said, I am
simply stunned and truly hurt that the trilogy had to end . . . like
this.Â– davidwoongkim, Seoul
