Words haven't been invented to describe this film

After spending a Saturday night watching a film I've been looking
forward to see since I first saw the trailer, honestly I feel robbed of
an hour and a half I'll never get back. This movie was nothing but a
let down. To call this film a horror is like calling Spongebob
Squarepants and Thomas the tank engine both horror programs.You cannot tell the difference between normal Keanu Reeves and tied up
petrified Keanu Reeves, it all sounded the same. Whenever he shouted it
reminded me of the best cry ever/worst cry ever video in YouTube.Overall this movie was a huge let down, very good idea for a film but a
horrific execution. Save yourself a tenner and buy yourself a Chinese
instead of a ticket!
