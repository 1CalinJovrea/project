An intense experience

A powerful feature film. Despite some reminiscence (group of friends,
dinner, the house atmosphere, colors) with "Coherence" is undoubtedly
an original movie. A very interesting point made by the director (who
had already done Girlfight and Jennifer's Body) over a possible
processing of the pain of a loss, in a quite denying way, perhaps
cynical, reaching extremes of aggressiveness. A lot of tension, making
us doubt who you believe (or even what is real) at every step, until
the crux of the matter comes; you may wait a little for that, but it's
worth it. Point for the director for not using low blows. Worthwhile if
you want to spend a very intense time. With regards to actors' work,
"Will" comes out unscathed. "Eden" maybe a little artificial, but I
think it is an intentional nuance given by the director. The rest comes
off well. The screenplay is pretty good. Although it is not
revolutionary, the pace is accurate, keeps the suspense, and plays with
ambiguity.
