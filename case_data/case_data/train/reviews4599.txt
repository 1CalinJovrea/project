This is why you don't close your forums IMDb

Something is wrong when the downvotes are massive on a film with no
real release. Then you realize its about the armenian genocide.... This
could have been revealed in the discussion page rather than people
posting fake reviews, but here it is, you made your page less
informative because you were so afraid of trolls you ripped out and
erased a basic feature for your site, you lost the ability to pick the
brain of the world.
