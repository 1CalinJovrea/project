Story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing.

This movie is not boring at all and it's full of well done action
sequences and it's absolutely worth watching Fortunately, I'm an
extreme sports enthusiast n i love rock climbing n mountain biking. It
has the most spectacular visuals of surfing, snowboarding, rock
climbing, wing-suiting, bike stunts, etc. The director Erickson Core
himself did the cinematography. Hes an amateur director but veteran
cinematographer. No wonder the film has exceptional cinematography with
setting like surfing in the middle of the ocean, Angel falls and the
Alps. The movie has remarkable camera work, the film was able to
capture every crucial move with acute depth. I was not expecting Oscar
worthy performances. Edgar Ram√≠rez got a strong screen presence n he
did a good job. It delivered what I expected. Its my kinda action
flick. I hate those super hero films, except Nolan's Batman trilogy.
Well story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and
scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us
who enjoy that sort of thing. I know and understand what goes through
the minds of extreme sports enthusiasts and why they do it. U cannot
call it a remake of the original classic. It's jus inspired by the
original.
