The subtraction method

The Spectacular now had some funny dialogue, but by no means was it a
comedy. You can read the synopsis of the story, which will give you an
idea of what to expect, but the story did not matter to me.Personally, I am sick of these movies: adult conceptions of what it is
like to be in high school. Teenagers are 'cool' and 'witty' and 'so
emotionally developed and open'. When kids are in high school, they are
treated like idiots; yet, in movies they are god forsaken prophets. People love movies like 'The Spectacular Now' and for some reason they
always ring false to me, which is probably why I am wildly
unsuccessful. The main character, high school student, son to a single mother, he
drives a better car than me and has a better computer; he works part
time at a clothing store and drinks all the time. That's a cool
character; he has great dialogue. He is not a teenager though. He is an
adult creation of what a writer should have been like in high school. I
know because I think about it all the time.People call this a coming of age story with complex characters. That is
what people want in a story, which I don't agree with (why I am very
unsuccessful). If you take out the main character's dialogue and
attitude, it's the typical guy loves a girl and you wouldn't expect
them to love each other, but they do --- wow curve ball dramatic event
to get you invested--work through emotional problems and realize one
very small thing that can be almost like an eastern philosophical
statement (applicable to nothing and everything at the same time, as
water is never truly still).But, the story was well crafted, the filming and production and
dialogue were great. It was well written and every actor and actress
performed wonderfully. If this movie wasn't getting popular, honestly
(if it was rated as a 5) I'd probably rate it at an 8 just to show how
much of a free thinker I am.
