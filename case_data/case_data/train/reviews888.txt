5
Not a boring movie, well acted and instructed..

Even though i only rated it 5, which usually means it didn't live up to
expectation, I didn't regret seeing it..It is extreme well acted by not-to-popular actors, and the effects and
directing is good as well..It's definitely a new kind of demon movie, more modern, more
'realistic'.. by the latter I mean in comparison to other late demon
movies..It's worth the watch, and would have giving it 6, if it wasn't for the
disappointing ending (IMO).. see it and judge for yourself.I think the movie brings something new to the table, and doesn't use
lame sound effects to make a scary scene..
