An abysmal failure......

I have read a good number of the Dark Tower series of books by Stephen
King and I'd rate them as some of his very best work.I was then hugely excited and then quickly disappointed by the
cinematic interpretation of King's work. The Dark Tower could best be
described as the "Coles Notes" version of the books. Whilst Coles had
their place summarizing often complex literary works for confused
students, the abbreviated silver screen version of the Dark Tower
series is disappointing. Worse still its unfaithful to the books. Roland Deschain, "the
Gunslinger", indisputably the main character in the books is "side
lined" in favor of an important but more marginal character, "the boy",
Jake Chambers. Its a naff move that disrupts the focus and displaces
the context of the story. The result is a film with a "boys own" feel. There are a few dark
moments but they in no way capture the atmosphere of the original books
which are dark, gritty and nihilistic, in a Clint Eastwood's, "The
Unforgiven", on steroids kind of way. Idris Elba is a great casting choice for Roland but the role he is cast
in provides limited opportunity for character development. Jake's
character, the overlooked, unloved son of the books, fares little
better. Suffice to say, the cinematic Dark Tower is, to my mind, a missed
opportunity that seems unable to take advantage of the wonderful
material on offer. Three out of ten from me.
