a poor copy of Lord Of War

Shame on you if you have not watched that great film which is Lord Of
War; go out immediately and watch it, and you will be able to see how
War Dogs is the same story, but seem from the eyes of Vitaly (Nicholas
Cage's brother in the film) instead of Yuri's.War Dogs is the story of David Packouz (Miles Teller) being dragged
into the business of arms trading by his pal Efrahim Diveroli(the awful
Jonah Hill); the film starts as comedy, with them being newbies,
stumbling in their early steps and accomplishing a great feat through
ingenuity and beginner's luck. Then, after the obligatory "and then we got so rich" montage, the film
attempts to veer towards a more serious tone, where the already
insufficient acting skills of both leads falls completely flat.In the end, when the film comes to its dark conclusion (with redundant
"we'll save the soul of Miles Teller, because he looks like a nice boy"
bit), it's evident these two cannot build a character to save their own
life.Miles Teller should never be cast into anything but "young adult"
roles; he does not have the depth, the nuance, to give his characters
anything but awkwardness and incredulity. Jonah Hill should never be cast in anything that does not rotate around
pee and poo jokes. Preferably, he should just not be cast.The only appeal of this film is the middle segments, where the two
leads get to party way harder than what their age should allow, but as
soon as the film tries to develop a story, you'll wish it was over. The
"family problems" things are badly written and just out of place.I would not recommend War Dogs to anyone, regardless if they have seen
the far superior Lord Of War or not; the film does not stand on it own,
there are a few bits which are mildly amusing, but nothing you haven't
seen before.A honest vote of 5.5/10 - could have been much better with decent
actors.
