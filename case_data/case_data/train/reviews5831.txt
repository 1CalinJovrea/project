Get over the book appreciate the MOVIE

First off, how many times do people get let down going in to movies
expecting them to be like the movies??? Get over it! The movie was
great...the main characters were great actors and had great chemistry.
I personally loved the movie. I actually liked it more than i thought,
which is a good surprise for me. I knew id like it, but i liked it so
much more! I really hope they continue to make movies from this series
whether or not they follow the books. A good movie is a good movie...so
all u disturbed book series followers get ur panties out a wad nd learn
to appreciate great young actors and their hard work to make
entertaining movies. For those looking for a good fantasy movie with
love, action, and funny moments, this is the movie for you. It was good
beginning to end.
