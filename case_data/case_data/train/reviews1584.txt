BRILLIANT! The best animated film of the year!

Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never
done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph,
the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced
by John C. Reilly), the villain in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who
decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he
goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to
become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von
Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game
called "Sugar Rush". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the
arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.I had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling
that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the
premise to this sounded really cool and clever Â– a love letter to video
games. I really love the voice cast.So, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a
fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave
(which was also very good).John C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character,
who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he
wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah
Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the
"Sugar Rush" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a "glitch" (a
character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to
become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock)
has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the
"Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back
to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main
character in a first-person shooter game known as "Hero's Duty", who
tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.I didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn
good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp,
pristine screen.The animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the
environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is
very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.The characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see
some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic,
etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever.
It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the
themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the
main character's goal become a success? And so forth.Generally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their
stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it
Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this
movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this
movie, they're going to fall in love with it.10/10
