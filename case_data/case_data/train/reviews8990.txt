The green garbage

Just awful that's all I can say about this movie. I had high hopes with
Roths favorite movie being the Great Cannibal Holocast. He should not
have been allowed the use the old working title. The plot was OK I
guess but the acting was total garbage, with one good gore scene (first
death). After that it's all down hill and very predictable to the point
of stupidity! We all knew the necklace was going to save her. I saw a
saving grace possible at the end when the military was gunning down the
cannibals she should have been mistaken for one of them and killed!!
Way better ending to a horrible disgrace of a movie with about as much
intelligence as a rock. I can't waste any more time on this -1 of 10
movie.Thanks for your time EMK
