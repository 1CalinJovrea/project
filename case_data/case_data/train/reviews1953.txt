Worstest movie ever!

Yes, worstest. It was horrible and cringe-worthy. Jokes were not funny,
there was no plot and story-line seems to be written by a juvenile
retard. The movie was dragging on for eternity with unwarranted scenes,
unfunny punch lines, over-acting, ridiculous jokes & cringe-worthy
scenes The monkey scenes was as funny as Saddam Hussein. The rest of the movie
was downhill from the already rock-bottom opening scene. I cannot even
fathom the reason why this movie was created.I would rather be dragged naked by my legs through a cactus patch than
watch this movie again.0/10
