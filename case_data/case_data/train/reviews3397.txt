Major Feel-Good Movie, just gets better as it goes along

In the opinion of this reviewer, an extraordinary achievement.The characters on which the film is based were special and unique on
their own, and well deserving of the sort of semi-documentary films
that Hollywood likes to serve up.However, to take that story and bump it up to a major "feel-good film"
that engages the viewer from the getgo and does not let up until the
very end of its 2 hour and 5 minute running time, THAT is what elevates
this project to greatness.I want to be clear on this because it is important. There are two ways
to do a feel-good film. One is (ironically!) by the numbers, using
proved plot arcs and other script devices to make it work. An example
of this for example is the latest Disney release MOANA which has taken
some heat from critics for being derivative and not original. But that,
you see, is the tried and true method to achieve the effect that the
producers wanted. And it works.The other way to make a film engaging and fun is to use your instincts
and your actors to get the most from each scene. No rule book, no fixed
way of doing a scene, just doing what works. This is, I believe the way
that writer/director Theodore Melfi set out to do Hidden Figures, and
boy did he pull it off! The acting is stellar. Costner has matured in
his latest film roles and his work here is as far from the nonsense he
used to do (like the dreaded Robin Hood) as the earth is from the sun.Taraji P. Henson finally lands a great role, the kind of role she was
looking for when she left the hit series Person of Interest a tad
early.And every good film or TV series needs a character who is "the glue" or
a reference point that the viewer can use, like a compass needle, to
see where we are in the main story. Here Octavia Spencer gives the
performance of her life as that "glue" and helps the director to pace
the film.Highly recommended.
