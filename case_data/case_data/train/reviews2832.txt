Very Disturbing

This movie was very disappointing. I could not believe that Disney
would attach its name to this garbage. This should not have been rated
PG13. Things such as Johnny Depp as a pedophile wolf and Meryl Streep's
psychotic relationship with Aurora might suggest that it was sexual.
Emily Blunt's scene of adultery with Cinderella's husband banging her
against a tree definitely made this inappropriate for me. This is
definitely not a movie for your kids. I could not believe my eyes or my
ears. The songs were not as cleverly written or composed as one would
expect from a Disney film. Even more difficult to understand was that
the movie continued even after the curse of the witch was broken. It
seemed in-cohesive somehow. Why bring in another giant? This made the
movie feel like it was 3 hours long instead of 2. What is worse is that
Disney has made most of these stories like Cinderella and sleeping
beauty iconic. Why would Disney turn their most beloved storybook
depictions into a creepy nightmare? Very contradicting. And a big
mistake on their part.
