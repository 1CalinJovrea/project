You are going to laugh!!!!

We're the Millers is going to make you laugh. The movie is more
hilarious than you would think. You will be surprise how creative some
of those "stupid", funny and ridiculous scenes are. The girls are doing
a great job. Emma Roberts as an angry teen with a big mouth and
Jennifer Aniston as a sexy stripper with mother instincts. Loved the
stripper scenes with Jennifer who looks as hot as ever. Kenny (Will
Poulter)is just so perfect for the part of virgin, sweet teenage guy
and of course Jason Sudeikis as David - the drug dealer - is the one
and only who can pull that character as good as he did. The Millers are
just the perfect "family". They picked just the right people for this
comedy. You can expect dirty, funny, sexy, ridiculous! Just go and see
it so you can have a good summer laugh!
