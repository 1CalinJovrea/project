This is what the world need - More Lemonade action movies

I enjoyed it start to finish, it's stupid fun, it's stupid, but in a
good way, and anyone with an urge for a trill needs to take a peek. The
movie has that action movie cheese and cheapness, but it didn't seem
cheap at all, the budget, direction and effects are top notch! I can't
recommend this movie enough.
