Super w Long Shelf Life

I saw Me & Earl last week at Sundance and have not stopped thinking
about it. That is a long (6 day) shelf life. What more can one ask from
a film? The writing and execution is elite quality. All scenes seem
necessary. Parent/child relationships, peer relationships,
teacher/student relationships all are captured in humorous and touching
ways. Life and death realities are also visited through the lens of
"kids" who make as much sense as possible when facing the grim
possibilities of severe illness.Sorry to be redundant from other reviews but this darn film has HEART
and should be required viewing for anyone who sees at least one movie a
year.Thanks to the team that made this one happen.
