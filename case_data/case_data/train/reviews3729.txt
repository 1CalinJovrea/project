Why does anyone like this?

Yes, the acting, top to bottom, is flawless, but to what end? Although
it's being advertised as comedy it's drearily unfunny. It's creepily
like watching a look-at-the-rubes in Oklahoma, freak show. A miserable
collection of mean, addicted, distraught, and depressed family, which
as individuals, might be believable, but as a group is preposterous.
You wouldn't want to spend five minutes with any of them, let alone two
hours. And, no, it has nothing to say about addiction or family. It
seems to have little to say about anything except that the people on
screen can't stand to be with each other any longer than they have to,
and after this they won't see each other again. Lots of fun for the
cast, and maybe even an Oscar or two, hopefully at least a nomination
for Julianne Nicholson. No fun at all for the audience. This won a
Pulitzer and Tonys? I can't understand what anyone sees in this piece
of A list dreck.
