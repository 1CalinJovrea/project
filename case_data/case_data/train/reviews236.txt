Wheelman is an intense thriller about a driver who is referred to as "the wheelman".

I personally really enjoyed wheelman, however it is clearly not
everyone's cup of tea. The movie does a great job of being both intense
and fast paced. The majority of the movie is filmed from within the
getaway car. This make you feel like you are in the car with the
characters, adding to the tension. The movie is extremely short meaning
there is limited time to introduce the characters and the plot. This
makes the first half hour of the movie slightly confusing, however once
it gets started I began to really like "the wheelman" as I felt the
immense amount of pressure he was being put under. The movie consists
of multiple chase scenes and fire fights leading up to the ending,
which I found to be a bit underwhelming, however fitting. In conclusion
wheelman was an extremely intense thrill ride which will keep you on
the edge of your seat, however it was really nothing more than that, as
it Lacks any emotion and real drama. Nether the less I really enjoyed
this movie and would recommend it to anyone thinking about watching it.
