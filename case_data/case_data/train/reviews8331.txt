Awesome

I can honestly say that my family and I really enjoyed watching this
movie and that's saying a lot because we all have different interests
in movies but this one we all enjoyed. It was exciting and entertaining
and would enjoy it if there was another movie to come in the
future.this movie caught me from the beginning. Some may hate this
movie because it doesn't base off of the Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.
This movie focus more on the legends and stories (that some believe to
be true) about 'Vlad the Impaler' the prince of Wallachia. 'Vlad's'
history is what led to the famous Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. 'Vlad'
was the original Dracula. But Its just a movie, in which i found vary
enjoyable to sit down with popcorn and watch. this movie was awesome in
my opinion. but some will hate it and other will love it. in which i
can say i'm one of those who loves it.
