Disappointingly shallow and poorly acted out

Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong?
Apparently, quite a lot.Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two
countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and
talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring.Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that
the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago,
but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to
see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with
exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from
Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the
role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for
Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm
sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the
exchange taking place. We don't need the "happy end" through
vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The
pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant -
it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see
the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should
be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5)
Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends,
but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances.
The little things that aren't part of the written history. But
everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of
the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre
written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller
(thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of
Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg
fails to deliver.4/10
