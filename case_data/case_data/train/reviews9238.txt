Awesome movie!

So before I went to see The Host I read the book and I loved it! I
instantly fell in love with it and was excited to see the movie.
However, before I went to see the movie I came onto IMDb and read a
number of user reviews. I started to get nervous when I saw the amount
of bad reviews. I was finally able to see the movie today and before
entering the theater I cleared my mind of all the bad reviews I had
read and the expectations I had for it. When the movie was over I
decided to write this review as soon as I got home. I loved the movie. I thought it was absolutely amazing. I think the
adaptation from book to movie was very well done. It is definitely top
4 on my list of best book to movie adaptations(it is at the top of my
list with movies such as Atonement and Lord of the Flies). The acting was great and I loved the casting. I have always been a fan
of Saoirse Ronan and Diane Kruger and I think they were both fantastic.
Also I have admired Max Irons since I saw him in Red Riding Hood and
thought he was great in this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. I walked out of the theater
very happy and very impressed.
