This is how you kill Chucky

Hm. Uh huh. Okay....Horror fans get slapped in the face once again with this latest
installment of the Chucky franchise.You know... Don Mancini may have taken the credit for writing all these
films... but all his self- directed films makes it seem like he doesn't
really care much about Chucky as a character. For some reason he just
does not know how to make a real horror film. He didn't direct the
first one and that's the only really good one.I'm not watching any more of these movies unless it gets a reboot. But
with the way this movie is, I figure they expected us to say that.They took the lore and flushed it down the toilet and they just slapped
this together they didn't care. Nothing makes sense any more and
Chucky's motivation is non-existent, it's not scary.Chucky has been dismantled. The movie was pretty but Chucky's been
dismantled. It'll never be scary again
