You should watch the other one, seriously

This is a great, big, steaming pile of tripe on your plate, so make of
it what you will. If you like it, I won't hold it against you.
Personally, I thought it was insultingly stupid at times, at least when
it wasn't completely screwing the original character over. When they
started harpooning cars, I just threw my hands up and said: "I give
up!" Please, no more of this. It. Was. Awful.Mr. Friend, Mr. Kretschmann or Mr. Hinds aren't to blame. They
delivered their parts with their usual professionalism. Mr. Quinto was
okay too.If you want to see a decent movie about Agent 47, watch "Hitman",
starring Timothy Olyphant. That movie is much better and much 'closer
to home', so to speak.47 is an assassin, not a superhero, or even a hero, for that matter.Just an assassin.
