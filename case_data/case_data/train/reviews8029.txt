Good Action Flic, But Not Much Depth

"Hit-man Agent 47" included plenty of action in a quasi "mad scientist"
film about the programming of human assassins.The mad scientist, Doctor Pitor Litvenko, has evidently recognized his
mistakes in developing the robots and has gone into exile. Before his
departure, he tinkered with the DNA of his young daughter in order that
she would have survival skills if his enemies pursued her. The story
focuses primarily on the daughter, who seeks to reunite with her
mysterious father. She is aided by Hit-man Agent 47, who is also a
victim of the scientist's programming.The most interesting character in the film is the daughter named Katia,
who is played dynamically by Hannah Ware. Katia's character is the
spokesperson for humanity, as she recognizes the dangers of genetic
tampering and the creation of the human machines by her father. The main dramatic tension is between Katia and Hit-man Agent 47. Will
he act in strict accordance with his programming? Or, will his human
side override his programming at the moment of crisis?Ruper Friend brings a good, deadpan style to his character. But as the
film unfolds, a glimmer of "personality" begins to appear. But don't
count on any smiles or humor from Hit-man Agent 47.
