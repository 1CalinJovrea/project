Plot Holes You Could Drive Through

I like to see a movie that on some level is at least plausible and does
not require you to suspend reality entirely to go along with what you
are seeing on the screen. First why would all twelve choppers stay
within striking distance of Kong after the first couple were knocked
out of the sky?? And then all of them get destroyed as well -
Ridiculous! Second how does a creature the size of a ten story building
sneak up on the unsuspecting human characters over and over? After Kong
being machine gunned early on in the film and seeing that he was
bleeding heavily and in quite a bit of pain he miraculously heals as if
it had never happened! The leader of the squad of pilots somehow thinks
he can kill Kong to the exclusion of all rationality in the face of
overwhelming adversity and convince his fellow pilots to go along with
him - ludicrous! How do giant squids and the giant skull crawler appear
out of nowhere in shallow water not even up to Kong's knees? I could
provide many more examples but I think I have made my point clear.
Whoever writes these scripts does not base things on even vaguely
realistic scenarios which makes for a less than satisfying viewing
experience.
