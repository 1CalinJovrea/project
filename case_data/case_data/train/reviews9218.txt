Ruby Sparks

Literary 'genius' Calvin (Paul Dano), after his Salinger-like successes
as a fresh faced 19 year old, ten years on is struggling with the age
old problem of writers block, sat at his typewriter with little to
inspire him besides his dog Scotty. Caught up in the midst of 'second
album syndrome' Calvin has a dream in which he meets the free spirited
Ruby Sparks (Zoe Kazan Â– who incidentally wrote the script) and
instantly falls for her 'perfection'. Inspired by this figment of his
imagination he begins to write, chronicling their dream-like
encounters; a whirlwind romance exploding onto the page. Expect the
unexpected however comes to mind when Calvin wakes up to find his
'dream girl' innocently making breakfast in his stylish LA kitchen.With encouragement from his brother Calvin begins to live out his
fantasies, making a life with the girl he conjured from his
imagination. The comedy is soft but affective as Ruby becomes part of
the family, meeting his hippy mum and sculptor step-dad in their
makeshift giant tree house.A new look at the myth of Pygmalion (the sculptor who fell in love with
his statue), husband and wife team (as well as the creators of Little
Miss Sunshine) Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris give a Woody Allen
flare to a witty and quick paced script by newcomer Kazan.The film has its dark moments. Morality issues arise when Calvin
decides to manipulate his creation, making her happier or more subdued,
as her human free will begins to compete with his character
construction. Ruby moves from mania to deep depression as Calvin's
ability to control her emotions backfires. The film acts as a comment
on control in modern relationships, pushing the message that a human
cannot be moulded to another's perception of perfection without there
being consequences.Even with this slight detour off into a darker place, the film wraps up
pretty sweetly in the end with a chance encounter in the park;
reaffirming that all is not lost for Calvin in his search for true
'true love', moving away from fantasy and firmly into the real world.
