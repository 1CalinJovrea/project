Better to stare at the wall than watch Ted 2

The first Ted I saw was a brilliant comedy with great idea of showing a
toy for little children playing a role of a s*x dr*gs'n'rock&roll guy.
There was some jokes which hit my taste & were too disgusting - but
overall whole movie was hilarious. Ted 2 - unfortunately has got the
opposite proportion of these, being mostly disgusting with awkward
jokes making me ill at ease. Scenes like a trying to w*nk out a person
to get his sp*rm (Ted tries to have a baby) or John being weighed down
by a cabinet full of sem*n containers (in a sp*rm bank)... and covered
with... it... Just awful. I've seen some movies with kinda same sort of
humor like: Borat, Bruno & The Dictator for example. These were
hilarious or something around that... But this one goes far far lower &
seeks for the bottom... Not recommending
