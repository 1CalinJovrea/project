Worst Marvel movie ever made

If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and
foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line
contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis
jokes are the funniest around.The story is about as hollow as the humor. It's a cheap and bland story
about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of "love" that is
as misguided as the character's personality.The movie is littered with
sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursing
and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is
very funny. This is the most overrated movie I've seen. Most of these reviews on
IMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for this
hype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low brow
film like no other.Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.
