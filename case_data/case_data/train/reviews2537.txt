Forget the marketing and chatter, there is a real film here.

The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D
sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and
left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering
stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well.
The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead,
favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and
again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again
and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please
them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a
resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in
halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this
film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with
it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love
and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a
chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used
to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows.
Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, No√© takes that
away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing ("finally a
love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning
in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and
I encourage viewers to look beyond.
