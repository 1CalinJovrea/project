Awful, awful awful.

This film is bad. You'd think after the total disaster of John Carter
(on Mars) someone somewhere would learn that if you take sci-fi and
just throw millions and millions and millions of dollars at it is will
just be rubbish. And by god is this rubbish. (It's worse than that Jim,
It's s, h, i and t). This film is so bad I just don't know where to start. Hang on - I'm
going to have a cup of tea and a think. OK. It has no redeeming
qualities at all. The film, not the tea, The story is so badly written
that I was just sighing to myself every five minutes. It basically goes like this: Large bit of exposition explaining what
they are going to do next then they go and do what they were saying
there were going to do in a huge amount of silly CGI. We have seen so
many action scenes that we all know anything can be done, but we need
to have a vested interest in at least one of the characters to give a
damn whether they live or die, and in this whole movie I couldn't care
less if everyone died. The tone of the film is perplexing. In the first few minutes this bloke
is shot dead for no reason. Then the main character is born at sea
under a particular constellation pertaining to something to do with
astrology, but this is never mentioned again. Then there is a woman in
her knickers and bra for some reason. Don't know why. Then Jupiter
Jones leaves the earth then she's a queen and we are suddenly in Terry
Gilliam's Brazil, complete with Central Services and a cameo from TG
himself. (Naughty Terry). The Wachowski directors have just stolen from FLASH, DUNE, BRAZIL,
2000AD and any other Sci-Fi source they can find. There is even a 2001
space station in one shot. They have proved over the last four films
that they have got nothing left to say at all. The film is so Flash
Gordon there is even a forced wedding scene with the hero Flash turning
up on a space scooter and crashing in at the right moment, oh sorry
he's not Flash, he's Â– I don't know or care, because I've lost the will
to live, because there is no suspense and there is no logic to
anything. Then not-Flash rescues not-Dale and we have to go through the
whole thing again, but this time Ming, sorry, some bloke I never got
the name of - who has got a very sore throat and serious Oedipus issues
and played by the unfortunate Eddie Redmayne (I bet he wishes he'd got
his BAFTA earlier and not had to endure this pile of steaming llamas
plop) needs Not-Dale to put her royal seal on a document so he can own
Earth, and she has to abdicate, without doing anything of any use
whilst being Queen, how about a few edicts? I'd at least ask to see the
Royal Mint and get some coins done we me on them. But no. Not-Dale goes
off without even a ray gun to see the baddest man in the universe and
right at the last minute not-Flash hurtles in and saves the day on
another space scooter thing. (His insurance premiums must be
astronomical), And of course because he's broken the window at the top
of the factory, the whole place is going to go up. I don't know about
you, but if I was going to build some sort of factory in the middle of
Jupiter where the atmosphere is incredibly fierce, the gravity is
gigantic, the electrical storms are the size of EARTH, I would build
some sort of fail safe and make certain that if some twit with a space
scooter crashed into my big window the whole place wouldn't
disintegrate with the speed of the Titanic hitting a massive iceberg.
And the baddie dies falling off a tall thing. OMG!! How many bad guys
have to die falling off tall things? At least Ming got a big rocket
ship through his guts. If I was a bad guy I'd live in a bungalow.Then some space people who were bad, but then good and then bad who may
be friends with Sean Bean do some stuff and are then good people, but
then they nip off, but luckily just in time to save Not-Flash and
Not-Dale and oh, for Heaven's sake. I don't care I really don't. And
then they are back on Earth. Sorry? What? She's the queen of the
flipping universe and can do anything and she goes back to cleaning the
toilets? Can you IMAGINE how angry her hard working mother would be if
she knew her daughter was the heiress to billions and she wasn't doing
anything with it? Why the hell do you think she left Russia to go to
the USA? In search of a new life! Not to clean toilets! And the
Not-Flash bloke has got wings at the end, Oh for sake of Peter Jackson
is this Lord of the Rings? He's even got Vulcan Elf ears!! Is there no
originality AT ALL in this movie??? Come on!! Couldn't he have had a
penis in the middle of his forehead to indicate he was an alien. Oh? He
has got one of those? Sorry didn't notice. And they all speak perfect
English and apparently the Earth was seeded with genes from, Oh I don't
care, I just couldn't care less anymore, this is awful, and I've run
out of tea. And there's some big sci-fi Lizards with wings called Mr.
flipping Ben or something. SIGH. There was one nice shot of the planet Jupiter with all the moons around
it in 3D that I did quite like, but that was nothing to do with the W
Brothers - that's actually there.
