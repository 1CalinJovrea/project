Really quite disappointing

I was really looking forward to this after really enjoying Despicable
Me and Despicable Me II.If this had been a standalone film rather than a spin off i'd say it
would warrant 7 out of 10 but following on from the minions being major
highlights in both Despicable me movies this was really disappointing.Just not enough of the silly shenanigans from the minions that you'd
expect and a lot of quite pointless and quite frankly boring dialogue
in parts.I'm taking my nephews to go see this soon and I really doubt it'll hold
there attention - that's how boring it is.....Disappointed.
