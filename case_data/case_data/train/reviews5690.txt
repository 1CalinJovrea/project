Why the hate?

Why all the hate for this movie? I understand not liking something, but
everyone seems to just TRASH it. Did I see the same movie? I saw an
emotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand.
Sure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting
in the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie
is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100%
electronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh,
and it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like
Blomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it
yourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been
thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off,
the trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical
"What does it mean to be human?" kinda movie. The TV trailers were
"GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!" and it is neither. Think "Little Miss
Sunshine" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation.
Blomkamp's most underrated film.
