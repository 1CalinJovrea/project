Less Than Lawless

Wanting to be so many things, sometimes, leaves you with very little.
"Lawless" is a blatant example of that. Everything feels so unauthentic
no matter how much effort has been put into accomplishing the opposite.
The script is rambling and sketchy as well as starchy and, at times,
downright annoying. Tom Hardy is one of my favorites of late, but here,
he seems to be impersonating someone. It felt like a self-conscious
parody. And Shia LaBeouf? What's with this man? Why is he playing leads
in films? He, I'm sure, must have acting coaches and he is, clearly,
following instructions, but what about the truth? He acts up a storm
but there is not a moment of truth, not one. Look at the moment when
he's told his friend Cricket has been killed. I felt embarrassed for
him. Jessica Chastain's character suffers a radical change in the
middle of the story and I kept wondering, how? when? and more
importantly, why? Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia
Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given.
The lack of chemistry between her and LaBeouf is unavoidable. He is
acting all the time. The only highlight, really, is Guy Pearce. His
performance is fearless and enormously entertaining.
