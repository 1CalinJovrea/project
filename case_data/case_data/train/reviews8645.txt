Good Solid action movie...by Netflix

I really enjoyed watching this movie. Non stop action, great acting.
Nothing new in the story-line but simple plot with some good acting
makes this movie some what enjoying to watch. Too many unnecessary F words. Some odd moments but overall really good
movie presented by Netflix. If you looking for a night of decent action movie don't be afraid to
check this one out.
