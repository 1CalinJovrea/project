Horrible in every way

The first minutes of this movie seemed promising, but it quickly sank
into a horrible, slow paced film where nothing seemed important. The
length of this movie is just silly, I love slow movies and sat through
this movie longer than I would have anyway because I liked that it was
a different pacing than most Hollywood flicks. But by half way through
I realised that this pacing does not work for this film, because there
is not enough happening to keep us interested through the slow points.
The characters are not highly complex, the drama isn't compelling, and
neither is their relationship or any of the relationships around them. I feel as though half of this film should have been left on the cutting
room floor, a very poor job in editing as well as script editing. This
seems to me as a first draft. I loved forgetting Sarah Marshall, and
feel as though the producers probably rushed the script of 'The Five
Year Engagement' into production before it was developed. So what we
are left with is a very slow, very boring, and sometimes plain
laughable movie. I never walk out on movies, and I walked out on this one because I felt
the horror couldn't go on any longer - and surely it would come to an
end soon, only to realise there was another hour to go. A really poor
movie.
