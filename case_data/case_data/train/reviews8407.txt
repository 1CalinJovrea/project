An Escape

I came across this movie randomly as a listing on the web and decided I
was going to watch it on Netflix. Considering the fact I have never
watched a German movie, I started watching this with the idea that
things going on in the movie were normal to Germans. I found that
absurd and disgusting. I'll later come to understand that it is the Director David Wnendt who
is a bit sick, not Germany. The film then started to make sense from
that perspective. A dark humor, an escape from reality and the social
norms of what is approved if you will. It's a coming of age movie about
a girl who is somewhat discovering herself and dealing with the divorce
of her parents.The general package is good. Like many European movies I have seen, you
sort of feel attached to the characters, like you are there in the
movie. The editing, music choice and colors are also warm and in tune
with the film.
