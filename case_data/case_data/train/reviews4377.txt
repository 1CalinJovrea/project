Douglas,De Niro,Freeman and Kline Are Simply Having Fun

Last Vegas is a comedy that features an ensemble cast of four legendary
actors namely:Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and
Kevin Kline.It is about four old men who have been friends for close to
sixty years who decide to throw a bachelor party for the only one of
them who has remained single that is planning to get married.Mary
Streenburgen co-stars.It was directed by Jon Turteltaub.Despite of its tag line that states "It is going to be legendary",it is
definitely far from it.The Academy Award winning actors are obviously
working for a paycheck and having fun being together in the set.Nothing
more.The comedic scenes barely would elicit laughter to the viewer. One
positive thing about it though is that they try to make do of what the
material offers to make sure that it is far from being one bad
movie.With regards to the performances,there is nothing really worth
mentioning except the fact that the actors are definitely having fun
with their characters.As for the screenplay,it was more like of a get
together among old friends who celebrate their friendship of being
together.As for the themes of unresolved issues,old age and friendship,
it presents nothing original and it is obviously clich√©d and
predictable.Overall,it is basically a movie about four old men having
great time together at Las Vegas.
