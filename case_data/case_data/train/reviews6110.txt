Good stuff

This is a great movie which in its offbeat dramaturgy depicts the
unpredictability, pointlessness and hardships of life. And it does so
with an underlying sense of humor which is almost Kafkaesque and
absurd. Don't let the settings fool you Â–this is not a western flick,
it is timeless, and it serves as a tasty, simple snack for the already
thinking viewer. All "plotholes" pointed out by other reviewers
actually makes sense when thinking about them, and once again kudos to
the unpredictable, non-conformant, "non-template-A" storyline and
character arcs which should be seen more in film and television.A little too much use of "fade-in fade-out" in the cutting, a little
unrealistic portrayal of mental disease, and a little uninspiring
photography IMO actually, but otherwise a great flick for the thinking
person. With guns.
