Lacks focus, takes itself too seriously

How to best describe this movie? It's basically one of those found
footage films which follows a couple of friends seeking thrills and
chills, slowly revealing increasing horrors, and... ends badly for
everybody.Except without much horror. If you can call a bunch of masked dudes and
clowns scary.I mean seriously, the movie is supposed to be about Halloween haunts,
but for some reason the filmmakers decided to go for THE MOST cliché
things. Yes, haunted houses do usually rely on clichés, but the whole
premise is supposed to be about a couple of people who go out of their
way into the "backwoods" to find the most out-of-the-way scares. What's more baffling is that half of the film doesn't even show any
scare houses. When they are shown, the scenes are so rushed and dark
you can barely see anything. Most of the time you are forced to sit
through uninspired banter, scenes of sleeping and eating, and at one
point, visiting a strip club. Even when things start to go awry (aka being stalked by psychotic
clowns), none of these people have the sense to go home. NOT ONE. And then it just ends abruptly with a rather dark ending. The tone of
the ending is so off from the rest of the film, it would have been
better if they just had fun with it and made it a whole lot campier.To sum it all up - Where most found-footage films rely on the unseen
for a sense of foreboding, here we are given an excess of uninspired
imagery, boring scares, sub par acting, and no clear direction. Oh, and that doll girl that's featured in all the trailers and posters
is actually one of the few creepiest things in the film. So, extra
points for her + a disturbing scene involving an organ in a fridge.
