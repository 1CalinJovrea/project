An insult to the horror genre

The Cabin In The Woods starts off as, what seemed to be a horror comedy
- the clich√© college students (a jock, a blonde girl, a stoner, a nerd
and a virgin) meet up to spend the weekend in a cabin together. 'Fair
enough', I thought. But that thought didn't last long. Here is a list
of things that bugged me about this film:1) The acting ranged from bad right down to laughable.2) The characters were annoying and 2 dimensional. I could not wait for
them to be killed and was actually rooting for the zombie family, which
had more of a background story than any of the main characters.3) The big red button that releases every monster. WHY WOULD YOU INVENT
THIS BUTTON?! In what possible scenario would you need this button?!
The mere existence of this button was the best plot twist in the movie.4) During the entire time of me watching this movie, I was not sure
whether the movie was parodying the horror genre or actually wanted to
be taken seriously. Either way it failed.A brainless movie with no good storyline whatsoever. I want my money
back.
