Slow burner, not scary!

I just watched this movie and I was like scare me already! It takes
awhile for the movie to get up to speed (More like turtle crawl). It
was predictable as other posts have mentioned and the wife was a super
nag I was really hoping she would get killed in the 1st 1/2 hour!With out saying much more and cutting to the point. - It wasn't scary at all - Bagoul was creepy till they showed his face
clearly, he looked like a member of the rock group KISS. - The lighting
was horrible, maybe they could'nt afford more bulbs or lamps! - The
films he found with the murder movies was original and creepy - The
cheesy loud bangs to make you jump was predictable and overdone! -
Acting was meh... - The ending left me leaving the theater 20 bucks
short!!
