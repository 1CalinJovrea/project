Enjoyed it!

I can say that this was actually a great movie! I watched this movie
clueless about the director's negative past as a filmmaker and other
things that made me think twice when I found out afterwords. But unlike
some of the other users, I went in just wanting to watch a good movie.The flashbacks, the emotion, the suspicion and the mystery that was in
it really did it for me. The story was so out of this world, but so
realistic. Also, being an editor myself, The Captive made me not pay
attention to the editing and thats a pet peeve I have. So that says
enough. But the ending, killed me. I literally said: this can NOT be the
ending. I was checking the time, I was stressing! So yeah, that's a
bummer and I do not think there will be a part two.Should get a lot more credit.
