The Dawn of Enlightenment Breaks Through the Windows of Christiansborg Palace

While obviously for fairly mature tastes, A ROYAL AFFAIR is a film that
has it all.--An engaging and compelling plot: Even if a film about the
18th-century Danish monarchy doesn't sound so thrilling, it is. Much
suspense of the slower, more intelligent kind. Complex but clear
layers. Romance and some sex.--Fine acting by all of the major and minor players. Mikkel Boe
FÃ¸lsgaard as mad King Christian VII convincingly (and amusingly) steals
the show. Alicia Vikander and Mads Mikkelsen also give very memorable
performances. Great costume design as well.--A lucid illustration of the purpose and effects of the Enlightenment,
showing it rather than telling it and never becoming heavy-handed or
preachy.--Nice blend of moods: poignant and melancholy in places,
laugh-out-loud funny in others, but always straightforward and
realistic.I could on and on here, but suffice it to say that A ROYAL AFFAIR is a
wonderfully rich experience and one of the best all-around films I have
seen in quite a while.
