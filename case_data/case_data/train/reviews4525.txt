Genuine terror

One of the best and most original thriller/horror films for a long long
time.A farther and son who are both coroners have a unidentified body turn
up at there morgue, the unidentified female was found at a mass murder
scene by a local sheriff. The sheriff tells them he needs to know what
happened to her by the end of the night so they get to work.With strange things that start to happen during the girls autopsy who
has been labeled as Jane Doe this film develops into a horror mystery
so much so you can't take your eyes off the screen.Brian Cox is excellent as well is Emile Hirsch, the autopsy of Jane Doe
is how a film is meant to be made not some rubbish found footage but
genuine real tension and horror. Quite possibly one of the best films
out this year.
