A Heartfelt Film.....

Really enjoyed this film! A very well acted and touching Gem of a film.
The young lead actress nailed the part and was very convincing and
quite good in this movie. I felt the sincerity throughout the film. If
your looking for a violent action film from beginning to end I would
suggest you pass. But if your looking for a film with lots of heart
then i highly recommend this one. Two Thumbs Up....Way Up!
