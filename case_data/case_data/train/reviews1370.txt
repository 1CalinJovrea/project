This movie when not compared to the book is awesome!

This movie when not compared to James Dashners book is wonderful. The
cinematography is wonderful, the script is great, and the acting is
even better. I admit I might be biased on the acting part my favorite
actor stars in this movie. Here are the reasons its not good.Alby shows Thomas around the first day. The screen writer gave Alby all
of Chucks dialog from the book. Theresa doesn't go into a coma. Ben
isn't in "the changing" when Thomas comes to the Glade. there is no
cliff. the "keeper's meeting" isn't private. Gally doesn't get mad at
the meeting and leave the Glade. In the maze Thomas has Minho's help
getting Alby up on the maze wall. it rains. Theresa brings the serum
with her. Thomas and Theresa don't communicate telepathically. The
Griever attack is all wrong. Gally doesn't give himself to the
grievers. there are numbers as a password. the scientists are dead when
the "Gladers" arrive. Gally doesn't want to leave. Gally kills chuck
without being controlled. the maze is not underground. For those
reasons I give this a rating of seven. it follows the book but leaves
out things that are important. Not all of the things I put are
important to the movie. but I felt were.
