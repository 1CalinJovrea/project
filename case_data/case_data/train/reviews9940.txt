Much better than some reviews are saying

I have read few unfavourable reviews about The Gambler mostly saying
the film is not gripping enough. I disagree. At no stage did i lose
interest in what was going on and i thought the tension was palpable at
times. A really good leading performance from Mark Wahlberg and it's
good to see Michael Kenneth Williams ( Omar Little from The Wire ) in a
big role. If i had to be picky i would say that the three people who
Jim owed money to could have been a little bit more menacing and the
ending is a little bit confusing ( or that could just be me ! ).
Overall though an entertaining , enjoyable movie which also has a great
soundtrack.
