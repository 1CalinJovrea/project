Great popcorn flick

I read a lot of bad reviews about this film, attacks on the script,
plot and direction, so I was pleasantly surprised to find they were all
wrong and they totally missed the point. I think these people were
expecting Oscar winning performances but this film is about watching
bad guys getting their a*s kicked. I also read that the actors seems
withdrawn and bored of their roles and that is utter rubbish, and even
if that were true it doesn't matter, im not interested in deep
characters and meaningful performances in films like this, I just want
to see lots of destruction and the bad guys getting owned.There's some funny dialogue here and there and Banderas' character had
me smiling a lot.If you like action films you will enjoy this action romp, so ignore
those bad reviews and grab yourself a bucket of popcorn and enjoy.
