Happy, Uplifting, Feel Good Movie

I did not expect such a talented cast of actors mostly in small parts.
Jon Favearu has a lot of friends. The actor who played his son is a
find. He was great. Low key, sweet and very natural and believable. The
story is good. It is about the chef and then the food truck, but it
really is about him and his son. I liked that he was friends with his
ex wife, Sofia Vergara, who did a great job. That struck home for me,
because my ex and I get along well and it brought a lump to my throat
to see how happy that made their son. It is special when divorced
parents can get along and do things with their kids. The story moved
quickly and I loved how the son used twitter and they incorporated
social media into the story. Very realistic. I highly recommend this
movie. Really a joy to watch.
