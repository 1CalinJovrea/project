Beautifully melancholic

These type of films don't come around that often, and for good reason.
It takes focus and effort to come up with stories and themes that touch
deeper than the usual Hollywood dirge. The story-line is completely
unpredictable , unlike 95% of the films out there.What is most intriguing about M B T S , is the way in which highly
depressing themes are kept in check with humour, intelligent scripting
and a subtle feel good factor, which seems to creep in at exactly the
right time. The overall feel is also kept balanced by the intricacies
of the relationships between various characters. Affleck has taken his
game to the next level , his character and mannerisms are completely
believable -he is submerged into type.As a couple of mid 40 somethings, we grew tired of the typical film
genres some years ago. We long for films like this, and having seen
many of the nominated films for this year (bafta), this one is by far
the clear leader. Hacksaw ridge is just another glorification of war,
predictable, overly violent and boring, silence is good OK but not
special and the list goes on. Manchester by the sea deserves
recognition for standing out in a sea of mediocrity
