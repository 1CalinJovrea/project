Good but there are minuses

When I watched the trailer my expectations is much higher but after I
watch the movie it didn't satisfy my all expectations. Of course it
can't satisfy everybody's all expectations at the same time. The film is generally very good. In the way of Electro's creation is
very good, Green Goblin could be better. Harry did very less research
about secret projects it didn't mention there it can heal the body.
Also spider venom effect Harry very fast. It start to effect Peter in a
day or less but effect Harry like 10 seconds. Also slow motions are
perfect and it happened the time it should be. Fight with Electro and
special effects were very good. It is good to see what happened to
Peter's family. Gwen's death was shocked me. I don't understand how she
die. Is her back broken or is she hit the ground before Peter catch
her. Anyway Ä±n my opinion she shouldn't be dead in this movie maybe she
can die in next movie or in the next movie she can go somewhere else
and leave Peter. If it is go like that next movie Aunt May is going to
die. Comedy is good somewhere but somewhere it is unnecessary. Rhino's
type is little different maybe because I saw it only in Spider-Man
cartoon. End credit scene could be about next Spider-Man movie.It was
unnecessary to add a scene about X-men. There are minuses but the pluses is more than that I suggest anyone to
see that film and it is far better than first movie.
