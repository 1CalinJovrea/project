The Great Wall. This film that makes Elysium look like an Oscar winner!

Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal are looking for 'black powder' in China and
find themselves by chance in the middle of a massive battle between the
elite Chinese army and an endless supply of unstoppable monster
creatures that could have come straight out of Lord of the Rings.There is so much wrong with this film, I really don't know where to
start, but I'll give it a stab. The plot is rubbish, the dialogue is
garbage, the acting is wooden, and I didn't really care for any
characters in this film, that's just to start with! It was like
watching a computer game made from a weird Chinese fable. I imagine
this is what Cirque Du Soleil does when not performing on stage.I appreciate that the producers needed a big name on the poster to draw
an audience but why on earth did 'Jason Bourne' agree to make this
garbage. Pedro Pascal's character is reasonably fun, which is why I
gave 1 star (though I couldn't give less).With a few tweaks, this could have been a comedy spoof and it would
have been so much better if they had done that instead of trying to
make a serious film! Stay away or they'll make The Great Wall2 (AGGGHHHHH!!!)
