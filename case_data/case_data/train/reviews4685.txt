Painful to watch

Sorry but I grew up living and loving musicals but this is tripe. None
of the "stars" are of the expected style or standard. The story is
grotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I kept wanting
someone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands, Stones voice left
me praying for a good dose of pharyngitis. In short neither can sing or
dance yet the Hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it is
and people believe it. In short i wasted 2 hours, 7 minutes and 3
seconds of my life. For our Australian summer releases it rates nearly
as bad as Passengers.Don't bother wasting the ticket money.
