Totally misunderstood

I can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody
understood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas
Shrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while
making it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of
itself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral
and action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the
end. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what
could be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas
Shrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now.
Oh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter?
Artistic licence anyone? Right my review is over but I have to keep
writing because it won't post unless I fill the minimum line count.
