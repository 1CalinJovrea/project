Save your money!

I went to see this movie in high hopes after the huge success of Seth's
earlier film "Ted" which I saw three times in theaters and enjoyed each
time. However, I could barely sit through the entirety of AMWTDITW
without nearly nodding off or wanting to leave the theater completely.
The humor (if you can even call it that) was scarce. It was noticeably
forced and obscenely crude, which is nothing new for Seth, but it was
crude in a very childish way. Much of it had something to do with
farting or diarrhea, not an adult topic in my opinion. The storyline
was unoriginal, boring, and predictable. The characters were
stereotypical and flat and the acting was poor at best. Seth is far
better suited for voice acting than live action. It was painful to
watch. *SPOILER* The scene that tipped its hat to the back to the
future series would have been a fun surprise had it not been ruined in
the previews. In fact most of the humorous lines or scenes were shown
in the previews. In closing, save your money for a movie you may
actually enjoy.
