Surprisingly good

Even though this movie didn't scare me,it was the first time I heard
people scream in the audience ever. This movie was absolutely
brilliant. It looked beautiful, the actors did a splendid job and this
adaptation of IT really added something valuable.I do have to say that
the first half of the movie didn't quite capture me, but then it just
got better and it kept surprising me.
