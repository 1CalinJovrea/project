"Konnichiwa!" Saw the first showing of "The Interview" on Christmas Day, and I'm very
glad I did. Franco, Rogan, and Park create an unpredictable 3-way
bromance with heart, energy, and more than a few subversive jabs at
both North Korean and American culture.Yes the plot is ridiculous. And to paraphrase a line from the movie,
yes some of the humor is "lowbrow with a capital 'low.'" But it's the
funniest of 41 movies I've seen in theaters in 2014 (so far.)My advice: if you want to see a truly funny over-the-top farce, go see
"The Interview."
