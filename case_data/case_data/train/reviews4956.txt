The ending crushes everything

The film seemed amazing up until the last 20 minutes of it where logic
just blew away and the worst possible ending appeared.So, let me summarize: a handful of terrorists who killed a lot of
people wins against a peaceful superb being that tries to heal the
world. And they don't just destroy it, they try to deceive it using the
wife who in 1 second decided to betray her husband. The deception fails
and the final terrorist girl just waves her gun into the air, points to
another friend who has betrayed Will and just commands: "kill your
f___ng self and your wife too, just so I won't shoot your friend".Why Will doesn't save his wife, while simulating death? Even better,
why can't Will neutralize one small stupid terrorist girl? How is it he
able to get over every other military unit, but not this one? Can't he
use one of his minions to jump fast and furious? Can't he attack her
from behind? Can't he, after all, just heal his friend?So, one stupid terrorist girl makes the world healing machine commit
suicide and basically murder his own wife for whom he was doing this
all and who betrayed him in no time and without any doubts.Terrorists win, planet loses. Basically this film is about that if you
believe in something so hard that you will kill many people for it and
just demand your enemies to kill themselves, you'll get what you want.
It's about "go terrorists, go, if you think that you are doing good
thing it's all good!"The worst possible ending ever.
