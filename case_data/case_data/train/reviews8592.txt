That was an experience..

I used to joke I want my money back when I saw bad movies. But I was so
angry with this one, I didn't care about the money. I wanted my time,
my Saturday evening back! As a matter of principle I never leave a
movie in the middle, but the more I saw the senseless "acting" and
"story", the more I became irritated.. I love sci-fi, I could even
watch the cheapest one and still be satisfied. But when they make
"something" as horrible as this, something with no connecting
storyline, no sense of the slightest sign of logic, no
consequence/connection to any scenes that just played, the constant
building up to nothing over and over again. I just felt like being
treated like a moron with a 3 second memory, who could be 'woawed' by
the scenes, but doesn't know or care what happened 3 second before
that. I came out the movie angry and stressed. This is beyond bad, this
deserves a -10. Not only that, this movie should be banned from human
history. Save yourselves!
