Whew.  No spoilers.

Woke up this morning thinking about it like a memory that was real.
Sometimes I see one of these back east movies where the location is
perfect, and the characters are perfect, and it haunts me like a past
life. It's not about the story, though this one was great, it's the
look and feel of time, place, and people. Whew. Any more said would spoil this movie..Don't let anyone spoil it for you. Go in blind. Don't let anyone spoil
it for you. Go in blind. Don't let anyone spoil it for you. Go in
blind. Don't let anyone spoil it for you. Go in blind. Don't let anyone
spoil it for you. Go in blind.
