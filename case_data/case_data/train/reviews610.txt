It Follows is the most refreshingly terrifying horror movie I've seen
in the last year.The movie begins on an exceptionally terrifying note, opening with a
teenage girl fleeing from her house. She's running from someone - or
something - but what? We have no earthly idea, but her fear infects us
with an overwhelming and inexplicable terror. This opening scene sets
the bar high for the rest of the movie, and we know that we will
receive no mercy.Director David Robert Mitchell knows what he's doing here. He knows
what scares you, and executes it perfectly. With camera-work that can
only be described as "surreal", we feel as if we are in a 100 minute
long nightmare. The worst nightmares are the ones you know you can't
escape from - you can't move fast enough, no matter how hard you try.
At the heart of the horror film lies this simple, terrible truth: You
cannot escape death.In this nightmare, an inexplicable terror is following the protagonist.
It's not a matter of WHAT is following her - per se - but rather WHEN
it arrives. The inevitability of its coming is by far the most
terrifying aspect of this movie. These are actors you've never seen before, yet characters you know
personally. The music score is one you've never heard before, but one
you will never forget. This movie is a nightmare that you can't wake up
from, and it is scary as Hell. You might as well be tied to your seat,
forced to watch as an unstoppable, grotesque, demon-like entity walks
slowly toward you...closer...closer...and closer. This is how horror movies should be made. Fear should "follow" you, not
"surprise" you. It Follows is easily one of the most terrifying horror
movies of the decade. I recommend it 100%.
