Disaster !!!

Watching KICKASS was a pleasant experience which really had some kick-
ass moments. Unfortunately , Kickass 2 tumbles down and is thoroughly
disappointing. To fulfill her father's dream Hit-Girl leaves Kick-Ass and joins
school. Meanwhile Kickass joins a new group to protect the citizen. To
his surprise, Red Mist creates his own group of evils to avenge his
father's death. Directed by Jeff Wadlow , Kick ass 2 has nothing new to offer. The
bound of expectations raised by the original movie will be deteriorated
by the sequel. The movie has no story and worst part is that not a
single scene is glorious as compared to the previous part. Direction is
no-where. Screenplay is disappointing. Editing is OK. Action scenes are
fine. It is again ChloÃ« Grace Moretz who shines as Hit-girl.
Unfortunately , the character is not fully developed. Aaron
Taylor-Johnson does his part fineOverall , I was extremely disappointed with sequel. Disaster. 1/5
