Some people are extremely sensitive

I don't know what s wrong with some people.This movie had nothing
against Europeans or Europe culture/history.Cause if it had,then this
wouldn't be approved by European critics.Anyway,this movie and the Logan are the grand jewels of comic book
movies of this year.Logan was deep,emotional,brutal with intriguing
story.Thor is pure epicness,filled with action and the comedy side fits
perfectly to tone of the movie.From the trailer I thought Guardians of
the Galaxy will have lots of cringe jokes and cheesy moments but they
used the comedy perfectly.Same can be said for Thor 3 too.They managed
to have an impact on the audience with sentimental stuffs,at the same
time they made us laugh in right places. This movie has already gotten
itself carved to my memory.A memorable movie for me.Just like dark
knight,Logan and guardians of the galaxy 1.
