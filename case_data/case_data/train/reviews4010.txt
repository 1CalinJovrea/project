Crimson Peak is one of the most artistic horror movies I've seen in
recent times. The movie's aristocratic splendor won my heart and is one
of the main highlights of the movie. All the main characters in this
movie are rich and you will realize why once the movie culminates in
its climax. And then there are the ghosts. Now I have to admit that I
have seen "better" ghosts in other horror movies because the ghosts in
this movie look out of shape and straight out of a child's horror story
book. ( Once again if you watch the movie carefully you might actually
be able to infer why the ghosts in this movie look the way they do) BUT
I won't deny the fact that the movie has it's spooky moments, some of
which are extremely creepy. Moments like these get a horror movie
going.So watch Crimson Peak mainly for the following reasons (1) The spooky moments-- Not exactly the moments when you see the
ghosts but the prologue to those moments are the ones to cherish.(2) The movie's medieval Gothic architecture and the director's eye for
detail that made Crimson Peak look so beautiful-- Yes, this is a
ravishingly pretty horror movie. The architecture used in this movie
more than makes up for all the ugly ghosts it features. If you are
aspiring to be an interior decorator and want a cathedral for a home
look no more beyond Crimson Peak.3) The aristocracy-- Like I mentioned earlier there is no dearth of
opulence in this movie. The costumes are amazing and there is this
exquisitely glamorous feel to this horror flick.So have a field day in the movie theater as you watch some wealthy
people of the Middle Ages tackle vindictive ghosts against an immensely
beautiful backdrop.
