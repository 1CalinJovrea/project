What comes at night?

I must confess I was expecting way more of this "horror" film. It started off quite well (hence the 4 rating) but after the first 30
minutes went downhill. No questions were answered, you are left with a
large list of plot holes and an ending that couldn't be more
predictable and boring.Don't get me wrong, it isn't the worst "horror" film I ever saw but is
avoidable especially if you like HORROR.I'm still waiting for what comes at night.
