A fun examination of the human condition via a slice of Frances' life.

Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig lead us on an expansive journey that
takes place in the confines of several years in the life of a single
character - Frances. They co-wrote the film and Gerwig is sublimely
engaging as Frances, a woman who prefers to focus on the moments along
life's path rather than any sort of destination to the path itself.Baumbach takes those incredibly realistic and often uncomfortable
moments, shapes them into black-and-white vignettes that are both
immediate and personal, and then precisely combines those vignettes
into this delicate and funny film. It's rounded off by an unbelievably
talented supporting cast who make "Frances Ha" an all-around joy to
watch.
