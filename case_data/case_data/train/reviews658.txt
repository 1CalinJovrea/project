boring .. one big failed low budget flop

i would like to start this with the usual compliment of something in
film but,, this has nothing worth mentioning. the characters are generic and corny.. it turns into a dumb story about
the dad that died in the safe. Morgan and Mark have a bonding scene
that is cringe-worthy, bad, corny,, almost gives you a "give a break"
moment... the one that makes you get up and go ask for your money back
do yourself a favor and avoid the aggravation, just skip this one.Also the new girl they use is too "Disney" and Woody H plays twins,,
badly acted and inconsistent to the plot and both just come across just
annoying. Poor Radcliffe tries to add his boyish charm but ends up
going down with this ship,,
