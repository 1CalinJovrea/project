A brilliant movie, but painful to watch

Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay
as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother ("Ma")The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother
are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated
her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived
in a small, locked shed, which they call "Room." Jack's mother has
lived in "Room" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has
lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from
realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that
anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe
that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept
it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because
it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic,
frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has
to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant.
Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such
great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room
wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped
men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the
lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given
the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small
screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally
before you begin.
