Excellent slow-build unnerving horror.

If you can't sit through a relatively slow-paced movie without losing
interest and wanting to play Angry Birds, this might not be the film
for you. If however you do have an adult attention span and aren't
afraid to engage it, this film will reward your patience many times
over.Utilising a vanishingly small cast remarkably well, the film relies on
the believability of the dialogue and the fine acting of the two main
characters to draw you ever closer into their seemingly idyllic world.
I won't go into any specific detail, but it is a technique that pays
off as things become more and more unsettling and a real sense of
wrongness begins to pervade what was supposed to be a perfect romantic
getaway in the woods.The film successfully ratchets up the tension over the runtime of 87
minutes, and despite a pretty slow start, delivers a lot by the time of
the final credits, leaving you feeling genuinely creeped-out and not
entirely sure of what you just witnessed.Honeymoon is that rare beast, a genuinely well-crafted horror movie.
The dialogue is genuinely solid, the acting is good, but it's the
perfect pacing that really makes this a must-see for any avid horror
fans.
