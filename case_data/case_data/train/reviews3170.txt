Kingsman: The Golden Circle is one of the worst movies of the year so far.

What I thought of Kingsman: The Golden Circle The humor was predictable
and cringe worthy, the plot minus well be nonexistent, they barely
develop/use the villain. All the characters that were cool in the first
movie were given nothing to do. And the new characters that they do
introduce are so irrelevant that they minus well not be there. There is
only one new character that is given anything to do, but he is so
obviously a secondary villain waiting to be revealed that he should
just have been a secondary villain to begin with. There was also a
bunch of attempts at shock humour attempt, but those were just more
obnoxious than actually shocking. The action is also not really well
done, because there are times where you just can't really tell what's
happening. The movie keeps zooming in unnecessarily because I guess the
director thought that looked cool. I basically hated almost everything
about this movie, and what I didn't hate, I was completely indifferent
towards it
