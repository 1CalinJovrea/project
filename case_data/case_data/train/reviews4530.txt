Excellent movie, both fun and inspirational.

Obviously kids are giving rates on IMDb, so Ñ˜udge movie by it's IMDb
rating is ridiculous.I personally hope that IMDb will hide its rating, or at last categorize
it somehow, because to be able to fully understand some movies you need
to fit the criteria, and in this movies case:A. You are aged over 20 B. You tried to accomplish something in your
life C. You cooked at last 100 meals :) D. You are driven by passion in
your lifeIn my humble opinion, Bradly Cooper's acting is awesome, I didn't
really expect he can handle such complex personality well, but he
nailed it.The plot and storyline are perfect. I rarely feel so motivated and
inspired after a movie. So, my thanks to the director, writers, actors
and producers for creating this movies!Keep up the good work!
