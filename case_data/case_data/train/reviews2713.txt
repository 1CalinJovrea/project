clich√© predictable juvenile propaganda

this is the remarkable story of an imbecile. perpetual fouling of
wishes, due to sloppy wording. "make boys wear pink clothes! OMG SO
FUNNY!" *rolls eyes...*the target audience must be around 5 to 10 years old.. young enough to
possibly be fooled when the movie presents "global warming" as though
it was anything other than a scheme to defraud taxpayers... did george
soros provide the financing? the author makes very little effort to present this movie as being
based in reality. characters express practically no shock to impossible
events - even when they are the ones those miracles are happening to!
"business as usual"...it's not horrible, but it's just so disappointing. mildly entertaining.
some nails on chalkboard moments. 4.5/10
