Utterly ridiculous piece of tribe

This fantasy is filled with bad acting, ridiculous dialog, and a rather
inconsistent use of CG. On a plus note, my daughter at age 7 found this interesting, and was
eagerly watching it as it progressed. I take to note as well that she,
at age seven, could predict the next course of events in the film.I, on the other hand, at age 41, had to slap my forehead in agony over
the idiotic irrational behavior of the teeny bobbies doing their best
to justify the bloated CG extravaganza, where it is equally necessary
to dress up and look like goth emo crew before killing daemons with
that usual array of medieval weaponry.It's a bit soft emo porn, and for a much less quality oriented
audience.
