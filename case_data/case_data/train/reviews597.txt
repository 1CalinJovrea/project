Loved it - hard to believe it's an Australian film.

It's a rare movie that makes you feel as though it was created just for
you - but Boys In The trees hits the mark so perfectly on what it was
like to be a teen in the Australian 90s that my level of empathy for
the characters was off the charts. The soundtrack is incredible, the cinematography is pure and the young
Aussie leads have taken hold of the ambitious script with both hands
and delivered performances that are nothing short of star-making. Toby
Wallace as Corey and Mitzi Ruhlmann as Romany are particularly strong.
Justin Holborow as the bully Jango also plays his part with true grit.This is the evolution of the traditional coming of age tale, with the
Writer/Director Nicholas Verso creating such an ethereal landscape you
feel moments of 'What Dreams May Come' style fantasy seamlessly
anchored by the exquisitely curated 90s Adelaide suburbia. I absolutely adored this movie. Anyone who loves fantasy will adore it.
It's a must-see for everyone who loves movies that straddle the line
between fantasy and reality.
