IMDb ratings really wrong on this one!

Yes,awful! Pretentious attempt with the writing to appear sophisticated
yet it was annoying within 15 minutes. The flash backs and music...ugh!
The last 15 minutes just made me angry that I wasted my evening
watching this because IMDb had a rating of 6.7. IMDb ratings are
usually right on target but this must have been a scam of abusers
submitting bogus stats.If you watch this then review all the goofs to make sure they are
accurate. I don't want to waste my time and even review it myself but
there are a ton of them goofs especially with the locked doors....so
easy to get out of the house in the end.....movie sucked!
