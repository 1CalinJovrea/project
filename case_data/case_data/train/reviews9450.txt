Knock knock....

Trailer was kind of interesting. Me and my wife just watched the
movie....and oh my goodness is it trash. Acting was trash, plot made no
sense. What a waste of time, I normally don't review movies, but this
movie was so bad I had to say something. If you bought this movie,
return it, if you are thinking about renting it, don't. I can't stress
how much this movie was horrible, like a flaming dumpster juice
cocktail. This is worst than running out of toilet paper after you had
the runs from a taco bell chalupa with extra hot sauce, it does not end
well.
