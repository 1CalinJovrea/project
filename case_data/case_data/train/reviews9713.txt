Well done, but disappointing

The Iceman is a great film overall, with very skillful "execution" in
most categories. Unfortunately, if you know anything about the real
Richard Kuklinksi, you may find yourself disappointed. I saw both parts
of the HBO documentary, The Iceman Tapes, and because of that extra
knowledge it left me wanting after the film ended. The main flaw here
was that they didn't depict what a truly sick bastard this man was.
Such disturbing anecdotes that were described in the documentary, such
as a day when Mr. Kuklinski decided to test out a crossbow on a random
citizen's face "just to see what happened," and a time when he let a
man be eaten alive by rats, filmed it, and watched it later, were not
depicted. I still found this movie to be worth watching, and deserving
of high marks, but if you know anything about the true story, don't go
in with unreasonable expectations.
