Having not seen the original, this is abysmal

This film is strange in many ways. Throughout the film, I questioned
the choice of actors in each role. None of them felt like they truly
cared about their character and just read from a script. Jack Bauer's
appearance was a shock to the system, only finding out after the film
he was in the original. His bit-part character was very questionable,
clearly only there for the money and/or nostalgia factor. He didn't add
anything to this poor film. Then there's the genre and storyline. It's
all over the place. With no depth to any characters, you rotate between
each of their half-baked stories. I didn't go into the cinema expecting
this to turn into a horror but it tries to be. Had the film stuck with
an action plot, where it explores the bounds of life and death, this
could have been good. But its not, if you want action you have better
chance in the bedroom.
