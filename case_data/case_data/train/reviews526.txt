Bad Moms is a "Bad" Movie

The film tried much too hard with the overuse of raunchy, vulgar
unnecessary humor, which cheapened the movie, which caused this film to
be nothing more than an overrated B Movie embarrassment. I am not a prude by a long-shot, it just didn't work. Just a badly
written movie. I couldn't even utter a chuckle or a smile from these God awful flat
jokes. All I could do, was roll my eyes with disbelief. Painful to
watch. This movie "could" have been SO brilliantly funny, witty, and adorable.
What were the writers thinking?? It's definitely..... NO 'Hang-Over'
movie. How could anyone remotely compare the two. Ouch! What can I
say..... It was just WRONG on every level. Lastly- The first movie I ever walked out on, and demanded a refund.
Thank you AMC Theaters for the credit. I wouldn't have paid $5.00 at a
cheap show for this mess. psst. Mila Kunis- I really like her. But this movie destroyed her
comedy appeal. Please rethink your visit, before you see this movie.
