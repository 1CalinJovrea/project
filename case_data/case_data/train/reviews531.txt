Lack of intelligence in the intelligence community

Greengrass returns to the Bourne franchise and brings with him the same
cameraman with Parkinsons that he has used all to often in the past.
The shaky camera thing is so old that it ruins what is an already
pretty average movie. As with all previous Bourne movies this one
suffers from credibility gaps but even more so than in the past. Even
the Jeremy Renner version was better than this effort. The biggest
problem I have with this offering is that even though Bourne and Nicky
Parsons are portrayed as sharp as tacks and well versed in all aspects
of covert ops and computer surveillance, especially facial recognition
capabilities, they still run around with faces uncovered and wonder why
the bad guys keep catching up with them. They keep making rookie
mistakes all through the move. The first half was agony to sit through.
Unless you are an intellectual midget with no eye for detail I'd save
my bucks and wait for the free to air TV showing if you must see it!
