Hilarious and original, which is all it was meant to be.

Although 'This is the end' does not have the greatest storyline in the
history of film, it is a very inventive movie in its own way. The fact
that every actor and actress plays him or herself makes the movie quite
original and refreshing. Besides that, there is also the fact that the
makers took an overused theme, the end of the world, and made it
completely their own.'This is the end' hasn't failed a second to make me laugh. It is a very
clever and entertaining comedy, with hilarious and dirty dialogues. I
do have to admit, however, that the storyline can feel a little bit too
ridiculous from time to time, even for this kind of movie. The acting
in the movie was not that spectacular, but the actors involved were all
born for this kind of movie.For anyone who can truly appreciate a hilarious movie which is made
specifically to humor and entertain people, and has no other hidden
agenda whatsoever, this is definitely a must watch.
