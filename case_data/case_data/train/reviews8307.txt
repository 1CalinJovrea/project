6
Mindless entertainment, boring storyline

OK, this is not a bad movie, but it is by no means good.The vibe you get from this is that it was aimed at children with comdey
moments for adults.The story deviated MASSIVELY from the comics, and while I generally
don't mind so long as it's done well... this isn't.In the comic Peter Quill's dad is J'son, Emperor of the Spartoi Empir
(kind of like the Shi'ar), not a celestial. The movie version has
fabricated a completely different and much worse story for this
iteration.All in, its a solid 6... but no more than that. This is aimed at people
who don't really care about a story and simply want visual effects with
a few comedy moments.Hopefully they get back to the Thanos Infinity stone saga now that they
are done with this deviation.
