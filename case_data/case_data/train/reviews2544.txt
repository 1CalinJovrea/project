Not worth it

At first half there is hardly any action. Lot and lots of talking and
no build up in story as such. One or two scenes they try to scare you
but again not that successful compared to the other horror movies i
have watched till date. Second half they try to confuse you without
adding any purpose to the story. The hallucinations and past turns out
to be absurd, unnecessarily trying to create confusion in the plot. The
story starts falling completely. The ending of the story is even more
pathetic having no sense of horror. Its more like a thriller (that too
an awful one).Really disappointed.Though the actors are pretty decent. Otherwise the story is slow and
without any touch of horror.
