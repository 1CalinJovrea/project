A dark day for so called comedy

Looking for comedy in a movie these days is like slogging through a
deep, dark quagmire filled with Directors trying to out do themselves
in profanity, nudity, greed and drug use and push the limits of
shock... all the things "we" want to see....NOT.What ever happened to comedy that makes you -think-, instead of a
constant bombardment of mindless, infantile dribble thrown at you.Yes, I am from the "stone age" and believe in good material and
brilliant writers...and true classic comedy, light hearted or even a
little dark, with some really good laughs. I'm not a puritan and an
occasional swear word or two I can handle, as long as the story is a
-good- one.Not only was I numb from all the F words, etc. but the moment that
really turned me off to this whole story line was when the parents,
searching to delete their Sex tape, hunts down the headquarters of the
porn company to break in and smash their operating system, -BUT- they
have to bring their two young children along with them.GREAT, now they have to have the whole family involved. (Its not bad
enough that their close friends pre-teen son is trying to blackmail
them with the tape first, oh no..) And after the porn King finds out
that the children are there, every thing goes from "kill the parents",
to "oh such sweet kids...we have to let you go, because we have kids
too"...really??!! Give me a break...daaaaa.I think that part of the film just crossed the line for me. We have
sunk to a new level in so called "humor". If adults want to do
something stupid and totally immoral, fine, but leave the idea of kids
out of it. A pretend story, yes,... pretend kids...yes, but totally
wrong in moral concept and tack.
