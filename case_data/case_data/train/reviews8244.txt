6
Not Bad.  Painful To listen to At times

Semi spoilers ahead - Movie was pretty good. Decent horror movie with
bigger actors but not so great effects. I will say that the acting of
the grandmother was absolutely horrendous, I mean so bad that I almost
had to turn it off at times. Started out giving this movie a 5 because
of her, but due to wonderful events I raised it to a 6. Seriously she
was ALMOST as annoying as Lily from Modern Family.
