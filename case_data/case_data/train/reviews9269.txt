Low point for this genre

Spoiler Alert (though hardly necessary for this predictable flick)If you read IMDb's synopsis, you already know the entire story. It's
the "group of teen misfits who band together and win a competition"
movie. You've it a dozen times before.This one has an updated, 2012 soundtrack, but all the other overdone
clich√©'s for this genre are fully intact.If, however, you find slick, unrealistic, overproduced, a cappella
singing to be pure joy (Glee fan?), then you may find this movie
tolerable.On the other hand, if you value your free time, pass this one up. You
will be spared several scenes of projectile vomiting, and the
"riff-off" (which will likely induce your own nausea).
