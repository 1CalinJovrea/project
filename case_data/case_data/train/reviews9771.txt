Perfect family entertainment!

Absolutely lovely! I'm 17 and saw this with my 8 year old brother, and
we both loved it! Dazzling special effects. Great Disney nostalgia
right from the beginning. Really good acting, particularly on 11/12
year old Raffey Cassidy's behalf, who manages to be both convincingly
robotic and also human enough to be empathized with. George Clooney
plays George Clooney as usual, what else could you ask for? The film
also has some pleasantly thought-provoking themes that left me
wondering whether the villain was truly evil or not. To add to this,
the ultimate message of optimism that shines throughout the film is
something lacking somewhat in films these days, and really makes this
one stand out from the crowd in the glut of super-high budget family
films that have been produced in the last few years.Now, important to add is that this is very much a kids' film. So maybe
not an appropriate film to see with your college or work mates on a
night out. And naturally, don't go and see this expecting masterful,
subtle storytelling or realistic dialogue. The story and dialogue are
both unabashedly silly, but quite frankly, why on earth would anyone
care? Don't go in expecting a storytelling masterpiece. Honestly, just
sit back, let down your critical barriers and enjoy the magic of
cinema.And one more thing: If you're reading this in time, this is DEFINITELY
a film to see in the cinema while you can. Get the benefit of the big
screen and surround sound while you can.
