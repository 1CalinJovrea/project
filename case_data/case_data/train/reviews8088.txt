As Tedious as a Textbook

Sean Penn is a true tour de force actor. What makes him so is exactly
one thing: his performance in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since
Spicoli, it has been nothing but lackluster, boring rubbish. If you
don't believe me, go ahead and watch The Gunman, and put this in your
pocket for later: "I told you so."Javier Bardem uses this stinker as an opportunity to teach us the art
of overacting in a second language.The woman in the film, whose name I don't want to know, is probably the
only actress in the world who could match Sean Penn in boringness and
lack of on-screen personality. She does a great job of making sure you
don't suddenly wake up during the film.Despite all the above big-money actors doing their best to compete
against each other and completely forget the fact that there's a camera
in the room with them, this movie can't save itself from its own
infestation of story lines. There must be seven different stories
taking place here, and none of them interested me in the slightest bit.
They all seem overly generic in their progress, but the way they are
presented left me highly confused as to what the movie was really
about. It's a boring film with too many story lines, all of them
predictable, but somehow it has been knotted together in such a way
that it almost comes off as a thriller that intends to be hazy until it
wants to take shape. This stinker never takes shape, or if it does it's
the shape of a pile of warm dog poop on a cold sidewalk, a real
'steamer'.
