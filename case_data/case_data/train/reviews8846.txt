One of the worst movies of the last 20 years

I am struggling to find a single thing about this film that was even
average. Jamie Fox handed in a performance appearing to have put in
about as much preparation as one would expect for a SNL hosting gig.
Channing Tatum, as another reviewer mentioned, did his best Bruce
Willis imitation but nothing could save this dreadful script.
**Spoilers Below** The pocket watch was almost as predictable as it was
with the bubble-gum filled cigarette case in "Johnny Dangerously".In addition to all of the above, I could have done without the
ridiculously left-wing nature of the film... There were so many that it
was hard to keep track but here were some: Left Wing President, who
wanting nothing more than peace in the middle east, essentially
declares it so. His peace policy blocked only by the right-wingers and
the evil military industrial complex, the only way that the evil
conservatives can stop his plans is to get the right wing speaker of
the house to enlist a secret service agent (whose son died in a botched
military operation), a burned off-book spy , and a "right wing" neo-
nazi. Their master plan: To assassinate the President and Vice
President and make the world think it was done by Islamist Terrorists..If you are able to look past the obvious political nonsense in the
film... your still left with a heaping pile of crap. A much better
version of this "genre" is "Olympus has Fallen"...
