The Nostalgia is real

Jurassic world is the #1 movie in America. This movie deserves the
right to be called back especially with all the money it earned
especially in the first week it was out. It's been 14 years since the
last time I saw Jurassic Park. I never would have thought that they
would be making a Fourth one and when I heard they were making a new
one I was ecstatic. It brought back all the memories of the first 3
films. When the day came for Jurassic World to open it had to go see it
on opening day and I did. The movie gave us the same feeling Jurassic
Park 1 did "Welcome to Jurassic World". The new park looked amazing
showing that John Hammond'so dream finally came true. The music was
more amazing than ever, the original Jurassic Park theme was re-prised
to show how much thing had changed in 14 years. The main attraction of
this movie was the Indominus Rex and hybrid of T-Rex, Raptor, cuddle
fish, and Tree frog and terrifying intelligence. At the end of the
movie we get to see the original T-Rex from the first movie roar for
the last time after the park was closed for good. This movie brought
back so many memories for so many people. I can't wait for the next
one.
