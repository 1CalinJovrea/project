Pretentious, Overrated and Boring, 27 April 2013

In Los Angeles, the alcoholic Irish screenplay writer Marty (Colin
Farrell) lives with his girlfriend Kaya (Abbie Cornish) and is writing
the screenplay of a story about seven psychopaths. His best friend
Billy (Sam Rockwell), who helps Marty to develop the profile of
psychopaths, kidnaps dogs for the veteran smalltime crook Hans
(Christopher Walken) that returns the animal to the owner to receive
the reward. When Billy kidnaps the beloved Shih Tzu that is the pride
and joy of the powerful gangster Charlie (Woody Harrelson), he hunts
Hans down and kills his wife Myra (Linda Bright Clay) in the hospital.
Soon Marty learns that the psychopaths described by Billy are not
fictional."Seven Psychopaths" pretentious, overrated and boring movie about an
alcoholic Irish writer that is writing about psychopaths and finds that
is surrounded by them. The plot was supposed to be a combination of
comedy with crime, but it does not work well and I laughed only in a
couple of scenes. Maybe with Guy Ritchie in the direction, "Seven
Psychopaths" might have worked, but unfortunately Martin McDonagh does
not repeat the good work of "In Bruges" and the movie sucks. My vote is
four.Title (Brazil): "Sete Psicopatas e um Shih Tzu" ("Seven Psychopaths and
one Shih Tzu")
