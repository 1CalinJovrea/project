"An excellent movie with an excellent plot and acting"

Summary (no spoilers) In the future where the world is overpopulated and each family is
limited to one child, a set of identical septuplets must avoid being
put to a long sleep by the government and dangerous conflict erupt
while investigating the disappearance of one of their own.My Review (no spoilers)The plot of this movie was excellent, a perfect blend of action,
adventure and crime. This movie takes you thru a never ending roller
coaster ride from the start till the end. Hats off to the director
Tommy Wirkola for and exceptional directing and also the wonderful
writers Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson without them we could not have
got this rare gem of a movie. Noomi Rapane did an amazing job in acting
for this movie also not to forget Glenn Close, Willem Dafoe. The ending
of this movie was unpredictable and awesome.My RecommendationYes just go watch this movie forget all the average ratings given to
it. This is a must watch movie.My Rating10/10
