Worst Movie Of the Decade

After reading countless review of this film, I could barely believe
that the other reviewers who rated this film more than 5 watched the
same thing. With the Villain referred to as 'Man' in the credits, I
struggled to believe anything this man did? With absolutely no
information given about the Villain the viewers are left to just assume
he's some kind of bored psychopath just waltzing through the bush
praying on ladies at home alone. Even when Sarah the neighbor was
murdered early on, Maddie may be deaf but she definitely has peripheral
vision! Doing the dishes and can't see her neighbour being stabbed 2
meters away through a majority glass door! BS! And with the countless
chances for Maddie to finish the Villain but alternatively deciding on
some other idiotic venture, not to mention the runtime of 80 mins? This
has got to be the worst movie of the Decade, and if you want to sit
through a movie where you'll be yelling advice at the dim witted
characters the whole time, I recommend something different.
