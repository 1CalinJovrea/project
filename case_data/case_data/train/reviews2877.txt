Don't Understand the Hype

There's a lot of discussion on here as to whether this film constitutes
a horror film or something more akin to a psychological drama.As a horror film, I didn't find the film scary, and as a psychological
drama, not particularly fresh in what it was presenting. I consider
'The Road' as a much, much stronger example of a film that blends
horror and psychological drama - in exploring the limits of humanity &
family in an apocalyptic setting.It's nonetheless a well-made film with fine performances, but I came
into the film expecting...something great, which it wasn't. That's hype
for you.
