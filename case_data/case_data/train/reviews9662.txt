This is NOT a one-star movie

I've never posted on IMDb before. But after seeing all the ratings of
one star, I feel that I had to speak up. If you're looking for an
intense police drama/action flick, then this is a great one. If you're
not a fan of Arnie, then you might want to skip it, as he (obviously)
dominates screen time. It's not an "Arnie Vehicle" as the entire cast matters; and Ayer's
direction is ballsy - but it works. The violence is nothing more than
you'd catch on AMC or HBO.I don't understand the hate this film gets.Give it a try if you like gritty cop dramas.
