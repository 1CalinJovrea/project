Unbelievably bad

I don't normally post reviews, but if I can save one person the 2 hours
that I lost, it will be worth it.It's all down hill after the first scene. The character development is
way overdone across the board, especially Arnie's character: cigar
smoking while guns are blazing, the one night stand with the
all-business homicide detective, bad lines like "look at you with your
40% body fat", etc. The DEA crew living together in a crack house,
drinking and getting lap dances at every turn, the member with the drug
problem, etc. Not one clich√© was over-looked.The acting is also horrible, but worst of all, the plot makes
absolutely no sense.I could write a better plot than this. How does this stuff get past the
script writers, reviewers, actors??
