I have no family

In London, the UDI blows up a British Bank which kills the last family
member of Quan (Jackie Chan). Quan suspects the First Minister of
Ireland (Pierce Bronson) knows the identity of the bombers. He will not
stop until he gets them.We get some background information on Quan at about an hour into the
film as well as confirmation of the clues scattered about. This was a
serious role for Jackie Chan playing a 61 year old Rambo. While the
plot was fairly simple, the story kept me engaged, even knowing where
it going.Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.
