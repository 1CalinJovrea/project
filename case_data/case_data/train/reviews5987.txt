Amazing dichotomy of emotions

Jake and Michael have the most amazing on-screen chemistry that makes
the viewers believe they're truly best friends and police partners. The
way the script was written allowed David Ayer to elicit an incredible
range of emotion from the viewers. It's hilariously funny during car
scenes between Jake and Michael, playing on relatable awkward topics of
sex, dating, and other things best friends would joke about, yet
incredibly serious, showing just how intense and dangerous police
officers' jobs in South Central LA can be. The use of Jake's hand-held
camera gives a Paranormal Activity feeling (without the headache) that
adds to the "realness" of the film. I highly recommend this film and
challenge anyone to not be completely moved by the end of it.
