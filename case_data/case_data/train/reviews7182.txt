Complicated and Too Convenient

As my summary title says, "Complicated and too convenient". I wanted to
like this film but as you're watching it you're more complicated by the
heist as it continues to move along. There are random characters or
scenes put in that don't really have a purpose or just extra fat that
needs to be trimmed. (Lady in the health care van??). And everything
works out to the tee. Even when someone's on to them, everything
conveniently works out. And the explanation at the end. What?? Sorry,
could have been great but script needed an editor. Good acting all
around. But, pointless, really.
