I Wanted to Walk Out

The movie had great promise. A husband dies and then comes back to
watch his wife's life move forward. How will she react? What will his
thoughts be? Who else will be part of their lives? It would have been
interesting if we would have learned what he thought about her life and
the lives of others who lived in the house; however, except for one
family who had children, we don't really know. I guess his irritation
related to the fact that there were children in the house, which must
have been his dream. Shallow and unoriginal.While most scenes were slow, two were achingly slow: the scene in bed
at the beginning and the pie-eating scene. "Just eat the pie, please."
There were two other scenes in which our ghost "communicated" with a
ghost in another house. The audience I was with laughed out loud. I
wanted them to get together to share their pain or to develop some type
of relationship. That would have been no more banal than their talk.The movie helped me greatly in one respect. I know that others liked
this movie. I have read the replies. I can't understand why, however. I
am able to realize that that makes me narrow-minded and that I have to
be careful of that.
