A Ton Of Fun To Watch

Going into this movie, I knew it wouldn't do well at the box office.
Unfortunately, that is true, due to the negativity surrounding it. It
did indeed bomb at the box office... By default, does that mean it's a
bad film? Absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I found it a ton of fun
to watch!The biggest problem the movie has is there are quite a few scenes that
seem to rush themselves. Aside from that, the characters are a sheer
delight to watch; all the cast members were clearly having a ton of fun
in their respective roles and one can't help but feel that when
watching. The music is absolutely enchanting and the visual effects are
gorgeous; one scene in particular, though barely a minute long, has a
beautiful combination of music, cinematography, and character
intensity.Fans of the source material may not like the changes they made, but try
to watch this movie with the unbridled ambition of a child's
imagination and judge the movie as a movie on its own merits first...
and who knows? You may enjoy it too!
