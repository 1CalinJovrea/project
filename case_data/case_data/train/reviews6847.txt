WarCraft: The Beginning - Review

I actually thought this film would be bad. Like most other video game
movies I thought this was going to be a massive flop and just suck.
This movie broke the video game movie curse with style. WarCraft
surprised me even though I am a WarCraft fan.If there are sequels WarCraft could easily be this generations
equivalent of The Lord of the Rings. The acting was great, the effects
were spot on and the action was epic. I was really impressed with the
motion capture on the orcs, they looked amazing. Travis Fimmel as
Anduin Lothar was a good choice. He did a really good job of portraying
the lion of Stormwind. WarCraft has a lot of lore that could easily be
made into a film series and I think this film did a good job of
establishing the world of WarCraft for future sequels. Do I recommend
watching WarCraft? Yes, WarCraft is a movie everyone can enjoy,
although it may be too intense and violent for younger children. If you
were a fan of the games there are Easter eggs for you. If you have
never heard of WarCraft you will be amazed by the world and want more.
