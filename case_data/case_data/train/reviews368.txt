Unfortunately Really Bad

Warning Spoilers!This main character is so damn stupid. Beyond any reasonable logic.
When she had a chance to kill the man who took her son, she didn't. When it's time for some cool stunt driving scenes, the highway is full
of cars. Other times when she is just following the kidnappers car,
there isn't a single car on the entire highway or 10 minutes! It's just to aggravating to watch a lead character who makes such
stupid decisions just to further the film. The stupidity continues
throughout the film.I wish someone would have kidnapped me before I started to watch this
film. Avoid it.
