Delightful Family Entertaining

The ex-villain Gru is raising his daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes and
researching a legitimate jelly and jam business with Dr. Nefarion and
the minions. Meanwhile, a laboratory in Arctic is stolen by a powerful
aircraft using magnetism. The Anti-Villain league (AVL) agent Lucy
Wilde recruits Gru to help her agency to discover who has stolen the
laboratory and its research. They know that the thief has a store in a
mall, and Gru suspects that the owner of the Mexican restaurant Salsa &
Salsa, Eduardo Perez, may be the villain El Macho that is presumed dead
in an accident. "Despicable Me 2" is a delightful family entertaining. Who can resist
to Gru, Agnes and the minions? And now, with Margo growing up and
interested in boys and the clumsy but heartwarming Lucy Wilde, it is a
great fun for the whole family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Meu Malvado Favorito 2" ("My Favorite Wicked 2")
