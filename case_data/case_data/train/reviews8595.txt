Tired, unimaginative, and sometimes laughable

Let me start with the laughable part: sorry if this sounds politically
incorrect or religiously biased but... I couldn't take a hasidic Jew as
an "exorcist" seriously at all. At least in movies where the exorcist
was a Catholic priest, there seemed to be some semblance of strength
behind the ceremony. But a man with curled locks who appears about as
dangerous and forceful as a florist just is ridiculous. No offense to
anyone of the Jewish faith.The movie starts off slow. The entire plot revolves around the
mysterious box, which somehow I found to be a total dud. The box....
seemed like a box. I never for one minute could imagine it as a
repository for a demon soul, or anything else.All the desperate attempts to create tension were so hackneyed. I found
hardly anything original about the plot. Strangely enough, as I'm
watching the movie, one thought kept racing through my mind: Ghost
House Pictures probably had 1,000 screenplays they could have filmed.
THIS was what they considered to be a "winner"? You probably already know the plot: a girl buys a box that has an evil
force inside it. Great... now what? That is the question they should
have asked before filming. There simply was nothing compelling about
the plot. It certainly didn't provide many scares. It didn't create a
realistic place we could believe in. It was very one dimensional.Exiting the theater I couldn't help but wonder: why film this junk? Did
they think it was safe? Did they think it was close enough to
"Paranormal Activity" that they'd cash in?P.S. If you read this review, please let me know with a thumbs up or
down. I'm just curious how many people read these.
