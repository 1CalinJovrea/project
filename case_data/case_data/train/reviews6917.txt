Boring throughout

The premise is sound enough (almost).Punk band invited to gig at a skinhead convention? Don't think so The
basic flaw can be lived with as artistic license, but as the narrative
unfolds, it becomes more and more incredible. The acting is sound
enough but is completely undermined by the unimaginable actions and
reactions as events unfold.I couldn't get to the end as I gradually lost interest in continually
struggling to persuade myself to ignore the gaping holes and the
mindless decision making of the characters.In the end, it's all very mediocre stuff more suited to cable TV than
general release. As the action takes place exclusively within a shed,
there's no real cinematography to ease the boredom.
