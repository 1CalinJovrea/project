Utter Disappointment -- May Contain Mild Spoilers

I totally loved the first Magic Mike movie because it was fun and
exciting and had that true-to-life sense about it, BUT this one: Magic
Mike XXL (2015) just "blows" so to speak.The story line was weak and scattered and the ostensibly erotic dancing
while agile and acrobatic was rather gross and coarse, the kind of
stuff that makes a girl feel itchy and uncomfortable -- this girl
anyway.And I don't believe this is a spoiler but what's with this business of
all women being queens and all men being kings? Kinda stupid to begin
with and overworked in this flick.Also I love Channing Tatum, and have enjoyed every movie I've ever seen
him in, but the best scene in this one -- and this may be a spoiler, I
guess -- though nothing could spoil this movie more than it spoiled
itself -- the best scene in it was with Joe Manganiello at a
convenience store.On the way to the theater, I had been telling my husband that what I
liked about the first Magic Mike movie was that it was the joyous and
fun side of sex and exotic dancing, very, sexy but not overly dirty or
pornographic, so I was excited and looking forward to this one, and
then we watched it and it was... well, it was a grueling hour and 55
minutes sitting through it...If there was someone I could ask for my money back, I'd do it.I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 for Joe Manganiello's performance and
because I love Channing Tatum.Magic Mike XXL not recommended at all. Sorry.
