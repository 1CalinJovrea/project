She's locked in this house and her dad's a psychopath.

I have to say that being British born and bred I'm not at all familiar
with Goosebumps, either the books or TV series etc, so I was going into
this film blind as it were. With that in mind I'm not really able to
review to fans of the original works.I went in with the hope of a good time, I liked the sound of the
concept, I like Jack Black and I knew it was going to be well produced
and no doubt heavily laden with the latest technological effects
(ironically I had watched the splendid Jason and the Argonauts prior to
Goosebumps, from one extreme to another or what?!).I got everything I expected and had fun without any frame of reference.
If I wanted any more I could dig out some questions that would need to
be answered, but why bother. I left at the end, as a middle aged film
lover, contented. I would for sure keenly watch any sequel if it
surfaces.Didn't do much for my Automatonophobia though... 6.5/10
