Is this the worst film ever?

This is probably not the worst film ever made, but it's not far off.Lets start with the pro's.- The acting is OK - It has the polish of a Hollywood filmNow for the cons.- The scriptIt's seriously unfunny. Kind of thing if you are nine or under then you
might like. Anyone who is in double figures should definitely give this
a miss. A big miss!If you are a fan of Miranda Heart then this film may make you smile.
Me, I find her offensively unfunny. Her involvement alone makes this
film arguably one of the worst ever.The one point that really mad me raise an eyebrow was when the over the
top cockney Jason Stathem uses the term "Twot". The writers and
continuity on this film are that lazy they couldn't even pick up that
Englishman say, "Twat", not "Twot".Very much one of the worst pieces of cinema I have seen in years and
years.
