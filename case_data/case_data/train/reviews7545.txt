a good and meaningful comedy for grown ups

This film was actually funny, but not in a slap-sticky juvenile way. It
was a comedy for grown ups in that it dealt with themes that are
applicable to 30 and 40-somethings, such as death of a parent,
fertility, running a business, divorce, etc., but it was not a heavy
film in that it was not a dark comedy. The father who died as the
premise for it was never presented to the audience, which keeps his
passing from being a sad event and allows for the levity at his funeral
to be appreciated. The film generally seems to focus the most of
Bateman's character and his relationships with others, but he carries
that role well. In fact, I thought this performance was one of his
finest in quite some time. Tina Fey was great in it too. I thought she
was just a comedian, but she can act too! (Is there noting she can't
do?) Overall, this film is worth seeing and is a powerful yet
lighthearted journey in the interplay between siblings and the event
that all 30 & 40 somethings will face at some point: the loss of a
parent. If this film doesn't get you thinking about your relationship
with your family members, then nothing will. Not to worry, the family
in this film has enough dysfunction to make you feel better about your
own.
