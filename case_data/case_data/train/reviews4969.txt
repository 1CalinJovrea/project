Birth of an Assassin

A fun action movie with a top-notch turn by Dylan O'Brien as young
Mitch Rapp. O'Brien's handling of the character's emotional arc supported the
sometimes thin plot and occasional dialog clunkers. Michael Keaton was
amazing in his first action film roll and was intense and believable as
a former Navy S.E.A.L. and infamous Covert Ops team leader. Shiva
Negar, who plays Rapp's counterpart, Annika, was the surprise of the
film and came across as believable and amazingly competent at her job.
Sanaa Lathan and Taylor Kitch also did a great job with with what they
were given, but, unfortunately, they were saddled with the majority of
the aforementioned clunkers.This movie would have gotten a 10-star rating from me if the pacing had
been consistently tight all the way through and the dialog had been
sharper. These are all highly intelligent, highly trained people whose
words should be as quick and deadly as they are.The great cast and intense action sequences still made this a winner
for me despite my quibbles, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. If you
want an action film to squeeze in between Horror and Super Hero movies,
American Assassin will fit the bill nicely.
