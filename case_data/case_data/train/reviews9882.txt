Not worth the hype... or hate.

Let me start off by saying. That anyone giving this film a 1 or 2 is
embarrassing themselves and anything they say should be taken with a
grain of salt. I'm not saying this because I like this movie, I'm
saying it because it's true. Hardly any movie in the modern era
deserves this rating unless it is shameless schlock without character
or plot. The Hateful 8 is not that movie. The acting alone gives this
movie a 6.5 because it is so good. If you were bored by this movie, I
hope you can at least admit that the people involved with this film are
extremely talented. Now, having said that, I'll get into the meat of the review. I enjoyed
this movie. However, I must admit that the main aspect of this film
(and biggest cause of disdain), the dialogue, is so prominent that it
might as well be the entire first half of the movie. When a movie is
this dialogue heavy, it tends to put audiences to sleep. However, the
cinematography and musical score is what kept me interested. I'm not
usually one to notice music in a movie, but Morricone has done an
excellent job of creating atmosphere and tension throughout this film.
Without him, it's a real snooze-fest. Not to say that the dialogue
wasn't top notch either. The lack of characters allows for more
streamlined and focused storytelling. The movie stays away from
unnecessary dialogue and story padding and focuses more on character
building. It is clear from dialogue alone what every characters
motivation is unless it is intentionally hidden. I respect what this movie tried to do and I think Tarantino succeeded
in making the movie he wanted to make. He created an atmospheric and
genuinely intriguing mystery movie with a western theme. Now, that
movie may not appeal to wide audiences and make tons of $$cash$$, but
they tried something ambitious and I believe it payed off.
