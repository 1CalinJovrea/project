worthwhile watch, good learning for all adult Americans

simply brilliant.I think production/direction, all commendable, perfect for the type of
movie. Jessica Chastain killed it - amazing work - she carried the
whole movie on her shoulders, and she be regarded highly for it.As for her character - very nicely done. there are many people who put
their career before anything, and I don't think we have many women
shown that way - though there are women highly married to their work.
there were examples like Devil Wears Prada and such, but this is
another angle, and knowing how hard female staffers on the hill work -
I think this is great to see. her hiring an escort, also a good choice
and point to make. I am not saying any of this to promote feminism nor
am I woman, this just purely independent of that whole debate.people mentioning pro NRA reviews, who try to attack the movie. sorry -
the movie is spot on, Washington is dirty and for sure, the NRA is.
they can totally destroy people's careers and I have seen the dirty
they pull first hand.
