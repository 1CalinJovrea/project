A really bad film

Director McG has many (many, many) haters, but I generally like his
movies. I don't consider him a "misunderstood genius", nor anything
similar; I just generally find his exuberant visual style and frantic
energy entertaining. I found Charlie's Angels and its sequel amusing
parodies of the action cinema; I liked Terminator Salvation for having
found an interesting angle to the franchise; and We Are
Marshall...well, that one was mediocre. Anyway, I can't defend McG with
This Means War, his most recent film, because it ended up being truly
horrible.The most important problem from This Means War is its screenplay, which
I found incredibly weak and predictable (if you don't guess during the
first minutes which one of the two gallants will stay with the girl,
you haven't seen any romantic comedy in your whole life). The humor
lacks of any spontaneity, the jokes are terribly predictable, and the
performances are pathetic, specially Reese Witherspoon's, which feels
so false and studied that I hated her character even more than the two
gallants.The action scenes lack of any suspense or emotion. There are various
fights, chases and explosions, but everything is so uninspired that I
wouldn't be surprised if editors Nicolas De Toth and Jesse Driebusch
made a confusion with the reels and included in this film scenes from
Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Knight and Day, Killers, or any other deplorable
"action romantic comedy".It's easy to note that nobody that worked in This Means War put any
effort to it, and that makes it a horrible film which I suggest you to
avoid by any means.
