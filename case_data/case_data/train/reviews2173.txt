Not Jack Ryan

It's ironic that "Jack Ryan" is part of the title for this one because
this is the furthest from the character that any of the films have
been. Beyond a some what similar back-story, the doctor soon to be
wife, and that he works for the CIA, Ryan is not Ryan. They turn him
more into a spy/field agent than the brainy analyst that he's meant to
be. As a result, there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out
from the rest of it's genre. It's just another spy movie with an over
the top villain that's plotting world domination. It's predictable and
generic. They sacrificed what made the Jack Ryan character unique. I'm not saying that the movie didn't work as some Bond/Bourne/Mission
Impossible wannabe with bits and pieces slapped together from every spy
thriller ever made. It captured successful elements from those films
pretty well. It's just a shame that they relied on recycling tired and
over used narrative when there is still a bunch of great Ryan books
that they have yet to adapt. There should be no reason to slap together
this films story when a much more talented writer like Clancy still has
more stories to draw from. I agree with Peter Travers comment "It's a
product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized
precision."Despite following a predictable formula very closely instead of the
source material, the movie still works as entertainment. Chris Pine is
great, despite the writers failing him, and he really carries the
movie. He could be a great Jack Ryan if they actually wrote the
character correctly. Branagh delivers a pretty good villain, even
though he's more suited for a Bond film. There are a couple of scenes
that deliver good suspense. It's just not a Jack Ryan movie. It seems
that they only used Jack Ryan for the brand name rather than faithfully
trying to tell a story about him.
