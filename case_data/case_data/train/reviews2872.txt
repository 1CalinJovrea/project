Very good animated film

Plot: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a
cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.This was a film that I was hoping would be good, since most trailers
can trick you these days but this film surpassed my expectations. Each
of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the
standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable
character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist
unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your
typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids
films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively
unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen
it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I
like, I just wish more of them were like this.
