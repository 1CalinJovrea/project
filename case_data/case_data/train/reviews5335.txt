A waste of my theater going dollars

I have enjoyed previous installments of this franchise and went to see
this most recent entry in 3D. Not having seen anything in the new 3D
format I felt this action movie would be the one to showcase this
technology. I was wrong. I found the 3D effects were most prominent on
the periphery of the screen and distracted from the foreground action.As far as the film itself, little plot development to the franchise
theme, pretty vapid dialog (when there is any dialog)and no character
development. I enjoy action movies but can do without 90 minutes of frenetic action
that does not really forward a story.Hollywood - Please return to story telling without all the unnecessary
gimmicks.
