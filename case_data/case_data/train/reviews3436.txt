A wonderful piece of art.

This is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other
IMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a
mistake to see this movie because it's just a "toy" movie. But that's
what makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters
throughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character
development.Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet (Chris
Pratt) who steals the show. It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem. Charming
from beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. The less
said, the better.
