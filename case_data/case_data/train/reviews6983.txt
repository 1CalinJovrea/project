What I thought of it

Full feeling of the movie: It's a good movie if you are in complicated
Romance movies. it properly shows how people find feelings in war even
if those people are an opposing force. That said there is a movie which
I feel shares similar points although being different in many ways
including country of setting, people and their relations. As this is my
first review I do not know if this is allowed but will give it a shot.
I feel this movie is very close related to Captain Corelli's Mandolin
with Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz. But there are still many
differences in the movie. And the similarities are only in the few
settings of the movie. It is worth the watch. About the reaction of the
story: I drawn to the story from the first 10 minutes. Although I felt
the male protagonist had a bit of a unimpressive introduction. as I
entered the final scene of the film I looked at running time and saw it
was almost done. The story is put well together and interesting that
you will want for more. Final sentence: Its very well worth your time to watch this movie
