9
one of the greatest morality plays of all time...

Disguised as a suspense thriller ... and with a script to die for.
Literally.Oddly I was reminded of Claires Knee (1970) a film that was supposed to
be about erotica but in fact, if you listened to the dialog, was also a
morality play disguised as something else.I will be honest -- I gave it a 9 and almost gave it a 10. That is
because as a reviewer I look for flaws -- much the same same way one of
the characters in this film first looks at a diamond.And I found none. The cinematography, casting, acting, scripting,
direction - all perfect.That such a perfect film was created to tell an abstract story will be
a loss to some viewers but a gain to others.The script, pound for pound, almost has more memorable quotes than
Godfather. I have seen a lot of films -- too many -- but will never
forget the dialog about "coincidence" or "grief." Highly recommended. A great film, but not an easy film.And as good as Fassbinder is -- and he is -- Cameron Diaz steals the
movie even with minimal screen time, using her eyes like a weapon, as
far from her role in Charies Angels as the earth is from the moon.
