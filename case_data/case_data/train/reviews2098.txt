Saw a screening the other night

So I went to this movie with no expectations. The first two minutes
seems interesting. Adaline seems like she is going to use her years of
living to provide some wisdom to the young man making her IDs. Then it
takes a nose dive from there. For someone that has lived 107 years, she
never truly experienced loss. Of course she loses her first husband but
you see that in a brief flashback that had an unnecessary narration
added to it. Then you meet the creepy stalker type Ellis. Not only can
the actor not give a believable performance, but there was absolutely
no chemistry between the two main characters. Another flashback happens
to the 1960s and we find out that Adaline loved someone else and I
thought well maybe that's what they are building too that she is still
holding on to that love. Spoiler, No that's not the case. I was really
disappointed with Harrison Ford's performance also. The whole movie
reminded me of bad SyFy flick that is aired on a Saturday afternoon.
Save yourself some money because you won't lose yourself in any
performance of this movie.
