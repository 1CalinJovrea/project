More story, less action.  That is OK!

The movie is not bad at all, not sure why everyone says it is.
Especially when the review just says it is bad and gives no explanation
other than implying there is no plot.Most of the Arnie movies are not that great, I love them still, this
one has a bit more of a story that it is following, with less action.
That is probably why every1 is down on it I suppose, it is different.There are a couple things going on with the main character, he is
trying to get to the bottom of them both. It all unfolds nicely, but it
is a bit slower than what most Arnie fans are used to. To me, that is
fine.I do not understand why anyone thinks there is no story, there is more
story than action. Could of used more time with the characters,
probably was part of what was cut from the original 3 hour run time,
but it is still a fine movie. Meaning there are much worse Arnie movies
that were more successful. This is like a better version of Eraser,
which I thought was only OK back then. Give it a shot, take it as it is
without some type of expectations, you will not be disappointed. Unless
you are not an Arnie or cop violence fan. If that is the case, then why
are you reading this?
