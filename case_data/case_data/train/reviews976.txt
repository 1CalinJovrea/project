As fake as Hollywood can be

So I know people within the music industry that have been in it for
over 20 years. I usually have access to V.I.P./backstage....So that being said, when this came out quite a few of my musician
buddies mentioned they had been around N.W.A. in those days or knew
people close to them. Their responses though were not so kind. They
mentioned quite a bit of this movie is made up/Hollywood fluff just to
sell it. So don't take this as an actually history piece, because it is
NOT. Pretty much all of them were disgusted by it. Think the real story
will ever happen? Most likely not.Sure, I grew up to their music, but I just couldn't bring myself to
finish watching this.
