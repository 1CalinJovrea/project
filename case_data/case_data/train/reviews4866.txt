A Harrowing Film with Incredible Performances!

Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a
challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But
that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the
film's hefty nature.'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from
the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy
makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good
people. But its also about hope & fighting back. Its shocking to see
the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave
mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed & often
disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son & mother escape.
The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke
down.'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is
consistently powerful & the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny
Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic,
unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly
claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.Performance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible
performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave
protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance.
The child does wonders & makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting
cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its
power is undeniable.
