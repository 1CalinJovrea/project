The Ritual: Never, Ever Take the Shortcut

Tense horror about a group of former university mates at the end of a
night out, they were generally discussing where to go on holiday next.A couple head for a convenience store to buy more booze. They discover
that the store is being robbed and the first bloke manages to duck
behind some shelves, the other is assaulted and killed, the first bloke
is too afraid to step in to help, he is visibly riddled with guilt for
doing nothing. Later the group decide to go hiking in Sweden in memory of their friend
that got killed, he was an enthusiastic hiker. The environment is harsh
and grim, there is lots of 'blokey' banter. Unfortunately one of the
group sprains their ankle and so to save time they take a short-cut
through the eerie forest. It begins to rain, so they take shelter in an
abandoned cabin.The group are picked off during the night, in the cabin and during
their onward journey by the monster. Though the monster isn't the best
design, the atmosphere was tense and I pretty much enjoyed it.
