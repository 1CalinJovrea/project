'Guardians' gives kids some holiday inspiration

Here's a fresh look at old tradition: a tatted-up Russian St. Nick and
an Australian kangaroo-looking Easter Bunny. Rise of the Guardians is
based on an original children's book series by William Joyce, who
produced the film along with Guillermo Del Toro. The books were
inspired by the author's 6-year-old daughter when she asked him if
Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny knew each other.Admittedly I was skeptical going in, but the chemistry of personalities
works wonderfully. It creates an original formula that goes against
certain expectations. Perhaps one improvement in potential sequels
would be to focus more centrally on Santa (or "Nicholas St. North"),
but Jack Frost's story is incredibly touching and I found it clever how
it parallels the antagonist's motives. The film is slow to start but
picks up at a fast pace with non-stop action. By the end, the entire
movie theater was in applause.Rise of the Guardians is a cute, adventurous, and heartwarming family
film that focuses on hanging on to the best thing about childhood:
belief.
