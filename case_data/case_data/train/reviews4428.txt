Solid acting and great cinematography

Though it is nominated for 4 Oscars I wasn't looking forward to seeing
it. The Danish Girl seemed like the typical arty-farty Oscar fare on
paper but fortunately it was better than that. The best part of the
film is the acting. Eddy Redmane does a great job but I was most
surprised by Alicia Vikander. She almost steals the movie though she
only has a supporting role. Mattias Schoenaerts is also in it with a
supporting role and I must say: that man can do just about any language
and accent and make it sound completely natural. The story was not that
interesting to me and is somewhat of a typical subject matter for Oscar
movies (that is movies about some sort of misunderstood minority and
who was the first to start the revolution if you will). That being
said, it is a very good movie, superb acting but on the other hand I
don't consider this a must see.
