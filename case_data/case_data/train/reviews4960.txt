Beautiful, sexy and sleek

I'm a sucker for a horror film that promises to be visually beautiful.
There is something about making blood look pretty and death seem
romantic that's very appealing to certain audiences. So it isn't that
much of a surprise to how much I enjoyed Byzantium. A very
untraditional vampire film that is beautifully shot and creatively
written. Although, definitely not a film for everyone, Byzantium is
filled with appealing characters, beautiful shots and a interesting new
approach on the vampire genre. It is important that you know that this
film in not fast paced nor is it as fun as an episode of True Blood.
But it is as sexy and sleek, similar to a film based on an Ann Rice
novel. I really liked this film and think most will enjoy, but only if
you like a style of fantasy horror that is both dramatically dark and
disturbingly beautiful. Please like me on Facebook! You can read more of my reviews and get
