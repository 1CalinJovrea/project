Forgettable and Boring

This movie is forgettable and boring. You keep waiting until the end
hoping it will get to the good part (the first hour just drags on and
nothing really happens, it's hard to watch) because you are expecting
excitement from what you saw in the trailer. Well, no, that doesn't
happen. There isn't a good story to tell. There isn't even a story
about strong, empowered women. I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching
it.
