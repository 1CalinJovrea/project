Tired and uninspired.

I hadn't ever watched the original series, so I had no ties to bias me
to the TV show.That said, while the characters grow to become fairly endearing, and
the film well captures the atmosphere of the 1960s as well as aspects
of the spy vs spy Cold War undertones, overall it's rather bland.I couldn't help but be mildly irritated anytime Gaby (Alicia Vikander)
took a stab at speaking German. I'm from the U.S., and took four years
of German in high school about 20 years ago, and even though I've had a
paltry handful of conversations in German compared to a native speaker,
even *I* could tell how mangled her pronunciation was; it sounded like
a muddled mess of nonsensical babble rather than the orderly and rather
crisp intonations of one fluent in the language.The final scene features the chief of British intelligence meeting the
group, reunited and having a drink on their hotel balcony. The chief
informs them they're to pack up and leave for Istanbul for another
mission. The expressions on the characters' faces, though, made me
wonder whether the actors themselves didn't think they'd need to suffer
through the making of a sequel. I hope they're wrong.
