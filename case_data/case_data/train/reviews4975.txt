Relationship, Modern Marriage and Mid-life Crisis

Pete (Paul Rudd) is a family man married with Debbie (Leslie Mann) and
they have two daughters, the teenager Sadie (Maude Apatow) and the girl
Charlotte (Iris Apatow). Paul and Debbie, who lies about her age, are
turning 40 and they are planning a party for Paul. He lost his job in
Sony and now he has a nostalgic record label with only one artist, the
British rock singer and songwriter Graham Parker that was successful in
the period from the 60's to the 80's. Debbie has a fashion store with
two employees, and she has just found an embezzlement of US$ 12,000.00.
She was poisoned by the inefficient Jodi (Charlyne Yi) and suspects of
the productive saleswoman Desi (Megan Fox). Debbie has issues with her estranged father Oliver (John Lithgow) while
Pete secretly supports his idle father Larry (Albert Brooks). Debbie
meets her father and invites him for the party. Pete comes to the edge
with the bankruptcy since he needs to sell their home and Debbie finds
that she is pregnant but she hides from Pete. In the party, Pete has a
nervous breakdown but Debbie is there to help him. "This is 40" is a dramatic comedy about relationship, modern marriage
and mid-life crisis. I believe that every viewer that is more than
forty years old and married with children will identify problems that
he or she might have lived. There are many hilarious scenes and
references to movies and shows but also moments of drama that are
immediately relieved by a joke. It is also funny because I have
recently watched all the 117 episodes (and not 114) of "Lost" in five
weeks, the same way Sadie did. Just as a curiosity, Leslie Mann is
married with the director and writer Judd Apatow and the two girls
(Maude and Iris) are their daughters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Bem-vindo aos 40" ("Welcome to the 40")
