Another chapter from "The Notebook"...only for the gullible

Aside from some terrific (if overly-glossy) bull riding sequences, this
hodgepodge of romance-novel clich√©s is riding on empty. Adaptation of
Nicholas Sparks' source material (calling it a book would be too
charitable), this drama, targeted at lovelorn teenage girls, concerns
the turbulent love affair between a handsome professional bull rider
and his university girlfriend, which parallels the one between an
elderly man (whom they rescued from a car accident!) and his wife in
the 1940s. Comparisons to Sparks' "The Notebook" are unavoidable, as
this is just a pale imitation (with Alan Alda in for James Garner,
hardly an upsell). The chemistry between the young lovers suffocates
under the plastic handling, while director George Tillman, Jr. takes
forever to get us to the finish line. A long ride, indeed. *1/2 from
****
