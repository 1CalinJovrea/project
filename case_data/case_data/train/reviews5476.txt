This movie is badass

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. I wish it had been
three hours long. And, no, I'm not a fan of the novels, although I may
dive in. But any film this decent that enrages the finger-sniffing
fanboys of the online world gets an extra star on IMDb from me.Admit it: Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are brilliant actors well
cast as the mortal opponents in a cosmic struggle of good and evil.
Telling their epic tale through the boy Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor, also
worthy of praise) is an inspired narrative device that appears to be
much of the sand in joints in the fanboys who trash the reputation of a
highly worthy film.Like Watchmen, another excellent film that irritated fanboys, The Dark
Tower is a wild ride across an action packed multiverse.I want more. Lots more.
