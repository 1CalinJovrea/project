I have always loved Vacation movies, and this one continues the
tradition of laugh-out-loud humor. There are several scenes which pay
homage to the original Vacation movie which was great to see. Fans of
Chevy Chase will be shocked to see how much his appearance has changed,
even since his role on Community ended. Ed Helms did an amazing job as
a hapless father trying to give his family a great vacation, in the
only way a Griswold knows how. Along the way he has to deal with his
own family's quirks, his extended family, car trouble, a menacing
trucker, and numerous other problems. Christina Applegate was also
great as his wife, in the same straight-woman vein as Beverly
D'Angelo's portrayal of Ellen in the earlier films. I saw this at a
preview before it was released and it was clear from the laughter that
the audience thought it was worth their time. If you grew up on the
Vacation movies as I did, I think you'll love this entry too, but be
prepared for outrageous situations and ridiculous scenarios.
