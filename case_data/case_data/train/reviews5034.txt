Drivel

I switched this film off after thirty minutes, because in all that time
I did not laugh or even smile and had started to feel a bit ill at the
dangerously pathetic attempts at humour.I like Jason Segel but Emily Blunt does nothing for me - she is just
quite dull and irritating. However, even Jason Segel could not save
this embarrassing train-wreck of a film.Just don't bother. If you do you will very quickly regret it when you
see an engagement party with some sad powerpoint presentation of
Segel's exes, with an accompanying song. Yes, because that is both
believable AND hilarious!I was on an eight-hour flight and I preferred
to switch this off and stare out of the window. That should tell you
everything.
