Vision

As an art lover I enjoyed Big Eyes because it exposes some the
complexity of inspiration and the creation of art. Big Eyes as the
title shows is about the Big Eyes paintings. But it also has the theme
of how strong women can overcome any challenge. In the 1950s it was
unimaginable for a woman to set her own course. The main character
leaves her husband and takes her child only to fall for a smooth talker
who takes credit for her art. All is OK, until she discovers she wants
to grow and not be hidden in the darkness. Along the way she uses the
art as a means to expose herself and share to the world how the eyes
are windows to the soul.
