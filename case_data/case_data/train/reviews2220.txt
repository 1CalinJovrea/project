Worst movie adaption of an anime EVER

I understand that movies can have different plots and endings than the
original anime/book but this one stripped the entire essence of what
was so great about Death Note.The characters are not at all how they are in the series. Light was a
stud, smart a sociopath genius who could manipulate and outsmart anyone
with and unwaiverable goal to be God. L is almost autistic and
incredibly smart, not emotional. He was logical and to the point. Mia
is a groupie fan girl with Light, a celebrity on her own but never
would try to kill unless ordered by Kira to carry out his true goal of
being God for as long as possible and destroying everything in his way.The scene were Ryuk appears makes me want to puke it is so bad, his
relationship with Light is far from what we see in the series, the plot
is plain stupid. IT is mostly about him and his gf fighting whether
they took it too far him and him being dumb enough to know his gf
didn't take the book and kill some cops. I hate this movie so much and so mad I spent whatever time I spent
watching it because it is not worth even 5 minutes. Whoever made this
should be ashamed and never produce a movie again.
