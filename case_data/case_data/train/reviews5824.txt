This used to be call porn.

Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a
serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to ..
Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine
line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent.
Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead
tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the
book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i
missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man
had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond
understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I
know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by
a perverted man.
