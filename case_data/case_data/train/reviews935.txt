Utterly awful? Hell yeah!

'Need For Speed'... more like 'Need For Better Acting, Directing and
Writing'. Actually, describing this film as needing 'better' acting etc
is an understatement. Seriously! If you think this film is good; you
are either ignorant, 10 years old, or clearly mentally capped to see
through the utterly awful writing. This film is painfully predictable;
to the point where its anything but entertaining. Staring at a wall
would be more worthwhile. The exacerbated speeding coupled with the terrible flaws of the
story-line simply makes me think WTF were the actors/actresses
thinking! Clearly they wanted to better their careers but come on! The
worst thing is that their will probably be a sequel. DO NOT GIVE IT YOUR TIME.
