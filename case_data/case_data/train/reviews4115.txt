THIS won an Oscar?

For me, a complete and total waste of money and time. My friend fell
asleep about 20 minutes into this self-indulgent piece of tripe. This movie strains so hard to make itself 'important' and
'groundbreaking' that it never stops to see that it has been done
before by Masters such as Woody Allen, Hitchcock and any late night
black/white '40s movie.The 'plot' is as old as the hills. Man is successful but inwardly
unrewarded. He has also rejected his family in search of California
movie gold. So, he wants to redeem himself and try his hand at serious
theater. Throw in a disturbed and rehabbed daughter, a long-suffering
but understanding wife, and a producer pulling his hair out because the
'play' isn't a success and you've got all you need to know.The rest is a montage of suspected hallucinations, maybe suicides "who
knows?" and you're left feeling empty, cheated and angry because you
know somebody's trying to be nouveau and special but simply missed it
completely by being too insider and artsy about the whole thing.Do not waste your time. If you want to see what theater and Broadway
are all about and need a laugh, watch The Producers with Zero Mostel
instead. If you want deep, head scratching drama that goes nowhere, go
ahead, pay up and watch this nonsense.And, I might add, Michael Keaton, to me, was trying too hard, had few
acting chops and it was embarrassing to watch him in this. He, like the
character he played, was trying way too hard.
