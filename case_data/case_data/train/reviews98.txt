Perfect chemistry Berrymore and Sandler is back

After a couple of very bad recent movies, finally Adam Sandler did what
he is doing the best. A family movie with kids, holiday and Drew
Berrymore! it is almost impossible for a movie to be disappointing with
these two. The jokes were funny, the kids were acting really good,
musics were great. I saw the movie with my family and we all enjoyed
(as Sandler fans) movie. His a few last attempts were really bad movies
but this time he got it right again. And that's why I feel sad about
all the bad reviews this movie has. Because some people are hating it
just because they didn't like Adam Sandler's last movies, and they are
ready to be automatic haters. Well if you like Adam Sandler (at least
his 50 first dates, click era) you'll love this movie. I also loved the
parts they used from earlier movies
