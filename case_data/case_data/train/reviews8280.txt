War, and watching 'Fury', is hell.

It is hard to put into words just how loathsome a movie 'Fury' is. The
self hating writer/director must have correctly calculated that any
WWII veteran of the European Theater must be in his or her's late
eighties by now, thus avoiding the real potential of one of them
slapping the living scheisse out of him for this atrocity. It begins
with a ridiculous scene, is of the war movie genre that demands German
soldiers running upright and without cover toward machine guns so our
anti-heroes can mow them down conveniently, and consistently opts for
opportunities to shove the new hip narrative that lovingly depicts
American soldiers as murderous, war crime committing, raping thugs.
See: 'Inglorious Basterds.' Much of it is hard to watch, especially
after 'Saving Private Ryan' which set a high bar for any war movie
following, the rest is drivel. And, not even good drivel at that. High
marks (pardon the pun) though, for the German soldiers surrounding the
tank, who stop firing for inexplicable reasons, but which coincide with
long discussions on war and friendship by the tank crew.
