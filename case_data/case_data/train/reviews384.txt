No point and no plot

I'm a huge fan of the zombie genre, I'm a huge fan of Arnold..when I
saw the trailer for this I was quite excited, what could be better? It
looked like a dark, thought provoking, unique take on outbreak/zombie
films. It was also refreshing to see Arnold in a more serious role.The movie started a little slowly, it didn't seem that scary, but I
figured it would get better... I kept waiting, and kept waiting, and it
didn't get more interesting, it didn't get more scary, it didn't have
any real plot or thoughtful story line to speak of.... and then it
ended. When the credits started rolling I thought, no way, there has to
be more. Awful waste of time, I'm astounded this has any good reviews. Just
awful.
