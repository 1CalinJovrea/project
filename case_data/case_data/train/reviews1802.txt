Colossal waste of movie goers time.

Outside of the misleading poster and synopsis of this movie, it is
nothing but miserable, poorly scripted, acted and produced. It's a
story of a couple of alcoholics, period. Anna Hathaway is far from a
decent actor, and this film fits her caliber of acting, shoddy at best.
If you're looking for a depressing and emotionless movie, and you're
into a crappy plot with meaningless side story of monsters destroying
South Korea while the main actors ponder their pathetic lives through
insults, sarcasm, violence then this is for you. Truly colossal heap
of....
