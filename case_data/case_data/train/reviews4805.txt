An extended Apple advert...

This is a bad film.I can not begin to describe the displeasure this film gave me because I
get more annoyed as I try, being reminded of different aspects as I go.The absolute nadir of the film for me was the following.There is a scene, and this is not a spoiler, in which the protagonist
throws an ipad out of a window. That alone should be enough to raise
some form of suspicion, something that people in this film universe
seem to lack, but no... Instead it's a great scene for product
placement."WOW!" Exclaims the protagonist "These are durable!"At that point I got very angry, both myself and another person shouted
in anger at the screen.Do not watch this film.Ever.If you do their marketing team will think it's a success and they'll
make more.
