No sympathy for stale stereotypes

Jasmine lives the privileged life of a socialite in her sumptuous New
York apartment - until her handsome, smooth-talking husband is exposed
as a philandering real estate fraud and commits suicide in jail,
leaving behind a mountain of debt. In an attempt to recover from this
setback, Jasmine moves to San Francisco to live with a despised sister,
who has been reduced to cramped rental properties and blue collar
Italian boyfriends.The film's narrative unfolds through hackneyed plot devices, and is
populated by the usual collection of generic caricatures that pass for
real personalities in Woody Allen's cinematic universe. It's hard to
feel much sympathy for Jasmine since she's a neurotic, self-absorbed,
self-pitying snob who patronizes ordinary people in the same way that
Allen does. While upending her sister's life, she proceeds to make
another mess of her own, as she drinks too much vodka, whines about her
misfortune, pops pills and tells lies to a promising new romantic
prospect. Neither comedy nor drama, 'Blue Jasmine' is about as tasty
and nutritious as a stale cupcake.
