Magical!

This movie is just magical! The message of the movie genuinely touched
my heart and spirit, it was breathtakingly gorgeous! The colors, the
cinematography, the costumes just wow and love the music! The only
thing i would change is i would love it more if there's singing..Lily
James have a very sweet mezzo soprano voice i love her singing "A Dream
is a Wish" at the end of the movie. And yes The acting was so good i
cried like so many times..my fave was Prince Kit and the King's
scene,Lily crying when her dress was ripped and the first dance oh god
it was magic! and the gown transformation was so epic! The lead actors
chemistry is so strong.. i fell in love with them. This movie is so
uplifting makes me do kind deeds every time! People saying it was
boring have a heart of stone for real. This is Amazing and i can't wait
for Beauty and The Beast.. Well done Disney!ðŸ’™ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’‹
