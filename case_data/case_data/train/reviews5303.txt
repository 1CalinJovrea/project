worst movie ever

This movie is one of the worst movie i every watched, This movie is
about a loving foster father who work hard to provide for his family,
he gave them love, food and shelter. Until one day the biological
father (Fun Dad) came out of nowhere, he took everything from him, the
children, the house and even his work. This show isn't really a comedy
as i don't even find this movie with a pinch of funny. So glad i didn't
pay to watch this show, this is more of a tragedy than a comedy. The
foster dad,i had never seen anyone so clueless, what's worst the end,
the biological got another super hot wife. Moral of the story, don't
bother about your children, let someone take care of it, than come back
and take everything back, god isn't going to punish you. Sorry i
watched only 40 minutes of the movie and i forwarded to the end, the
front is horrible the ending is terrible. Its like the movie is not
even funny and they are trying to squeeze out the funny.
