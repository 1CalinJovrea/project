Strong Effort

Very strong directorial effort, coupled with a great musical score,
that reminded me of the original score from Assault on Precinct 13.
Very taut and tense. I have a problem with loud music that makes it
difficult to hear the dialogue, thankfully this does not suffer from
this, in fact the music underlines the dialogue rather than intruding
upon it. I am fed up of straining to hear what is being said when the
music is crashing all around. Strong performances from all involved.
The only reason it was marked down was due to the interaction between
captor and victim was limited and it would have been much more
immersive if this was explored further.
