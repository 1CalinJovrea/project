Not worth my time

Low budget "reality" horror film that is disturbing at best but not
worth the 90 minutes I wasted watching this trash. It starts out slow
and I almost turned it off after 10 minutes. I stuck with it and it
never really improved. I'm not a big fan of the "documentary" / reality
style films and this one fails miserably. There is potential but it
seems like the director ran out of money and just threw something
together. The story is poorly developed and there's really nothing
substantial or gratifying provided by this film. The sudden ending puts
to rest a film that never should have made the play list. This won't be
getting a repeat performance.
