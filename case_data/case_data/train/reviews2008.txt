9
Quite realistic...

Why do I give it a 9 out of 10? There are several reasons: a) It's
quite realistic. b) It's very close to what really happens (as far as
the public knows today) c) It's in general well made. Why not a 10 out
of 10? We know that the SAS trains with live rounds, as it was shown in
the movie. But their targets wouldn't stop the projectiles. During
their practicing in the bus the bullets would hit the target, go
through, hit something else and from there on they would be
unpredictable. No one would sit behind those targets and just watch the
training. Same applies for the "house" made of wooden frames and
fabric. bullets go through, nobody in the hanger would be safe.
