A Fantastic Commentary Above the Understanding of Many

This film is not a normal movie. It is an acid trip work of art. Korine
is truly brilliant, somehow creating a work that is both luscious and
devoid. Fantastic acting throughout the lead roles, highlighted by
Franco's truly amazing performance as Alien, extends the movie further,
and the portrayal of the characters is definitely more important than
the actions. The movie not about Spring Break. It isn't about robbery.
It is about emotion, change, and the beauty that comes from apathetic
destruction. It truly is more of a psychotic documentary than the drama
that it is made out to be, and the result is beautiful.However, there is a significant divide in the perception of this film.
It caters intentionally to those who see film as an art form, but it is
also unintentionally perfect for the inevitably simple masses who just
want to see hot women and violence. The problem is the middle: people
who are somewhat informed, who aren't controlled by their baser
instincts, but also aren't as experienced in critiquing or
understanding movies or art. Those people will inevitably hate this
movie, seeing it as just another wasted, trashy, teenage movie, instead
of noticing the painful beauty that echoes throughout.This movie is one of the finest films produced in the last decade.
