I cried. Twice.

It's been a while since a trailer threw me completely. The intent of a
trailer is to entice the viewer in to seeing the film, to tickle your
curiosity. The trailer for The Book of Henry did this admirably. Like a
magician's sleight of hand, it provided misdirection too. Having seen
the film, I left thinking that that was not what the trailer implied.
Hats off to  editor, Kevin Stitt.The plot synopsis on IMDb.com, written by the distributors, Focus
Features lays out the plot without spoilers:Sometimes things are not always what they seem, especially in the small
suburban town where the Carpenter family lives. Single suburban mother
Susan Carpenter (played by Naoimi Watts) works as a waitress at a
diner, alongside feisty family friend Sheila (Sarah Silverman). Her
younger son Peter (Jacob Tremblay, who we last saw in Room) is a
playful 8-year-old. Taking care of everyone and everything in his own
unique way is Susan's older son Henry (Jaden Lieberher), age 11.
Protector to his adoring younger brother and tireless supporter of his
often self-doubting mother - and, through investments, of the family as
a whole - Henry blazes through the days like a comet. Susan discovers
that the family next door, which includes Henry's kind classmate
Christina, has a dangerous secret - and that Henry has devised a
surprising plan to help. As his brainstormed rescue plan for Christina
takes shape in thrilling ways, Susan finds herself at the centre of it.This is Colin Trevorrow's second feature and he has crafted a warm,
charming, sometimes despair-filled film that ultimately brings a
message of hope. Good triumphs over evil in the end, as it should in
most films.  Critics have been very harsh in their reviews. Some decry being
emotionally manipulated! Is that not the whole point of going to see a
film? Audience reactions are more favourable.My reaction? I cried. Twice.A very enjoyable and competent film: 3.5 out of 5
