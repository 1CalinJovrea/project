Don't listen to the hate!

Right, i'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I went to see
this film the day after its release. If i'm honest, I didn't have high
hopes as part 2 was such a flop. This is not the case for part 3! Personally, I thought this was a film of two halves. The first half was
extremely funny and had me laughing throughout. The second part
summarised the film, whilst lacking in the volume of the comedy, it was
still present. I definitely would recommend anyone to go see this and
judge it for yourself. Personally, I am going again in the next few
days, that is how much I enjoyed it! I thought it was better than part
1, but that is my opinion. Go see it for yourself and you will see what
i mean!
