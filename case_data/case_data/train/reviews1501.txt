If you thought "Eyes wide shut was bad ........."

Initial half hour of watching created a reasonable level of
anticipation and possibilities of where the film was going to go were
certainly firing off in my imagination and my wetting my appetite to
watch more.However, the plot disintegrated very quickly (like over a cliff) and
storyline melted into complete nothingness.Imagery tries to create an air of surrealism but fails. How the hell
Jake Gyllenhaal signed up for this one is beyond me? A real waste of
time! And by the way, last scene of film attempts to re-create a Blair
Witch type moment but makes me wished I had gone to watch that paint
dry on my recently painted bedroom ceiling.
