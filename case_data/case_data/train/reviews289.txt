I have never done a film review before but after seeing American Sniper
I thought i would share my views on what a brilliant film this is.American Sniper is a biopic about the "legend" Chris Kyle (played by
Bradley Cooper). Kyle starts the film as a wide boy cowboy, but then
realises that he wants more from life and joins the American Seals. As
this is happening he falls in love with his wife to be Taya ( Sienna
Miller). This is where you start to see the beauty of the film develop.
His love and passion for his country, and his endless-love for Taya is
portrayed perfectly from Eastwood. Kyle ends up doing four tours in Iraq with over 1000 days in service,
away from his wife, and the three children that came over the 5 years.
Out in Iraq Kyle become known as a "legend" with his deadly aim with
the sniper rifle. You see Kyle become ever close with his comrades. It
was rumoured that the Taliban put a bounty on Kyles head of $180,000,
you can only imagine how deadly his rifle was. After each tour you see
Kyle with his family and you can see that Kyle is struggling to deal
with civilisation, becoming very jumpy and hearing noises that he had
in Iraq. This is shown in a few teary scenes between Taya and Kyle.
Some very heart wrenching moments. This showed what any military
personnel would go through when tore between love and duty of serving
their country.The film ends with Kyle getting honourable discharged and starts to
rebuild his life with Taya and the children. You can get the tissues
out for the last scene!I am ashamed to say that I didn't know this was a true story before
watching this film. This is news that should be heard worldwide, not
the latest selfie taken by the Kardashians...
