This movie was ridiculous, where do I begin? Well in the beginning of
the movie all you see is a half naked woman on the screen, instead of a
powerful introduction to make the plot stronger.That was the biggest problem with the movie. There wasn't a strong
enough story to make it a drama. I didn't cry once. I farted instead. I
love Danzel Washington, but the movies plot was horrible. I did not
even feel any sympathy for the main character who was a drunk cocaine
addict that was a pilot. The plane crash was barely 20 minutes and the entire movie was mostly
revolved around a prostitute no one gave a sh*t about and drugs. I felt
like I was watching intervention 5 times. Where was the drama? I thought the movie would have a deep past for
Danzel Washington's character but it didn't give enough to satisfy me.
All it was in the movie was the crash and him doing cocaine and
drinking. Yawn. I don't get why the co-pilot's wife in the movie was an annoying
religious woman who's only line was "praise Jesus!" How freaking
annoying. Go to hell! This movie shouldn't even have a good rating it was a let down.
