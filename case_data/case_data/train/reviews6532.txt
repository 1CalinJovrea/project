Epic fail...

Honestly this movie scares me, the fact that it has a score higher than
6 makes me afraid that this is the future of comedies, targeted for the
new generation. I was hoping to see a Superbad style movie but this one
is just full of absurdity, completely unrealistic, everything feels
forced and absurd, the dialogue is just ridiculous... I don't
understand how these good actors accepted to star in this massive
garbage of a movie... huge disappointment...
