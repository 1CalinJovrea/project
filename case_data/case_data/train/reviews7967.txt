No No No! How can this be a 7.6

Disney have produced some fantastic marvel films throughout there
takeover. Ironman 1 and 3, Thor, and the avengers were awesome. They
don't try to be the dark brooding DC films, they cant be, they're of a
larger scope, more comprehensive in appeal. They're packed with humour,
action, and riveting twists, and as a whole capture the characters spot
on ie Downey jnr. This however, does not. This film is saturated beyond
humour with joke after joke after joke. Thor has his lighter tales, but
malekeith is a darker adversary, brooding and malicious. Thus the plot
should reflect this. Yet this film kept joking and joking, so much, I
didn't care about Malekeith, he didn't seem that menacing at all. He
butchers millions...yet the humour detracted from that beyond belief.
The twist in plot from Loki is its saving grace, as is Hiddlestone's
acting, hopefully Thor 3 can recapture that which was Thor.
