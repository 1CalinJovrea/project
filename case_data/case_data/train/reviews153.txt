Horrible movie

Not to give too much away but the story is weak and can be summed up
with this equation:4 GI Joes - 3 ninjas = 1 movie you wish you'd never seen!!!My wife and I sat and waited for action, and waited, them waited some
more... It finally came like my brother melting my Duke action figure
with a lighter and Aqua-Net. Horrible plot, good special effects, and a
stereo-typical ending. The next DirecTV add will say cable is worse
than... Sitting thru GI Joe 2.If you don't believe me, waste your money, then contact me for an "I
told you so!"
