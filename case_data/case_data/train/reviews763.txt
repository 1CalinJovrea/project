Very scary and well done

Lights out really is a great modern horror film. It offers great
thrills and also offers wonderful acting. Every actor did their job
beautifully and the characters they portray are well constructed, they
are not just surface level, cardboard cut out characters. The visuals
are good, the darkness and the creepy eeriness effect of a lot of
scenes work very well. There are some scenes that may even be somewhat
hard to watch because of the utter creepiness. Diana and the visuals
that make her up are done very well and the horror is real here, it's
not cheap or cheesily boring. The opening of the film is also very
effective in its attempt to be truly scary. This movie isn't very gory
or overly grotesque either, it has a minimal amount of blood/gore, and
some violent images, but not a whole whole lot, which it good and a
wise decision by the filmmakers, because if a scary movie is too gory
or overly disturbing, then it can be distracting from the plot. You
want people focused on the plot of the movie and on what's going on,
not on the ridiculous amount of gore. Lights out receives an 8/10 on my
scale.
