2 hours of HELL...when 1:20 would have still been terrible

I don't know what to say beyond how boring and unoriginal this movie
is. A mortal with secret powers, a hidden past and memory, sacred
inheritance, demons possessing the living and so on and so on and so
on. Apparently people from other dimensions meet in dance clubs to have
supernatural battles between good and evil?The hero as I will unfortunately call him was a casting tragedy. Where
do they get these people and why do they think we will relate to them?
Hollywood I have news for you. REAL tough men and women look NOTHING
like 90% of the people you cast in these teeny bopper movies. Real men
and women coming from hardened backgrounds look at these idiots and
dislike them from square one. Brainwashed, pop culture consumers
destine to be yuppies with absolutely no frame of reference on the
other hand well, they will swallow anything you feed them.So 2 hours later, we get a clich√© ending where a girl with a drop dead
gorgeous face and body with as much curve as a ruler hops on a
motorcycle with a supernatural warrior who has a face that is a cross
between an Easter island statue and Napoleon Dynamite. I point this out
because these actors will come back to haunt us in future movies and
possibly television shows. If you're going to make superstars out of
nobodies for starring in crap, why not go the full monty?Be as superficial as you possibly can! Because in the end, it's all
they can bring to stories this unoriginal and boring and their entire
careers are destine to be full of these lousy movies and television
shows or TV guest appearances. I suppose if I were 13 the special
effects and action scenes would be all I need to have helped get this
movie rated over a 6 when it's clearly a 2-3. My 1 is an attempt to
bring balance...and REALITY to the IMDb's corrupt rating system.
