A Stunning, Wonderful Movie

Kenneth Branagh did convinced us with a fresh retelling of this
Disney's 1950 masterpiece with a heart and soul.Lily James did a good job of portraying Cinderella, best part is Cate
Blanchett in which she delivered a stunning performance and at the same
time, can do scene stealing too.Still, there are flaws within this movie, they still need to convey
more depth as there are things in the movie, it get too cartoon.
