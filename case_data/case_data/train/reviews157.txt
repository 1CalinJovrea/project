Great Entertainment

Captain America continues where it left off from the first movie and
the Avengers.Chris Evans did a good Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four and does an even
better as Steve Rogers.The movie is fast paced with lots of action that keeps you glued to the
screen. New weaponry, spectacular fight scenes, introduction of new
characters and possible love interest for Captain America.Jackson, Evans and Johansson put in some good performances and the
chemistry between characters new and old was good, very believable.There is a strong emphasis on trust in relationship for all the
characters and a sprinkle of political interference which was developed
throughout the movie.The film has the customary spectacular ending which does not
disappoint. There are some flashback done very well. Good surprises,
twist and turns, which you probably wont have anticipated.This film is a great addition to the Captain American franchise and is
vastly superior to the Thor and Iron Man nonsense.I cant wait for the next installment of Captain America
