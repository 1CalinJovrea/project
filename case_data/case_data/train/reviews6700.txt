Berg and Wahlberg make another heartwarming film about true events.

Director Peter Berg delivers another solid flick based on true events,
and this might be the best one yet. Good characters, who other than
Mark Wahlberg, were actual people. From Kevin Bacon to John Goodman to
Michelle Monaghan, all actors were at their best. And the decision to
use actual security footage of the bombers from the events gives a good
sense of fear of the actual events. I find the flaws being the actor
playing the older bomber, as he wasn't an interesting character, and
J.K. Simmons felt miscast.
