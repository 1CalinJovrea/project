The art of ripping off fanboys

A soul-less, seen a thousand times formulaic piece of crap especially
designed to sell toys and empty those pathetic man-child fanboys's
wallets. Everybody seems to agree nowadays that the force awakens was
at best a re-hash of a new hope, at worst a very boring and mediocre
marketing scheme. Remember when it got out a year ago and everyone was
super excited and enthusiast? Same thing's going to happen to these
2hrs of bore printed on celluloid : wait for the hype to disappear, be
honest with yourselves and acknowledge that this piece of crap film is
just another fanboy scam, especially designed to rob kidults of their
hard earned cash. Then watch the ratings drop to a more realistic 5,
tops. And -surprisingly-, this farce is presently rated above 8. In 6
months, no one will care. So please, childish people that can't read
and that don't watch movies that got out before 2k because they don't
have computer graphics in them, try to stay objective when rating a
film. Or better yet, spare us your "opinions", and don't even vote at
all. Thanks in advance.
