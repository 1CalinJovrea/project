To see the world. To find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.

I saw an advanced screening of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" last
night. To the right person, this movie is life-changing,
life-affirming, and truly beautiful. No, the narrative isn't perfect.
The script isn't perfect. There are narrative flaws and stretches of
the imagination, but this movie is about stretching the imagination.The concept - of an underachieving dreamer finally discovering the
world - is something most of us can relate to. Accompanied by a truly
beautiful soundtrack, Oscar-worthy camera work, and the surprisingly
able acting of Ben Stiller, as well as an accompanying cast which
includes Adam Scott, Kirsten Wiig and Sean Penn, among others, this is
heart-warming and truly special.
