Cute Movie

The term Duff - I have never heard of that term. Maybe it exists in
society or maybe it was something that Hollywood made up. I'm not
positive on that.So The Duff translates to (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Which is the
friend that is less attractive than the others in that particular
CLICK. It touches on some very real LIFE facts hidden in the story. CYBER
Bullying, Social Media, Clicks, Stereotyping, Awkwardness and just the
meanness of high school in general.I felt like this movie was a cross between She's All That and Easy A.
It was cute and funny. But it was very predictable.Mae Whitman was a great choice for THE DUFF. She is great with one
liners and usually plays the girl that is a bit odd, different or just
does her own thing. And she always plays it well.And of course this movie has Robbie Amell who is very nice to look at.
I think a lot of teenage girls would really like this movie.
