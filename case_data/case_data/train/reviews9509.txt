SEXIST! Travesty to be avoided

Awful. I love the original Ghostbuster. There was chemistry between all
the characters. But this movie is horrible. The 140 million dollars
would of been better spent on the homeless that this travesty.The jokes are dull. The acting is dull. The men are mindless dunces,
while the women are sexist brainiacs, that objectify the men. The black character is a typical stereotype angry, abrasive and rude. Avoid it. The ghost are all the same green glow. Waste of time watching
this on dvr.The story is a rehash of Ghostbusters II, where an evil man wants to
bring ghost to destroy and take over New York. I enjoyed dental surgery more than this nonsense.
