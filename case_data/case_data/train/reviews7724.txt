Nostalgic, Colourful, Joyous CinemaScope Magic

Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a
nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his
masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull
off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is
anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films
under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big
thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and
musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films
like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'Rebel
Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so
seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least,
after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped
them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is
bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning
with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum
up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los
Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I
have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would
typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my
favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see
in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic.
