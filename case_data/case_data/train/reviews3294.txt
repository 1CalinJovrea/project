Abbie Cornish let the film down.

The film had lots of potential but in the end was not perfect. There
were strong characters in the real life drama. In most cases the actors
were excellent and very convincing. One of the important characters is
the award winning BBC journalist Kate Adie. Unfortunately Abbie Cornish
did not have a convincing accent and did not portray Adie in the
correct standing. It was a chance to highlight Kate Adie's
groundbreaking journalist work for British TV. Unfortunately Abbie
Cornish's casting spoiled the film for me.
