Wasted ambition

The Osiris Child gives a strong feeling that at some point during the
production the team realised there were no new ideas in the story or in
the world-building or in the characters, somewhat deflating their high
ambitions and resulting in a choppy ride when quirky editing choices
and unchronological order attempt to liven up the seen- that,
been-there proceedings.This doesn't succeed to save much, though, as buying the story depends
on buying its monsters that are done with genuine 1980s rubber-suit
quality. Maybe the original intention was to give the film a vintage
vibe but if that was the case it fails to translate on the screen,
leaving the main story driver outright ridiculous and sinking whatever
was still afloat.If something positive needs to be said, Kellan Lutz is trying harder
than he has ever tried, and next to the monsters he is the less
distracting one.
