A serious disappointment

First, I want to say that I loved the LOTR trilogy. The spirit of the
movie is close to the spirit of the books, even though the action
scenes are more dominant in the films.The Hobbit has a completely different spirit than the LOTR trilogy.
Though I am adult, and the Hobbit is considered a children's book, I
enjoy it a lot. I have read the book a couple of times and listen to it
(as an audio book in Swedish, with a very talented reader) and it is
just a wonderful journey.Both the story-telling and the story itself has a great number of
intricate and humorous moments. With Peter Jackson's talent of making
the LOTR trilogy into the three movies I had great expectations of the
Hobbit movie. Unfortunately, PJ has just made another LOTR-movie which
has very little to do with the Hobbit.In my point of view, the greatest moment of the book was when the
dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf visited Beorn. For the movie, I just couldn't
wait to see how PJ had tackled the big hassle Gandlaf had to introduce
all the dwarfs to Beorn. In the book, he had to introduce them two by
two, during a long period of time. Just to make Beorn comfortable with
so many visitors. PJ left this wonderful scene and changed it to an
action scene, where the company just sieged Beorns house and didn't let
him in. That makes the film story to something completely different
than the book.Then, I was curious whether the company would be served by animals, as
they are in the book. That could have been a challenge, and PJ didn't
take it, but placed a normal cow and goat in the kitchen and living
room.If you are around 13 years old, never read a book and obviously not the
Hobbit, and love to play Grand Theft Auto - this might be a decent
movie to watch. Otherwise: skip it.The only positive thing with the PJ:s movie being so bad and so far
from the book, is that there is room for a REAL The Hobbit movie in the
future!
