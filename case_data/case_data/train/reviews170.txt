Very different from the books and just a major disappointment

My daughter and I had read the books. Fans will be disappointed because
the film deviates from the original story so much, it is surprising
this is called an adaptation. The peculiar children as an example were
not all portrayed as written and some were even missing. My daughter
kept asking why this child or that child were not there? Miss Peregrine
is also not portrayed as she was in the book. I could go on and on. Acting fell very flat and characters were void of emotion except for
one scene where Miss Peregrine shows sadness. Jake in the book is
humorous and sarcastic but also had some serious feelings to contend
with about tough choices. Absolutely none of this was translated to
film. The ending was confusing, entire story rushed, and anti-climatic. Also, for 3D lovers, there is almost no 3D effects. There are some at
the very beginning which were great, but then the rest was like
watching a regular 2D film! Save your money for the DVD or Netflix!
