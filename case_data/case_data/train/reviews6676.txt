the typical cliché-ridden paint-by-numbers production

We all have seen "The Hit-man's Bodyguard" a million times over. From
the lame script to the weak directing, this film is the typical cliché-
ridden paint-by-numbers production we are all so familiar with.The film is too violent for children and too shallow for adults. I am
sure this film will find it's target audience though. Gary Oldman keeps a straight face throughout the film. This guy never
disappoints not even in a lame stinker like this.Among all the recent netflix productions "The Hit-man's Bodyguard"
sticks out like a sore thumb. If you are a fan of fast paced action
films go watch the trailer instead and skip the actual film. Thank me
later.
