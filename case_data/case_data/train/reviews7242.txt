Fast & Furious Delivers Another Stellar Installment

Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriquez, Tyrese
Gibson, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and Kurt Russell return to the Furious
franchise with Charlize Theron, Hellen Mirren and Scott Eastwood added
into the mix.I pride myself as one of the biggest Furious fans, while at the same
time knowing when a movie will be great or be a bust. I was into this
series the very summer the original came out in 2001. 'Fate of the
Furious' isn't better than 'Fast Five', 'Fast & Furious 6' or 'Furious
7' and it isn't worse. It's right on par with the greatness and
excitement of the second half of releases in the franchise. Paul Walker
and Jordana Brewster's absence is felt, but it doesn't hurt the movie
as Dwayne Johnson's increased hero role fills the void. Expect all of
the twists and turns that the previous movies have thrown our way. The
type of twists that make you change how you see the franchise as an
entirety. Like when you realized Letty wasn't really dead, when you
learned Letty and Dom were married at a previous time or that Han was
killed intentionally by Deckard Shaw and it wasn't just a typical car
accident.The most intriguing aspect of the film is the role reversal of Vin
Diesel and Jason Statham. It's like seeing two all-star players traded
for one another and now those two teams are playing. It really mixes up
the movie and makes you guess and think. It's also an angle we haven't
seen in recent films. Charlize Theron is a dark and vicious villain who
constantly keeps increasing the intensity in the film. All of the car
scenes are exciting and right on par with the finales seen in recent
installments.
