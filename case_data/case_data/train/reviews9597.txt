Tense Thriller

The American engineer Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is expatriated to
Southeast Asia to work in the water plant of his company. He travels
with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and their daughters Lucy and Beeze and
befriends the English Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) at the airport. Nobody
from his company comes to take Jack and his family to the hotel and he
accepts the ride offered by Hammond with his local friend Kenny Rogers
(Sahajak Boonthanakit). Soon Jack notes that the television, telephone,
Internet and cellular do not work and the front desk explains that they
are facing problems. On the next morning, Jack walks to the market to
buy a newspaper, he discovers that there is a revolution in the country
and the rebels are executing foreigners. Now his only hope is to reach
the American Embassy with his family. But the rebels are everywhere and
Jack does not speak or read the language of the country. "No Escape" is an extremely tense thriller with a great storyline of an
expatriated family that are surprised by a rebellion in the country
where they have just moved. The tension is intense and the viewer that
has been expatriated along his professional life will probably be more
impressive with this film. The cast has wonderful performances and it
is easy to understand the reaction of the annoying Lucy if the viewer
is a father or mother. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Horas de Desespero ("Desperate Hours")
