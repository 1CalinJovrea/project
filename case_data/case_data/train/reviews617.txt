Met High Expectations

"The Giver" is one of my favorite books, my eighth grade self could
feel the emotions of Jonas as he received his first memories, cringe as
his friends became unscathed by murder, and in awe as he watched a
colorless apple turn red. The movie explores the concept of losing
touch with emotion- in a way that was better than I expected. I thought
my fantasy of making "The Giver" come to life exactly as I had imaged
it would take hold and send me wining about how "I could have made a
better movie!" Well, it did give life to the book, although it was
through different ways (like a kiss, the nursery for babies, or a
punch)- ways that were more appealing to an audience visually. I do
wish the red apple had been the first color to appear- oh well! I was a
little sad at not keeping the sense of complete mystery as to what
happens to Jonas's town after he crosses the border of memories. Also,
frequent flashes of memories distracted me at times (like what am I
watching again?), but they did give insight into Jonas's onset of new
thoughts- the movie would feel bleak without them. It seems I left the
theater believing in the necessity of feeling all emotions, and
relieved for the fictional society of no memories having to deal with
life itself! A thought-provoking movie I am glad to have seen. After
all if you can't feel, what's the point?
