Introducing a new icon of the action genre...

I'd never read any of the Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' novels so I went in
with no particular expectations about the portrayal of this character.
But this film can certainly live up to ANY expectations thriller fans
might have had of it, in my opinion!Having seen Tom Cruise as the flamboyant, charming and somewhat Boy
Scout-ish Ethan Hunt in the past, its refreshing to see him as someone
almost as ruthless and taciturn as Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's
rendition of James Bond. Jack Reacher's appeal doesn't lie in the fact
that he's a 'larger than life' figure, or the world's biggest
bada##...it lies in the fact that he's a normal, perfectly relatable
and very realistic human being, albeit a trained and skilled soldier
and detective.Rosamund Pike does a great job as the lawyer, Helen-a far cry from
glamorous 'Bond girls' (one of whom Pike herself has portrayed), and
Lara Croft styled action heroines who normally populate the action film
genre. Instead she's a three dimensional character with her own doubts,
anxieties, convictions and flaws.One of the great things about this movie is how, without wavering from
its narrative, it does highlight several significant real-world issues;
ranging from the political debates over gun control, to legal
representation for terrorists, to the politics surrounding the actions
of military personnel overseas, to the corrupt political-industrial
nexus...without necessarily taking sides or trying to come across as
being preachy of moralistic.To sum it up, Jack Reacher is virtually a 'slice of life'
piece...albeit, a very dark and grimy slice of life.
