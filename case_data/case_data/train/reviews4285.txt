Not a rom-com

I really don't understand people who think - oh the characters are
flawed, ugly people inside so I don't like it. Really? Are you seven
years old? Do you live in Disneyland? Do you know anything about life
or the human condition? Who. are. You? Anyway, I loved the film. It was
not perfect, but definitely excellent for a first time director. Some
issues: the jokes were so fast and tight that I would miss one while
laughing at another, the sound mixing seemed cheap, and the rehearsal
dinner scene had one of the most unfunny moments in the movie in it.
Overall though the film felt honest, which is what I value most in a
film. If you must compare the two I found Bachelorette to be all wit
and pathos, while Bridesmaids was all fart jokes and vanilla.
