Waste of star power

Seriously! Is it that film, which earned Worldwide $346,147,658(source:
http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=xxx3.htm)? I think, the
producers (Vin also one of the producers) may be thought that casting
some stars from Worldwide will be making this very good flick. Well,
it's actually does in some cases, if the plot was good and director
know how to get good performances out of his actors. In my view, in
this movie what I see, I see a waste of stars power. Actually, there is
no twist in this movie even I saw the twist coming a mile away. Boring!
The cinematography was so bad in some cases. CGI When a film uses too
much CGI, it stops being believable, truly! But I think it needs to say
that, the action sequences was good specially Donnie Yen's action.
