Pretty Damn Good

It's fair to say that the movies which have been walking away with Box 

Office numbers this year have been either big superhero movies or big 

sci-fi movies. If you're wondering whether or not you should go and see 

this film because it looks like something a little different DO IT! 

This is a film, regardless if you already know the story, which 

delivers excellent acting, excellent moments of tension and excellent 

use of emotion which ,when you leave the theatre, won't be difficult to 

feel at all.



Now if you're still considering whether or not you should go and see 

this film, let's address the rumours you might have already heard:



1.There's been a lot of talk about Tom Hanks potentially claiming 

another Oscar - yes he simply HAS to be up for contention after this. 

True in the first half of the film he doesn't necessarily have to be 

all out emotional, but he does enough so that when we reach the second 

half and ultimately the final act, we are in as much shock and awe as 

the character of Richard Phillips through watching his performance.



2. A few people have said "too much Tom Hanks." There's two sides to 

this: Obviously he's going to be in the story a lot because he is the 

star BUT he doesn't give the only good performance here; the Somali 

pirates are truly terrifying, not just because of what they are but 

because their characters have a lot of uncertainty making them very 

unpredictable.



3. Some people are saying it's overrated and we've seen it all before. 

I'm not claiming its the greatest movie ever made, but what I am saying 

is its definitely worth a look.



So if you're worried about wasting some cash don't be, it's definitely 

a film you won't regret paying for.
