10
Not the disaster they make it out to be.

Having read the worst reviews about this film, I went into the cinema
expecting to be bored and annoyed by what they are calling a disaster
and a flop. However, even though I sincerely do not expect anything
great from Shyamalan at this point, I found it a bit hard to believe
that Will Smith would fall so low, so suddenly and make a very bad
movie. I wanted to decide for myself and I am glad I did. The film was
quite enjoyable, it had a fair amount of action and emotion, balancing
the two quite well. It is by no means a great movie, the likes of which
we're used to expect from Will Smith, but this is not his movie, it's
Jayden's and it's not a bad one for the younger Smith. Of course, he's
not too mature as an actor, but if you don't expect too much from him
and the whole thing, you don't get disappointed. I believe the whole bad feedback about this movie comes from the fact
that it was directed by Shyamalan and that Smith senior was not the
main star. If you get past the fact that Shyamalan's previous offerings
were simply horrible and alleviate the pressure of performing as a
blockbuster, you'll find that this was actually a decent movie. I would
rate it 7 out of 10, but because I feel so many people out there have
been unfair to it, I will give it a full 10, just for the heck of it.
