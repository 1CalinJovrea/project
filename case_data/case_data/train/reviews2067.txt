Stands Out

I don't write reviews very often but because of the low ratings this
film was given by users, I decided to let you know what I think.This was an excellent movie. Plain and simple. It was filled with the
perfect amount of action and drama. I thought the acting was very good
and the storyline was phenomenal. I found myself getting attached and
feeling for the characters and at some points, I was even in tears. It
upsets me to see that so many users only gave Savages a one star rating
and a bad review. The movie was rather bloody at parts but all in all,
it was an outstanding movie. Savages was definitely worth the two hours
and eleven minutes I spent watching it.
