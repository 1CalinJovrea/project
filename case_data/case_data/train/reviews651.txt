Not a favorite.....

Probably the worst movie I have ever seen.... Only finished it 'cause
we paid for it. Zero fluidity, very poor storyline... Full of holes,
hard to follow, cheesy boring script. Attempts to include moral life
lessons and love stories were entirely unsuccessful . R. Hall was
horrendous - trying to mix-up her ditsy slut role by adding a bit of
drama to her acting did NOT work. We chose this movie based on Bruce
Willis ' and Catherine Zeta Jones' involvement . It is shocking they
were willing to associate themselves with this film. They were OK in
their roles with what they had to work with .... Crap. Do not watch
this movie. Life is too short.
