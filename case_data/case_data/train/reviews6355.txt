Soooo close

What the heck? Look...this movie simply needed to be edited better. A
lot better. The gal who kidnaps the cop...is she into it? Or was she a
brainwashed captive from his past? The details guy detective....we get
introduced and then never see him again? What about the boss of the
development company? He plays no relevant role in this movie? If he
subscribed to the video of this private "ring" THEN I'd be impressed
with the twist of it all. They took what could have been a pretty good
6.8 IMDb review movie and trashed it to a 5.8. Sure this has been done
before...I loved the landscaping trees bit. Clever. Not sure why the
rest of it wasn't.
