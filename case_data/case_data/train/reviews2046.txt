A Really Bad Movie.........

My daughter told me this was a funny film, so I watched it. I will
never trust a teenager again. I forgot that teenagers will laugh at a
fake willy joke every time, and this film does the same. Showing a male
member is faintly amusing the first time, but by the fifth time it's
just boring. I made myself sit through the last hour, because I had
hoped it might improve. It doesn't. The first ten minutes are by far
the best. It drops off a cliff after that. Puerile, profane, badly
acted, ham-fisted and just really unfunny. The dialogue is appalling,
the action sequences are ludicrous and the obsessive swearing just gets
old very early on. Don't watch this if you have a mental age older than
six. Adam Sandler would be ashamed of this movie. Avoid........... no,
seriously just don't watch this tripe.
