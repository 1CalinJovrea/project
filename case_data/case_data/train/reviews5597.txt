A little generic & predictable but a movie that will keep you laughing and extremely entertained the entire time.

"Ten years, thirty countries no one finds us out and we can't even last
a week in suburbia." Jeff (Galifianakis) and Karen (Fisher) Gaffney are
a normal suburban couple with an average non-exciting life. When a new
couple moves into the neighborhood they become friends with them, but
the new couple has a secret. Now Jeff and Karen are put in the middle
of a deadly high stakes deal with no idea what they are doing. First
thing I have to say about this is that the movie is really funny and
entertaining. There really isn't anything all that new and the movie is
a little cookie cutter, but the acting and jokes make it seem fresh and
exciting. The chemistry between all four of the actors is almost
perfect and really helps the movie a ton. This movie won't win any
awards or become a classic, but it is hilarious and I laughed
throughout the entire thing. That is what a good comedy should do. I
would compare this to Central Intelligence. You pretty much know what's
going to happen the entire time, but you can't stop watching and
laughing. Overall, a little generic and predictable but a movie that
will keep you laughing and extremely entertained the entire time. This
is a great watch. I give this a B+.
