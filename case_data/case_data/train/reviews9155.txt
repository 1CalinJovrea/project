Let JJ Abrams and the lousy writers go ruin Star Wars

Viacom/Paramount have got to pull the JJ Abrams team (writers Damon
Lindelof, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman) from the next one ... anyone
could do a better jobFirst and foremost the Abrams team did not make Star Trek either with
their 2009 film or this one, and if they get to do the next one after
the under-performance of Into Dreckness it won't be until 2017 that it
sees a release since Abrams, et al, are off to do what they do to the
Star Wars franchise for Lucas and Disney*Spoilers*Into Darkness is a typical action-adventure Mission Impossible kind of
thing (it's what Abrams does), but this one is even more hackneyed and
grasping than their first effort. They don't respect the source
material and couldn't come up with any ideas so the reverted to the
Plot Scrambler again and trot out an amalgam of forger female
characters and a stupid new secret society found only in the novels and
comic books and long after the audience has figured it out reveal that
Brit actor-of-the-moment Benedict Cumberbatch is indeed
KKHHHAAAAAAAAAAANNN The stupid brewery is still there as if Abrams wanted to thumb his nose
at those who called him out on how dumb it was the first time ... and
that idiotic little rock-monster sidekick is still aroundViacom/Paramount ... quietly let the deal the for the 3rd installment
by Abrams and his team go kaput and hire Dean Parisot to do the next
one since he's arguably done the best one already anyway (GalaxyQuest)
