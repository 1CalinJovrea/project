Great buns, shame about the script

So many elements that could have made this a truly original movie.
Instead it's confusing, meandering and ultimately pointless. Alex
Pettyfer, the innocent entering the world of male strippers has a good
face a great body but lacks life, yes, that's it, he's kind of
lifeless. Channing Tatum, whose story, apparently, this is, has a body
that seems to have been shaped by a genius, but a face that looks
slightly unfinished. I didn't get his character at all. As an actor
Channing tries far too hard. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest
and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. So, all in all,
entertaining and little, very little else.
