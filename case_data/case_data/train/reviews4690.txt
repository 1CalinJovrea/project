Judi does it again

What an amazing movie, Judi is as usual, such a wonderful actress
portraying Queen Victoria once again. The story line is fantastic and
it flows beautifully. This would have to be the best film for me this
year. I love how they made this film so funny, and yet so touching. I
laughed and I cried all the way through.
