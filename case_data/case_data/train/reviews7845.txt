Empty calories, mainly due to poor direction

Imagine if Spielberg had directed 'Godfather' and Coppola had directed
the Indiana Jones movies. Both great directors, but it wouldn't have
worked.Same thing applies here. Like the first two in this franchise, 'Da
Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons', there's just something terribly
wrong with the direction. Yes, the Langdon movies are suppose to be
fast paced, but if almost no scenes are allowed to breathe, does it
matter? And why do director Ron Howard keep on insisting insulting my
intelligence? Like in the first two, many things are explained twice,
so even the dumbest one in the audience knows what's going on.Then there's the blatant mistake of shooting the movie in standard
widescreen, instead of cinemascope, like the first two. When you make a
movie with several visually looking fantastic locales around the world,
it SCREAMS cinemascope. And the best park of the book? They completely changed it. Guess they
wanted to avoid any controversy.Hans Zimmer's score was great, as usual, though.The first two Langdon-movies are hovering at 6,6 on IMDb. So will this
when the dust settles.If the studio decides to make 'Lost Symbol' and - for once - have a
Langdon movie getting great reviews, they should probably hire another
director.
