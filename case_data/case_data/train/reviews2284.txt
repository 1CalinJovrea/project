Hilarious 2👍👍 up

This movie was absolutely freaking hilarious!!!! Leslie Mann was
awesomely funny. Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton were funny as well.. I
absolutely love Nicki Minaj character Lydia!!!...The men in the cast
were great, and then the "Legend wait for it Dary"***Barney Stinson
Voice*** Don Johnson as Cameron Diaz dad.. Wanted to see the 7o'clock
show but it was sold out and went to the 8o'clock show... This is the
one best chick flicks in a long time...You can't always go by others
reviews, you have to see our for yourself!!! This is definitely worth
the money..Hopefully they can make a sequel... Will definitely see it
again and buy it when it comes out on DVD!!!👍👍👍👍😄😄😄😄
