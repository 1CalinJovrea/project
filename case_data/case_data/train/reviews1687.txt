Expected more than routine story

Need For Speed (movie) is such a routine movie. Sir John Gatins (writer
of movies like "Real Steel", "Flight" and "Need for Speed") I have a
classic story where both leading actors will be in space with many
other astronauts. Unfortunately, the spaceship they are traveling in
collides with a massive rock and all of them die, except the lead pair.
At the end male actor dies leaving the female actress with a couple
oxygen cylinders. She survives and the later is history. Sounds similar
to "Titanic" but complete different locations and new actors. Same
happened with NFS."Need for Speed" - same old story. One of the lead actor's friend dies
in a car accident and later for revenge and power they race at the end.
New cars, New faces and new locations doesn't make any difference to
"Fast and furious". One black guy in your team. What next? You will
have an Asian guy in your sequel who is more intellectual than the lead
actor. Wasted my break. Ohhh yeah, forgot to mention the acting skills
of Mr. Aaron Paul. He is no different to Mr. Ram Charan (telugu actor).
Not in look-a-like way, but in acting way. Same expression for every
shot and hardly shows his facial expressions. I wish I had lots of
money. Would have made "Need for Speed" myself and acted in it as a
lead actor. Enough said.
