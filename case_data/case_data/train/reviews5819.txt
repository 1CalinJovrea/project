Not a Documentary!!!!

Check the genre of this movie, it says SCI-FI, which stands for science
FICTION!! If I watched every sci-fi movie expecting it to correlate
with real life physics then there would be no point of the genre. All
these bad reviewers seem to be on the more intelligent end of the pole
but isn't cognitive enough to realize they're NOT watching a
documentary!!!! This is a good sci-fi movie, which kind of lets you
imagine what you could do if you knew everything and could do anything.
Obviously It's not possible because you would have to break the laws of
physics to even get near that point but it's still good to wonder.
Worth a watch if you like the genre.
