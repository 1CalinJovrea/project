Cheesy

It is so cheesy than I cannot even believe how I kept watching...
probably hoping another ending and due to the photography and music.
Seems Hollywood, as it is: could even be Disney. Into the wild was
totally different and have a good script. Even if it is a true story,
read the damn biographies: is so so easy... did she actually walk for 3
months? how many miles did she do by car? Furthermore, all the
beautiful sentences comes from books. She just add one and seems like a
heroine? I miss so so much the true feelings of Into the wild and also
the respect for the true story. My God.. and the ending... Movie for
people who will never hike!
