Touching story reminding us what life is all about...

Goodbye Christopher Robin touched me personally and helped me to
remember what life is really about. It touches on the trauma that can
affect those closest to us. It shows how hard and long those times can
affect our lives and those around us. The casting and acting was spot
on for me. I could relate to the characters and could relate to their
situation. It reminded me in some ways of "Finding Mr Banks", but touched me more
deeply. There are movies you go to watch to escape the real world. This
was a movie that helped me to remember what is important in this world
and feel better for it. It was touching, heart breaking and had times that all parents can
relate to. In the end it showed me how important it is to spend time
with your children.It is a movie I will be adding to my collection.
