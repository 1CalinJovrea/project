Good family movie - Minions

I avoided watching Despicable Me for a long time. I just didn't like
the look of it. But as it turned out, I loved the film when I was
eventually coerced into seeing it by one of my nephews. It was thanks
to him that I also liked the second movie. As for the third movie, I
don't know why some IMDb users are complaining that this movie is more
suitable for 'kids and families'. It seems odd to expect anything more
from The Minions when that is the main target audience! I watched this
film with my own family and since this was the first time I took my
toddler to the cinema, it makes it extra special. I enjoyed the movie,
laughed out at several points and liked it even more to see how much my
daughter loved it. We all had a good time and there were no complaints
at all. This one, like Despicable Me 1 and 2, was great entertainment,
lots of villainy and slapstick humour. It is the best kids animation
I've seen in a long time. A lot of fun.
