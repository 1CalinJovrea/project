Deeply Funny Political Satire!

Now I'm not the one for politics and in fact, I despise politics on a
whole. However, I found "The Campaign" to be a wildly funny affair.
There is plenty of over-the-top humor here to satisfy comedy fans and
of course the big laughs here involves a certain conversation around a
dinner table as well as a baby. As a political movie, the film plays it
pretty safe as both the Left and the Right are only moderately poked
at.Jay Roach, known for his brilliant work with Austin Powers and Meet the
Fockers, returns to direct this film. Cam Brady has been a North
Carolina congressman for several terms now and is on the verge of
securing another term. But, he ends up running against a Marty Huggins,
who happens to be the candidate no one expects to be running for
office.Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis are both very funny here and they
seem to feed off each other's energy. This is Ferrell's funniest film
since Step Brothers and he just has scene after scene with end up as
laugh riots. Galifinakis is really good too despite being somewhat
type-casted. But the golden moments are when these two are on screen,
going at it with each other.Overall, this is a really funny film and funnier than I anticipated. I
tend to avoid political films, but since this film has no agenda rather
than to poke fun at politics, I was all for this. My fear was that the
trailer gave many points away, but be prepared for some unexpected
jokes. This is a very funny movie. I rate this film 9/10.
