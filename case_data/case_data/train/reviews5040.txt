Good promise that doesn't end into anything

This film is okay if you have nothing better to do. The cast, first of
all, are beautiful and performing well. The story starts out
interesting, but is developing very slowly into something that you'd
expect to a be big revelation, while the romance is developing quite
nicely.But after waiting to the end, there's practically nothing revealed.
This will get two additional stars from me for the revelation. The six
are for the cast, direction and overall production value.
