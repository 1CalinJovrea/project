Bond with and IQ of 2

I went into this movie blank.I had never seen any trailer, or read any
of the reviews about it. But I was bored throughout the entire movie.I
felt i was watching one of those 60-70's bond with the dated lines and
the tiresome old clich√©s.And they are endless. As someone else in her
put it,you feel like you're watching Austin powers instead.
************warning
spoilers************spoilers*****************spoilers I mean you
understand from the very beginning that his new boss is working for the
enemy. And when the bad guys always find him wherever he goes,you
sort'a know right away it's the tracker MI6 put in his body,that helps
the bad guys. I felt I was watching a kid movie,with a plot written by
a dilatant. Go watch true lies instead,much better movie,with better
action. After watching this I get why Craig is tired of bond,cause this
script is really bad
