I don't usually write reviews but this was such a disappointment that I
felt I had to put something. Most of the good jokes were shown in the
trailers, so if you've seen the trailer then it's probably not worth
the money. There were 3 of us watched this and although we all loved
the despicable movies none of us enjoyed this. My son (11) said it felt
like it was 2 hours long it was so boring. I can't really explain why
it came across as so poor - but it just seemed really lazy and without
Gru to play against the Minnions were just to simple. It was slapstick
with no soul. The music although quite good didn't really seem to fit
the film - just seemed to be tacked on at bit were they felt they
should have a soundtrack and a famous song. Buy yourself a copy of
despicable me and watch it again and again. Much better value for
money! This just felt rushed, with loads of stock jokes, maybe hoping
enough of them would hit the mark - they didn't.
