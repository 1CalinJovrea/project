Nothing fascinating here.

So i gave it a try today and here i am presenting with my very first
review. :D After watching the movie, I felt like perhaps i expected a
bit more b'Cox of the trailer and the fact that the film could have
depicted more of an adventurous theme rather than flowing along the
clich√©.The special effects were too obvious to pick at, the slow moving and
dead story-line fails to engage the audience throughout the movie, no
surprise element is there to indulge the par imaginations with the
"giant world" {I wonder why they did not showed the world above and its
inhabitants the different way, something that will flabbergast the
viewers when they meet the giant world}.. Though i must admit that the
movie had had some good parts, reason why I'm marking it 5 out of 10.My advice = Go and watch if you're full of boredom and have no choice
but this movie, otherwise save your time.
