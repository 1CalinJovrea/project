HIlarious & Ridiculous

So, seeing Russell Crowe and Ryan Grosling on the cover of this film
ehhhhh, I wasn't sure how I would like them on this film together. I
mean, the two just didn't mix with me. But they almost reminded me of a
duo like Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys, except raunchier!
So this story is about two characters, Jackson Healy(Crowe) and Holland
March (Grosling) who are both private detectives who go on a hunt for a
missing girl. Now, these two weren't work buddies. March was hired by
the missing girls aunt to find her, but the missing girl hires Healy
for him to STOP trying to find her. In the midst of everything, Healy
is confronted by a couple of thugs who want to kill Amelia, so he
decides to team up with March to find her together. NO, this was not a
happy pair. March only cared about getting paid and also had a sassy
daughter to take care of where Healy is still bothered by his divorce
from his cheating wife. There are tremendous funny parts in this movie
that will have your stomach hurting and asking yourself what would you
do in the situation and glad it wasn't you.
