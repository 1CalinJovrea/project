Portrays the dark side of the religion while maintaining the suspense until the end

I am so glad I took the chance to watch it before premier. This movie
may not have "the most unexpected ending"-factor like other top
thrillers.However, the great acting and the setting manages to keep
that thrill alive until the end. As pointed by others, it is not suitable for faint-hatred and you may
encounter some violent scenes which may make you feel utterly disgusted
but this makes the film more realistic and leaves you craving for
justice. If TV-series like Game of thrones, Outlander, West World intrigues you
this will as well.
