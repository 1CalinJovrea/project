The Best Movie I have seen in years

I have watched the Jason Bourne sagas for years. James Bond movies have
been a mainstay since I was in my teens. Ben Affleck, as an actor, was
average at best. With that said, I was somewhat skeptical when the
trailers were first released about "The Accountant". My curiosity got
the best of me. So I went to see it at a matin√©e. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!
Every question raised in this movie was answered by its conclusion. It
was so entertaining and creative. I LOVED IT!! The audience applauded
at the end while the credits rolled.I had to go see it again, because I missed some nuances. When I saw it
the second time, again the audience (a different group) applauded at
the end. GREAT MOVIE!!!I might see it a third time. Can't get too much of a good thing.
