Wasted 90 minutes for nothing

Bad story, bad direction that makes you find out the mistakes that
don't make sense.simply, it is a perfect movie for teenagers :)I just registered to IMDb to give the movie worst rate cause it is
really over rated!!!!!!I'm shocked that it has 6.9 as an overall rate.guys, you really don't want to waste 90 minutes for on the movie.I think this movie will give Dave Franco a bad reputation. What a
difference between this movie and Now You See Me. The trailer of the movie is awesome but the movie itself is bad.
