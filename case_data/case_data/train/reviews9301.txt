I've seen stencil graffiti with more depth than this

If you want to see a painfully unoriginal and unengaging story of
paint-by-number characters getting at it in the green room for 90% of
the time, go see this movie.The most deplorable thing about this movie - aside from the plot being
an incoherent mess - is the way the villains are portrayed as
caricatures, and the good guys as saints who can do no wrong. I don't
know about you, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic
psychopaths with no real motive or character, I lose interest in the
story.tl;dr lots of CG, completely two-dimensional characters and a plot that
could've been auto-generated with a smartphone app.
