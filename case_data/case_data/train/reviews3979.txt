I liked this movie, mostly. Two things I found) that kind of bugged me about this film (the first
of which an earlier reviewer made note of also) was the fact that "Rex"
was so obviously reacting solely to cues from his handler---the handler
being just off camera. Maybe I'm being too picky, but I was sorry to
see that Kate Mara and "Rex" had so little chance to interact
naturally. The second thing is a bit silly, perhaps, and I am wondering if anyone
else noticed this: Where the heck is Rex (and where is "Bruno") in the
credits? I tried to find Rex's real name in the movie credits, on IMDb
and elsewhere online and could only find "Movie Dog." Is this kind of
weird over-protective identity concealment really necessary?I don't think I've seen any animal-starring movies in the past few
decades wherein the animal actors weren't credited. Call me crazy, but
I'd kind of like to know what Rex is called in real life. "Rex" is
definitely a gorgeous and accomplished actor, I must say, and I would
like to see more of him. It would be nice to know "who" he is. Are we
going to see him in any other movies?
