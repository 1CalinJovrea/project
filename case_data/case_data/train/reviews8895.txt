Wretched Mess

I thought this was going to be a fun and slightly scary
paranormal/monster/romance, sort of like the Twilight series. Instead,
I paid for the privilege of getting bludgeoned with Cultural
Marxist/Politically Correct orthodoxies and bigoted anti-Christian
stereotypes. A few examples: 1.) Christians are loathsome, vile
stereotypes, but sorcerers/witches ("casters" in this movie) are fine
folk. Christians ban books and loudly and obnoxiously pray to be
delivered from "heathens," rather than reaching out to non-Christians
with love and compassion. No scenes of Christians praying silently over
a sick child in the ICU, or donating time and money to Christian
charities which have made the world a vastly better place. 2.) Small
town folk are ignorant, backward, close-minded dead-enders, but New
York City is heaven on earth. No mention of the possibility that
small-town people might be eager refugees from the toxic taxes,
crowding, murder, rape, theft, and moral relativism of the modern
American metropolis. Finally, there is the fatal plot flaw (spoiler
alert) of the "casters" is this film being immortal, yet one of them
gets shot and dies at the end. I don't get it. Don't waste your time or
money on this wretched mess.
