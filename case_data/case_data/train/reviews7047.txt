There's beauty in misery.

My 2nd Italian film, my 2nd hit. Gomorra type level (movie and TV show)
and hope the new show on Netflix with the same name be at the same
level. Well, where I'm start . . . these movie was so good that even
the sex scenes between Sabrina and Filippo worth the time. And I'm not
a fan of pointless sex and nudity on movies, but even that type of
scenes where beautifully filmed in Suburra. I don't know if it's a
combination between the dramatic music, the facial expressions of both
of them, the surreal beauty of the Italian cities, the beautiful way
the movie was filmed or even the great style the italians have to
personify people that work on the underworld and corruption. If you're
a fan of mob-style crime dramas, I truly recommend these movie and if
you don't know yet the Gomorra TV show, give it a look (my favorite TV
show produced out of Hollywood) and better than a lot of overrated
American TV-shows.PD: That bed conversation scene between Sebastiano and Sabrina was so
sad and lovely at the same time.
