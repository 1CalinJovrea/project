Pointless remake of a pointless movie

The 1990 original ( original ? haha) was not as good as we think we
remember.At a time when the cinema needs to refresh itself and stop
reworking old stale ideas..we get this ...utterly pointless.Bad screen writing here..less than 1 dimensional at best and the acting
is pretty atrocious in all honesty. The first 5 minutes made me wonder
if it was gonna be any good...I could not foresee a movie go downhill
so quickly...the ending was so daft I could hear people saying "What"?
in the theatre.Not even the addition of Keifer Sutherland could make this any less
silly. Direction was lame and lazy...I get the idea they thought they
were going to cash in..I also get the idea they are very much mistaken.Rush release on DVD I would think to cash in before people catch on how
bad it is. The story is really , really silly with enough plot holes to
take the wind out the story. Bad at best gave it a 3 because I'm in a good mood.
