Straight Up Gangster Movie

The Iceman a biopic based on New Jersey hit-man Richard Kuklinski who
managed to murder at least 100 and possibly up to 250 victims in a span
of almost 40 years.Michael Shannon giving a strong performance as the hit-man with the
calculating and creepy demeanor of a psychopathic killer with no
conscience who can still flip the switch back to his life in the
suburbs with wife and kids. Yet a shade of subtlety and pathos in his
portrayal of Kuklinski that we can actually identify and take some
interest in his struggles. With the exception of Winona Ryder who fits
seamlessly as naive suburban housewife (and the 2 daughters) very
unlikely to feel sympathy for the victims with the exception of one
senseless killing. Mostly wiseguys, mostly scumbags. We're not all that
mad at Kuklinski for the nasty stuff he's doing. Ray Liotta a can't miss as a minor mob boss, all the acting first rate
and the characters real. But the Iceman story is told without ice and
without chasers, a gangster flick without sentiments real or phony
thrown in. Viewers hoping to draw insights or conclusions from all the
dead bodies might end up disappointed. The 'Iceman' moniker from his
practice of freezing bodies to confuse the time of death.My biggest question for Kuklinski would be, how do you get away with so
many murders, so many different methods, places, people over a span of
almost 40 years? In the true crime shows the perp makes one little slip
in his only perfect crime and ends up in the slam.The movie is what it is because I don't think there's all that much
complex or new in a Kuklinski to learn. Abused growing up, turns to
sociopathic super bully behavior as an adult to get what he wants and
to survive. No genius but smart enough to know when to turn it down out
in the suburbs. Kuklinski was an usher at mass every Sunday. They
should have included that in the movie.
