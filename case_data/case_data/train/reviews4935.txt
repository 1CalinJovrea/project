A Decent Comedy! Ferrell & Galifianakis deliver Superbly!

Jay Roach's 'The Campaign' is A Decent Comedy, that offers genuine
laughs in the goings-on. And, Ferrell & Galifianakis deliver Superbly! 'The Campaign' Synopsis: In order to gain influence over their North
Carolina district, two CEOs seize an opportunity to oust long-term
congressman Cam Brady by putting up a rival candidate. Their man: naive
Marty Huggins, director of the local Tourism Center.'The Campaign' is undeniably funny, I laughed & enjoyed myself. The
film serves its purpose. Chris Henchy & Shawn Harwell's Screenplay is
funny & crisp. Jay Raoch's Direction is satisfactory. Cinematography &
Editing are alright. Ferrell & Galifianakis are up for vie top honors. The Comedic Veterans
are hilarious in their respective parts & go head to head from start to
end. Among the supporting cast, Jason Sudeikis is first-rate. Brian
Cox, John Lithgow & Dan Aykroyd are excellent. On the whole, 'The Campaign' works.
