Gritty but unrealistic hocum and very silly final scene.

OK, lets face it. We are over movies where one American kills 20
Germans who seemingly can't hit the wall of a Barn. They were big in
the 1950's, and 1970s, but not any longer.Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period
vehicles, settings and costume. The acting is good, but it is let down
by tow things.Clichéd characters. There is the tough commander, the new kid, the
slightly crazy guy. There are a lot of clichéd characters here.Unrealistic battle scenes. Seriously I just switched off in the last
scene. 20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an
immobilied Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes. BUT 200 CRACK SS soldiers
can't destroy a tank with its tracks off, sitting in the middle of a
road????? The tank only has machine guns facing forward, so most of its
sides are unprotected. Germans are carrying bazookas, but instead
choose to shoot the tank with machine guns, which would not do
anything? Seriously, one of the silliest, most unrealistic scenes in
any war movie. Really spoilt what could have been a good movie.
