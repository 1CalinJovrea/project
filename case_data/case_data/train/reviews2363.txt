Historically Accurate

Where did they get all of these props. Almost everything was
Historically Accurate down to the clocks, German Hanomags SdKfz
(Armored Cars), clothes, Uniforms. Whole City of Extras. The Street
Cars, not something Modern CGI can do. Having been to Czechoslovakia
"back in the day" still did not look like this 1930s to 1945,
Czechoslovakia used to make some of the best Chrystal Glassware (cut
crystal glasses), that I still have.By having all of these authentic props this added lots of credibility
to the movie. During the being there were only the early Panzers
(tanks) this movie had those.Asymmetric Warfare (Guerrilla Warfare) always has repercussions as the
U.S. Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) later found out doing
similar Missions at Occupied France and other NAZI Occupied Nations.Never could understand why anybody would kill themselves instead of
taking out as many Enemy as possible, until shot and killed. Killing as
many Enemy while saving the last bullet for yourself sends the Enemy a
different kind of message. For quite a while Operatives have been
trained to shoot themselves in the left or right eye, not the temple of
the head (not 100 percent assured death).The animosity between the German Army (Wehrmacht) and the SS is
displayed briefly. Many do not realize the hatred of the SA
Sturmabteilung and the SS Schutzstaffel with the SS massacres of the
SA, as depicted in this movie.This Movie should be shown at German Gymnasiums (High Schools) as part
of German History.
