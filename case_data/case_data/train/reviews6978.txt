Waste of time

Spoiler: this movie is the equivalent of gargling dirty toilet water.
I'm so tired of the same stupid back and forth, predictable as always,
flaming garbage bag fire movies. I've never left a review and had to
set up an account to do this. That is how stupid this movie is. I would
rather watch a movie of someone peeling an orange with the fire alarm
going off for 2 hours then ever watch this movie again. Seriously,
don't waste your time. Read a book, watch literally anything else,
start a fight club with your neighbors in your back yard. Go to the
store and buy 12 pizzas, some pizza rolls and make 47 tacos and sit
outside and watch the grass grow. It will be far less annoying and more
entertaining than watching this. You would have more fun power washing
your small intestines.
