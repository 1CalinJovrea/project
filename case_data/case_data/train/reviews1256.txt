Tim Burton has come back from the dead

There was a time when Tim Burton was systematically churning out great,
original, quirky movies that endeared him to the general public and
earned him a large amount of die-hard followers who hung on to every
last idiosyncratic trademark. These followers have had a particularly
hard time these last few years, ever since Tim Burton started to spoil.
True, he was still using all of the unique little devices that made us
love him, but his heart was not in the movies, and they all turned out
commercialized and soulless, the cool "Tim Burton-ambiance" mocking us
by hinting at how good he used to be.I'm glad to say now that has all changed."Frankenweenie" starts by showing the audience the ordinary life of an
extraordinary kid called Victor, a young boy with no friends, but a
burning passion for his specialist subjects (horror movies, film making
and science), a childhood that will surely resonate with both Tim
Burton and the majority of his fans. Then, to the surprise of no-one
who has seen the poster for the movie or heard the title, his beloved
dog dies, and Victor conducts an experiment to bring him back to life,
รก la Frankenstein. From that moment, everything gets deliciously out of
hand and grows into a classic "there is an imminent problem at hand
that we need someone to deal with before this all goes down the
toilet"-movie that we all love.While the movie does not really develop its characters deeply and
sometimes drops certain plot lines we would have liked to see more of,
it makes up for it tenfold with the thing that Tim Burton has more of
than anybody else: imagination. So many moments in this movie are truly
original, clever and, best of all, funny. "Frankenweenie" is a giant
tribute to old horror flicks, set against a sweet story of a kid and
his dog. It will find its way into the great list of "Must see
childhood movies" and will remain there for the ages, much like his
previous hits "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "Edward
Scissorhands". I'm giving it a very high rating, not just because it is
a great movie, but because it is proof of that Tim Burton still has
great things inside of him, that might well be brought back to life one
dark and stormy night.
