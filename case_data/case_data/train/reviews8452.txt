Godzilla

In my opinion, this movie was insane. Godzilla was not really that much
in the movie, but when he was he kicked ass!I don't understand people bitching about the movie wasn't like pacific
rim. I liked Pacific rim, but i think it was a good idea to make
something different. This monsterfilm is much more realistic, and is
much, much better made (CGI). In my opinion Godzilla was way better
than Pacific rim.Bryan Cranston appears in the trailer like he is the main character but
he dies in the beginning of the movie, which i think is really
misleading. He's son takes the spot, and must travel from Japan to
U.S.A to get his family away from the danger. The son (Ford Brody) is a
very boring character because we don't see him so much and he doesn't
seem very sensitive.In the end Godzilla actually saved mankind and just go in to the ocean
and swim away, which i think was a really unpredictable ending.So don't watch this movie if you just want some meaningless
monsterfight. Watch it because you wanna se a "realistic" movie that
keeps you on the edge of your seat - With monsters in it.And this was the best CGI i have ever seen in a movie.(Godzilla has atomic breath)
