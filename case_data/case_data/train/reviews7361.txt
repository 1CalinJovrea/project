A solid biopic made worth seeing for Keaton

The Founder is another tale of the American Dream. It's the kind of
tale we've seen a million times before. American man wants to become
successful, sacrifices morality for moolah, etc. It's The Godfather,
it's The Social Network, it's The Wolf of Wall Street. And The Founder,
while entertaining, offers pretty much nothing new, or distinctive, to
contribute. It is directed fairly conventionally, the story hits all
the beats you'd expect, and it's not going to stick to your memory for
too long. But that discounts the fact that the film is rather well made.
Performances are uniformly solid, and the film is undeniably compelling
for much of its run time. But the real reason to see the film is the
powerhouse performance of Michael Keaton, a neglected actor throughout
the 2000s who seems to be finally getting roles that he deserves with
this, Spotlight and Birdman to consider. He is slimy, charismatic, and
curiously sympathetic in all the right ways. In all The Founder may not light your world on fire, but it's a rock
solid tale of greed and the American Dream that ought to entertain most
that it meets.Side Note -I have no idea why this is playing in Australia over a month
before it comes out across the rest of the world, but hey I'm not
complaining.
