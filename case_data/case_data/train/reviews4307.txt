starts kind of OK but dies by dawn

I swear, no one was looking forward to this movie more than me, I love
the original, absolutely love it, then I hear about a remake and I got
so excited I could barely contain myself, I saw the trailer and got
even more hyped and hearing good things from reviewers sealed the deal,
I went to see it and was Disappointed!!!it starts OK, the acting seems about average, and it looks really nice,
but the dialogue is atrocious, really irritating. it went on and the
scares came along, really well executed scares too and they were really
creepy but the acting, pacing, dialogue and set up went straight
downhill. half way through I began to really lose interest, and when it
got to the monumental gore scenes from the trailer they they were
completely bogged down by everything i found terrible.any impact the jump scares had was all gone by the end, as the movie
went on I almost fell asleep, something that has NEVER happened to me
before, ever. it also doesn't help that the movie ends about three
times, and I lost count how many times the movie begged to be taken
seriously and all I thought was "oh, cry me a river". I started
forgetting about the movie on the drive home and I don't even remember
how it cut to the credits in the end.the good, the effects, gore and make-up.the bad, the acting, the pacing, the dialogue and construction.it's a shame, this movie looks really nice and I really want to love it
because i love the original but no, I just don't.I can barely remember it, it feels more like a rip-off rather than a
remake, the bad smothers the good, it's boring, gets completely
uninteresting half way through, the script is criminal and the actors
probably need help dressing themselves.I'd say this movie is like an anorexic, it puts so much effort into
looking nice it's forgotten all the important stuff that goes inside to
keep itself, you know, alive.
