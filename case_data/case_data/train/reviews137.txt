Quirky.

Party girl Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is kicked out by her long-suffering
boyfriend, and so returns to her home town where her parents own a
vacant house; there she is reunited with old school friend Oscar (Jason
Sudeikis) who now owns a bar, which acts like a magnet to boozy Gloria.
Meanwhile, in Seoul, South Korea, a massive monster appears and trashes
the city. When Gloria recognises some of the monster's movements and
mannerisms to be the same as her own, she realises that she is somehow
in control of the creature.A fantasy/sci-fi parable about the destructive nature of alcoholism and
the acceptance of responsibility, with random observations about the
detached manner in which international disasters are viewed by the
masses, Colossal is what might best be described as 'quirky'. Sometimes
I like quirky, but in this instance it just didn't work for me, largely
because I found the central characters so unlikable, reckless Gloria
unworthy of our sympathy and Oscar a controlling psychotic with a
serious case of self-loathing. When Gloria finally takes control of her
life, preventing Oscar from more mindless destruction, it is done so
with deadly forceand this is supposed to be a happy ending.5/10different, but not particularly enjoyable.
