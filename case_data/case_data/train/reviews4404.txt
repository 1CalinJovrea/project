Like Any "Mountain", It Just Feels Unmovable

Some films have left me speechless. Not simply because their execution
was unlike anything I've seen in the past, or opened my eyes to a story
so insane thinking someone came up with this idea, but speechless cause
there's so little to say about it as the film doesn't ask any new or
interesting questions. The Mountain Between Us is that kind of film
despite having 2 very talented actors I respect in this romantic drama.The story begins with Idris Elba as a doctor rushing to Baltimore for
surgery and Kate Winslet off to get married to her fianc√© and they
agree to work together to get to their destinations. However, their
plane crashes into the middle of the mountains and leaves them stranded
with only a golden retriever and their wits to find shelter and keep
one another from falling apart.Kate and Idris both give committed performances even through the harsh
weather conditions displayed. The cinematographer sets up some pretty
beautiful shots of the mountains and the scale and distance the actors
are from any form of civilization so that was something I appreciated
in a post "every month a CGI fest blockbuster" world. Sadly the
compliments end here.What kills the film is it's SO UTTERLY PREDICTABLE. If you have seen
any romantic film ever, you know what will happen. The dialogue is void
of any psychological questions of dealing with a stranger alone for
weeks despite the film feels like it's only 6 days tops. Not as viewer
did I feel they went through harsh conditions as Kate's hair the entire
time looked freshly curled.The Mountain Between Us on the trailer felt what could have been a
solid survival film, but instead got a corny and sometimes boring
romantic drama. Outside of one genuine jump scare that truly surprised
me, the film just feels lost in trying to be a romantic movie and
survival movie at the same time with very little chemistry to weave
them together.
