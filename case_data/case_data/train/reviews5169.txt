Holy Sh*t!

I rarely bother to give reviews after watching a movie. But holy crap
this was a good movie. I'm pretty sure it is the best movie i've seen
all year. and yes i saw dark knight rises, avengers, flight, Argo,
hobbit, etc... Tarantino delivers and then some.. Every actor is on
point. Awesome performances, great story, it will definitely take you
on a ride full of surprises. I would recommend everyone to go watch
this film, it is truly a great film.. unless you're a little kid..
don't go watch this movie if you're a little kid. I've seen all of
Tarantinos movies and I have to say this has been my favorite. It is
just awesome in every way. I'm usually very harsh on movies. I mean ill
watch just about anything, but for me to think a movie was actually
"good", takes a whole lot. DiCaprio was like i've never seen him
before, and being one of my favorite actors, it was a little weird at
first. But he does an outstanding job at selling his role within
seconds of his first appearance. Waltz delivered as i knew he would.
and Jaime Foxx, well he did not fall behind. Last but not least Jackson
was hilarious and also did an amazing job... Go watch the movie, it is
worth it.
