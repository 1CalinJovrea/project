An intimate and blunt brash look at the coming of age of a young lady who learns about life, love, and sex while finding herself.

"The Diary of a Teenage Girl" is one film that's not worried about
showing it's point even though it's supported by some artistic
animation it proves that one young lady is serious about finding
herself thru sexual discovery learning that life is about love and lust
before you discover your true self. Set in mid 1970's San Francisco Bel
Powley is Minnie a young teenage girl who starts an affair with her Mom
Charlotte's(Kristen Wiig) boyfriend Monroe(Alexander Skarsgard). And
the passion and intimate feel is hot and feel good as many scenes are
provocative and blunt showing plenty of skin and breast of young
Minnie. As this young lady is in a crazy home life world as mom
Charlotte is a fired alcoholic lady who snorts drugs with Monroe on the
west coast and California party scene. Thru it all this young lady
Minnie learns about people, life and love yet most important she comes
to peace thru herself with love and inspiration for art and people.
Overall good film of fun, discovery and finding about one's self with a
happy feel in the end.
