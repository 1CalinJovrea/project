Excellent

Daniel Radcliffe has definitely grown up from his days as Harry Potter.
This movie is reminiscent of the 1970s Gothic horror films. I recommend
it to anyone that enjoys real horror movies such as the movies with
Oliver Reed. The location this movie was filmed is spectacular, and the
ending is unbelievable. This is definitely a movie that has people
jumping in their seats. It is not overdone, and each of the
actors/actresses do a fine job. This is filmed on location at Layer
Marney Tower in Essex England. The film was planned to be shot in 3D,
but that plan was later scrapped. I am happy that it was scrapped
because this film does not need that kind of theatrics. It's well
written with a great plot and excellent acting.
