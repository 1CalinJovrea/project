What a bunch of cry babies

I went into this movie thinking it was going to be cheesy and have some
good action in it which is why I go to the movies. I don't go for drama
and talking I want to see fighting and lots of craziness. I loved the
movie, I love alien invasion movies and to see people on here
complaining that the aliens didn't really have any special powers makes
me laugh. I mean come on they come from a planet similar to ours so why
would they have any special powers? They had a bit better technology
then we did and what alien movie doesn't? Also think of all the alien
movies we have had so far and what else can be done? You go to the
movies to be entertained but I guess some people just can't let
themselves go for 2 hours and enjoy whats on the screen because it
wasn't written like they would of written it. I liked the aliens HALO
type armor they wore and the wrecking ball/drilling metal munching
destroying things were the sickness. That was one hell of a way to chew
up a ship and spit it out, thought that was great. My kids loved it and
my father got choked up over the veterans part. (His father is from
that era and fought in Guam) I was just happy to get away from the
busy/nasty daily grind we all sometimes endure and let myself go. I
wouldn't see it again at the full price but will for sure go to the
dollar movies and buy it when it comes out on DVD.
