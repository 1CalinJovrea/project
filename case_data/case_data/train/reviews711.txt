Nice movie on so many levels!

To begin with, I have to let you know that I was not aware of the
existence of any book before I saw the first and second movie. So,
comments like "you ruined the book", etc. don't make sense to me. I saw the first movie on a DVD and this one in the movie theater. For
me it was pure entertainment for the entire duration of the movie! I
liked the thrilling scenes and the chase from the zombie like people.
At some points I could not help but thinking that it a PS4 game and at
some point they would turn over the control of the actors to me and I
would be left alone clicking on X or L1/R1 to run as fast as I can! I
liked that but many may not like it. For me this was awesome!The acting was OK, as expected and really similar to the first one.
It's not like you wait to see an Oscar-winning performance there,
right? I really enjoyed all the special effects and the amazing scenes
from the cities that are crumbling and falling apart. The movie seemed
a lot longer than it is. The action-packed and full story behind it,
gave too much information and left me feeling really "full" after
watching it and this was not because of the XXL pop corn that I ate! I will go to the movies to see the third one, with excitement! And yes,
it definitely is an "8" in its genre. "7" felt like a minimum, so I
would easily give a "7.5" with pleasure! If you don't like this kind of
post-apocaliptic stories, wait till it's out in DVD, don't spend money
in the movies. If you do like them, go and see it, like yesterday!
