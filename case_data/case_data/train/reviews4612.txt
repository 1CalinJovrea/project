Unusual and interesting

A psychopath on the loose. Or should I just say, a young boy with
unresolved mother issues as a result of which others (girls, in
particular) have to suffer?Once he sets his eyes on the next target, nothing gets in the way. Very
cunningly he establishes where the victims live and like a skilled
craftsman carries out his hideous crimes, without remorse, second
thoughts or hesitation.Pivotal to the story is the appearance of an artist who has an acute
interests in these plastic mannequins something that appeals greatly to
the disturbed young man. Much as his instincts are ever present she
somehow causes him to not be himself which is no little thing.Great job has been done to bring intensity on the screen. We follow the
troubled man, we agonise as he prepares his next murder, we feel sorrow
when he indulges his animal instincts. Elijah wood is outstanding as
the loner with a dark secret.Another plus would have to be how the director gives it a very 80's
look and feel without ever misleading us from the fact that it is a
very modern day story.Ultimately, although the direction by a Frenchman has its obvious
advantages it remains a Hollywood movie. Hyperbole, gory scenes for the
sake of it and a sense of stretched reality deprive this appealing
story from further deserved points.
