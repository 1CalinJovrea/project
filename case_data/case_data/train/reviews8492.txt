Great film

This is a great film, except, for some reason, they have put 6 F-words
in it. I'm only 10, so I was surprised to see such bad language in a
12A. However, it is a very funny film. I especially like the part where
he is watching TV and seeing all the stuff he has done wrong. This is
on of my favourite films, so I was very surprised when I looked at the
rating in the morning (8.6) and then the rating after I went to see it
(6.1).I highly recommend this film, though not for kids.Look at the IMDb Parents Guide (I tried to get it on Common Sense
Media, but it wouldn't work).
