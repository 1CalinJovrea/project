It just doesn't make sense.

I'm a big fan of movies and I always try to give credit to the
directors and screenwriters as they have creative minds and not always
understood by others. In this particular case the story just doesn't
make any sense and the movie ends a bit childishly. The actors perform
average and it is not them fault but the director's.
