Best debut from a first time director in years

Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a
comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level,
worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along
with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme
of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As
far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work
just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are
from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial
relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of
the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that
it so richly deserves.
