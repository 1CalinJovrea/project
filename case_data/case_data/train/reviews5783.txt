A hidden gem

It's quite difficult to categorise this film, I found it quite special
and original, something you don't come across every day. The idea
itself is great and it really draws you in. The story develops slowly
and it's not exactly straight forward, since it's a surreal journey it
leaves you with linking a few things together on your own but it is not
complex at all so don't get discouraged by it. Hats off to all the
actors, a job very well done. The ending will not disappoint you
either.It got mixed reviews on this site so it's best just to see it and make
up your own mind about it. I would definitely recommend it, especially
if you are looking for something fresh, well-acted with a great
soundtrack and something that leaves a lasting impression and requires
a bit of thinking because, let's be honest, how many films actually do
that nowadays.
