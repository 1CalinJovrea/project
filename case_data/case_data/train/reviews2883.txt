Actually kind of disappointing after years of being built up

If Eli Roth is known for one thing, it's that he is known for high
levels of violence in his films and pushing the envelope. And The Green
Inferno is no exception, it's easily the most graphic movie of the year
to receive a theatrical release. The movie features some extremely
cringe-worthy scenes where the villages show no mercy to the young
students. Of course, this is the focal point of the movie, the
gore/torture of these somewhat arrogant, twenty somethings. Yes, there is some social commentary in the movie, mostly poking fun at
today's society and how everyone wants to 'appear' to be fighting for a
cause when in fact, they are doing very little. And yes, he has a point
here, but it isn't as thought provoking as he wants it to be,
especially once the carnage starts and those ideas fly out the window.
Only for those ideas to awkwardly return at the end of the movie.There is not much to say about this movie other than the obvious, it's
extremely violent, nothing more nothing less. The Green Inferno is
obviously a homage to those 80s cannibalistic horror movies. Which
means the body count is high and the foreigners are going to be
punished by the natives in some of the most cruel ways imaginable (at
least since the SAW series). But I can't help but feel a bit letdown
after years of build up with the movie being stuck in release hell.While The Green Inferno isn't on par with other strong horror
contenders for best horror movie of 2015, it is easily the nastiest,
most violent movie of the year. Thus, if the torture-porn genre is your
cup of tea, then look no further, you've found your next fix!
