Fresh and Above Average

Director Michael Drowse has put together a both funny and touching
romance befitting the talents of Michael Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan for
"What If". Lifting this movie above the rank-and-file is a solid script
with introspective and witty conversation. Supporting actors Adam
Driver, Megan Park, Mckenzie Davis, and Rafe Spell also run with the
script. Driver in particular is excellent blasting off in several
scenes. There is some formula involved as there always is with romance
and comedy, but this movie and all involved deserve high credit for
creating a fresh look. Radcliffe is spot on in his earnest, quirky, and
lonely character while Kazan waffles insecurely and believably as the
story marches. A solid recommend @ 7.5/10.
