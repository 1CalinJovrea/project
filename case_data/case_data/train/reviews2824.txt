Good for lazy evening on the sofa

If you've seen enough movies you know exactly how this is going to end
a few minutes in, so the fun is watching how they work the plot towards
that conclusion. It's an enjoyable movie with humor that sometimes made me cringe and
other times laugh out loud. Jason S. is typecast in this role, but he
has good screen chemistry with Jennifer A. The two kids play their
roles well, the boy maybe too well. If you like sexually charged humor, or want something to tune out with,
I can recommend it. The biggest compliment I can give it is saying I
hope they make a sequel.
