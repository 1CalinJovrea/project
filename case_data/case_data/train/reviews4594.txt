Bad film

The irony is that while 'Alien' was a film with a modest budget that
desperately tried to use the available resources to pull off the look
of an A-film, 'Prometheus' is a film with a monstrous budget that
doesn't even seem to aspire to rise above the B-movie level - with the
exception of special effects.Alas, 3-D glasses can never compensate for one-dimensional characters,
and an experienced director cannot fix a poorly written script that
makes every screen writing error imaginable.I guess what it comes down to is that god is a bald bodybuilder who
never says anything but instead punches everyone he meets straight in
the face. Don't mess with him!By the way, the aliens in this film verge on silly. You don't want that
in a horror film, much less in a film that wants to explain human
origins. Can anyone explain the stupidity of the characters?
