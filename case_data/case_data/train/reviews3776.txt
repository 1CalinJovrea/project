Don't waste your time

I have not read the books , I hadn't even heard of them so I went to
see this with a very open mind , but this is just a very poor film ,
badly adapted , not very well acted and all the special effects can not
make up for what is just a turkey of a film , I didn't engage with any
of the characters which left me not caring what happened to them , and
i just ended up looking at my watch to see how long it was till it
finished ! I'm surprised to see so many positive user reviews on here ,
my advice is read the critics reviews far more accurate - no big
blockbuster franchise here I for that I think we should all be very
thankful , This is one strictly for young kids only !
