Sweet, sensitive, thoughtful movie - so much better than I expected

A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored
with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online
fashion retailer and gets the position. The founder of the company is
Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic
workaholic. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she
doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing.
However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of
support and wisdom.Good, and surprisingly so. I was expecting a farcical half-baked comedy
about how an old guy rejoins the work force and struggles with modern
gadgets and work processes. There are a few examples of that but the
movie is far more than a story about generational differences. It's
more a drama than a comedy, and is a good one too. There's themes of
generational wisdom, not judging people by their age (or anything
superficial) and making the most of people's talents. It's also a movie
about starting over, and doing what you enjoy.Moreover, it's simply a nice story.Solid work by Robert De Niro in the lead role. He doesn't do bad
performances, but that hasn't stopped him in the past from taking on
roles and movies that are well below his standards. This is not one of
those roles or movies. Sensitively played, and ideal for the role. Good work too by Anne Hathaway, who is very convincing as the go-
getting entrepreneur.
