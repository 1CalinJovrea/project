Political Thriller

From the trailer, and without knowledge of previous Jack Ryan films,
Jack Ryan seems like an average spy action movie like The Bourne
Trilogy or James Bond movies. However, its not. This movie gives us the
origins of Jack Ryan. I came into the movie expecting an average spy
action/thriller and it managed to surpass my expectations. Jack Ryan
does not have many action scenes, as he uses more of his intellect than
his fists. The exposition parts of the story are at times boring, but
when Jack Ryan is doing his mission, it doesn't feel rushed, and it
manages to constantly keep you in suspense. Even with not much action
scenes, there were quite a few action scenes that come as a surprise.
The director of the movie, who was also the villain, was pretty
menacing with his Russian accent. Chris Pine was good, too. If you like
spy movies, go into this movie not expecting much and this film will
probably be better than expected, and it will constantly keep you off
the edge of your seat.
