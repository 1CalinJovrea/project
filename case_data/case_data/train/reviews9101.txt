Well organized story with great characters, performed by great actors

This is like the stuff you see on hour long serialized Television like
Netflix's Narcos, but instead this police like drama is done in a two
hour movie instead of thirteenth episodes.Emily Blunt was amazing in her character, a good FBI agent who feels
she's not doing enough on the streets and allows herself to get used by
someone with more power, played by Josh Brolin brilliantly as a man who
seems uncharismatic about his job in order to hide the covert nature of
his mission to find the big man responsible for all the street crime.Brolin played a necessary evil, that comes off brilliantly in the
narrative that plays out. Loved how they go from the bottom and get to
the very top. It's very surgical. But the actor who stole the show in Sicario is Benicio del Toro whose
character Alejandro, is a cloud of mystery that unravels slowly through
the film, done both subtle and dramatic by Del Toro. Every time he was
on the screen even when he did nothing he was doing something and you
he demanded your attention.Plus the music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. it
was powerful.Incredible action-thriller.
