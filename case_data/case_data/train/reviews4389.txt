Great classic monster movie fun

This movie for me personally was just a fun classic monster movie with
funny characters and great action.- Great visuals, Skull Island did not disappoint me.- Mix of funny and serious characters blended very well together. Tom
Hiddlestone, Brie Larson, and John C Reilly were my personal favorites.- King Kong was actually represented as a different kind of ape
entirely, not just a giant gorilla. He was also given a personality,
maybe not as well as Peter Jacksons King Kong, but fairly close. - Skull crawlers served their purpose greatly, with them being visually
terrifying but also not overfilling the movie with their presence.- Story was easy to follow and interesting to watch.Overall, this movie for me has already placed itself in my list of
favorite movies this year and it's only March. I can't wait to see what
else 2017 can throw at me.One last thing, definitely stay for the end credit scene, it does not
disappoint.
