Once seen, never forgotten- truly magnificent

'Your Name' is not just one of the best animes in recent years (and
there have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes ever
from personal opinion.Will go even further, saying it's one of the best animated films in
recent years, one of the best animated or otherwise films of the year
and that it rivals the masterworks of Miyazaki. This is a huge
compliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a bold
claim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's'
stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but never
forgotten.The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully and
intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the
backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also
atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no
problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own,
serving superbly as music on its own.Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to
say and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The
storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never
lets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investing
in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is
deliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well
realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second
half.Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written and
developed, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters with
no qualms.In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered
for years to come. Deserves all the raves it's gotten, and deserving of
even more. 10/10 Bethany Cox
