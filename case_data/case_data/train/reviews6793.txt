Utter Tripe

Just seen the film Gone Girl. I really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never
finished it but the film was getting good reviews so I thought I'd give
it a go.What a pile of crap!Two and a half hours of my life wasted. The story is just unbelievable.
Neither character makes you like them or hate them. They are just bland
and, well, unbelievable. By the end I just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the
pair of them. I would have stood up and cheered. As it happened it has
a really lame ending.A waste of my life. Utter tripe!
