Sicario, Sickario, Psychario

I was really stoked about Sicario and went to see it the night it
opened. Why was I excited? Well, the posters looked cool and I knew
that celebrated director Dennis Villeneuve was expected to deliver a
fresh and intelligent suspense movie with a nice dose of action.That, plus Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are in it, and I think
they're cool.What I got was a gritty action movie, but unfortunately it wasn't
intelligent or thought-provoking. When I'm watching Expendables 3, I'm
ready to sit back, enjoy the ride and hold back on the nit-picking.
That's not really an option, though, when you have to pay attention to
follow the story, and are promised new insights into a deep-rooted
problem.*** Spoilers ahead *** I thought it was clever that we see the plot
from the perspective of an ing√©nue, this time in the form of a
"small-time" FBI agent (Kate Mercer played by Emily Blunt). After her
SWAT team storms a horror house run by the Mexican cartels in which two
of her fellow officers are killed, she's ready to go after the big
guys. Her new CIA-lead team is willing to use "unconventional" (read:
highly questionable) methods. They extract a drug lord from a Mexican
prison and torture him for information. Kate is told that she is there
to "watch and learn", but ultimately she finds out that she is only
there as a goon to legitimize the CIA operating in the homeland. Her
function is not to "watch and learn" but to shut up, keep out and to
sign a paper at the end. For the time being though, the team storms a
tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the border in a scene that seems to
take a page straight out of Zero Dark Twenty ...*** Spoilers thick on the ground from here on *** Sicario really
annoyed me because it brings together so much promise with an
incredibly lackluster plot. I feel like I could write an entire book
about it. What's the point of the horror house at the beginning? If the
cartel is using it to dispose bodies, why would they shrink-wrap the
corpses? Why are there gun-toting criminals in a house full of
incriminating evidence? Why are the corpses behind dry walls (is the
cartel planning on renting out the house)? Why is the trap-door
booby-trapped? Why do police have to anticipate that in about six
months every further crime scene will be booby-trapped if they don't
stop the cartel now? When they are illegally extracting the cartel boss
from the Mexican prison, why are they doing it in a highly visible
convoy? If they anticipate being ambushed just before the frontier, why
don't they keep a lane open? Why didn't they use a helicopter? Why
don't they just torture the guy in Mexico? What are the ambushers
trying to achieve? What is the role of the crooked cop? Could he be any
hammier than carrying a gel bend around that the cartel uses to hold
their bankrolls together? And on and on.Five points because of the acting and the cinematography. For an
intelligent thriller on the Mexican drugs war, I'd recommend Traffic
over Sicario any time.
