Thought-provoking feel-good fun

An ordinary 21 year old man is shocked to discover that he has the
ability to travel through time, a concept which, granted, is not new to
the world of cinema. Although this unusual ability is naturally the
main theme of the film, the plot still engages the viewer with the
struggles of every day life including marriage, finding a job, having
children as well as a few family issues to keep the plot fresh. The
intriguing plot complements the few time-travelling excursions and
keeps the idea crisp.The plot is thought provoking and the script is kept light, with
several laugh-out-loud moments which can be all-too rare in this genre.Domhnall Gleeson gives an extremely high quality performance in his
lead role and is supported well by the highly experienced rom-com lead
Rachel McAdams and an ever-amusing Bill Nighy, who provides much of the
comic relief in the film.The plot could perhaps be accused of moving slowly at times; however
this only serves to heighten the drama of the intriguing plot twists.
