2hrs 10minutes of misery  I will not get back

This ruined my day. I suppose I should have checked before going , and
then I would have avoided seeing dead children , dying and dead young
father, everyone choking back tears all through the film , flat, slow,
tedious script.An unremitting wallow in misery and bereavement. I observed 2 moments
when the woman next to me chuckled: one was when a 16yo boy whose
father is in a freezer at the undertakers gets acutely upset when he
finds a frozen chicken in the fridge. She must have one dark sense of
humour.Very good acting and production , but who would have anything to do
with a script like this? I spent the last 90mins praying for it to
stop. I suppose this might make a good training film for bereavement
counsellors
