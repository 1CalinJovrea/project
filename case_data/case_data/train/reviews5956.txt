Let me sum it up for you... *MAJOR SPOILERS*

Let me sum it all up for you;Opening scene sets the stage for every one needing to go into the woods
- this is repeated about twenty times until they finally go into the
woods. You may not know going in but it's a musical - every sentence is sung.
And I love a good musical - this gets old reeeeally quickly. Within the first scene of the witch she is singing about the bakers dad
stealing & "raping" her gardenJacks mother repeatedly hits him & tells him he's an idiot childFirst major scene of the wolf & the" little girl" /red riding hood is a
scene that is both disturbing & cringe worthy leaving everyone in the
cinema feeling uneasy & sick. As he sings to her about wanting to eat
her "plump & pink limbs" and can't wait to have her grandma too all the
time you feel this has become the national anthem for pedophiles
everywhere The baker then attacks the little girl to strip her coat off her before
she lets out & blood curdling scream and he gives it backoh by the way Rapunzel is the bakers sister but that's all you ever
hear about that and they never meet Cinderella runs away from the prince three times and he keeps hunting
her downThere's a homo erotic scene between the two princes singing about their
objects of desire /the princess' probably the best part of the film
(kind of not really)The wolf eats the little girl but then the baker cuts the wolf open to
get them out to which another horrible song is sung about how she felt
"excited" about how the wolf devoured her leaning heavily towards the
same uneasy feeling of a girl describing her first sexual experience
"scared but excited"Oh also the cow dies but gets risen from the dead but then the humans
feed it shoes, clothes & hair That hair is Rapunzel's by the way which the bakers wife literally
pulls off (almost a scalping scene but thankfully Disney toned that
down)There's a song in which jack sings of giant women holding him to her
"giant breast" then it gets even more disturbing with the prince getting blinded by
thorns Repunzels hair is brutally cut by the witch after she sings to
her that she cant be trusted & that the world is a horrible place But
it's OK cos her tears fix his scars & blindness and they ride off on a
horse never to be seen again Then there's Cinderella's slipper - and of course the trying on of the
slipper between the ugly step sisters And I know I know you think you
know how this bit goes but you don't. The step mum again quite
graphically (sounds and all) cuts the toes off her first daughter "you
don't need to walk when you're a princess!" Then the cuts the heel off
her other daughter who literally faints when she tries to walk in the
shoeThen Cinderella sends her bird friends to stab out their eyes as
revenge The witch drinks some milk & turns into a "pretty" witch again and the
bakers wife has an emasculate conception in front of your eyesOh & Jack kills a giant üëçFinally you think it's almost over - Cinderella is happily married
there's the happily ever after ending scene where they're all waving at
each other & happy Joy oh joy this horrible nightmare is over!!No. It's not.45 mins later you are left with the remains of even more heinous story
telling There's a giant wanting to kill jack and it's apparently
EVERYONES fault (there's an anxiety giving song about that too!) The
prince meets the bakers wife in the woods literally says"your brave -
can I kiss you" and they make out and have sex on a treeHe leaves - she sings about her want to continue to cheat on her
husband And then falls off a cliff and apparently dies So does jacks
mother but she get pushed to the ground by some guy "she didn't make
it"The witch sings I'm sick of this and turns to mud Then it's suddenly a bible story about David & Goliath (jack kills the
giant woman with a sling shot to the head) And when you think yes it's almost over the baker decides to adopt all
the left over kids & tell them about the story that we had just
witnessed as that horrible song starts again & you just want to cry &
run out of the cinema and demand your money back, tell every parent DO
NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THIS!!! And rock back & forth in a corner as you
try to comprehend what just happened to you.If my review has confused you left you saying "what???" Or have no idea
what I'm talking about - then you've basically watched the film and
I've saved you from being put through the torture that is; Into the
Woods.
