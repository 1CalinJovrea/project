I hate modern film-goers

If Jaws was released today, everyone would complain how it took too
long for the shark to turn up. WHAT HAPPENED TO ATTENTION SPANS?!When I saw it in the cinema people couldn't even get through the
opening credits without being on their phones. These are the same type
of people who complain about how the human characters are dull (Yet the
1998 Godzilla characters were too ridiculous) but tell you off for
saying the same thing about Pacific Rim, saying "But I just want to see
action"The people who complain about there being too little action also
complain about how Transformers has too much action. The people who
complain about Cranston not being in it enough complain about movies
using popular actors just to get people to watch it. The people who
complain about it being dark and realistic complain about the Marvel
movies being too light and unrealistic.The people who complain about this movie are whiny, hypocritical and
missed one of the most beautifully choreographed movies, with the most
impressive visuals even when the monsters weren't on screen, a great
soundtrack that inspired terror and a cast that although lacking in the
third act, made up for a great introduction and middle (Cranston and
Watanabe) and some of the most epic-scaled action I have seen in the
last 10 years. Cloverfield was a shaky mess that wasted the monster and
Pacific Rim had sporadic fights that gave no real sense of scale.I can't wait for the many sequels that will most likely have a lot more
Godzilla now they are confident (given the box office)to use more CGI
and money. He will be fighting some of the most iconic villains from
the Godzilla universe, and hopefully all the idiots who watched and
hated this movie won't watch it and me all the people who cheered
through the first one will get to watch it in peace.
