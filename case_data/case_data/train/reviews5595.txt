Perfect Dredd

In a dystopian future, the world is devastated. Judge Dredd (Karl
Urban) is the last word in Law & Order within Mega-City One. Judge
Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) is his junior partner. They are
battling drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is operating out of a
massive apartment block.The previous version of Judge Dredd (1995) starring Sly is a campy
affair. Consider that it had Rob Schneider in it. 'nuff said. This one
brings us into the comics once again but this time, they drop the camp.
It is well written probably because they had Alex Garland who also
wrote 28 Days Later... and Sunshine among others. Karl Urban is not as
imposing as Sly but he does a solid job. Most importantly, he's not
impersonating Sly. Olivia Thirlby is great as a foil or conscience to
Dredd. Their relationship is the heart of the movie. Lena Headey does a
good job as the baddie. It's an interesting unusual choice. It's
certainly not your average muscle bound villain.I did have 2 problems. First, Slo-Mo happens too many times. The first
couple of times are interesting. I'm sure it's cool 3D fun, but even
that would get tiresome. It's a balancing act between pace and cool and
the climax needs pace more than cool. Second problem is the ending. The
final fight with Lena Headey is not as climatic as needed. It's a bit
of a letdown. Overall, this is super-fun despite the minor problems.
