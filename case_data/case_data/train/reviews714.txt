This Is What An Action Film Should Be

I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX
cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates
a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this
film would be great in any format."Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation" is one of the best action films I
have ever seen. The story is clever and action packed. The photography
is amazing and the music is fantastic.Much has been made of the stunt work, especially that done by Tom
Cruise himself. It did not disappoint. And the action and chase
sequences are as exciting as any I have seen.We can thank the writing for the well-defined and engaging characters.
Some Bond films have villains that are rather cartoonish, but in MI:RN
the danger feels real, helping to drive the suspense.The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, deserves special mention. Her
portrayal of Ilsa Faust is a wonderful blend of intelligence, beauty
and strength and definitely one of the best in any action film. I can
only hope she shows up in the next installment. some of the credit goes
to the writers who created the character.In all, this film offers everything you want in an action film and
deserves a "10" for its place in the genre.
