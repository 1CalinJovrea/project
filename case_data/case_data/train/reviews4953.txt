If Time Travel is real - go back & tell yourself to not watch this movie...

At best this movie is a concept which thinks it is clever but
ultimately fails to deliver for trying too hard to be clever.So the lead character goes back in time to convince their earlier self
to go back in time to connect with their former self which results in
the birth of their self which is then kidnapped by their future self in
order to fulfil a time-line to try to stop a mass murderer who also
happens to be..... Yup you've guessed it!So basically at any point in the film they could have resolved the main
plot at any point and resolved the needless deaths of innocents & the
troublesome life that awaited them (over & over) if they just stopped
rather than prattling on about the idea's of the 'chicken & egg' or the
Ouroboros (snake eating its tail)The only Ouroboros this film delivers is one's head being stuck up its
own backside.
