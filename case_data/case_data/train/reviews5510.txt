Keira can sing!  Nice feel good movie about music making today

This is a feel good movie about musicians making an album. Mark Ruffalo
and Keira Knightley play producer and song writer who team up to make a
demo filmed all over the city. The songs are pleasant and the
characters are sympathetic and likable even Hailee Steinfeld as Mark's
daughter. There is a nice dynamic between the characters which makes
the movie enjoyable to watch. There is almost as much music as a
musical but it doesn't feel much like a musical.Who knew Keira could sing so well? She doesn't have the most powerful
voice but her singing is musical and right for the type of songs. Mark
looks suitably scruffy for the fallen on hard times composer. Nice
cameo by Ceelo Green and Adam Levine who sings quite a few songs.Movies like this are pleasant and uplifting to watch - if you want a
break from action or violence of summer blockbusters.
