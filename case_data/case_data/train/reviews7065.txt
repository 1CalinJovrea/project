Epic - series just keeps getting better and better

As a big fan of Transformer series and M. Bay I had really big
standards for this movie, and it went far beyond. Perfect follow up to
the last one. Visuals are great, soundtrack also , maybe one thing that
could be better are actors. Overall it was great experience, especially
in 4D.
