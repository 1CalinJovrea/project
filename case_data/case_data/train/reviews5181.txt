Dreadful stuff

I went against my instincts when it came to watching 'The Bad Batch'.
Every nerve in my body was telling me it would be dreadful, but the
words cannibals, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi kept
repeating over and over in my head until I finally gave in and made the
fateful mistake of watching it. My god, how is it possible to make a
story this boring out of cannibals? Every single thing it tries to make
itself interesting with completely falls flat. When you manage to get a
completely dull and forgettable performance out of Jim Carrey you know
you're doing something terribly wrong.The film tries to be thought-provoking (at least it seemed like that
was what it was going for) but none of the concepts it presents are in
any way actually worthy of a second thought. It also goes for a lot of
style, however it again falls short. In a futuristic desert wasteland
setting there a thousand different concepts you could use to create an
interesting story. For some reason 'The Bad Batch' chooses a story that
could have been told in any setting and in any time period. That's
about as lazy as story-telling gets. If you do make the mistake of
selecting this one up on Netflix brace yourself for a long and painful
couple of hours.
