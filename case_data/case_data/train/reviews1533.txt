To much CGI used indiscriminately

I've read the book, which this movie is based on and enjoyed it very
much. I think that this movie kept mostly true to the source material
which isthe aging make-up wasn't terrible (when it wasn't
post-production). The actor playing Lincoln had pretty convincing aged
makeup from teenager to the time of his death. My problem with this film was the over-use of CGI. If someone got hit
or shot, the director would use the "Matrix effect" of slowing the
person down as they do an outrageous head over heals flip. And not just
then, even when a person would just get pushed or looked at funny,
there goes the slo-mo reaction. In general, I think this movie could
have been a whole lot better with a lot less CGI. Almost every scene
has it. Lazy film-making leaves everything to post-production. If used
more sparingly, this could have been a much better movie.Spoilers: It's amusing to me how the female vampire looks so similar to
Circe on Game of Thrones, down to the hairstyle. Also, how does Abe
write in the same journal from his teens to his 50s? Only one is left
with the vampire.
