Honeymoon

It's movies like this one that remind me why I love horror films so
much. Reminiscent of the claustrophobic 1960s classics "Repulsion," it
follows two newlyweds spending their honeymoon at a secluded cabin in
the woods, with strange goings-on occurring outside and affecting them
more and more as time goes on. It's a surprisingly intelligent
exploration of the anxieties of new marriages, finding out more about
your loved one than you cared to, and the psychologically corrosive
impact of anxiety. It also functions effectively as a straightforward,
restrained horror movie, with several sincerely scary scenes and a
general sense of eeriness and malaise. It's a sincere and genuine
shocker with two tremendously likable and talented leads. Watch it with
the lights off!
