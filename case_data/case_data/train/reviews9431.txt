Bound to be polarizing - it's twisted and perverse, but very Smith-esque

Kevin Smith's vanity film Tusk is sure to be polarizing: either you
will love it or hate it, there won't be any gray area. Archon Cinema
Reviews happen to love it's crazy ass.Tusk is a half comedy and half horror film where podcaster Wallace
Bryton goes missing while in Canada out looking for content for his
radio show.Wallace's cringe-humor podcast with his best friend Teddy revolves
around Wallace going out interviewing zany people and then telling
Teddy about it, the podcast is aptly called the Not-See Party. Wallace
ventures out to the great white north of Canada to the boonies of
Manitoba for an especially gnarly story. When it falls through, Wallace
finds a plan-B and decides to interview this odd and mysterious
seafarer Howard Howe. At this point Tusk turns from straight comedy to
straight horror when Wallace goes MIA and his BFF and girlfriend
Allison team up to look for him.If you don't know the idea behind Tusk, Kevin Smith came up with it
while talking on his own podcast with his own friend. Can the film be
more of a vanity project under these circumstances? I don't think so!
Smith makes the film he wants with complete disregard for appeasing the
viewers Â– and it pays off big for his fans and others who are simply
dark and twisty in their gooey center.Tusk is neither comedic-horror or horrific-comedy and a clear and
defined line can be drawn (or spliced) in the film where the two shant
meet. The first thirty minutes contain joke after masterful joke
playing into American stereotypes of Canadians and Canadia in general.
The latter portion making up about an hour of the film is perverse
horror. It is unnerving and unsettling with completely weird and
off-kilter imagery.Justin Long, who plays Wallace, is the quintessential American who just
can't keep his mouth shut and is marvelous. Michael Parks was made to
play serial killer Howard Howe and both Long and Parks are perfect
together. Relative newcomer to mainstream audiences Genesis Rodriguez
is smart, beautiful and most importantly believably real as Allison,
girlfriend to the consummate nerd that is Wallace. Even Haley Joel
Osment is the perfect beta-geek as Wallace's bestie Teddy. There is an
A-lister in Tusk that I think should remain a surprise cameo until you
watch the film. With that said, Kevin Smith's Tusk definitely could
have done without it and it was a massive distraction that cheapened
the horror half of the film. If you heard about the cameo then you
should know who I am talking about.Kevin Smith's Tusk is a film for the oddball freaks, when it comes down
to it, but nobody can say it's not original. A good litmus test as to
whether Tusk will be your cup of tea, in our opinion: If you like the
1981 original The Evil Dead or From Dusk Till Dawn's overboard but
fresh take on their associated genres (especially when they were
initially released and before they garnered cult-like acclaim) then you
probably won't dislike Tusk.Check out our WEBSITE for all the 2014 horrors and recent releases
