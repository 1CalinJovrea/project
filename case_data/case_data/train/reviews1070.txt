I walked out of the theater wanting to go back in and see it again.

It's seldom that I leave a movie knowing that I absolutely will go back
to a theater to see that movie again rather than wait for distribution.
As I walked out, I absolutely knew that I would be back. There are so
many amazing actors in this movie that I need to go back to fully
appreciate the story.In my estimation, Spielberg's Lincoln will become the definitive movie
on Abraham Lincoln. Daniel Day Lewis absolutely disappeared into this
character and out gallumped Honest Abe - country lawyer, gifted orator
and a man born more fully suited to the desperate needs of a nation
than possibly any other man in history. This movie is not the shiny
myth, but a portrait of an amazing man who inspired, cajoled and even
bribed the Representatives of the People into representing ALL of the
people. If you go, and I hope that you do, go with ears ready to hear voices
speaking out to us from our violent past, telling us that we can be
better than we are, that some things should be done because they must
be done and that we can sometimes accomplish the impossible.
