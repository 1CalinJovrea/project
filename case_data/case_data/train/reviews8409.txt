Total Waste of My Time

I think the other reviewers here were too kind. The movie is
unforgivably terrible. No storyline, no dialogue to speak of other than
almost-verbatim regurgitations from the original film, poorly acted,
and utterly boring. I couldn't wait for the drawn-out affair to end.The CGI elevators and car chase scenes were quite fantastic but with no
story to back-up such graphics and artificial set, there was little
point other than to wonder during the film why all the money went into
the visuals and marketing and not into plot development or storyline.
If just some budget had gone to the story the film could have been
wonderful.For those who never saw the original, I don't know how you will ever
figure out what this movie is trying to say or accomplish other than to
take some hard-earned money out of your wallet.This film in now on my Top Ten Worst Films of All Time list.
