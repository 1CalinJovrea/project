Unrealistic, boring and dumb.

I have to say that IMDb has become more and more misleading with their
ratings. Incredibly deep European movies getting low ratings while
movies like this are ranking higher and higher every time. Reading all
the reviews below, you get to understand why.This movie is unrealistic and silly in many ways and this is no minor
issue. I understand that cinema is a suspension of disbelief but this
movie could have been much better if it had been more realistic. I
won't get into details other than saying the behaviour of the
characters (especially those lame cowards on deck) is unbelievable, the
moments of terror boring and the decision made by everyone is dumb. The
Coast Guard should have arrived immediately carrying proper gear like
tiny explosives which are thrown around the girls (of course, knowing
their location beforehand) in order to chase away the sharks. The music is predictable. The action scenes are clich√©d and not
remarkable and worst of all, they are boring. That ripped off finale
from "The Descent" and "Gravity" does not work because we have seen it
before in much better films.There are tragedy movies which are so real and in which the characters
do everything their common sense dictates that the viewer cannot but
suffer and empathize with their predicament. And the movie shines. No
wonder such movies have become classics. This is not one of them.
Boring and dumb. Stay away!
