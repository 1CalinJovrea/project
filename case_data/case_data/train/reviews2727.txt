Southpaw: The Next Generation's Rocky!!

I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of this movie, and I
was extremely glad I did. After watching the previews I felt as though
a lot of the movie was given away, but I was blown away by the
performances on screen. The movie was centered around a champion prize
fighter hitting rock bottom, and slowly climbing his way back into the
ring. It was an emotional journey that cannot simply be categorized as
a movie about boxing, but rather, an inspiring and riveting tale of
parenthood and a father's love for his daughter. The cast was excellent
and everyone excelled in their roles. I wouldn't have expected to like
Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson in a role as much as I did. Jake Gyllenhaal
and Forest Whitaker had Oscar worthy performances. Everyone did a great
job with their roles. The cinematography was fantastic, and the fight
scenes gave some great first person shots that made you feel as though
you were there in the ring fighting along side the actors. Overall,
this movie is an experience that is not to be missed. 9/10
