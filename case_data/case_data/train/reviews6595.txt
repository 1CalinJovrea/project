Watchable date movie.

Looks pretty. No thinking required.How many times can the writer play the photograph card? The picture the
marine finds is the catalyst for the story, yet very late they play
another picture to wrap up a loose end.Predictable. Good performances all around. Zack Efron seemed a little
young and short for Taylor Shilling. The dogs are good. The movie drags at times, but if you get board you can always watch the
rear view mirror on the truck appear and disappear from scene to scene.It kinda has the feel of a 60's movie with the folk singer telling the
story as it happens. Pleasant enough romance tale with a happy ending.
