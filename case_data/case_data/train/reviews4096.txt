It is easy to give up

The film is based on the true boxing story of World Champion Boxer
Vinny Pazienza (Miles Teller). It starts with his defeat in November of
1988 to Roger Mayweather (Peter Quillin). It appeared his career was a
wash and after a training music montage he won the second fight of the
film, 30 minutes into it with the training help of Aaron Eckhart, going
whiplash all over Gilbert Dele. The fight was a set up and he was
expected to lose. Paz gets into an auto accident and the bulk of the
film is about his remarkable comeback.The film skips a few fights in between. Paz didn't go from training to
title bout as the film portrays, forgivable for time considerations. I
thought the acting was excellent, decent New England accents. At the
end of the film you get to see the real characters on which the
production was based and they looked were remarkably similar. Good
casting. Good film for the genre. Good sound track.Guide: F-word. Nudity ( Noelle Trudeau, Christine Evangelista)
