Yew can do it

I don't know who you would market this movie to. It's not a kid's
movie, tho it tries very hard to look like one. It's not an adult movie
(a boy and a talking tree), tho its themes certainly are mature. Both
child and adult will squirm under the relentless emotional requirement
with only a faint wisp of humor to lighten things up. Melancholy
overload anyone? No? But if you make it to the end, you'll have received an unexpected
cathartic cleansing and a life lesson in your pocket that is hard, but
beautiful in its truth.Once you stop blubbering, that is.
