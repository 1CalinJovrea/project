What Ever Happened To Original Ideas?

It's just depressing for a movie lover like me to see a film like Joel
Schumacher's 1990 Flatliners remade. Why? Can anyone come out with
something we haven't seen before or at least from a fresh new POV.
Somebody told me that my reaction is "generational" - I fear that's
true. It makes me feel really old. I almost walked out of Mother!, the
other day - something I've never done - because I felt treated like a
moron. To steal from Robert Polanski to do what, what? Here is even
worse. They're stealing from Joel Schumacher without having any of
the...what was it that the 1990 had that this one hasn't? Well let's
say that the first one wasn't a remake. Where are the mavericks? The
new ones. The ones I love are in their 70's or gone. I do apologize I'm
just venting my frustration. Thank you for indulging me.
