2
Is 2 too much?

How many stars do you give a movie that makes you squirm with
embarrassment for an hour before you turn it off? I think that 2 was
too much for this frankly embarrassing effort at screwing a few grey
dollars out of the coffin dodging community. How much fun would you have going to Las Vegas with your grandparents?
Probably not much, but it would still be far better than watching this
contrived and lumbering wreck of a movie shuffle on its zimmer frame
from one clich√© to the next. You can't argue with some of the acting talent on show here, its just a
shame they didn't exercise any judgement before signing up for this. I
can't believe the visceral force of nature that drove movies like Taxi
Driver and Good Fellas should be reduced to this. And please for the
love of all that is Holly do not show us Morgan Freeman "dancing" ever
again. If you are desperate for geriatric laughs then check out Bad Grandpa,
Last Vegas is the kind of movie that will make you hope to die young.
