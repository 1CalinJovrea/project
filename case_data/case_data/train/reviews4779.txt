3
Just the shell...

It gets a 3 only for SOME of the visual effects... as others have
noted, some scenes don't work and appear more unreal than the old 2D
animated film.As for the most important part: the story... where did it go? The
writers of this screenplay had the greatest advantage possible: A
PERFECT, ACCLAIMED ORIGINAL. It was a story which addressed very
complex subjects of mind versus machine: at what point does a mind
become a computer, at what point does a program become a mind? And is
there truly a difference at all once something becomes aware of itself.That's not present here. It's a stolen identity/conspiracy plot you've
seen over and over, and done better. Apparently they threw the whole
original story out and inserted this hackneyed plot which felt like an
awkward mix of "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall" themes, with all the
heart and soul torn out and left hollow.There is no ghost in this shell. It's just a thin, flashy facade over a
contrived, tired jumble of plot points... perhaps an unintentional
irony to the CGI facade over the crumbling buildings in the movie.On the themes of Hollow-wood cashing in on lazy nostalgia grabs (Power
Rangers last week as another example), this leads me to suspect the
heavy tone and themes of "Blade Runner" too will be deconstructed and
dismembered in the remake, until only another empty shell remains.At least in this case, for certain, the advances in computer science
have lessened the humanity in the film.
