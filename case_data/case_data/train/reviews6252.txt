oh dear

Well I got back last night after watching it. It was a last minute
thing too. Love Gangster movies and thought this looked great. loving
Boardwalk Empire and enjoyed public enemy number one (suprisingly) so I
was a little dismayed by the total lack of empathy with this movie upon
leaving the cinema. It was running good right up to Brolins wife
(excellent acting btw) began to help him hire the team of misfits. From
there it pretty much fell away. the crew were average at best. The
acting was strained. Brolin wasn't too bad. But even he was below
average. Never looked too comfortable. I couldn't really put a finger
on it but it never really got my blood pumping. A few plot holes I cant
be bothered to go into and I wonder if this was the outcome of a total
script re-write by the director. Who knows. Penn tried his best to give
the movie some depth. But even his performance lacked the Scorsese
touch. Jimmy the Gent he wasn't. Despite the obvious attempt. Average
movie that could have been good. Never great.
