Terrible Direction-waste of time

This review contains some spoilers.The biggest problem with this movie is the central premise: if the
police are trying to arrest you for a crime you did not commit, you can
create whatever level of death and destruction you deem necessary to
escape and prove your innocence. At the end of the movie, the main
police character, Forrest Whitaker, tells Mills (Liam Neeson) that
Mills' hacking the police computer is a crime and Mills could be
arrested. They both have a quiet chuckle and Neeson is "free to leave".
After assaulting a number of police officers, wrecking several police
cars, stealing a police car, throwing officers out of moving cars,
shooting the obligatory dozen bad guys and causing a freeway crash that
is supposed to be one of the highlights of the movie, hacking the
police computer would be the least of Mill's problems.Prior "Taken" movies require some suspension of your disbelief. One guy
creates total havoc and kills several dozen bad guys and then walks
away with family member in hand. This is theoretically possible because
Mills leaves the country after all the death and destruction. This
movie takes place in America. In the world where Taken 3 takes place,
if you uncover an evil plot and confine your killing to the guys who
have the right tattoos, Forrest Whitaker will smile genially and send
you on your way. This movie requires that you be a complete idiot.Then there are the mistakes. Brian Mills finds the body of a main
character in his bed whom he tries to revive by patting the wrist! One
suspects the character was poisoned. Later, we are told the character's
throat was cut. Yet no blood anywhere! Don't get "Taken". Stay away from this stinker.
