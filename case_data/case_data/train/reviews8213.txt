A family action movie

Rather childish but will appeal to young audiences. Children 17 or
below will absolutely love it. The plot is really nice. It has a lot of
inflated action scenes which reminded me of the Transformers movies.
They obviously spent a lot of money making this movie. It doesn't
deviate much from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles story. It
contains all the main characters including Splinter, Shredder and April
O'Neil. It also presents us a background story with an explanation as
to how the mutant turtles were created. It doesn't promise more than
what it delivers. A very entertaining but rather lengthy movie with a
few funny scenes. They made sure through those funny scenes that we
understand those turtles are young teenagers. I definitely recommend it
to any parent who wants to take his or her kids to see a movie. I give
it a full 10.
