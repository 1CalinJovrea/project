A great film and welcome break from the jump scare flicks

I was getting pretty sick of those
jump-scare-there's-something-lurking-in-a-dark-corner style movies like
Insidious and the Conjuring. And Guillermo Del Toro must have thought
the same thing because Crimson Peak is a gorgeous looking Gothic style
movie with awesomely designed sets which have an incredible amount of
detail to them. This adds a great dark and brooding atmosphere to the
film and alleviates the need for these aforementioned jump scares. The
story is well written and has great characters played by Mia
Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston and other well cast actors. Unfortunately it
got only moderate critical reviews and was also somewhat ignored by the
audience in favor of Goosebumps no less. Damn kids, they ruin
everything! wink emoticonBut it might get a second life in the video circuit as people might
still discover this very enjoyable movie. Big thumbs up for me!
