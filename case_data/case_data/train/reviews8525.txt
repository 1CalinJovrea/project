Don't try to compare it to the book!

After seeing this film last night it is clear that they did not want to
make it like the book, and if they did they did an awful job in doing
so. There were so many characters missing along with so many enchanting
moments that made the book. With that being said the film itself was
outstanding. Great performances by all actors and just all around a job
well done. Had I not read the books I would have walked out giving it a
9/10. For me I am going to take the book series and the movie series as
two separate stories that are so close to being the same in that they
have the same story line. If others can do the same and try to just see
them as separate things than this could be a really successful movie
series.
