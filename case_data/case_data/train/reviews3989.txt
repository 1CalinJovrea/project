A bad horror movie if you really think about it

Thru out this movie my intention was to rate this around 6 or 7. But
the more the movie progressed I realized that it depended to much on
character development which in the end didn't pay off.A lot of the horror is implied and therefor looses a lot of shock value
and a strong feeling of tension. Also the movie has a lot of plot holes
and is really poorly explained. The whole movie thru I could not grasp
how this was all connected or even what the point was of it all.The most tensed scene was the killer trying to set the girl on fire but
that looked fake as hell (sorry for the pun)The actors and the chemistry between them was the best thing in this
movie I blame the writing or the execution of it why my rating is so
low.The same director made "the loved ones" and what I remember of it
that's the better one by far.I hope to see all involved go on an doing something better and although
i'm disappointed it is not a terrible watch.Maybe you get more out of this than me,if so...Enjoy.
