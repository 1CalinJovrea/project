Expected more

I am a bit of nerd of this kind of realistic science fiction movies and
therefore I had high expectations of this movie. I regret to say I was
disappointed.The movie tells the story of how the main character struggles to
survive on Mars and how the space agencies work to get them back. But I
was missing the emotions, the human touch. The main character never
displays any signs of loneliness, despair or fear. He is more like "oh,
looks like I'm stuck on Mars, let's grow potatoes". He makes a one- off
reference to his parents in an electronic communication, but nowhere in
the movie is it made clear what his main drive is to want to return to
Earth. It appears as nothing ties him there. Maybe the directors wanted
to avoid the cliché of the eight months pregnant and terminally ill
wife eagerly awaiting her husband's return from a dangerous mission,
but even a cliché had been better than nothing. His character is also
too flat. The only character trait that is highlighted slightly in the
movie is that he may be a bit too smug about himself. Nothing else to
make me identify or sympathize with him. To be honest, I couldn't have
cared less if he had not survived.The Mars landscape is beautifully rendered en very credible with dust
clouds and all. This is the main attraction of the movie.The main problem that there is nothing novel about this movie. There
have been better movies for every aspect of the film:Human aspect/psychology of being marooned in a strange place: Cast Away
did it so much better; set in space: Matt Damon's role in Interstellar
was more credible than his performance here. Space action scenes:
Gravity had me on the edge of my seat Ground control scenes: Apollo 13
already set the standardIn summary, the movie is a beautiful, but hollow shell.
