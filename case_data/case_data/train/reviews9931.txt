what a gem

in all honesty the reason i know about this film is because am sort of
fascinated with saoirse ronan and i follow all of her news, but
unfortunately this beautiful film hasn't got the fame it deserves in
contrast to all the other vampire movies, it's not like any other
vampire movie I've ever seen maybe due to the impeccable performances
by the leads and also the direction is leaning towards dark and drama
rather than teenage fantasies, i mean those vampires share a few traits
with the Hollywood sexy monsters, they feed on blood and they live
forever and that's it, they don't have super powers and they're not
super rich and they don't sparkle or burn in the sun, actually most of
the time i kept forgetting that am watching a vampire flick and just
got immersed in there stories and mysteries, what also drew me
completely into the film is the atmospheric nature and style the
director adopted and merged with the angelic music and the grim rainy
cloudy weather which helped deepen the edgy feeling of the story. this
is definitely a superior piece of art than interview with a vampire
just watch it and you'll get the feeling
