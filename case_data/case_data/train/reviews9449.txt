A Must See

Valerian and the city of a thousand planets is a must see movie for the
whole entire family. I saw Valerian in Real D 3D and it was Fantastic.
This was a great film that will keep your mind asking for more. I have
seen a lot of Sc Fi movies, but this has been the best one by far. The
acting was on point the whole time from the very start till the end
credits. Rihanna was great as her role as Bubble.Parents Valerian is rated Pg-13, but to be honest I did not see why
besides the action and the flirting between Valerian and his partner. I
really think the little ones will love this marvelous film full of
bright colors. This movie is one in the history books for being a unique film that was
a masterpiece for ever and everMy score for Valerian 10/10
