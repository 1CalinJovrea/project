Good Halloween movie when you don't really want to be scared

It's not scary so if that's what you want skip this one. But it was a
fun movie with a good amount of blood, some tension & excitement and a
fun story. It should probably be seen as a horror/comedy, not just a
horror. It's kind of like the horror movie your mom would have let you
watch when you were 12. Well I guess nowadays parents let their kids
watch Freddy & Jason at 5, but think back to the 70s or 80s, in fact my
mom probably wouldn't have let me watch it because of the amount of
blood & guts. It does have some terrific kills, original for sure! I
did think it was well done for what it was, acting was decent,
production was good. The pacing was gold! No lulls in this. From the
get go you care about this kid and whats going to happen to him. The
poor underdog that we all want to see come out on top. I'd give it an 8
of 10.
