We saw it so you don't have to.

Why did we go and see 'The Great Wall? Well we don't mind Matty Damon,
we, or at least me, don't mind the odd Chinese action pic, and we've
seen and walked along (a bit of) the real thing. AND there were
monsters and the shorts hinted at a suggestion of 'Starship Troopers',
the greatest movie ever made. And big walls are in the news! This is a
movie with nothing to redeem it. Look. Some of the costumes are OK. And
Matt Damon's sidekick might be called 'tow-bar and that was a funny
bit. But otherwise, nope.The dialogue is as if it may have been written in Chinese, gone through
a google translation into, say Finnish, and then another google
translation into English. There is a nameless order (who all have
names) and are colour-coded in order of their expertise (blue is for
bunjee jumping!).There are big, toothy iguanas who are ruled over by a ginormous female
frill-necked lizard. They (the lizards) are allergic to magnets. They
would have been heaps better Â– and more relevant - if they wore
sombreros and called each other Diego, Emiliano, Santiago and Juan
(Hwaaahn). And funnier too. And the frill-necked lizard coulda been
called 'Koylie and she could've had perky macguffies! Sadly, it was not
to be.There are hot air balloons too. Made of rice paper. Powered by hot air
made using gunpowder. What could go wrong? What indeed! They drop like
flies under a Mortein barrage.There are many more questions asked than are answered and those are
really not worth asking to the point that I can't remember what they
were.We left the movie nearly 2 hours closer to death. It was the sort of
movie that makes one dwell on this.
