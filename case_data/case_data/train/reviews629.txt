'The Croods' is a fresh tale that invigorates and entertains

'The Croods' is an enticing tale about an emotionally bonded family
living in the cave of a mountain. Grug,the head of the family is a
loving but overprotective father with one fierce motto-Survival and
that anything new is dangerous.At night he narrates stories to his
children that teach them not to indulge in their curiosities.His
daughter Eep however is a naturally inquisitive being who likes to
discover things for herself,a trait that her father doesn't
appreciate.Their cave gets destroyed and soon after they meet Guy,a
young laid back fellow who is a somewhat opposite of Grug .Guy is fun
and adventurous and has an uncanny ability to pop ideas out of nowhere
and do miraculous things like light a fire.The movie is all about how
the family along with or in many ways led by Guy embark on a journey to
find a better home,a better tomorrow.There are many likable things about 'The Croods'.For one the plot is
atypical and fresh.There are no villains here,just characters playing
their roles.You can feel a separate connection with each of these
characters.Even though for most he is against the idea,you know all
Grug is trying to do is keep his family safe.Nor can u fault Eep for
her natural curiosity or Guy for his inventive fun approach-There are
no bad guys here.The pace of the movie is fine.The animation and
effects aptly done and commendable.Nothing over the top or in your
face.The voice actors are an all star cast comprising of Nicolas
Cage(Grug),Emma Stone(Eep),Ryan Reynods(Guy) and others.They do a good
job.The characters are unique,intriguing and lovable at the same
time.What else? The animals.You will love them.The movie is also packed
with genuine humor that makes you laugh a lot.The animation captures
the emotions of the characters well.The background score is cool too.In all 'The Croods' is a happy feel good movie with plenty of
boisterous moments.An enjoyable watch.Go for it!
