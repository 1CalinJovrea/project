Shame on Metacritic and others

This is not just an excellent and entertaining movie, i found many
elements as real/istic and present, it is just touched some (maybe)
future elements. Neil pulled the maximum out of this story and made it
unforgettable as District 9 was.How ever, my stomach turns upside down when i see the Metacritic or
Rotten Tomatoes score, these pathetic sites and their brainless people
(called themselves "critics") live amongst us with their nonsense and
empty headed, braintumored criticism - sure, this movie has no Beverly
Hills and it's "amazing" crowd, no lemonade punch as story, no muscle
cars and no muscle people, no worldwide threat to the USA and such. It
has something else to say and this is the core of this amazing movie.Afterall, Chappie has Everything that needs for a unique and must-see
movie, sure, it is a target for all those (disgusting) critics who
expect the everyday boring lemonade with everyday boring actors and
actress.Shame on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, you guys are not more, than
just rotten and brainless second level scribblers.
