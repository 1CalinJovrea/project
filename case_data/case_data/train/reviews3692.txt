The Spectacular Young at Heart

The Spectacular Now is a coming-of-age drama mixed with young love
story about Sutter (Miles Kelly, an interesting, uncynical young find
who can communicate a lot of different sides to this character without
coming off too fresh or overwrought) who starts off obnoxious (but in
the way that is believable to the way that teenage boys can get
obnoxious) and in the wake of a failed relationship meets a good, sweet
girl, Amy, and a natural relationship unfolds in their senior year of
High School. While this is going on, he has a problem with alcohol -
which extends to Amy - and about a past history that Sutter has to
confront with a dead- beat father. The film that is very well written (based on a book but having that
same quality in the dialog and story turns that speaks to their
intelligence at navigating conventions) without being show-offy, and
performances that feel raw and sensitive and try to avoid a lot of
clich√©s (or that Hollywood way of showing teenagers "like we think they
are" as opposed to how they are closer to life), and a strong dramatic
story about young love and overcoming the flaws in yourself. It's not perfect, and has a few little things with the alcohol element
to the film that irked me (which is much bigger than what you may
realize seeing the trailer, much more actually, it's really a companion
piece with this director's previous movie Smashed which is also about
boozing), but its real and honest and that's so rare to find in a
teenage story like this. Woodley has a long career ahead of her, and
has that great distinction of being naturally pretty, dramatically
intuitive, and yet is not SO pretty that you can't accept her as a cute
teenager girl (or... dare I say Mary Jane in the next Spiderman movie?)
Go see it - it's not top 10 of the year great, but it's great in the
ways that matter for a story like this.
