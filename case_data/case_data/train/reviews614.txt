Exactly what you would expect

When I saw the trailer for Goosebumps I was intrigued in ways which
would remind me of stories I would watch as a child rummaging through
my thoughts of delightful young fantasies.Goosebumps is exactly what you would expect to see in a fiction and
fantasy based feature. Something which was not only unadulterated but
contained enough joy in it to remind one of their child hood(albeit
they were from the 90's era).I enjoyed the way the story was woven around R.L.Stein's monsters. As a
child when I stayed in the States for a year I would indulge myself in
the "Goosebumps" books. I was not expecting a visual extravaganza but
nonetheless I expected this movie to be a heart warming, child friendly
rendezvous with scary monsters who were just right enough to scare a
child but in a harmless way which was both fun and entertaining.Jack Black helps in retaining the core of the movie with this goofy and
wacky self. I hardly found a boring minute in the film and my wife
thoroughly enjoyed it as well.I would rate it 8 stars and recommend anyone to see it. Its a good
feature with all the essential ingredients thrown in it.
