I almost never cry in films...like I said, almost.

First off, this film is NOT like The Fault in Our Stars. It is NOT a
Romantic film and it is NOT about dealing with Cancer; this is a
friendship movie about a guy who enjoys films who has trained himself
to be as distant and as close to everyone becoming more empathetic and
focused, while building a connection with Rachel who is dying of
cancer. The lack of a love story may be where the film failed in
comparison, but it is still nevertheless emotional.The trio of characters, Greg, Earl and Rachel, all feel like people I'm
familiar with. Particularly, I see a lot with Greg, because I am fairly
like him and I know people like him, so to see his journey through the
film was something that a film like this works well BECAUSE this aspect
works well. Earl is the emotional grounding; he centres the film in his
and Greg's space, and becomes the voice and reason and social feelings.
Rachel is the person who Greg becomes deeply affected with overtime as
she goes through Chemotherapy. This film certainly succeeds in making
me like the main people. Even when Greg has his meltdown with Rachel
not wanting to keep up Chemo, his snapping back never stops making us
care for him.Now, the ending. After this movie, I went to see another film, and I
went to buy Popcorn, and the person at the till asked me "what's
wrong?" because I was crying. I just signaled the poster off to my
right - this movie - and she said "Oh, I know, right?" This ending is
truly sad, because in its bittersweetness, you see one story end and
another potentially begin. It's the kind of ending that closes
everything that we've seen, but opens a potential new one for Greg. The
visuals, the voice-over, the music made me sob buckets, and I genuinely
can sit through many things without getting emotional. This film is
definitely to be considered just for that one aspect of it, so see it,
but you WILL cry.
