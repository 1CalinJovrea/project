Unfunny and unromantic, with a miscast Jason Sudeikis

There's nothing new about a romantic comedy devoid of romance or
comedy, but what did strike me as a little odd was the casting of Jason
Sudeikis as a serial womanizer. He has a certain charm, I guess, but
he's no pin up. I wonder who the role was originally written for.The movie is about two late bloomers who meet in college and interrupt
each other before a sexual tryst: her with a jerk she will of course go
on to fall in love with, him with computer porn. They lose their
virginity with each other and don't meet for several years.Then, in the present day, the Alison Brie character is cheating with
the aforementioned jerk, while Sudeikis is beating off women with a
stick, apparently.We've all seen the movies, read the books, heard the songs, browsed the
blog posts about the woman who comes dangerously close to being snapped
up by the jerk while missing out on the guy who really loves her. It
may be a new trend for the "guy who really loves her" to be kind of a
jerk too, so you can't really tell what's so bad about the first jerk,
and you certainly don't care who they end up with.The movie had maybe two funny moments, and the touching/romantic stuff
fell flat even worse than the humour did.
