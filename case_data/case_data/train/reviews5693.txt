For those of us who've watched the previous 948 hours of . . .

. . . unique TMNT content, OUT OF THE SHADOWS is not exactly chock-full
of new revelations. Even casual fans have long tired of the TMNT Origin
Story, in which a hot coed named April off to her freshman year at
college is given a dorm-warming gift of four ordinary baby terrapins,
catches a seemingly fatal case of salmonella poisoning from them, and
is only saved when the Reptilarium under her hospital Death Bed is
attacked by an escaped but starving radioactive medical research lab
rat which bites each of the tiny tortoises in a thwarted attempt to
scarf down turtle maximum rare. Instead, the rodent and quartet of
amphibian brothers are super-sized, endowed with a whole raft of mutant
powers, and blessed with the ability to speak fluent American. Their
first order of business after this miraculous transformation is to
discover an antidote to salmonella, so that April can be saved to
become their liaison with Humanity, fulfilling the same role that
Renfield does for DRA(ULA. However, SHADOWS is a pretty tame TMNT
outing, with none of the characters needing to use the franchises safe
word--"Cowabunga"--until almost an hour (59:30) has elapsed. We do
learn here for the first time that "Notsomuch" is the brothers'
Transylvanian-sounding surname.
