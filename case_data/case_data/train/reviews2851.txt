Not about guilt

You won't find anything here about emails and it won't really elaborate
on the guilt question. It is almost like a documentary, showing what
happened on the ground, showing the desperation that existed. This does
take a while to set up the situation many may be familiar with from the
news and have heard and/or read about. But when it starts it's almost
impossible to take a breath.Just like the characters in this movie, you will be on the edge almost
all the time. And it's really well shot and to think that this actually
happened (probably some exaggerations aside), is really breathtaking.
So the based on real events tag, works like a "charm" here (if you
excuse the pun). Also if you were affected by this, it may be very
difficult to watch. If not, or if you want to watch a movie that really
captures agony and action in a nutshell, this is the one to watch.
