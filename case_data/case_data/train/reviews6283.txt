Shallow, empty

I was waiting for this movie for a few weeks and was greatly
disappointed when I finally watched it.It doesn't matter if the number of potatoes to survive is accurate, if
you are using toxic rocket fuel to make water, you do not feel lonely
and isolated, and you are not worried about oxygen - you are just
having fun - isolated for 300-500 days without anyone or anything else
around - the guy seems pretty comfortable and not worried.Impossible to connect with characters. Too many stereotypes. Blatant
sales and marketing, actor and story picks for the sake of selling more
tickets.I hope I will save my money and time, next movie like this comes out.
