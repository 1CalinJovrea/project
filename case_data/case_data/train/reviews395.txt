The movie rails off into an unwanted territory

The characters all end up committing heinous acts that throughout the
runtime of two films would lead you to think is completely unlike them
at all. Not only is the final act a giant figurative middle finger to
the audience, but it also decides to give all the characters completely
new personalities just to be able to create a shocking ending. What is
so infuriating about the ending, is that there was no built-up or
anything suggesting that the characters were capable of doing these
acts. It is not as if only one character were to do something that is
"outside of their character," but it is pretty much everyone in the
movie decides to do something completely unlike themselves all at the
same time, just to be able to have an unsatisfying climactic
conclusion. Other than the final act, the other scenes also seem to
delve more into fetishism instead of focusing on the central "problem,"
which is her sex addiction (or nymphomania). The movie rails off into
an unwanted territory and brings all 4+ hours of these two volumes to
not only a disappointing ending, but also an ending that is insulting
to its audience.
