Pee Wee Heman Loves This Movie

No one should see this movie, EVER. It is literally the corniest "spy"
movie ever put out into the world and is on point as far as shitiness
with Garbage Pail Kids. It should have ended as soon as Jack was shot
at from behind in the hotel room and somehow dodged the bullet, but
even if he survived this, DEFINITELY after he confessed him being in
the CIA to his fianc√©/wife/girl/doctor/unbelievably acted role played
by keira knightley. How does Jack go from being a CIA analyst to being
fully operative, able to drive at high rates of speed in a city he's
never been in within a matter of a day, and why was the bomb at the end
of the movie set for 5 minutes? 30 plus years of planning for a
downfall of the US in 2014, with a well plotted attacked on NYC by some
Russian with stage 3 psorasis and a VODKA problem or whatever and the
bomb was set to 5 minutes. GTFO. I'm done commenting because this has
already taken too much of my time but please listen to this, and save
your money/time/wasted energy and do ANYTHING else.
