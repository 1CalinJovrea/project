Lots of anachronisms for one thing....

I agree with the earlier review ..."..our last chance to revisit it,
even for a few hours, is taken away..." Yep. I read the book soon after
its publication and, like the above reviewer, only remember the
intensity, the poetry. My memory is that there was no real story line.
But wonderful evocations of crossing the country in the old Hudson, at
night...something about the feeling of being in that capsule. Just one
of the many quibbles I have with this movie is that it showed us the
Hudson speeding across the screen from left to right...an exterior
view. Nothing of the romance of being in the car as it hurtled along.
Lots of scenes of Dean driving dangerously, but that tells us something
about Dean...that isn't what the book was saying about being in the
car.Okay. Anyway..anachronisms...I graduated high school in 1957. I remember the hair cuts for girls...I
was one of them. Marylou did not wear the cut shown in the movie. No
long layers. Long hair , yes, but not long layers. That's very
contemporary...It's distracting. Ever hear of "pin curls?"Restaurant servers did not start saying "Enjoy" until at least the
90's. Remember the carefully recreated restaurant toward the end of the
movie...the middle aged, somewhat overweight waitress in the red
uniform? Never would she have said "enjoy." I think some of the cars seen rushing from one side of the screen to
the other in the early part of the movie were not available in the late
40's. Looked like Chevys from about 1953.So much was carefully done...the paint peeling in the old Victorians
when Victorians were low rent...yes! That very restaurant mentioned
above.Come on, there are lots of us still living. Hire a consultant next
time.
