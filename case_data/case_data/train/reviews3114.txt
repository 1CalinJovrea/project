Humdrum, tedious, ho hum and whatever else thesaurus.com suggests as being synonymous with boring.

The idea of the film is great, they are exploring a side of cinema
never before explored, however I feel that taking on this task should
have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this
collage of rubbish together. Forgive me if I've missed anything, but I
feel that I spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude,
ill-mannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life. I spent
the entire film looking for the "beauty" or "the message" in this
"masterpiece" and left with a distinct feeling that the people who
produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they
thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up, nothing
bloody happened.My definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something,
which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration, something which
makes you think about an interesting topic. I was present for my
growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than
this fake Hollywood crap. Also it would have been nice for it to have
had an ending, or some sort of redeeming quality, like an announcement
that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this
film wasn't genuinely being considered great (IMDB rating 9.0?!, maybe
that's a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in
Hollywood is laughing at us.)Unfortunately the minimum rating is 1/10 whereas I believe negative
possibilities would have been appropriate. In ancient Rome they had no
concept of negative numbers, I feel that seeing this film would have
progressed their discovery of this side of 0. Don't see this film please, and for goodness sake don't let it win any
Oscars, I don't want the industry to be polluted with films like this.
