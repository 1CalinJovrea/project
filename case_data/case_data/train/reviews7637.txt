I'm not a big fan of South Korea movies or TV shows but I love zombie
movies so I try this one and I didn't disappointed as a zombie movie
fan!Train to Busan is such a great ride, Well Written, A lovely
cinematography, wonderful performances with the main cast, and
especially unbelievable performance with the zombie actors to this
film!This is the film that you will never forget this year because its all
in one movie, FUN RIDE, ACTION RIDE, SUSPENSE RIDE AND DRAMA RIDE!
Hollywood zombies films I think you need to think twice now because
South Korea zombies will eat you alive!4over5
