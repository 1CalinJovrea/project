I really enjoyed this funny and heart-warming movie about a chef and
his relationship with food and his son. The film is worth about 8.5 in
my books. The current IMDb score is roughly accurate, despite the
inexplicably negative reviews and voting of a tiny minority.Leguizamo and Vergara light up every scene they're in. Quite a few
A-list Hollywood stars are in this movie, but it's not a Hollywood
movie at all. The performances by all the main and supporting actors
were excellent. When I try to single one or two out, I just start
thinking about how good the others were too.You feel like the movie had no script at all, that's how natural the
writing was. Remarkably clich√©-free.I was subtly but deftly moved at the end. This is an optimistic guy
movie but women will enjoy it as well.Kudos to Favreau (of course) and to everyone else involved in this
film. I have a new respect for Favreau and will watch out for his films
in the future.
