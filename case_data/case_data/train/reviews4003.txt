Likable cast and feel good story

The fact that such a likable collection of actors and actresses is
assembled should indicate this movie is worth a watch.Although the story isn't ground breaking it's not irritating and
doesn't lose steam. It's a story about a writer (Kinnear) and his
family and their romantic and family relationships.The daughter is played by Lily Collins who is very pretty and acts
well. The still very beautiful Jennifer Connelly looks like she could
be her mother in real life with their dark hair and thick eyebrows -
good casting. Wish she would act more these days. Greg Kinnear is quite
writer like with his beard but he looks a little too scruffy. Nat Wolff
as the son is a bit dorky looking for such an attractive family. Liana
Liberato is a bit irritating as the druggie girlfriend though. Patrick
Schwarzenegger has a small role as a jerk boyfriend of Liana. Logan
Lerman play's Lily's sweet boyfriend.Everyone is kind of nice and sweet even when they aren't being nice and
it's refreshing to see a movie with nice people and a watchable cast.
