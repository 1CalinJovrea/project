Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.

Wow! Now this is a Horror cult classic! I haven't seen a movie like
this in years! It was certainly a great surprise! While people compare
this movie to Gremlins I guarantee you it is nothing like Gremlins.
This movie is its own movie! The acting was top notch, even when there
were elements of cheesiness that occurred they all managed to keep it
great! The director also did "Trick Or Treat" which is another
Halloween cult classic. But Krampus surpasses "Trick Or Treat" by a
long shot. The story was good, and it keeps you really glued to the
screen wandering what will happen next. There are also many scenes that
are hilarious. Most of the humour came from Aunt Dorothy. Many people online will complain that the characters/actors were too
unbelievable and so unlikeable. This is the whole point of the movie.
This is a story of a broken with family with no love, no respect and no
desire to love Christmas. And then Krampus comes to town! The Practical Effects were used so well. I like the fact there was no
CGI used for this movie (with the exception of the Ginger Bread Men).
It's kept old school, and it never fails to amaze us. Without spoiling anything...the story does start out quite slow. But as
soon as the blizzard hits...you know you're in for the roller-coaster
ride. Kramous's minions are awesome and scary, to say the least! When
Krampus's appears his face will give you nightmares! The ending was
very original and very unexpected. I really hope this becomes a movie
(like Home Alone) that comes on TV every year for all of us to
appreciate the spirit of Christmas! All in all, it is a cult classic
and it was quite a surprise on how good it was. Had no idea this would
be a movie I would love so much. Really highly recommended! 4.5/5
stars. -Autistic Jay
