The sad case of Less being More. Spoiler Free.. Keepin the Mystery Alive

"Do you know what the cure for the human condition is?" A phrase we
often hear in one form or another in this Picture, which Perfectly
describes what this Film seems to be about, narrowed down to its Bone
at least; totally in contrast to what the Official Synopsis says "An
ambitious young executive is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an
idyllic but mysterious "wellness center" at a remote location in the
Swiss Alps, but soon suspects that the spa's treatments are not what
they seem." To tell you, the reader, as little as possible, if you are
Watching this Film you are on a Hunt of a Visually Stunning and Sound
technically Well crafted Film that sadly seem to lack Focus and feels
way too long. What hurt my Love for the Cinema really Bad is that i was
able to see through its flaws that this Film could have become a really
good, even Great Mystery Horror Thriller, which i would have proudly
given an 8/10 but due to its unforgiving longevity with many
unnecessary "filler" scenes and over explaining where you don't need
any explanation at all, Plot elements that could have been cut out of
the Movie and an Introduction that would have benefited of being cut
down to 5-10 Mins. With the Way the Movie has been Shot it either would
benefit from being cut down to a Maximum of 110 Min's instead of 146,
or becoming an 8 Part mini series, as for the simple reason that the
film gives so much possibilities of where the Story could go but
instead keeps teasing until the Unfulfilling Finally that looses its
Impact for way to much going on before dragging us the Viewer to its
Twist Ending that becomes weird when we are reminded of what was the
whole Purpose our main character got to this mysteries Place, right
before Finally hitting the Credits.I Hope that someday the director has the possibility to re-cut the Film
or one ambitious Fan Honours us with a Fan Edit that shortens and Cures
this Film down to its Potential by loosing roughly 30 Min's of illness.I give this Film a 5/10 due to its ambitions and Scope but failing due
to its own weight and longevity
