Engrossing Escape

Yes there are plenty of plot holes in the movie, written by John J.
Mclauglin (Hitchcock, Black Swan) and directed by Taylor Hackford (Ray,
An Officer and a Gentleman), but I still found it to be an entertaining
and exciting film that I could just escape into.Jason Statham does his usual schtick as the charismatic, frenetic, and
fearless Parker. He a professional thief with his own code of ethics
and rules. After leading a multi-million dollar robbery of the Ohio
State Fair offices, things go awry as he and his partners-in-crime
escape.His criminal partners, led by Milander ( Michael Chiklis), want him to
re-invest his share of the loot into their next caper and won't take no
for an answer. In the getaway car, a shoot-out ensues and Parker is
shot and left for dead by the side of the road. Of course, he doesn't
die and soon will be hunting down his former gang members.Finding out they're in Palm Beach, Florida, he disguises himself as a
rich Texan looking to buy a mansion there. This is where he comes
across Leslie, superbly and bravely portrayed by Jennifer Lopez. She's
a fledgling real estate broker, recently divorced and desperate for a
commission so she can prevent her car from being repo'd.She actually sets back the women's equality movement a few decades with
this character. She's terribly naive, ditsy, and seductive as she
literally throws herself at Parker wanting his business and his body.
Even when Parker reveals somewhat what the "game" is, she's still on
board. What follows is really a fantasy as Parker seeks to exact his revenge
against his former gang and anyone else who gets in his way, including
the Chicago mob. As you might expect there's plenty of violence and
bloodshed along the way. There's even some humor laced into the film,
perhaps even in parts that it wasn't intended.All in all, this film is not for everyone, but it struck me the right
way and I enjoyed it.
