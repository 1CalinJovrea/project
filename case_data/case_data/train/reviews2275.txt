Perfectly enjoyable film, just not outstanding or remarkable

Absolutely Anything is a funny enough light comedy that seems better
thanks to its notorious cast but unfortunately is a bit subdued to
'wow'.Simon Pegg plays Neil Clarke, an unassuming teacher who has a crush on
his neighbor and hates his job and boss. Little does he know that
aliens are circling the planet, ready to put it to the test. One lucky
human gets the power to do absolutely anything, and if they use the
power for good then great, if they use it for bad, well then the aliens
blow up the planet. Seems fair enough.For those Jim Carrey fans out there, the idea behind Absolutely
Anything is strikingly similar to 2003's Bruce Almighty. But unlike the
Americans, the Brits are far more restrained in their use of absolute
power and complete command of the universe. Neil just wants the simple
things, to mess with his friends and maybe improve his work and body
sitch. In fact, the ways in which Neil uses his complete power is
almost too restrained and basically ends up making the film feel like a
missed opportunity.There are several decisions the producers made that really optimized
the film, like getting the Monty Python gang to voice the aliens and
Robin Williams to voice Neil's pet dog Dennis. Between their comedy
chops and Simon Pegg, it seems impossible for this film to be bland,
but it is. It seems as though the film strictly follows the script,
leaving very little improvisational wiggle room which is where all the
aforementioned talents shine. The comedy of Absolutely Anything is
fine, entertaining and delightful, but not memorable or laugh- out-
loud funny either.Ultimately, Absolutely Anything suffers from a lack of creativity and
originality in its comedy. It is amusing but average, and in the sea of
films released annually, you won't even give it a second thought.Please check out our website for reviews of all the recent releases.
