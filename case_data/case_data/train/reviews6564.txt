It amazes me how a film like this has such a high rating

Raw or Grave (original title) is a French horror film about
cannibalism. This is not the first time I'm drawn to French films of
this genre, for instance Martyrs and High Tension are only a few I
could mention that are definitely worth a watch.Unfortunately Raw doesn't deliver. It tried to be disgusting and I
guess it is but shock value doesn't really work if you don't have a
decent plot/story-line. During the film it is noticeable it tried to be edgy and over the top
but it fails miserably. It's just a bunch of nonsense with an awful
soundtrack in the mix. For instance in one scene the sister of the main character (forgot the
name) jumps in front of a car, killing the passengers and proceeds to
eat them. Luckily no more cars pass by while she was feeding herself
and luckily in France the police is nonexistent which explain why she
can kill so many people without any suspicion whatsoever.I could go on and on.In conclusion if you like annoying music, young adults trying to be
edgy and people biting each other because it's lunch time, then this is
for you.
