Love Denzel In Any Movie But This Was Awesome

The movie was action packed and I love when the good guy always win.
The character don't talk much but you can only pull that off if you are
a good actor. The young actress I hear she is 17 did an amazing job to
play that part.Denzel no words you still got the box office power. My
husband ex marine he would not stop hollering when one scene came up he
gets a kick out of that stuff. Never seen the Equalizer series at all
so my opinion is from the movie only. Sequel is wide open lets have
more next year. Hope to see more. Love It. Hope the DVD be out for a
Christmas Present for the husband I will be buying it. All I can say is
go see this movie because it is very good don't listen to the haters.
