6
It;'s Groundhog's Day

Take the 1993 classic Bill Murray flick and make the short furry guy
the star minus the comedy and include lots of guns and you have Edge of
Tomorrow. Interesting in theory except it completely throws the entire
concept of linear time out the window with the 2nd or 3rd revival. If
the actions of a single person do not change the outcome of everyone
around them then this movie makes perfect sense. Why altering ones
choices does not result in a completely different outcome is completely
against the theory it is based on (but it is still entertaining to
watch which is why it got a 6 instead of much lower). If looking for
something intellectually stimulating this is not the answer. Want stuff
that blows up and is loosely based off of sci-fi folk-lore this is the
movie for you!!!
