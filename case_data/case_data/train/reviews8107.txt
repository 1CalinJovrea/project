A Great Follow-Up To A Cult Classic

Whatever people are saying this movie is great follow up to the first
and i cant say how they could have made it any better. I think this
movie did the best that it could, I mean I don't think everybody who
have seen it thinks it is as good as the first, of course. It is
impossible to make such a classic as Trainspotting and then make a even
better follow up. All that aside this was a great movie and I can't find any good reason
for this is a bad movie. This movie was really f***ing funny, and it
was really beautiful in a strange way, and it still had the same
feeling from the first. First of all it was just crazy to see all the
same characters together again, and I really think they did a great job
with the whole movie. I think it also really got deeper in to the first
Trainspotting and explained many things to the people who haven't read
the book, and you just got to know the characters so much better.When I went in to see it, I was ready for this movie to be terrible,
but I just couldn't stop myself from liking it. The movie is not as
tough as the first one, but i think it has just as much comedy (if not
more) as the first. If you are a fan of Trainspotting you need to see
this movie, and again it is not as good as the first, but it comes as
close to as possible. Anyway it was an amazing experience to watch all
the same characters going through the same streets as the first and I
think they did it as good as they were able to. I wanna finish by saying, I think any fan of Trainspotting, should see
this movie as soon as possible, with an open mind and know it is very
different from the first, but still the old Trainspotting feeling. I
hope you found this review helpful, and I hope you will love the movie
as much as I do. 9/10
