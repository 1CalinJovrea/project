I can not believe this got such a high rating It was so pathetic and
predictable. In the beginning it was tolerable to watch, then it became
so predictable it was annoying. Then it just got to be in one word
"DISAPPOINTING" Typical US rubbish of one side can shoot and kill from
any position and the other cant shoot a barn door from 1 foot away.In the end it leaves the option open for a follow up movie after he
gets shot stabbed in the back and stabbed in the heart but manages to
walk away at the end dressed as Fire fighter.I am truly sorry but the previous reviewers must have never watched a
decent thriller movie before "EVER".
