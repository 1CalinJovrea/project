Atomic Blonde Review

Atomic Blonde is what you get when you mix the Cold War, James Bond,
John Wick and a hint of Scott Pilgrim. Being based off  of the 2012
graphic novel: "The Coldest City" by Antony Johnston, this colourful
yet bleak world has a great stand-out personality with neon spray paint
that sprays the intro and credits as you enter the end of the Cold War,
but the beginning of a new threat that emerges when the KGB get their
hands on a list of every active MI6 agent in the Soviet Union.  Enter
Lorraine Broughton, a A-class MI6 spy with icy blonde hair and a habit
of taken constant baths of water and ice as she's held under
interrogation about her last mission in Berlin. The story is very
complex with a ton of twists and turns so I won't write anything
spoiler related here but I can say this, be ready for one roller
coaster of a story and the need to rewatch this title twice or maybe
even a few times more.Action in Atomic Blonde makes James Bond look like Mr Bean. Gun shots
and punch impacts feel really beefy and many of the fight scenes keep
you on your feet as Lorraine and her foes have the endurance of Olympic
athletes rather then the latter being rag-dolls. Fight scenes are also
just the right amount of bloody and brutal and definitely warrant the
15 rating. The use of sound is absolutely the winner in this film.Music in Atomic Blonde does work in the moment with music like "99 Red
Balloons" in German playing during an interrogation scene to add some
light-heartedness to the graphic beat-up of a captive under the KGB.
But the film was so fast-paced in it's action that I couldn't keep
track of the music all that often as it was like a raging buffalo
rampaging past a talented Mexican band.I had (excuse the pun) a blast with Atomic Blonde thanks to it's balls
to the walls action scenes and captivating in the moment music. Like I
said before, the film may need a few rewatches to get the plot but this
is one film that should metaphorically be the next film you see next in
your film watchlist.
