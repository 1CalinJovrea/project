"Maudie" An Unusual and Brilliant Love Story

Maud (Sally Hawkins) is different...and she's been treated as someone
who is not only different, but not capable. Having had enough of this,
she ventures out on her own and takes a job as a housekeeper for a
local fish monger (Ethan Hawke). The two have an unusual relationship,
but like knots in a rope, they work themselves out and they find a
strong bond. Her artistic skills are allowed to flourish and thanks to
the keen eye of a summer resident, her popularity grows."Maudie" is one of those films that just makes you feel good throughout
its entirety. Even with the harsh realities that seem to be inflicted
upon Maud, nothing can quell the light that shines so brightly from
within this effervescent woman. She's smart, witty, and talented, all
blanketed by her shyness and humble attitude.This is a beautiful film, from the style to the narrative, creating
what we love about going to the movies...it pulls you into the story,
allowing you to truly care, connect, and love the characters, and in
the end, have knowledge about a remarkable artist. I haven't been this emotionally connected to and moved by a film since
"Philomena." With exceptional performances and a well-told story, this
is a film not to be missed.
