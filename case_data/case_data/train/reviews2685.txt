Unspeakable

Impossible to fully explain what a terrible waste of talent this film
is. I cannot offer one word of praise for this stinker. First it is
pathetically predictable, all the jokes are terrible, and the people
responsible for the script should be deeply and irrevocably ashamed of
themselves. Don't waste your time. Take a nap. Read a book, even the
phone book to avoid watching this mess. Hackneyed, physically ugly, and
devoid of joy. Simply horrible.I didn't like it.
