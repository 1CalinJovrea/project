The movie is not worth the two hours of your time!!!

All the series of The Hunger Games had a main element which was the
emotion for "riots", "stand up for what is yours" while we all, mostly
me expected the FINAL episode of The Hunger Games this to be the most
expressed element they lacked of it a lot. Most of us while watching
the the movie will find it boring impatiently waiting for what will
happen at the end. It is disappointing to see such an awful final movie
of the series Mockingjay. If i was the director when i would be seeing
the movie for the first time i would not publish and either make a
whole new film or not publish it at all. This film is meant for teenage
girls which "fall in love" deeply in some of the characters and it
disappointed all other "fans" which were having big expectations for
the final film.
