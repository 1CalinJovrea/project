How bad can a plot twist be?

Iron man 3 is not completely fresh in my mind considering I saw the
movie over a month a go, but it was a movie to remember.Iron Man 3 was the first movie on my list of anticipated movies for
summer 13, and I thought it was a delight. Robert Downey Jr. was great
in the suit as usual. He steals every scene, charms you, and is an
overall funny guy. War machine ( haha) had good chemistry with stark
and remained a relevant supporting character.I am a big Guy Pearce fan! I loved him in movies such as: memento, hurt
locker, and la confidential. He was good as an actor in this film, but
I felt they could have made him a little deeper of a villain. Which
brings us to the supposed downfall of this film. The Mandarin. Die hard
fans of the Mandarin will be disappointed as ever by the mandarin in
Iron Man 3. He appears as a large threat and as a ruthless terrorist in
the first half of the film. Halfway through the movie you actually find
out he is a drunken actor. In the end, no one can deny Iron Man 3,
unless your a Mandarin purist. 9/10
