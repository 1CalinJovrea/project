Way too good for the franchise lovers.

This movie is just absolutely action-packed, fun, has lot of
''WOOOAAAAAH'' moments and definitely better than any other film in
this box office. If you follow the f&f franchise. You are going to love
the plot twists and explanations in this movie. The chemistry between
Dwayne - Jason is just over the top and their scenes are just fun and
action- packed. Been following the franchise for 16 years now and can
say this movie is definitely on my top 6 list. Watch it on IMAX with
big screen, loud sound and with popcorn if possible.
