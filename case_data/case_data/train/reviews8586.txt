Where was the plot?

I really tried to liked or at least understand this movie but it seem
to be an impossible task. I keep it brief - imagine that the screenplay
is written by several schizophrenics who fight over whether they write
a comedy, drama, melodrama or anything in between throughout the film.
Characters come and go without realizing what they should bring to the
story. Add poor Isabella Rossellini to the mix (the most bizarre act I
have seen in years) who has lines so unbearably surreal no one could
possibly carry them without looking like a lunatic. Add nightmarish
soap opera merging with the plot. Boom! No sense what-so-ever. Jennifer
tried really hard to keep this scrambled mess of a movie bearable and
to watch she is only reason it is not a complete disaster. I feel dizzy
now!
