not very good

Rebecca Hall does an excellent job as a naive bookie in Lay. The other
actors, Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Vince Vaughn are great
in their supporting roles, but.... This movie was poorly written: the
jokes fall flat, the script doesn't develop enough so that the audience
can care about the characters, the gambling is explained only enough so
that gamblers can understand what the actors are doing and there is
very little plot action that's not inside an office looking at TV
screens with sports games on them. Stephen Frears, the director, has
done some major work such as "the Queen," and "High Fidelity," and i
would think he was brought in to save this, but it's shot so plainly,
like a made for TV movie. I get the feeling that this was filmed in a
couple weeks and everyone involved wanted to get it over with as
quickly as possible. I give it 3 out of 10 for Rebecca Hall's efforts
and the fact that she comes off as incredibly sexy, but other then
that, it's totally forgettable.
