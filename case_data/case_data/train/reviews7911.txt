Contraband- 5 category review

Directing 6/10- Some unique and intriguing shots, but nothing too
rememberable Acting 8.5/10- The acting is the category that without a
doubt, stole the show. Solid efforts from the entire cast but the film
really benefited from tremendous performances from Ribisi and Landry
Jones. Screenplay 4/10- The screenplay is fun no doubt and benefits
from decent pacing and a few intense action sequences but the film
lacks originality, stealing concepts and at times, lines. Visual
effects 5/10- The visual effects were average. I can't completely fault
a film for not using unnecessary visuals. Sound effects/Music 5/10- The
sound effects were fine, nothing misplaced there. The music was again
just OK, sometimes the music was great and mixed well with the action
going on but in some the haunting/emotional scenes the music didn't
make the scene 'better', which is what it should do. Overall, the film
is just another forgettable action film. The film has decent enough
story (though clich√©), with great acting and some fun action sequences
that make the film at least worth a viewing.
