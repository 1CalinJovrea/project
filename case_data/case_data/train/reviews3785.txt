Amazing film. No story.

Honestly, this in the strangest way one of the best films I have seen.
There isn't really any story line apart from 3 guys throw a party and
basically, it goes really well, then bad then worse.But the film itself. It's such a different film and I think that's why
it appeals, it isn't your standard party gone wrong film. The way its
filmed from loads of different cameras and the humor in it is very
funny.I found myself cringing when stuff was going wrong as you feel as if
you're at the party! This is why I think it will appeal to the younger
generation rather than the older. Afterwards it gives you a real buzz. Would recommend this film to
anyone!
