Storytelling traded for Porn

Very rarely I comment on IMDb, but I felt this was necessary. The film
is an excuse for porn, if there was just half the amount of turning
points, character development, surprise, tension, deeper meaning... as
there is uncensored penis and pussy, this film may have saved itself
from the hall of shame in post-modern storytelling. Frankly, I don't like the attitude of putting someone down, I'd rather
recognise my own shadow and deal with that internally... but it comes
down to more than a matter of subjectivity when a film that lacks any
type of spiritual or even psychological depth makes its way to the
screen. Aristotle turns in his grave.
