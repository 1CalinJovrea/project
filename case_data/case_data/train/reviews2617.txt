8
13 Hours that didn't have to be...

For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military
service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the
characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well
protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but,
that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to
protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.I am well versed on the facts as provided by the MSM however, as
someone in the biz I also know that the fly in the ointment are the
facts.1. The firing of mortars is an art and the mortar launcher has to be
anchored to the ground or every mortar will land off target. The
mortars landing on the CIA compound are dead accurate and also require
spotters to assist with any corrections.2. Aviano AB, Italy is about 2-hours away. Had they been launched, even
if only to do a low fly-by, would have driven off the attackers; just
like I used them in Iraq in Mosul, Tikrit, and Baghdad. I don't know
why the Commander of the 555 (Triple Nickel) didn't launch. It's one of
the big questions that remain unanswered by the media or the movie.3. Hillary's statement that, "Was it because of a protest or was it
because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill
some Americans?" was a red herring. Because it was neither. As later
testimony bore out, it was a planned, coordinated, terrorist attack on
the anniversary of 9/11.4. All UAS aircraft are armed. As stated in the movie could have
assisted in the defense of the embassy or the CIA compound.5. General Ham, AfricaCom CC is someone I worked with in Mosul in 2004
for 6-months. Good guy and I know from my experience he would not
hesitate to act if allowed. One day he'll give an interview and get his
whole story. Can't wait...Rick274 Colonel (Retired) 274ASOS/CC
