Inside the perceptive stoner

Yeah, probably : under the paving stones, the beach. But we'll never
know. The 60's are over, the dream is gone and the pavement which
imprisons it is thick. Pynchon's vision and nostalgia are summed into
this genius slogan from May 68 events in Paris. As for the movie, well,
it is almost impossible to review. There's too much going on in. I
thought it was the finest and most complex blend of comedy, drama,
historical, cultural and political recalls I have seen in years. It is
utterly funny if you do not mind not catching every bit of the plot.
Some shots and most of the dialogues are truly beautiful, every single
moment involving Shasta in particular. You will need to pay attention
at the details, at what's going on in the background and offscreen. I
can only urge you to go see it.
