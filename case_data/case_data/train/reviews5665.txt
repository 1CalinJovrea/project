One of my favorites of the year

"Saving Mr. Banks" is easily one of the best movies to come out this
year. It tells the tale behind the making of Disney's beloved classic
"Mary Poppins," but it is so much more than just a typical 'making of a
movie' movie. While many of these types of films aren't as good as the
movie they are about, this one is different. It feels like a companion
piece to the beloved classic. It allows us to appreciate the trials and
tribulations Disney had to go through to make his magnum opus. However,
it is also more about P.L. Traverse and why she loves her character so
much and why Mary Poppins holds such a special place in her heart.Director John Lee Hancock does a great job of making this film
something truly special. He balances witty humor with emotional depth,
but does so without being too sappy or melodramatic. The film is also
well written by being more personal than just being a movie about
making a movie. The themes of letting and moving on are handled well
and really becomes relatable to anyone watching.The performances are top-notch. Tom Hanks makes a pretty good Disney
and he isn't sugar coated either. The real standouts are Emma Thompson
and Colin Farrell. They give strong dimensional performances that makes
us truly care and sympathies with the characters.Overall "Saving Mr. Banks" is a truly great and beautifully told film.
Its individual parts may not be the years best, but as a complete film
it is the whole package. It's a movie that exemplifies why we go to the
movies and what Disney stands for as an entertainment corporation. It
is a movie that is equal parts heartfelt, witty, charming,
entertaining, and emotionally satisfying. I give it 5/5
