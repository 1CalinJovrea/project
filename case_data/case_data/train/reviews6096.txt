Dull as dishwater

I was so let down by this movie.I had been really looking forward to
this and had been harping on to my wife about it for weeks.When we got
to see it she actually fell asleep watching it, to be fair i really
don't blame her it has to be one of the most boring movies i have
watched in quite some time.I really liked the soundtrack and the way the era was captured in many
scenes but besides that the whole film was a massive let down.I was
really excited by the cast and reviews were really good i don't think i
was wrong to have high expectations but i never imagined i would be so
disappointed.I watched it again a second time to try and give it a
chance, big mistake it was still just as terrible the second time
around i could not find any humour in a film described as a comedy.The two children are painful.Two mentally disturbed kids who fall in
love, to be honest they don't even seem like they even remotely like
each other let alone have developed a sense of love.Major let down.
