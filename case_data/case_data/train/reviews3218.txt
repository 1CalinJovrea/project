Practically magical in every way!

This is a huge movie, seriously huge. You can tell the Disney animation
studio really put mountains of effort and it shows they're firing from
all cylinders now. Music and awesome sisterhood story separate this
from many animation offerings of the past. Also the computer generated
animation is really cool, pun intended. The quality is top. I have a
sister and so i felt this deep connection to this feature. I won't lie
i was moved to tears. I ended up visiting my sis and giving her a huge
hug which totally caught her off guard. I am really happy to see a
movie that can connect worldwide and with something so simple and
profound and that is sibling bond and its special quality is
demonstrated really amazingly and with a lot of tenderness. I have been
singing part of your world and reflection for years and i feel that let
it go and most songs i will be singing for years to come. It was new
and yet nostalgic and took me back to my childhood years and recreated
the spirit of the movies i adored tenfold. It has something for
everyone and that is why i loved it so much. Everything from action and
romance and comedy and fantasy and not forgetting the tears. Many
movies from Disney are always uplifting and this one was even more so
and that made this a very special experience.
