Psychological allegory on Sir Walter Scott's famous lines

"Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive!" A
depressed college professor knocks up his new girlfriend and has to
untangle the double-life that he apparently doesn't know he's living
because he's got split-personality disorder.The main character is portrayed in the film as two different (but
identical) people. He is a college professor with a girlfriend. He has
developed a split personality due to depression with his mundane life.
His new persona is a bit-part film actor with a fast motorcycle and a
6-months pregnant lover. Now he's got to figure out how to dump his old
girlfriend. This movie is how his old self "discovers" his new self,
how the new self confronts the old life and the physical fight for
which persona (and which girlfriend) will "survive".It's an artsy-psychological tale with sparse dialog and lots of
confused hints of an actual plot. The unsatisfying surprise-ending
seemed like a lame attempt to explain all of the "tangled web". I felt
no empathy for the disturbed main character. I was emotionally
un-invested and intellectually disappointed.
