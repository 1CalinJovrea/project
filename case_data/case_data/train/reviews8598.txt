a very particular set of skills

In London, Quan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan) takes his daughter dress
shopping and she's killed in a terrorist bombing claimed by the Irish
UDI. Northern Ireland government deputy minister Liam Hennessy (Pierce
Brosnan) is a former UDI leader who knows nothing about the bombing. He
fears upcoming pardons being endangered and an unraveling of the
political peace accord. Mr. Quan confronts Hennessy in his own way
demanding names.Jackie leaves behind his comedic skills. He replaces his fun style of
kung fu fighting to deliver some darker fights and a more dramatic
performance. I'm more convinced than ever that he should be doing a
seriously dark Death Wish reboot. He's ready for this acting turn. This
is good for his career and hopefully, somebody has a good franchise for
the man. Brosnan is a great foil playing a two-faced character. This is
a thriller with action. It's a throwback to the 90s including the IRA
replacements. They should have simply done a period piece which would
be even better.
