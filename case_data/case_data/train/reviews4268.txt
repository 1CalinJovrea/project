A great romance and a decent horror

- Excellent cinematography and costume, I was surprised this movie
costs only 55m$ dollar.- The whole movie is creepy but not many jump scares. However, for a
romantic drama, this is scary enough.- The cast is amazing, Tom H, Mia W, Jessica C all did remarkably good
job.- The sex scene is a little bit funny, silly to be more exact.- The first part of the movie is too cheesy, but it gets more
complicated and intense over time.- Overall, this movie is OK. It's engrossing and interesting, I highly
recommend it.
