Fun

I vaguely remember when this movie was in the cinemas. I didn't go see
it and I didn't even see a trailer, but I remember seeing the poster on
the wall at the theater. Once it was up on Netflix, I wanted to see it.I was expecting some kind of weird mixture between crime drama and a
"unusual family" comedy like the Addams Family and We're The Millers.
Not the best examples but they are the first ones I can think of. The
Family wasn't exactly close to my expectation. The Family is way more
refreshing the way it is. Still, it's hard to say what is the main type
of this film. It's partially a comedy, it's hilarious and clever and
all that. But then again it seems like a deep drama, because it's about
a family who is trying to adjust to the new situation, and everyone is
facing their own challenges. But of course it's also a crime thriller.While it's hard to say which one of these mostly defines the movie, the
thing is, the elements of all those types are used so wonderfully, that
as the story goes on, it doesn't matter. The story and the characters
are intriguing and it's exciting to see what is going to happen. That
shows what an excellent writer Tonino Benacquista is. While I don't
know the differences between his book and the screenplay by Besson and
Caleo, but I'm guessing his Benacquista's writing involved a lot of the
stuff I loved about this movie.The Family is intriguing, thrilling and fun. It has excellent casting
and excellent writing. While this movie doesn't really stand out, it's
not astounding in anyway, it's still a good film and definitely worth
seeing.
