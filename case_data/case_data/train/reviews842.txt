Better than expected

When I saw better than expected, I knew it would be good. But it was
better than good, it was great.Very witty, sexy movie. Take the humour of Sherlock (with Robert Downey
Jr. & Jude law) and stick it in a bond movie- then you have The man
from U.N.C.L.E. - I like bond movies, but I LOVED the man from uncle.
It doesn't get boring, or drop at any point. If you've read anything negative from critics Don't listen to what
critics have to say, they don't like any kind of movie if it's not
based on a true story. It's certainly worth the price of admission, you'll be glad you saw it.
I'm honestly hoping a second will be made.
