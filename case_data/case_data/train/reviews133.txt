Statham Doing What He Does Best - Kick Ass

Many people say the same things about Jason Statham, He's a typecast or
he doesn't do anything different. Which is partly true, but he is good
as an action star and in my opinion hes a better actor than what some
say. I don't think he does get enough credit seeing how he got into
movies almost by accident. Anyways Parker has a good revenge/crime story its about a professional
thief who lives by a simple code, don't steal from people who can't
afford it and don't hurt people who don't deserve it. After a
successful heist our man is left for dead by his partners. The movie
has good action throughout. lots of hand to hand combat, and violent
ones at that. It also has a better than usual cast and director for a
statham action movie (Good villains + hot leading lady). Overall, I got what I was expecting for $10 as a fan of Jason Statham
and would recommend it for a good popcorn flick.7/10
