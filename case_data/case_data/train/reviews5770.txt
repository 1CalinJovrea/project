Anyone remembers Nazi Sniper from "Inglourious Basterds"?

Let me start by saying that "American Sniper" has portrayed the true
face of Americas great brainwashing weapon called "Hollywood".As in the movie "Inglourious Basterds" where Dr Goebbels, Reich
Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, has been
given a right to direct a movie for Fuhrer himself, a national pride
performance which depicts a war hero, German Sniper killing 300
"enemies" in three days. Now switch the roles with Clint Eastwood as a
director, Fuhrer as a Americas high elite of nowadays, and Nazi Sniper
as an American Sniper Chris Kyle.A big irony this movie is, and as such it shows how much effort will
American Movie Industry give in order to brainwash its own people.Pathetic.
