Not Everyone's Cup of Tea- But Great If It Is!

I was able to see the Little Hours at Sundance and loved it. I will be
going to see it again when it has its official release. This film is
very loosely based on the Decameron by Baccaccio, a collection of 100
short stories written in the mid 1300's. With an amazing cast of comedy
talent, great chemistry between all the cast members, spectacular
cinematography of the Italian countryside, and a great score, it is
something unique to behold. The story centers around three bored, foul-mouthed nuns Alessandra
(Brie), Fernanda (Plaza), and Genevra (Micucci) and their crazy antics.
Early on in the film, Massetto (Franco) finds refuge in the convent as
a deaf-mute and sparks some some hilarious and sexy interactions with
the nuns. After the first screening I noticed there were others that loved it,
and many who were like "What the hell did I just watch? This is one of
those movies that is not for everyone, and the cast and director made
sure people knew this. Everyone seemed to have had a hell of a lot of
fun making it- and it (really) shows in the interactions in the film. If you're not easily offended, love quirky, raunchy humor, and love to
have a good time, then this film may be for you.
