Watchable caper.

Your not unlucky if you missed this in theaters, it will enjoy a
popular run on home platforms.A excellent cast that you may not recognize give uniformly fine
performances. It's fun to watch the preparations for the heist and how
it comes together. It's one of those movies that fills in the blanks in
flashbacks as not everything is shown when it happened. A good script
and director keep the action moving. The end credits state nobody was actually robbed but you, so the less
you pay to see this the better off you are. It's a pleasant enough
caper movie. Catch it in the comfort of your home.
