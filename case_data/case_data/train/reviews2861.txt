A Nutshell Review: Jack Reacher

Jack Reacher is written to be quite the physical giant, so when Tom
Cruise got interested in the character, many would not have fathomed
that Cruise himself would take the role, although I felt it was
probably one of the best ways to get author Lee Child's famous
investigator onto the big screen by none other than one of the biggest
stars Tinseltown has to offer. Written for the screen and directed by
Christopher McQuarrie, Jack Reacher the film, based upon Child's book
One Shot, is a solid investigative drama dealing with a sensitive issue
of today with a sniper's seemingly random shooting, and you should know
better than to trust the marketers on their treatment of this film.With Drop The Lime's State Trooper track pulsating with the Camaro's
engine roar, together with plenty of fisticuffs as thrown by Cruise's
Reacher, one will be forgiven to think that this is an action film
thanks to the trailer. Granted there are action set pieces, they are
not the showcase of the movie. Instead it's quite old school in its
treatment, dead serious yet punctuated with moments of wry wit, backed
with a genuine whodunnit mystery. Like Cruise's other films in A Few
Good Men and even The Firm, his protagonist must uncover the mystery to
why he's being called by the accused, Barr (Joseph Sikora), whom
everyone automatically thought he was a friend, and to carefully
navigate through murky waters with yet to be revealed villains adamant
in sending him back to the shadows where he came from, or to frame him
up so that he's out of commission.But the best in the business aren't known as the best for nothing.
Reluctantly hired by Barr's defence attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) to
become her investigator, we follow Jack Reacher as he conducts the ABCs
of investigations - assuming nothing, believe nobody, and checking
everything. No stone got left unturned as McQuarrie's screenplay gets
you hook, line and sinker, drawn deep into trying to unravel the Why
and the Who involved in this relatively complex piece of intrigue, and
how it's pure bad luck that the antagonists have to grapple with
Reacher's unique skillset, which almost bordered on a parody of Taken
when he gets in conversation with the bad guys.Reacher's modus operandi, and investigative skills and techniques would
be what will draw the crowds hungry for this genre of film. It's an
investigative drama through and through, with hypotheses and theories
readily thrown up for deeper examination, which some may be quick to
dismiss as convenience, but it's antagonist screw-up mostly. These
naturally introduce us to the supporting cast who aid, or get in the
way, of Reacher's investigations, and allows for the appearance of
Robert Duvall, whose charisma in a bit role just chews up the scenery.
It's the story here that's engaging, because there's zilch development
character wise, where we don't get to see how Reacher develops into the
tough guy he is, nor be bothered too much with it. Most times Tom
Cruise just continued being Tom Cruise, which is inevitable because
little is done to try and get him behind the Jack Reacher persona, but
we're not complaining.For those who find investigative dramas a little bit dry, there's no
lack of action sequences that mattered, with a few that stood out, such
as the very first time we see Reacher take on five thugs, in
Spider-Man-ish style complete with very dark and wisecracks, before
putting his military training and background to good use. It's no
nonsense, and frankly quite methodical in his choice of martial arts,
going for the jugular, or to inflict massive pain to demoralize
opponents, than to waste time horsing around. Then of course there's
the finale which mixed things up a lot to offer action fans a buffet of
experiences, combining sniper with melee, firearms and martial arts,
with some self-deprecating down-out-of-luck moments.Despite having Rosamund Pike as the female lead, there's little romance
thrown up in the story, unlike most other Hollywood films of such
nature. Pike's presence as Helen the attorney felt nothing more than a
little plot necessity in having to reach into Jack Reacher's thought
process, and allow him someone with whom he can debate and bounce ideas
off, versus having to talk to himself, or worse, for a movie, talk to
nobody, or having a narration throughout. It's a pity her character
served as pretty much the mouthpiece of the conspiracy, helping
audiences piece stuff together in quite verbose terms when the need
calls for it.Still, I'm giving this a wholehearted recommendation, with the likes of
Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo and even director Wener Herzog himself
lending star power to the film in a rare appearance as an actor. This
may be the start of a promising franchise that Tom Cruise could be
getting himself involved in, and it certainly does enough as a first
film introduction to the famous Lee Child character, who will clearly
garner more fans to pick up the books, compare the film and literary
versions, and maybe devour the further adventures already available in
print.
