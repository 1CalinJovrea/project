And this is why....

Just read thru about 20 or so reviews...."disgusting",
"disturbing"......you guys all seemed to have missed the mark on this
one. *************spoilers*******This movie shows you that you should follow your heart. So what if some
of you small minded people find this situation "wrong". Then don't do
it. doesn't mean others cant. It's society that is wrong. They were
happy. But they kept trying to go against what they were feeling
instead of flowing with it. They were all quite happy. What a shame
that some people cannot live the life they want to be it homosexual,
whatever, because they have so much societal pressure working against
them. Shame shame shame!And look how many lives were ruined? And for what? Because the guys
were too young? Pfft. Real eye opener.
