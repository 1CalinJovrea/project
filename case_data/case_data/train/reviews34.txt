Who knew that a movie about collegiate music could be so classless?

Once again, I find myself in the minority, but aca-believe it - I
didn't enjoy Pitch Perfect. Pitch Perfect has no storyline. It is a droning Cinderella story minus
the charm, and based on that knowledge, you won't be surprised when the
Barden Bellas (yes, that's their real and extremely uncreative name)
finally pull out a win in the college acapella contest against their
sworn "enemies" after the proverbial mean stepsister gets out of the
way. It has some corny quotes, some of which are funny but can easily be dug
up on Pinterest or IMDb. You'll find the same amount of amusement in
just reading them, and you can skip the crude "humor" and barfing
scenes too! Many PG-13 films I have watched are rather mild and the
upped rating is primarily a marketing tactic. This is not one of them.
There's some pretty risqué content in this one, so NO, Pitch Perfect is
not a cute and harmless movie about a collegiate singing contest.
Neither is it really about college or going to class, but maybe Barden
is just a hangout for disenfranchised and clichéd misfits and not
really a location for education. Fat Amy is somewhat likable but the rest of the one-sided characters
are nearly excruciating to watch. Characters are supposed to be the
center of a movie in which there is no action, and all I got was a
bunch of singing contest commentary and a headache from the absolute
meaninglessness and vapidity of this film. I'm disappointed. Unless you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie (like
yours truly was), you can easily skip it. Even if you are trapped on a
bus and forced to watch this movie, just look out the window and listen
to the music instead. The music is (kind of) enjoyable. However,
nothing will beat your own pair of headphones or some earplugs.
