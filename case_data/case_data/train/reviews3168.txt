Absolutely Terrible!

This is one of the all time worst films I have ever seen. I am
surprised that theater goers aren't demanding their money back (it
really was that bad). Shame on you Nicholas Stoller for your lack of
direction -- the film was all over the place. I am amazed that Judd
Apatow did not take his name of this one -- it's a real stinker! Great
cast, beautiful locations -- no excuse. With all of the great scripts
that can't get funding, what genius gave this poor attempt at comedy
the green light??!!! No wonder the theater was empty! In addition to
the bad directing, editing and writing, the film was almost two and a
half hours! It was painful to sit through.
