Why this?

Sometimes, when watching a movie billed as a comedy, and finding myself
over an hour into it without cracking a smile, I ask myself, "Why? Why
did I waste these precious moments of my life on such crap?" This was
my exact sentiment during this film. Contrived, sophomoric and actually
quite boring. If you want to experience those feelings, by all means,
watch this two hour exercise in profanity- laced verbal exchanges
between unlikable, one-dimensional characters. I gave it two stars
because I normally like Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally, and they
give it their best despite having minimal material to work with.
