Extraordinary look at Power and the Human Psyche

This film blew me away. I first saw it at the IFC Center in New York
with an average expectation. The sound editing is the first thing you
notice. It's crisp, clean, and wields its own power that is
advantageous to the narrative. The narrative centers around the experiment that takes place at the
Stanford University in the 70's. It follows the students who
participate and how their lives immediately change for the worst. Now
the film feels and looks like the era with great costumes and set work.
Everything from the computers to the coffee mugs immerses you ever so
deeper into the emotional toil that intensifies with each scene. A smart move I would like to mention from the casting directors is the
fact they used actors from children's films and popular TV shows then
start beating them up and messing with their characters' minds. For any
millennial, they would instantly recognize the actors which gives the
millennial a sense of familiarity with the characters, and at that
sense feel more towards the behavior and mistreatment of those children
actor's character. Overall, I was pleased with the film as it's theme and historical
significance played in my mind throughout the whole day.
