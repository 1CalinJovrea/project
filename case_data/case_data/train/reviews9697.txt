Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) is a renowned specialist in prison
breaking in high-security facilities. He owns a company with his
partner Lester Clark (Vincent D'Onofrio) and he works with his
coworkers and friends Abigail (Amy Ryan) and Hush (50 Cent). Breslin
follows three basic rules to escape: to know the layout; observe the
routine; and get internal or external support to the getaway. Then he
delivers a report with the flaws in the system to his client.Breslin and his team are visited by the CIA agent Jessica Miller
(Caitriona Balfe) that offers five-million dollars to him to test a
state-of-art facility. Breslin accepts the challenge but soon he learns
that he was double-crossed. The cruel prison ward Hobbes (Jim Caviezel)
gives special attention to Breslin, following the instructions of his
client and uses his right arm Drake (Vinnie Jones) to break Breslin.
But the inmate Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets close to Breslin
and helps him to find a way to escape and find who betrayed him. Will
they be well succeeded in their intent?"Escape Plan" is a full of action movie with Sylvester Stallone and
Arnold Schwarzenegger and a great cast. The plot has the usual flaws
but entertains a lot using the themes prison, betrayal and revenge that
are always attractive. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Rota de Fuga" ("Escape Route")
