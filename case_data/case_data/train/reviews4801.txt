I think it might be Oliver Stone's best film yet

I know he won best picture for platoon - which also was a serious
endeavour - but its behind us. Vietnam is over, Vietnam is done. Snowden lives. Actually, Snowden escaped and survived. He went to what might be the only place people can be protected from US
government agencies. I would like to think all whistle blowers would
have to do is cross into Canada but then Snowden would know. He was
smart - he is smart. I remember Bambi Bembenek. She blew a whistle too and made it to
Canada. Poor thing.This is a must see for all except those that don't care their
protection set forth by the founders of the United States can be taken
away by bullies, perhaps corrupted by limitless power of a new
industrialized intelligence complex. Masterful work by Oliver Stone. Thanks for bringing it to Tiff. Oliver, please ask for a theatre more appropriate for Q&A for Snowden
