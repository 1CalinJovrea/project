Psychologically disturbing- ORIGINAL

I cannot believe that people are giving this movie low ratings. As an
avid horror movie fanatic,it takes a lot to freak me out in a movie and
this movie not only disturbed me it stood out to me.This movie is based
off of psychological mind tricks and you will feel as if you are being
deceived by the mirror.This does not get its horror based off of cheap
jump out scares or gore, it messes with you so you no longer know
what's real and what's not. While the ending was very abrupt,I love how
the whole film mirrors itself in the past and that the two story lines
interconnect.This may not be for everyone, but I can say that this
movie is psychologically terrifying. This generation is used to over
used gore and predictable horror, but this movie is different than
that. Despite what others say it is not just another scary movie. I
left the theater afraid after all of the illusions the movie pushes you
through. It is slow, yes, but it is full of suspense and the slow dread
adds to the plot. I bet the people who rate this low are into the shock
factor and gore of other horror movies. Give it a chance.
