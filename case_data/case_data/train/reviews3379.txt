Smart Rom Com, two things that don't often go together

I'm a little surprised at all the negative reviews here. It's hard to
imagine what the reviewers found missing. Romance? Comedy? Or both?
Because I found plenty of each. I will say that I can see how you need
to be able to relate to the lifestyles depicted to appreciate the film.
Because if you can't, this might as well be about life on Mars.This is a smart movie. And the concept is pretty original, considering
the difficulty of deviating from the restrictions of the genre. The
leads are immensely likable and each able to toss off complex comedic
riffs with ease. And I very much enjoyed seeing Adam Scott play the
heavy. Not easy to portray a dull-as-donuts bad guy, but he pulled it
off.Despite the "truthiness" of the dialog, the movie does share one thing
with all romantic comedies: it's a wet dream for the love hungry.
Especially for those folks who juggle and struggle with the reality of
modern relationships. The lead characters wear a veneer of cynical
sophistication that many of us use as protective shields. But, as is
expected from a rom-com, the veneer cracks. And we're glad when it
does.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but be warned: it is a movie for grown
ups.
