One of the worst Disney movies ever

Bad movie for sure. Disney movies are most of the times one of the best
I have ever seen, but not always this is true which is the case here.
This movie was so boring so I was wandering what to do 1 hour and 50
minutes, only the last 10 minutes of the movie is worth seeing. Budget
160 millions dollars and the result is total disappointment. All this
musical elements in the movie is just too much, it takes away the real
feeling that this movie is supposed to bring to the viewers. Ema Watson
clearly is worst choice for this role, she was looking like Beast's
daughter when standing next to him, she is just too young for this
role. This movie should be rated not to be viewed by viewers over 16
years of age. Overall very bad movie, it is a clear waste of time to
see this movie, but we will forget Disney and will wait for them to get
back on track this month of May.
