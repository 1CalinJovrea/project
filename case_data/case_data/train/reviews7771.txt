Micheal B. Jordan is a super star, and Sylvester Stallone's got his back!!

Milking the franchise for everything it's got, Sylvester Stallone
returns as Rocky Balboa in the 7th installment in the series. This
time, he's smart enough to know he's too old to get into the ring, so
he gets some new blood with a familiar name.Micheal B. Jordan plays Adonis(perfect name), a man who was in his
mother's womb while his father, the legendary Apollo Creed got his ass
handed to him in the 4th Rocky. With the same passion to fight as his
father, he seeks out Apollo's old rival and best friend the Italian
Stallion to teach him the skills to reclaim his legacy and become a new
legend.Like a good boxing movie should, Creed has heart. I'm such of fan of
Micheal B. Jordan. He's got the charm and talent to become a movie star
and Creed proves he's leading man material.And much respect to Sly, who as an aged Rocky, is in the same spot as
once franchise regulars, Micky and Paulie. It's humbling for a movie
star to take a step back and let Jordan drive the vehicle in front of
the camera, and Ryan Coogler sit in the director's chair and pen the
flick, but obviously Sly cares about this cow and sought out the very
best to make it the very best. Stallone also gave a performance of a
lifetime worthy of an Oscar nod for supporting actor. He is Rocky, and
watching him on the screen with Jordan was incredible cinema.And the action in this movie was amazing. Some of the greatest battles
in cinematic boxing are happening in Creed. We are so close to the
action you can feel every hit. Also have to comment on Jordan's boxing
skills. Creed, does an excellent job with showing a boxer going from
having raw talent, to becoming a champion.Definitely a worth wild boxing movie to see, and I think the best Rocky
film since number two.
