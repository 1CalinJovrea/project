10
Best Stop Motion Movie of All Time

This movie really introduced me to Laika; even though I had seen
Coraline earlier, this was the movie that had me doing research.Norman represents every kid with a weird talent or hobby in a small
town. He's literally ostracized by an entire town, including his own
father, yet he understands that some people just don't have the mental
capacity to not fear something different. He's told to not be a freak
or weirdo by people who don't even bother to learn about him. He's the
Harry Potter of this town of Dursley's.Dealing with death, hopelessness, bullying, and forgiveness/acceptance,
this movie creates a real world of monsters and ghosts. It presents a
movie where the true evil is bigotry, bystanders, and herd mentality.
It's the 13 Reasons of 2012, yet flew under the radar. A girl was
murdered, cursed the town, and in the end, is set free by realizing
that scared fools make rash decisions, and by being hateful and angry,
she became a fool herself.I give it a 10 out of 10, because it presents a kid who doesn't have to
be a hero to a bunch of jerks (who don't even learn a lesson outside
the dad) but he does, because he's a good person. There's no reward or
admiration, he just gets a friend and father who no longer hates him.
The real, underwhelming, reality of being a hero.
