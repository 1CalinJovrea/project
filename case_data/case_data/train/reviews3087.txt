10
Good story, better acting & great climax.

Me and my girls(wife & daughter) went to see Collateral Beauty....I
rate it a 10! It's a Sensitive topic because I'm the father of a
daughter. But since she was there with us, I was able to push thru the
story line.Any man that is a father of a daughter will need to secretly keep some
tissues in his jacket pocket. Many men (including me) don't truly know
love, until the moment they first hold their daughters. At that moment,
there's an inexplicable phenomenon that happens and the steel that
shields a mans heart, that makes it incapable for him to cry or show
emotion, evaporates. At that moment, all other priorities become
irrelevant and the focus of the fathers remaining existence, becomes
protecting his baby girl. My entire existence is to ensure she is
forever protected...to the best of my ability.Will Smith captures the essence of every father that shares my
relationship with my daughter and how I would prefer to take on any
pain, sadness or issues that would come her way. If you can understand that level of LOVE...then you will certainly
enjoy this movie. Good story, better acting & great climax.
