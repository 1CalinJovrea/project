Terribly boring.

This film is pretty much just two girls floating in a cage under water.
That's it. Sharks appear once or twice very briefly.I could have just drawn some bars in marker pen on the door of my
shower and filmed myself sitting inside for 90 minutes. It would have
been exactly the same movie.Don't waste your time. Watch 'The Shallows' instead.
