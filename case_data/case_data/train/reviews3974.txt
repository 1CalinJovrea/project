Why the fast forward button was invented.

I should have known after being made to sit through Knock Knock what I
was in for, Eli Roth is an interesting character, he seems to want to
make films that are different and challenging, the trouble is he just
seems to miss the mark wildly.The Green Inferno starts off quite brightly, it's sunny, cheerful, with
lots of upbeat music, it isn't long before carnage descends, a group of
student activists protesting at the culling of the Rainforest meet the
locals....At times the acting is bad, it is like as if the cast are larking about
and not taking it overly seriously. Some of the effects were shaky to
say the least, and the makeup of a few people was a bit naff. Classed as a horror film, I don't really get why, grim as opposed to
scary.Do something more exciting with your life, like a crossword or wash the
dishes, a much better way to spend ninety minutes of your life.I'll rate it 3 instead of 1 as some of the locations are breathtaking.
Overall though it is a terrible film. 3/10
