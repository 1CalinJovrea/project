Denzel Washington is dope

Action, drama, humor, Denzel can due it all. Based on the TV show,
Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in
the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a
mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young
hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major
hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.The movie had a quiet tone similar to Denzel and Director Antoine
Fuqua's last flick, Training Day, but Denzel's performance in this is
far more Oscar worthy. Denzel still brings passion to movies in an age
were other actors like him are phoning it in just for the pay check,
and basically that's what makes the movie. Watching Denzel on screen.In all fairness, The Equalizer's main antagonist, A man the mob sends
to take care of their problems, was no slouch either. It was so
entertaining watching these two hunt each other down.Possibly the worse part of the movie was there was not enough ChloÃ«
Grace Moretz whose role in the movie is no more than a gloried cameo.Overall Mr. Fuqua directed the great Denzel in another amazing role.
