It's literally, the best film of Aamir khan's carrier

PK is the biggest achievement of Aamir Khan's carrier and Raju Hiranis
too. Aamir acting and expressions deserve an Oscar. The film has
everything. Emotion, Drama, Comedy, Message which literally means
perfection. PK was the toughest character for not just Aamir Khan but,
for anyone in the Bollywood industry. Not only Aamir, but Anushka
Sharma and Sanjay Dutt did a very good job of their character which I
think no one could have done. Sushant Rajput also did a fine job of his
character.Like everything in this film is perfect. I insist you to go
and enjoy the film because it's like a word of mouth movie. PK is like
a father of 3 idiots.
