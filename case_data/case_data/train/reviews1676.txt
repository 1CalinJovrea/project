empty roomLike the frozen yogurt and the noodle business, the industrial film
thrives on playing out endless variations of the same plot. Green Room
is no more than a video game movie in which a posh English actress with
the gun and box cutter is allowed (scripted) to win.Saulnier's Green Room works out with the format of teenage entrapment
by forces of evil Â– bogie men. The bogie men in the cupboard decked out
as proto white supremacist, but basically just plain old bogie men in
the cupboard. Saulnier's movie lacks any idiosyncratic or cultist
distinction: Chainsaw massacre it is not. Green Room lacks the
imaginative stylisation and deep black comedic rituals of the cult
slaughter movie. It also lacks even the social cultural themes of the movie such
Carpenter's Escape from New York or Scott Cooper's Out of the Furnace.
The latter film which although violently formulaic and lurching into
parody, nevertheless in its title and in its expressive
characterisation calls up the dark forces worming through the flesh of
United States of America, psychically legitimising the corruption of
violence in the name of an enraged 'id'. Cooper's film crudely but
effectively anticipates the politics of Donald Trump, both as parody
and as expression of the infantilised rage that defines contemporary
politics. Woody Harrelson's performance as Harlan is the film's
psychopathic core. In the film's opening sequence, set in a drive-in
movie theatre, Harrelson maps out the film's territory, as he defines
and demonstrates his visceral understanding of human relations. In
comparison, Patrick Steward's playing of Green Room's villain, Darcy,
is something of a pussy cat. Darcy is motivated more by the banality of
money than any deeper gloomier psychic intolerance. Harrelson and
Steward both do the 'hard eye' thing, but Harrelson does it to the
greater effect.Set against the idea of a situation in which a touring punk band gets
slammed up in a venue for seeing something they didn't ought to have
seen, Saulnier as director/writer simply spins together some punk
dialogue, some bad-ass backwoodsmen, guns machetes, couple of adorable
bull terriers called Brownie and Grimm, and like a pot-pourri cocktale
shakes them all about. The result is a movie without an idea or even
the notion of an idea, a feeble attempt to pitch the forces of good and
evil against each other. It is a structure without a concept that ends
up as a mechanised combinational tryst that is not a movie but a video
game.
