Did i see the same movie as everyone else?

The Conjuring is not nearly as bad as it could have been, it did have
some pretty solid jump scares and every actor could hold their own on
screen. However; This movie had way too much going on, there were
witches, evil dolls, possession, demons, psychic visions, etc. Waiting
for each of the sub plots to come to their epic conclusion felt like
watching paint dry as the scenario breaks into even smaller pieces and
more sub plots appear. The ending didn't feel like an effective pay off
at all, and call me simple but i prefer a bit of grisly violence in my
horror movies which this movie was devoid of. Not to mention the ghosts were not scary looking in the least bit (with
the exception of that damn doll) and they looked like they were ripped
right out of insidious, which just takes away from the movie.This movie is just jump scares irrelevant to the plot and a boring
excuse to cash in out the success of insidious.
