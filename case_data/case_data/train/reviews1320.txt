Why bother?

Routine, by-the-numbers tale of a man, repelled by his college-aged
daughter's boyfriend, attempting to show her what a loser he is. It
turns out, however, the boyfriend is an internet multimillionaire, and
an obnoxious, loud, profanity-laden one, at that. There is nothing even
remotely likable about his character, so it is easy to understand why
Cranston doesn't like him.Zzzzz.Little, if anything, we've not seen before (except for the dead moose
in a pool of urine, in one of the more disgusting moments) its talented
cast carries the film, and its half dozen laughs, and ham-fisted
product placement (Subway, Applebee's) The audience I saw this with had
a few laughs, but also long, quite stretches in between, so I suppose
I'm not the only one unimpressed with this one.Keenan's genuinely bizarre, guru character was more puzzling than
funny, as were his sideburns, the oddest sideburns since Tony The Pimp,
from Demons. While we're on the topic of puzzling things, why did we have to endure
five minutes of Brian Cranston sitting on the toilet, try to figure how
to use the bidet? Kiss' cameo at the end seemed surreal, like even they
were unsure of why they were in the movie. Released at Christmastime, but barely a Christmas movie, although one
of the funnier scenes involved searching for a Christmas tree.
