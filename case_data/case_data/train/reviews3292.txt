Another Another Earth

Mike Cahill creates another low budget low key fantasy film, using some
of the same actors as in Another Earth, and again he succeeds in
producing something intriguing. I watched Another Earth and I really
liked it, because it didn't just publish an idea, but it built and grew
its characters, reaching the underwhelming, but thought provoking
ending. I liked I Origins for the same reasons, but truth be said, it's
just not as good. If you watched this film and liked it, you will love
Another Earth.The story is difficult to explain without spoiling the basic plot.
Let's just say it is a journey of discovery for the main character. The
film starts with a really slow pace and much of what happens in the
first half is just character exposition, rather than development. That
may put some people off. However it is important to understand all
characters to get the film, and they are all rather interesting and
original, not tired clich√©s. I liked that.So basically you get a well done, well acted movie, involving
interesting characters in an intriguing story. What else do you need?
With a cast like Michael Pitt and Brit Marling, it feels like the indie
film that it is, but I thought it was clearly worth watching. Some
scenes could have been removed to make the movie last less than the
full two hours, but they do develop the characters and pull the viewer
into their story a little.
