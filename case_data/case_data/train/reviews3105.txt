Slow and uneventful

I was really excited about this. I thought it was going to be a very
clever science fiction movie. It turns out it's low budget, the acting
is bad, the script is bad, the story is bad and nearly non-existent and
the locations are bad. I would advise you to watch something else if
you can.
