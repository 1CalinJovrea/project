Pointless, overlong and not funny

I seldomly write reviews, but sometimes (every 4 or 5 years or so) I
just have to warn people before spending hard earned money on something
so incredibly awful as this film. I see most films at home but I saw
this one in the theatre with my stepson who really wanted to see this.
For me it ended up even way below my expectations, which were already
very low. Note: I really liked the first one. I don't dislike Bay (even
liked Pearl Harbor and Armageddon and Bad Boys II), but this is just
simply not very good. It's plain awful actually. Even my 11 yr old
stepson thought it was boring.... need I say more...? It doesn't go
anywhere, you don't care at all what happens to the characters, human
or alien and there is literally never any sense of urgency or peril for
anyone involved. Please let another director have a shot at this
franchise and let Bay direct another The Rock. And why Spielberg is
executive-producing this turd of a movie is beyond me. Waste of time
for everyone involved, only good thing is it's making a ton of money
for Paramount. Lets just hope they invest in something with more
substance.
