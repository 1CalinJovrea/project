Jane Doe is very much alive & creepy!

If you were pleasantly surprised with André Øvredal's TROLLHUNTER
(2010), then you will regard him now as your new 'Master of Horror' -
in this latest & his first English-language film The Autopsy of Jane
Doe! Because, in Jane Doe, this Norwegian director applied almost each
& every great craftsmanship of horror film-making so skillfully that
you are not only going to see just another good or passable horror
flick set around an awesomely interesting premise, you'll going to
experience it! Through the effective use of half light, sound, smoke &
shadow this time he created an utterly eerie & unsettling atmosphere by
revealing not too much but keep toying with the viewer's imagination
from start to finish. And the perfect cast & characterization also
helps to fuel the unease feeling of an unknown terror  an untouched &
unidentified corpse of a beautiful young female; the local cops
discovered the body from a shallow grave under the basement of a
house-where everyone was massacred! The best horror film of 2016 so
far! A must see.
