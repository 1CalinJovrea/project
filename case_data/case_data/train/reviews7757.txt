Beautiful looking film that doesn't match the quality of story

This film is very beautifully done, the artists, great job. The
storyline was terrible. It was another balled up Disney movie that
seemed like it was just trying to fit in every single clich√© and Disney
trademark as it could. It starts as it should, epic. Then out of nowhere the epic Celtic music begins and the female vocals
come in. I immediately wanted to leave. The girl I was with, also
seemed exhausted with this as well. It didn't need that, it made the
film go from really cool to chick flick.Little did I know, it was going to get worst. The trailer explained the
movie as a hero rising, and the changing of fate. Who doesn't like
that. So she rides off mad at her mom, finds a witch and requests her
fate to be changed. She is granted her wish and her mom is turned into
a bear. Yes, a bear. So the entire movie, basically is the main girl
trying to mend her moms relationship and turn her back into a human.
Well, that's not hard, because the love is already there. She basically
apologizes and is sad about everything. and obviously, in the nick of
time, the sun, which could consequently keep her a bear, shines light
on the two and magically she turns back into a human (which isn't as
cool as I'm making it seem). The plot was a total deviation from the
trailer, it made no sense, and it was more for little kids than the
usual Pixar film, which for the most part is usually made for a wide
audience.After the film, I couldn't leave fast enough. I hope people enjoy the
film, I just didn't. Nor would I recommend seeing it. I was throughly disappointed, but I'm curious on what others think. So
