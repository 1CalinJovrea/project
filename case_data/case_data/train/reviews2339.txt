Read my spoiler review now so you'll know why to avoid this movie

So Wallas has been missing for three days, and his two friends each
receive a creepy phone message that he has been abducted and his life
is in danger. Wouldn't the immediate action be to go to the local
police, file a report, and start getting cell phone records of the last
broadcast location? Instead we see the two flying out to Canada, making
a few stops, talking to some people, and then going to the police. And
they just brush it off instead of, again, doing the obvious thing and
finding the last location of the cell phone. One simple throw-away line
("We can request the records, but it may take days") would have
sufficed. Instead, we're led to believe that all of these people are
operating in a world of technology from 1955.And when they do find the car half-sunken in a nearby stream, nobody's
first reaction is to immediately call the police to send out a search
party. Don't any of these people have cell phones with roaming
capabilities? Clearly there's a cell tower nearby if their friend was
able to use his phone.How could they have made this whole f-ing movie, and not one person
ever brought up this painfully obvious point?
