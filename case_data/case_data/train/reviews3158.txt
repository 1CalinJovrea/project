Beautiful visuals do not make a movie

I have just watched this movie and it was a terrible disappointment. I
loved other Del Toro's movies, but this ones feels totally empty. The
film is a visual feast. Gorgeous locations, wonderfully lit serve as
the background for the tale. Fantastic shots and good acting would make
you think that this is a good movie. But it is not. The plot is so
cheap, that you can tell what is going to happen since the first frame.
The evil characters are so cartoonish that you can see their next
movements from miles away. The "good" character is so bland and
pathetic that you never have a real connection with her. In fact, as
you can see where the film goes from the beginning, this movie is a
total bore. Do not waste your time and watch "The Devil's Backbone"
instead.
