You can't not see it.

I dreaded going to see this but I couldn't not. It's one of those
movies you feel you need to see to get a dose of historic reality, like
"Schindler's List, "United 93" or "World Trade Center", so that you
understand better what happened, and remember. But for me at least,
it's only the once. The reality of it is incredibly evident.
