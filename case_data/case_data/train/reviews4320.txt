"Never lose Focus"

You know a movie is bad when it doesn't even follow it's tagline. Unfortunately, this is the case in Focus, a disjointed, needlessly
convoluted misfire from directors Glenn Ficarra and John Request and a
talented cast that includes Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Focus starts relatively well, displaying many cool scenes of
pickpocketing as Smith tries to lure Robbie into the business. However,
soon all of this turns out to be a distraction of the real plot, that
is the big time con, which is an absolute letdown. There is plenty of filler in the middle, particularly a clever but
ultimately pointless 20 minute scene at an American football match.
While it is impressive to watch, it doesn't contribute anything to the
plot. Soon, they move on to the next big con which is completely unrelated to
the last (that shows how useless the start was) full of ever more
filler, more deception, more forced humour and more lame twists. The third act is a disaster with the plot double or should I say,
triple crossing itself like a spider's web on a spider's web on a
spider's web. Nothing is clear and the explanations are given vaguely
and lamely. There is more humour that doesn't work again in the end. Will Smith is lazy as the main lead and Margot Robbie is functional as
his love interest / sidekick. The side characters are all equally
functional and forgettable. Overall, Focus is a terrible con movie which cons the audience with
it's good trailer and impressive cast, which can't save this convoluted
mess from it's filler filled plot.
