LEAVE the Woods

This movie was absolutely, positively HORRIBLE in every sense of the
word. I generally don't write reviews but I was so incensed by the
stupidity of this absolutely ridiculous crock o' s*** that I had to
spread the word. I don't see how this movie got any positive reviews at
all. I had high hopes because of the cast and I generally like what
Disney makes, but this was horrendous. From the first song on, it was a
disaster filled with repetitive, pointless songs that attempt to
provide moral guidance but definitely DOES NOT. This movie instead has
hints of rape, pedophilia, adultery, shitty parenting and basically
half the cast is killed off with the remaining cast not seeming to
really give a damn as it ends with the Baker starting to re- tell the
same shitty story that just happened to all of them (in which his wife
died, little red riding hood's grandma and mother died, and Jack's
mother died)... This movie actually got me to dislike Meryl Streep a bit, which I
thought was almost impossible. Johnny Depp was really not in it, he was
in it for maybe 5 minutes top. Chris Pines was the ONLY good thing
about this movie, and that was basically just for one of his songs
which was amusing. The actress who played the little red riding hood
was incredibly annoying and emotionless - if she had been killed off
the movie might have been decent. I almost walked out of this movie but stayed hoping for some kind of
salvation of the film towards the end -but NOPE! All in all, this was
ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN, and I don't say that lightly.
Please don't waste your time and money, or at least consider yourself
warned.
