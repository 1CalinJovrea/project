One of the better RomComs

It doesn't use an original idea nor does it stay clear from the usual
RomCom tropes and the plot is sort of predictable. But even though it
has all the ingredients for a derivative flick it feels fresh and is
quite entertaining. Mainly it's because of Radcliffe and Kazan, the
more original dialogues and by staying clear from slapstick comedy.
Also the story by itself feels convincing as a whole and the characters
stay consistent and relatable for the most part. Though, by the end you
also recognize that they slandered a lot of potential by going the
usual RomCom route. It could have been better by doing a few things
differently, which I'm not going to name here to avoid spoilers.Bottom line, if you like RomComs then you will probably like this one.
If you don't like the genre at all you may still find this one bearable
enough to sit through it next to someone.
