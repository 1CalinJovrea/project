What were they thinking??? only if they were thinking

OMG what did i saw???, this was a terrible movie, it has the most
stupid idea for an ice age movie ever i mean just think about it for a
second, if i say "hey lets see the new ice age movie" Â¿what is the
first thing that you think of?.....well if your answer was not
pirates,teen mammoths, terrible jokes (not that the other ones form
before were good), a pointless story and horrible new characters then
this is not the movie for you, i mean it when i say "STAY AWAY FROM IT"
don't see it if you have children take them to other place or other
movie but please don't see this one, just a little example of how bad
it is imagine the kind of things you do to make a baby laugh mixed with
stupid teen jokes mixed with terrible pirate jokes the result is this
horrible movie i gave it one star just to let you know how much i hated
it and not just me, everyone in the theater was complaining about it
but it deserves less than that
