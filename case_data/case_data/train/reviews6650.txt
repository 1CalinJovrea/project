A Gem to Rival "All the President's Men"

I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards
broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one.
Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled
director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something
where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold
of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director
comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest
misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who
are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is
there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of
sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and
uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as
anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have
weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This
plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this.
