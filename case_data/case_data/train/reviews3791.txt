Mediocre, Predictable, and Boring

I'm not dumb, I knew what to expect when I put this on. I wasn't
expecting some Tarantino esque film with tons of heart and interesting
dialogue. I was ready for some mindless monster action along the lines
of Underworld or Blade, unfortunately none of that was to be found.
Instead "The Last Witch Hunter" plays out like a very shallow detective
movie with a very unlikable detective. Vin Diesal just didn't work in this, Vin isn't in movies because of his
acting chops, he is in movies because we love to watch him be a badass.
In this though he is basically just walking around investigating clues
while we are treated to some pretty lame CGI. There is very little
action in the movie and the few action scenes that do take place are
pretty underwhelming. "The Last Witch Hunter" should have been a mindless action movie, it
really didn't have the cast or the story to be what it really was
trying to be. Pretty much all in all this was a very dulled down
version of much better movies.3/10
