Even Mater cannot save this one.....

This is a classic example of Hollywood culture of trying to force a
sequel even though you have no thought of idea.When I see the movie it seems that someone forced the writers to do a
rush job just because a sequel had to be made.All characters look clich√©d and boring. There is nothing new from a
character perspective. The movie manages to be unnecessarily emotional
and most events in the story look like filers which are totally
unrelated to the story.They totally fail to live the magic of the original cars movie. This
one is very disappointing and just outright boring. all i wish that they had left the original alone and not made this
sequel.
