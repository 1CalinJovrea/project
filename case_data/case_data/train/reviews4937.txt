This is definitely the best movie about Spider-Man. Marvel and Sony
have finally got the character perfect both in and out of the suit. His
link in the MCU just makes the movie that much better. Tom Holland is
the best Spider-Man and Peter Parker and you can't even compare him to
the previous 2. This movie is very fun and there are shocking plot
twists to look forward to. It's definitely better than the original 2
Sam Raimi movies without a doubt. And be sure to stay to the very very
end.
