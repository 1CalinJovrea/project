Legend of Tarzan, A Really Great Movie

They finally portrayed the Tarzan character more like Burroughs wrote
him! This is the best Tarzan movie I have ever seen. The acting is
superb, and the settings are beautiful. The movie was so good that it
seemed like I wanted it to last longer. It was sheer entertainment!The stars of the film were really excellent in their roles, and I
thought the two main characters perfectly played their roles. The rest
of the cast were excellent also. The story moves along briskly, and the plot is very effective. I believe people will enjoy it, even if they know nothing about Tarzan.
This is a very enjoyable movie, and I recommend it. We are going to see
it again this weekend and bring our family and friends!
