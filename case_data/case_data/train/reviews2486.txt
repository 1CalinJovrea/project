Don't waste your time and money!! Seriously.

2 hours for nothing! The story line is so simple. I think they wrote
this movie in 30mn after watching mafia movies on TV. This movie is
like directed by an amateur! I am so disappointed about Luc Besson. The
production only count on first grade actors and it was not enough to
make a great movie. I don't know what this movie belongs to, this is
not an action movie and nor a comedy, its not fun at all. The first
hour of this film is so pathetic and boring, only the last ten minutes
are interesting. This is a worse movie this year, for sure! Don't waste
your money and time! This is a traditional boring french movie! Go for
a coffee with your friends or girl friend is better than watching this
crap!
