Hollywood garbage

I am writing this to stop all those who liked the anime from watching
this what i consider not a movie but garbage... *this might contain
some spoilers so don't read if u don't want to be spoiled*First of all the Light in this adaptation wasn't smart at all (no being
a straight A kid doesn't make u smart, u study a lot u get good marks
and that s what Light was) that they caught so fast u had to wonder if
they didn't make him a retard. And a huge attention seeker that he
revealed all the secrets of the death note to the first girl he met to
impress her (i really don't understand why they have to force a romance
in American movies) i think that the writers wanted to satisfy the
American white audience forgetting that the whole world was expecting
this movie.i wont forget the scenario that's horribly written, and the horrible
acting (the first meeting of ryuk and light for example)...I think it would have been better if they weren't just rushing the
scenes, if they took enough time to make a full complete story. They
would have clarified a lot of things it they just made this into a TV
showI gave it one star and i wish i could give it less, cuz even if it was
a separate movie that has nothing to do with death note i don't think
any of you would ever like it.
