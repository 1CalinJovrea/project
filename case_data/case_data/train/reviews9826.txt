Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney's 1991 Beauty and the Beast
was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely
unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as
the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the
Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup
to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim
Carrey's expressions. The side character animations were poorly
executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of
compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI
and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting,
because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is
by far the worst remake of an animated classic.
