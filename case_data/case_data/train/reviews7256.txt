I Spent How Much on This?

I will start with the pros. This movie is packed with excitement,
action, and CGI effects - almost start to finish. Now the cons: a
blatant ripoff of both Die Hard and Olympus Has Fallen (which was a
blatant ripoff of Die Hard); the most implausible story EVER; the
absolute worst acting EVER with Jamie Foxx taking the lead. This movie
should be reason enough to finally burn that guy's SAG card once and
for all. And Channing Tatum, whom I normally like, was a close second.
In fact, the only actor to give a good performance was the little girl
who played Tatum's daughter.Believe the reviews you read here. They are not exaggerations. If you
must watch this, wait for Redbox!
