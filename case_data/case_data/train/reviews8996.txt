pretty good movie to watch with kids

I've been hooked on video games, especially the classic ones, since I
played Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Wizard of Wor, Frogger, Donkey
Kong (etc., etc., etc.) at the arcades from the late 70's through mid
80's, and of course on home systems afterwards. My kids have played
many of these classic arcade games on MAME and on compilation disks on
the Gamecube. We absolutely loved Wreck It Ralph, so when I heard that
there was another video game themed movie coming out, I was looking
forward to watching it.I wasn't able to get to the theater for the first month, but then it
was showing at a local drive-in as the second feature. I went to watch
it with my oldest son, who is not quite a teen yet. We were pretty
bored by the first feature, which was a failed attempt to reboot yet
another 60's TV show. However, Pixels really captured our attention,
and we both loved the humor and the video game action.I could have done without the reference to Martha Stewart that they put
in there, and I would have liked to see maybe 4 or 5 more classic video
games featured. I also would have liked for there to be some form of
personal appearance by the alien A.I. in charge. Overall, however, I
think it was the most fun my son and I had watching a movie this
summer, and we've watched more than a dozen. After we watched it, he
came home and played a bunch of the old video games for a few hours. I
finally bought Pac Man Championship Edition DX+.It certainly isn't a blockbuster, but with the international box
office, it will finish at about 2.5 times its budget, so it will
ultimately be another profitable movie. Is it the greatest movie of the
year? No, but it would be a good choice for anybody who has played
classic arcade games through the mid 80's.
