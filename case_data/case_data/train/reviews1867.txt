Dark on dark

Every action has consequences. Unintended or otherwise. Just when you
don't think it can get any darker someone goes over the edge and
commits an act that at first looks like the end of a story. Of course most of the time those acts are just links in a chain of
never ending violence and far reaching consequences. The main feeling
you get while watching this film is one of being being sucked down by a
giant whirlpool of corruption and crime. There is so much rain it looks like a monsoon. That it (the story) ends
in a waterlogged courtyard is fitting. For some reason most of the
outside scenes of Rome take place in rain at night. Whether that is a
metaphor or not it fits the tone. Dark on dark - but then again maybe the water will wash everything
away.
