JOHN WICK meets MAN ON FIRE...and God help anybody caught in the middle.

Dylan O'Brien is a relatively new name to me. But, he did a very
convincing job portraying Mitch Rapp. A man who trains himself
single-mindedly (and almost single-handedly) to track down the
terrorist leader responsible for the death of his five-minute fianc√©'
(along with dozens of other innocent tourists) in Spain eighteen months
earlier.It's a mixed blessing, though, that he tracks down the terrorists
posing as an American jihadist sympathizer. Because it makes the CIA
aware of his existence. Not to mention, gets him captured--and nearly
killed--by his quarry through a bit of overconfidence! What follows is admittedly pretty predictable. Rescue by counter-
terrorist commandos; an offer he can't refuse (train to be an anti-
terrorist hit man or go to Federal prison); the training, itself, under
ex-Navy SEAL Stan Hurley (enjoyably played by Michael Keaton); and, of
course, the literal baptism-by-fire overseas when Team Orion crosses
paths with renegade ex-teammate "The Ghost" (almost too-well played by
Taylor Kitsch) who has a hidden agenda more shocking than all his
accomplices!I won't spoil the rest of the plot. Suffice it to say that, as
end-of-summer blockbusters go (technically, the first day of fall isn't
till Sept. 22), this movie is well worth the admission price.
