This movie is metal

Here's a good, creepy movie for you. A family moves in to a house
cursed by The Devil, and the previous occupant returns to carry out
what the demonic voice in his head tells him to do -- which just so
happens to be the same voice the father hears that compels him to paint
horrifying scenes.There's a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle things that make this movie
really great. From the metal soundtrack, with all of its connotations
to devil worship all the way to names and roles of certain characters
and locations referencing the biblical devil, a lot of thought and care
was put in to making this movie work on more than one level and flow
together great.Rarely is the movie too heavy handed. The supernatural elements are
treated with such a deft hand that it's almost possible a case could be
made that this movie isn't even supernatural at all. It's there, around
the edges, creeping in to your head, but never getting in your face.
The scariest monsters are always the ones you cannot see.And, at its core, what really matters are strong characters. Though a
lot of the family in this movie are metal heads, there are no
stereotypes here. These are real three dimensional people, and they
care about each other very much. It sounds so obvious, but you'd be
surprised how many movies forget to make you invested in their
protagonists. Not so, in "The Devil's Candy." If you're looking for a
horror movie with a strong sense of personal style and you like heavy
metal, I definitely recommend The Devil's Candy.
