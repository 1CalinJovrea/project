Brilliant film

I always like to read other reviews, some of the negative reviews would
be better watching Transformers or anything where your brain does not
have to think. The story is simple and starts quietly showing two lines
one oil production and population growth, both head upwards until oil
starts plummeting and then population. It could have employed expensive
graphics to show desolation but this is not what the film is about. It
is about human relationships, as the great Leonard Cohen sang "I will
help if I can and kill you if I must but when it comes down to dust I
will help you if I must and kill you if I can" The acting is superb he
three protagonists are wary of each other and the daughter takes a
pragmatic outlook on killing her own mother. This is gritty with a
capital G, if you do not mind thinking and realise all films are the
Bourne identity then enjoy this movie.
