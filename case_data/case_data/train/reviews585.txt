Wild Ride of Gore and Humor

I must say "Look out Quentin Tarantino!" What a crazy ride!
Director/Writer Ilya Naishuller is hardcore and takes shootouts to a
different level. I loved the camera movement but it does take some getting used to.
Overall, it was entertaining in a gory way and the splattering of humor
made the gore a little more tolerable.One scene with the subtitles overlapping (not sure if on purpose) was
interesting and funny because it was a 3-person conversation - whiny
and catty - all talking at the same time. If you like Jason Statham and Quentin Tarantino action and shock value,
you will love it!
