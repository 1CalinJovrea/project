Marion's soul

Marion Cotillard in "Rust And Bone" gave my favorite performance in a
long, long time. She is astonishing. Her performance here touched a
personal cord with me and reminded me of actresses who've been able to
transform me. Yes, that's exactly what she's done, transform me. She
was able to awaken my sense of compassion and admiration. Simone
Signnoret in "Room At The Top", Annie Girardot in "Rocco And His
Brothers" Samantha Eggar in "The Collector", Charlotte Rampling in "The
Night Porter" Those performances by those actresses not only instructed
me as a man but inspired me. Now Marion Cotillard has done it again for
me and I'm very grateful. As a bizarre note, she has been ignored by
the Oscars, how is that possible?
