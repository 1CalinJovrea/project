Anna-bleh

I have given much of my valuable time to the horror genre and I have
viewed so many disappointments. Add Annabelle to the list. Annabelle was facing two very stiff obstacles. 1.) It was following the very successful The Conjuring2.) Scary doll movies had already been done (see Child's Play and Dead
Silence to name a couple). Not to mention other movies in which a
creepy doll came in to play (such as Poltergeist or countless other
movies in which a doll turns its head or moves)Annabelle just didn't deliver. A husband buys his wife this doll as a gift to complete her set. After
a tragic event the doll becomes a conduit for evil. This evil (demon I
guess) marked that family and once marked it wouldn't leave them alone.The premise was real simple it just wasn't a good movie. It wasn't
horrible, I've seen a lot worse, it just wasn't good.
