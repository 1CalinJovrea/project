Not pleasant sights

If you are hit-man video game fan , avoid , please avoid this movie.
Its one of these that would have been a total trash and waste of time
if it wasn't based on something successful.I just cant understand how ,
with the fact that the actors are good actors and the plot is a plot
you can work with , they managed to mess this up.I won't lie , it is
way better then the previous hit-man but the previous one is not much
of a competition to run against.bottom line , this movie is a total
trash and nothing could save it , not the decent actors and not the
medium level CGI effects , i don't recommend it because it a total
waste of time and money.
