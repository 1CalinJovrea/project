It made for an old-fashioned movie going experience...

This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for
NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by
all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's
also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time
period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some
scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this
film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.And in spite of it being an overall positive experience, I could feel
the oppression at certain points - Dorothy at the library just trying
to find the right book, but it is in a part of the library to which she
cannot gain admittance due to her race. Mary being reminded that she
must sit in the back of the court room, again because of her race.
Katherine runs across campus just to find a bathroom that she is
allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is
publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner's character
appears to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and
yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into
a certain bathroom half a mile away. You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I
admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my
college days.The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was
particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to
take away from this film.Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then
applauded at the end credits as well. I don't recall the last time I
heard that at a film. And most importantly - I did not see a cell phone
light up the whole time - truly a miracle.
