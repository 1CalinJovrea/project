Slow to start, but picks up the pace. Interesting story with good performances

It is clear from reading other reviews that this film has upset some of
the NRA gun lobby people. Despite the narrative that runs through the
film, about "control" not meaning, "the lefties are coming to take your
guns". Clearly many of these people slating the movie have not even
bothered to watch it. In my mind the film promotes common sense and
suggests the petulant bickering of both sides to be nothing more than
political jousting, rather than genuine concerns about rights or
safety.The film itself has many positive performances, it is well shot, and
despite a slow start. The story picks up pace to a superbly crafted
ending. The leading lady is an intimidating hard faced lady, who will
be attractive to some, but perhaps not to all. That said any movie
where the leading character is not easily likable, can be refreshingly
interesting.
