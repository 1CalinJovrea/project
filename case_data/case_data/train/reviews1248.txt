The Circle (2017)

I was a big fan of Dave Eggers' A Hologram for the King. It was a
fantastic read for enjoyment and to analyze. The film adaptation also
did not disappoint. When The Circle was announced as a film I
immediately checked out the book. To my disappointment, the film wasn't
as interesting an got to bogged down to its technological ventures and
wasn't exactly the best read. However, I held out hope that the film
would be able to impress, especially with the star studded cast at the
helm.Emma Watson plays Mae Holland an ambitious young customer service rep
who joins The Circle, a cutting edge technology based company that
seems to be growing at fast pace and changing the future. The thing is,
the technological leap of the company leads to massive privacy concerns
and the company seems to be capable of more than what initially meets
the eye. First off, I will say that the scathing reviews I've seen for
the film are somewhat unwarranted, however the film is far from perfect
and could have been much better.The plot may seem like its minimal or nonexistent but this wasn't
really my concern. I was more concerned with things being introduced
into the film that have no real importance later in the film. John
Boyega's character is a glorified cameo that seems to just be there as
a big name. In the book the character is mysterious has a much larger
effect on Mae's life. The ending of the film leaves much more to be
desired; there needed to be more explanation onto what the reveal was
and anything about repercussions.The film is littered with talented people but unfortunately the writing
and the structure of the film really lets them down. Its a misfire
really, and the film needed to be much better and have a stronger
central message. I feel like parts of the film and scenes were left on
the cutting room floor. The film isn't exactly terrible but its most
certainly unfulfilled and really could have left a stronger impression.6/10
