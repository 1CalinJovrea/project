Why him? Should be called 'Why Bother?'

Brian Cranston is the traditional father who struggles to bond with his
daughter's boyfriend, James Franco is the boyfriend, a Tech millionaire
who wants to win him over in order to marry his daughter. There's
frequent forced humour, with particularly lots of bathroom humour. This
film drops the 'F' bomb frequently (too frequently for me anyway!).The audience had a few laughs, I think I remember laughing 2 or 3
times. The trailer showcased the very few 'funny' scenes and makes this
look like a much funnier film than it really is. If your idea of funny is frequent swearing then (unfortunately) this
film is definitely for you. Overuse of the 'F' word soon wears thin,
makes you realise it was used instead of clever humour. Please don't
waste your time and money supporting this nonsense or they will make
'Why Him2'. In summary, poor plot which has been done better previously, boring,
gross and vulgar. I wouldn't recommend to anyone, whether 15 years old
or older. Would not watch again.
