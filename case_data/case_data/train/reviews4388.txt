Well This Sucks

When I saw the trailer, I thought it would be fun. But when I watched
the full movie, I was totally embarrassed. Its not a matter of
religion, nor a matter of anything - but this animation started with a
great starting but it failed miserably at the end. Characters were
funny, story was great at the beginning, But food sex ? Seriously ? You
could Mark the Film as a 18+ Animation. Sorry, but watching this
animation was a great waste of my time . I couldn't even watch it with
the kids.Boring story line made it even worse. Try to make a better
film next time. I can't say more. I wish, I could give it a Zero. But,
sorry, I can't.
