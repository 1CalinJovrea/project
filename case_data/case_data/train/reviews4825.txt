A dramatization of the first genocide of the 20th century.

My wife, the president of San Jose State University, and I were
fortunate to see this film at a festival in our hometown, San Jose. It
played to a full house and a discussion followed with the director of
the film. Years ago, in the 1920s, an attempt was made to make a film
on the Armenian genocide following Franz Werfel's powerful book, The 40
Days of Musa Dag. As many know, the salvation of a small band of
determined Armenian survivors were saved from the Mountain of Moses
(Musa Dag) on the Mediterranean coast by a French warship.Ihe salvation of the persevering few was an inspiration to the
Holocaust resistance movement in Nazi occupied Europe and copies were
passed around from one cell to another.Unfortunately, the film was never distributed due to the collusion of a
frightened, anti-communists State Department fearful of losing Ataturk
to the Soviet sphere and a determined Turkish government to deny the
"murder of a nation," as the US Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry
Morgenthau, term the Armenian genocide, a word to be invented later by
Rafael Limpkin to suit the Armenian case.Turkish denial of the Armenian genocide continues to this day and the
government of Turkey spends millions of dollars every year to hire
lobbyists to influence American thinking. The thousands of negative
votes on this film currently under consideration should be a dead
giveaway that the Turkish government is once more active in trying to
prevent the distribution of a film on the Armenian genocide.
Furthermore, the Turkish government currently sponsored a film, The
Ottoman Lieutenant, which gives the impression that all of the people
of the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia suffered equally.The Promise is an excellent film bordering on greatness. I urge people
to see it and judge for themselves.
