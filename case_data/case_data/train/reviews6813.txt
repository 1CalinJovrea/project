Awful Movie

This movie, by far, is the worst I have ever seen...If I could give
this a zero I would. I would highly recommend that someone thinking of
seeing it should consider another option. Thought he special effects
were halfway decent, the plot was horrendous and mad little sense.
Also, many questions were left unanswered concerning the plot and the
main characters, Jupitor Jones and her accomplice. It is unfortunate to
see that such a high anticipated movie fell flat, and I am sure that
other reviewers would agree with me. I went to see this movie with my
cousin hoping that it would somewhat impress us, however, we both
attempted to leave the theater within the first half hour. Overall, I
would suggest viewing a different movie the next time that you go to a
movie theater.
