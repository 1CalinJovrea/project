Big Dumb America

Hilariously dumb and manipulative, it's entertaining on that level
alone, although scary in that it's so boarder line that you can't be
sure the movie was made with tongue anywhere near cheek, I'm inclined
to think not. That this movie is serious, that America needs to feel
like a scared kitten rescued by a big stack of muscles. That stack of
muscles is Dwayne Johnson and it's hard not to love him. He's kinda
good in this, I like him, even when he's part of this manipulative
propaganda. The special effects were nice. it kinda flowed, sort of, I
guess, lots of plot holes but why bother looking for them when the iq
level they're aiming this at is so low you're not supposed to notice.
The cheesy flag at the end gives you another good piece of cheese to
choke on. If we're going to go down we might as well go down stupid.
