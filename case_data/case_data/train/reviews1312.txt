I can't hide it

I am really excited, especially because this is a major improvement to
the recent output of Chucky movies. This really hits the spot or mark
or whatever you want to call it. Unrated version should be the one to
watch obviously. The movie might not have many surprises plot wise (you
know the drill, no pun intended), but it has one very funny revealing
that ignited a lot of hooting in the cinema. And deservedly so! It
might be gender based hollering though.Whatever the case, the lead actress is the daughter of ... the voice of
Chucky! Which is a very strange thing to do and play as you can
imagine. Something she revealed in the Q&A after the movie was
presented too. Very convincing, as is everyone else in the movie. There
was not a moment where I felt not entertained. So I might have given
the movie a point to much (a 7 would be more appropriate), but that is
what happens, when a movie defies expectations and is actually exactly
what it should be
