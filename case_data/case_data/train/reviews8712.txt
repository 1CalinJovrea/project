A bizarre folk tale which leaves you unsatisfied!

Going to the cinema with high expectations was surely not the right
thing to do. After the director's marvellous masterpiece "The Lobster",
I expected a bigger movie - bigger in direction, screenplay, actor
ensemble, and budget - since The Lobster received many accolades and an
Oscar nom for best screenplay! However, his new movie seemed as if it was actually filmed before "The
Lobster" - a dull, white and unappealing setting (mostly the hospital),
not an ensemble cast or switching scenes + an unattractive and annoying
young boy as the young protagonist.I actually watched it till the end with enthusiasm because of Colin
Farrell and Nicole Kidman - I really like their work and acting and
they never disappoint. Also, hail to Nicole for having such a great
year ahead! They had some great scenes together which make the movie
worth to watch. The most annoying part must be the recurring unsettling & loud
orchestral music to force the effect of: "Hey, you are not watching a
slow-paced drama with no elements of thriller or action, it is going to
be so exciting and spooky right now". ...and the "bloody violence" or
scary, spooky scenes never came, actually. Wished Nicole Kidman had more scenes, though. She was too passive. I
wanted her to smack the boy or do the final act herself which I won't
tell ya not to spoil the ending.I hope we get more lobsters in the future than deer - they were not so
tasty, after all!
