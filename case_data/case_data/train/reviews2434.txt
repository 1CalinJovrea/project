Weird and wonderful

The tiny Australian town of Dungatar, which appears to be constructed
out of corrugated iron and dust, is home to a small population of
mainly picturesque eccentrics and poisonous women. Dressmaker Tilly
(Kate Winslet) returns to Dungatar after being driven away when she was
10 for murdering a classmate. Her remarkable dressmaking skills earn
her some brownie points, but the old wounds are far from healed.This extremely odd film defies classification. It is often very funny,
sometimes mystifying, always intriguing, sometimes tragic, and boasts
some terrific performances and some sights you never expected to see,
most of them involving Hugo Weaving. And the story keeps you constantly
interested and keen to find out what happens next. Liam Hemsworth does
some shirtless stuff, if that floats your boat (and it floats a couple
of boats in the film). Judy Davies, an actress I have never liked, made
me cry. The dresses made by Winslet's character (and her competitor)
are visually impressive and sometimes hilarious. The people who
populate Dungatar are not believable for an instant, but they work
wonderfully well as characters.This is a truly weird film, but I really liked it.
