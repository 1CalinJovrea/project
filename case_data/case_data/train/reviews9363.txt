awww.. it's not good.

Let's assume you know this film, and you just want to know *why* i
didn't like it.So ..Ben Affleck is Wolfe, a kid with Asperger / Autism / Any Other Mental
Illness which makes his crazy, but not. Because his dad makes him play
Karate Kid, Wolfe grows up to be a spy/vigilante who can also account
with the best accountants.He makes a ton of money accounting, but when he finds that some people
are bad (he's been working with bad people all his life) he decides NO,
I MUST KILL THEM.His autism comes and goes during the film, from minimal to severe.The he goes all rambo because it's a well known fact that being
autistic makes you better with snipers than an entire squad of
professional mercenaries.The film is stupid, but i can live with stupid.What i can't live with, is the fact that i had to wait 40 minutes of
backstory that serve to portray the main character as "autistic,
THEREFORE good with books" which is OK, but completely irrelevant as
there are about 30 seconds of math in the whole film.Everything else that happens, the Bourne/Wick/Reacher ripoff
shooty/punchy bits, do not in any way benefit from the backstory that
was so excruciatingly created for this character, and they could have
been totally left out of the film, with maybe a tiny mention, instead
focusing on his dad giving him a martial arts training, and just saying
"because he's weird, he's really good at this".And more, (although there's already plenty of nails in this coffin)
Anna Kendrick (whom i like and find very cute and funny in OTHER FILMS)
plays a character whose sole role is to show that Wolfe cannot have
normal relationships; there was no reason to cast such an expensive,
inappropriate star in the role, and the cutesy closing scenes (where
just five minutes earlier her character enunciated "he's a murdered")
where she now loves the lead, are horrible and should be removed
entirely.And there's more, but i think this is enough.Bad John Wick/Jason Bourne/Jack Reacher clone - 6/10
