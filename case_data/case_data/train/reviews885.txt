"A movie about modern advances dismantling the art industry as we know
it by replacing the high-paid middle-men with IT, bringing artist
closer to audience." Doesn't sound like a thrilling blurb, but this
movie brings the story to live with incredible writing, great music,
wonderful performances and a brilliant vision. Just like in "Once,"
this not-love-story side-steps the romance plot Hollywood usually uses
like a crutch and focuses on the struggle and triumph or artistic
endeavor. (most mainstream stories end with the message that the only
happy ending ends in breeding. This tale recognizes the value of
humankind's other creative capabilities.) Not that the film's all
esoteric and above family. There are all kinds of emotional wounds we
suffer in this life, in our families. Rather than a sub-plot focused on
starting a family, this story's sub-plot focuses on both growing strong
after a family fails (harder) and on repairing another failed family
(hardest).And that's all below the point.Music! What wonderful music they used in this film, from the soundtrack
to the original performances. The way they bring the performances and
the creative process to life - the pain, the joy, the failures and
triumphs - is just thrilling. This is the kind of film that will make
you want to get up and MAKE STUFF. And then put it out there because
you can. You don't need the middle-men anymore. You don't need the
industry.To create is the highest expression of humanity and so, perhaps, making
art (like this film) that inspires creativity in others is yet a step
above.
