Like tulip bulbs, this film needs to be stored in a cool, dry place

Tulipmania is one of Europe's weirder historical events. Unfortunately,
the movie barely touches on the tulip market craze, except as a deus ex
machina to bestow sudden wealth and/or loss on characters who we barely
care about and who do nothing to deserve it. The main problem with the film is that the love triangle that is
supposed to be the main story appears out of nowhere -- one of the
characters simply looks up pensively, as if he just solved a riddle,
and declares, "I'm in love!" Up until that point, he had shared maybe
60 seconds of screen time with the object of his affection. How can we
care about the contrived swings in fortune of such shallow people? Making things worse, this love triangle movie has five main characters,
leading to underdeveloped characters, repetition of ideas and
unnecessary subplots. I loved the sets and I thought that Christoph Waltz, Holliday Grainger
and Jack O'Connell did great jobs with the little they had to work
with.
