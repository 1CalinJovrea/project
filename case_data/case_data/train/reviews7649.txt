Bloody, dark, tongue in cheek fun!

I wasn't expecting anything deep or insightful or thought provoking
when I went to see this. I was expecting a fantasy/horror movie with
dark humor where I could turn off my brain and just enjoy the ride and
that was pretty much what I got. I really enjoyed it. It was fun and
funny and it was fairly obvious that their tongues were firmly in their
cheeks when they made this. I enjoyed the 'Middle Ages meets Steampunk'
aspect and thought it was a nice touch that Hansel actually developed
the sugar sickness - a.k.a. diabetes - from being forced to eat all
that candy as a kid.I enjoyed the brother/sister vibe between the two. You don't see a
great many brother/sister action duos. At least, none come immediately
to mind. It's always buddies/cops or soldiers and if there is a
male/female pairing it's usually romantic. To have the protagonists be
siblings was a refreshing twist. They both knew the other could take
care of themselves but were still protective and concerned for each
other.And as for taking care of themselves, hunting witches was never shown
as easy. They each got their asses handed to them on numerous occasions
and in the scene where we see Hansel shirtless, his body is covered in
scars, both old and new.The only complaint I have is that it wasn't long enough. It's run time
is just short of 90 minutes so they had ample room to expand a few
scenes - or even add new ones - to flesh out the character development
a little.
