Just didn't care

After watching over the first hour of this movie I just couldn't stay
interested in any of the characters or even in the plot for that
matter. In fact I was kind of hoping that his wife was dead and not
just missing. I really hoped he killed her because I didn't like her
character and I really hoped Affleck would die too in a shoot out with
cops; and I kind of hoped he would get lucky and kill them also. Well
maybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of
the pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I
mean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too.
About the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's
sister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in
an hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of
boredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic
scenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well
expressed how disturbed individuals were). I don't need to see Affleck
going down on a chick on his first date to kind of figure out they
bumped uglies. Graphic scenes have their purpose but when you over-do
it, you lose value.
