Terribly Bad Movie

This is a terribly bad movie I'm sorry to say but there is no other way
for me to put it. First off the acting is so awful I can't even believe
it. Clearly Jaden Smith (spelling?) (Jaeden Smith?) only got this job
because his dad is Will Smith, I know I know shocking but true haha.
Will Smith is also just going through the motions then collecting his
pay in this one obviously just being a good dad and getting his kid a
blockbuster movie role. Unfortunately this movie is the pits and it's
not just because of the awful acting. I'm sure it's hard to act with
CGI monsters anyway but the effects in this are surprisingly bad, much
worse than in Will Smith's other sci fi film. I am very disappointed in
this movie as a sci fi fan and movie fan in general, avoid this movie
at all costs even on TV!
