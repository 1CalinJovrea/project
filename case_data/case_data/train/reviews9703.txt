Unusual, captivating, repellent, and very, very good.

'American Mary' (2012) is the story of a would-be surgeon (she's
attending medical college) with money problems who suddenly finds
'underground' work lucrative. Soon she's performing increasingly
freakish 'body modification' procedures for fabulous sums, and her
'fame' grows. This one played out like a black comedy until around a
quarter of the way in when something nasty happens to Mary which skews
the screenplay into something a lot darker. It is an unusual movie but
one which held my complete attention until the end; not something which
happens every time with the horror genre. There's a little of the David
Cronenberg, even David Lynch about it. Bonus; the classical music on
the soundtrack (especially at the end) was lovely enough for me to seek
out on the Net.
