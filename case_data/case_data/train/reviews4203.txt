the tedium October built

well, the premise is interesting Â– a group of friends travelling Texas
and Louisiana in search of a secret haunted house experience that's
supposedly more 'extreme'/scarier than any other. unfortunately the
execution doesn't do the story justice the camera never stops bouncing and swiveling like the director is
jerking off with it through the entire film. seriously, it's bad even
for the found footage style. the first 30 minutes are primarily dull,
seemingly unscripted banter between dull, undeveloped characters. i
guess the lack of scripted dialogue is meant to add to the
documentary-style, found footage presentation, but it doesn't really
add anything to the story, and you can stretch it out only so far
before it begins to look like obvious filler. edit out all the
unnecessary parts of this film and shorten the scenes that drag on to
the point of killing all tension, and you'd have a marginally
interesting 20 - 30 minute short. i can't imagine why anyone thought it
needed a sequel, or who would want to sit through it after having
watched this, but i for one will be looking elsewhere for entertainment
this holiday season
