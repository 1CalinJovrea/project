Good animated fun!

I went to see this film this morning and found it very enjoyable. I
can't really remember the 1st so I can't really compare. Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, funny, feel good film that keeps you
entertained from the 1st minute to the last. The pace of the film moves
along nicely and keeps the audience attention very well. It has many
laugh out loud moments, a decent mix of children humour and adult
humour. The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell)is likable and funny.
The minions however are the main stars, they had me laughing on
multiple occasions during the film. The language created for the
minions is very well done as they speak in a fictional language but you
can always gather what they are saying.I found the visuals very impressive, it was very colourful and very
imaginative. The action scenes we also very well done.Would definitely recommend seeing this, no matter what your age. I am
22 and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not just for kids!
