Deceptive trailer and 8 year old point of view included

My daughters opinion of this first........Daddy can we leave after
about 40 minutes into it and her twisting and turning in the seat for
20 minutes at least. Daddy's opinion about 20 minutes into it, same
thing. The trailer is clearly deceptive by leaving out the singing
while the witch talks...........enough of it really, A movie with a few
songs like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty bang bang etc...and it's okay.
The whole movie makes this not a movie! This is NOT Disney material and
NOT worth wasting my time. If I had not been using free passes, I would
have demanded my money back! I mean Johnny Depp showing off his skills
for a singing pedophile? This is some sick stuff and for someone
brainwashed into thinking this sort of thing is good. Bottom line, this
movie was portrayed in the trailers to be for a child with the Disney
branding and trailer, which left out the singing likely to garner more
views. Big mistake Disney! I think folks will be a little more wary of
your trickery now. There is a difference between a movie and a musical.
Bad judgement call to deceive the consumer and not make this abundantly
clear it was a musical. Someones job should be on the cutting block for
this one without a doubt!
