Terrible

The concept of the movie was flawed from the start. "It is nearly
impossible to kill someone in the future and get away with it so they
send them back to the past to be killed and disposed of." Why not kill
them in the future and send their remains back to be disposed of.The movie dragged on and the ending was anticlimactic. It left me with
the impression that he was the young boy on the train and he too was
from the future, a kind of echo. If that were the case then why did he
not disappear too? Why would the gold stay when Willis disappeared. His
disappearance indicates that he was not sent back and neither was the
gold. Finally why would you leave a kid alive who you know is going to
turn into the most monstrous person in history? Are we to believe that
a kid with those powers will turn himself around with the help of his
mother? Had he changed the time line that much? The kid already turned
on of the "gats" into mush!OK... It is just science fiction... bad science fiction.
