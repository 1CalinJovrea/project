Great Beyond Any Expectations!!

After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy, the happiest Troll ever
born, and the curmudgeonly Branch set off on a journey to rescue her
friends. When i watched the first trailer for 'Trolls' i didn't know
what to expect but i'm happy to announce that the 6.5 rating here in
IMDb is a big joke because this film was insane and all the songs were
pretty amazing especially 'Can't Stop the Feeling' was the best of them
all. Plus the voice casting was pretty spot on Anna Kendrick as Poppy
was excellent, Justin Timberlake plays a troll called Branch that
doesn't like singing and Zooey Deschanel as Bridget was easily my
favorite part of the entire thing plus the ending of the movie was
pretty great and with some pretty good messages for both kids and
adults about what true happiness feels like. So overall let's bring on
Trolls 2 now!!!
