A very resplendent movie

Wow, there's "No Better Feeling" that could describe this experience; I
can see a rainbow after all. When the intro began, I get chilly over
the staggering soundtrack. There it is, in all of its glory: MY LITTLE
PONY: THE MOVIE. And almost instantly, we dive into the exploit.The one thing that REALLY stands out for this movie is the animation;
it looks magnificent and resplendent for its time especially in
contrast with the TV series. It really makes the characters all vivid
and vigorous; did I even mention the celebrity cast involved? Songbird
Serenade blew my mind, especially by the fact that she's played by Sia
herself - and while her original song "Rainbow" wasn't all that
astonishing, I'll still give credit to the grand soundtrack that this
movie provided as I was told that Daniel Ingram would be composing it
with a full orchestra. Sure, the movie did remind me of "The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie" and
"Lilo and Stitch" based on its borrowed elements - but it was still
stunning for this type of storyline. Overall, I thought that the movie
was all bright, smart, clever and observant - especially the
collaborative, action-packed ending - even if it didn't meet up to all
expectations. As for any-pony? Feel free to take time out of your life
to enjoy this cinematic masterpiece. We got this together!
