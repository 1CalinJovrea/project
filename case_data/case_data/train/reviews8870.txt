On the bright side, none of us had to pay extra, leave our homes, or put on pants to witness this atrocity

Adam Sandler, in the last five years, give or take, has become one of
the most divisive names in cinema; the name either inspires nostalgic
thoughts of belly laughs from previous years, be it from Sandler's
early films or his Saturday Night Live skits, or it inspires groans and
remarks of unusually mean-spirited proportions. With the first half of
this new decade down, he has given us Jack and Jill, Pixels, That's My
Boy, Just Go With It, and Grown Ups 2, some of the most critically
panned pictures.With that, Sandler has become something of a risky box office commodity
for Hollywood; while he does indeed make studios money, he attracts a
lot of negative press. Because of this it's understandable why, in
addition to the touchy subject matter in an exhaustively politically
correct society, Sandler's latest picture, The Ridiculous 6, endured a
rather low-key release on Netflix's Watch Instantly platform rather
than a heavily marketed release in over 2,000 theaters across America.
Netflix has signed a four-movie deal with Sandler, but after The
Ridiculous 6's incomparably negative reactions from critics and
audiences forced the streaming company to minimize its prominence on
the film's site, I assume the forthcoming three pictures will be
released to the public with a lot more four-letter words mumbled under
CEO Reed Hastings' breath as he cuts his losses and moves forward
accordingly.The Ridiculous 6 is an atrocious film, but atrocious in an unsurprising
way, frankly. It's a satire on American Westerns, which, in the
present, need to look to Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the
West as some kind of contemporary benchmark of quality, something that
says a lot in itself. The film is a tireless array of physical sight
gags and grossout comedy helmed by some huge names in the industry
ostensibly doing their best to be the most insufferable screen
presences of the year.The film revolves around the nonchalant Tommy "White Knife" Stockburn
(Adam Sandler in a character boasting less personality than his
character in Pixels, who has found himself caught in the center of
vicious gangs due to his engagement to a Native woman. Tommy believes
he is just a simple orphan, until he meets a bank robber named Frank
Stockburn (Nick Nolte), who claims he is Tommy's biological father and
that his mother was shot by a man with tattoos on his hand when he was
a young boy. Frank also reveals to Tommy that he has $50,000 buried in
the middle of a field before he is kidnapped by Cicero (Danny Trejo)
and held for the hefty ransom.In efforts to rescue his husband, Tommy discovers he also has five half
brothers: they are a Mexican donkey-rider named Ramon (Rob Schneider in
his ongoing streak of never playing a tolerable character), a giddy,
mentally-retarded man named Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner), the large and
feral Herm (Jorge Garcia), a black pianist named Chico (Terry Crews),
and Danny (Luke Wilson), Abraham Lincoln's bodyguard who failed to
protect him from no one else but John Wilkes Booth. Together, the gang
form "The Ridiculous 6," a bumbling but well-meaning sextet that
attempts to find their father all while avoiding dangers such as rebel
gangs, Wyatt Earp's (country singer Blake Shelton) sharp-shooting
skills, and "Injuns." It seems that both Sandler and Tim Herlihy, the screen writing duo on
this project, concocted a list of the most intolerable attributes they
could include in a film and haphazardly sewed a film together
conjoining those scenes which produced little in the way of a plot. The
way The Ridiculous 6 just wears on a helpless viewer, beating them down
with sterile comedic setups, characters that are simultaneously
underwritten and overdone, and acting from nearly everyone involved
that just tries too hard to resonate in a humorous way, is depressing.
The strongest actor in the film, playing the most consistently funny
and likable character, is Vanilla Ice, who plays Mark Twain in the
film's sole good scene involving a staged robbery by the six before
Twain, Earp, and a few others.The problem with Western satires is that most of the material is
well-charted ground by now: how many more times can we see the eclectic
and specific names of Native Americans made fun of, the fact that
bumbling white people are uncultured and stole the land from the
Natives, or the invention of popular conventions such as baseball that
we know today? Slam MacFarlane's admittedly mediocre attempt to
revitalize the genre, but he at least came with a thesis of showing how
miserable and inconvenient life in the West would've been. Sandler just
brings his brand of mindless stupidity to a different setting and turns
recognizable faces (most notably Taylor Lautner, who is just
unbelievably bad and unfunny here) and talented actors into the most
unlikable cast of buffoons I've seen this year.Give Sandler credit in that he, at the very least, didn't make us pay
any extra, leave our homes, or put on pants to see a film that's really
not even good enough for a direct-to-Comedy-Central release. The
Ridiculous 6, which also parodies The Magnificent Seven, though,
because of timing, seems to ride the coattails of Quentin Tarantino's
forthcoming Hateful Eight, is an abysmal comedic affair, and that,
above all, given Sandler's recent string of films and the dumping of
his next four films on Netflix, is the most unsurprising thing about
this entire mess of a film.Starring: Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Jorge Garcia, Taylor Lautner,

Ice, Blake Shelton, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Will Forte, Chris
