Disturbing and beautiful

"Stoker" is a beautiful, twisted, hypnotic trance - it's meant for an
audience not overly concrete in it's thinking but who have an open
imagination and are able to take the plunge into the darkly poetic
vision of it's director. "Stoker" doesn't exist in a normal, everyday
reality - it's more of an alternative dream reality, hyper-aware and
sexually charged. The three principle actors are superb, but Mia
Wasikowska really gives the film a beating heart, as she emerges from
her innocence into her latent self - a mesmerizing performance. This
movie is filled with images that are as disturbing as they are lyrical
and open to endless interpretation (along with a subversive wit). I've
seen the film multiple times and find that my impressions change with
each viewing and that it has really haunted my imagination. "Stoker" is
one of those unique and mysterious masterpieces that I'm sure I will be
returning to frequently over the years - there's much to drink in, as
the well runs deep.
