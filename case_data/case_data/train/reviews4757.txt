Slow building & plot alternating claustrophobic bunker movie with a sloppy ending

I've always loved movies with strong atmosphere. Three people locked
together in an underground shelter is a recipe for making a movie which
is going to draw you in a rather small but peculiar world.This is one if the rare non-crime movies that keep you guessing what
might have happened and what's happening. No where does the plot
release it's vents but on contrary it keeps building pressure.There are little if any horror elements in this movie. Those of you who
want to get scared are not going to be content. Those of you looking
for a tense, slow building atmosphere are going to love this one! This
is primarily a mystery movie.John Goodman has done such a good job that he even succeeded in making
me nervous like I was locked with him. There's nothing really strange
about Howard. The conditions are guilty for making him looking wicked.
Or are they?While the main premise has been greatly utilized I don't think ending
was sound or in some way contributory to a plot. It's as if writers
didn't know how to leave some space open for a sequel. You can enjoy this movie equally well watching it by yourself or with
somebody else. Go and see it.
