In a cinema no one can hear you cringe

After watching Prometheus I was looking forward to Alien Covenant, big
mistake. When you can guess the ending of a film early on, are aware of
the SLOW passage of time when watching it and don't give a flying f*#k
about the characters and you suddenly realise you are actually BORED
you know you have a dud. Yeah, big budget, impressive scenery but no new ideas here folks. It's
like the writers didn't care anymore. "Hey, we'll make money out of
this no matter what let's just chuck a bunch of derivative s@#t in the
script, no one will notice". One word...PREDICTABLE.
