Everything seemed to good to be true. And it was, but only a little bit.

Lawless has a great cast - Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Guy
Pearce. - And a great story about three brother's growing up in
Depression- era Virginia and based on a true story. The three brother's
are bootleggers, but when a special deputy and other police figures
want a cut of their action, their whole world turns upside down. Everything seemed too good to be true. The cast, the story, everything.
And it was, but only a little bit. The film was great, very enjoyable
to watch, great acting from everyone involved. But the film, I felt,
lacked something. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters, as
in they felt too two-dimensional. I didn't really feel how they felt at
certain points and it should have showed the brotherhood more instead
of opting for blood and violence. I think the film needed to be more
humorous, because it needed something to ease the tension between those
bloody scenes and I think that was it. Shia LaBeouf was very good and Tom Hardy was even better. Even the
smaller roles like Gary Oldman's character were acted well. I think it
spent too much time on the whole romance aspect of it and it should
have laid off of that a bit more. But the acting was great from
everyone and it was an enjoyable time at the cinema. It is a good film,
but didn't live up to the expectations I had. A solid 7/10.
