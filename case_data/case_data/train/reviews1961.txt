Thin plot, bad acting

I guess I fell for the marketing, and I have to admit the idea behind
the film still seems OK. The 3D effects were good & not overdone. On
the other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the acting
and voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made by
an American director who was trying to make a 'european' style movie
but didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born in
south America).The movie lasts more than 2 hours, but there is no suspense, no
buildup, etc. Karl Glusman (the lead actor) is not credible in this
role, the emotions don't seem real and his voice-overs are even worse.
His character begin a 'movie director' or something of the kind seems
almost irrelevant and implausible.After an hour, the movie started getting tedious as it was obvious this
'wasn't going anywhere'. I don't recommend seeing it, unless you're
only interested in the raw sex in 3D (but remember... it's more than 2
hours you have to sit through).
