Unexpected Gem

I've not seen an original horror this well done for a long time. The
cast is strong, dialogue and acting good, the story is interesting,
well paced and well directed.If you didn't know better, you may think after the first third of the
film that you were watching a forensic crime, and would be quite happy
to continue watching in that vein. Instead, an unsettling, atmospheric,
claustrophobic tale of magic, sacrifice and revenge unfolds, which I
was more than happy with. The direction is outstanding, your
imagination does a lot of the work and the budget is saved for some
very well done major scenes (and of course, quality actors -
unfortunately rare in horror these days). Whereas it would have been wonderful to tie up the loose ends, see a
bit about the Witch Trials history, give Hirsch and Cox a bit more to
go on earlier in the film etc. With that said, it may have removed
something from the very polished whole, and in all likelihood will
yield a - well deserved - sequel. Jane Doe sure as Hell hasn't finished
yet!It's got that "Sinister" vibe about it, and is certainly one of the
best horror releases of the year. I challenge anyone to watch this and
not feel impressed, satisfied and maybe just a little bit scared.
