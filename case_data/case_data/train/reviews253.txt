Abundantly creative, needlessly confusing, anti-climactic

One of the more creative movies I've ever seen. The premise showed
great promise, and it's fleshed out about as far as you could take it.
The problem is... things accelerate at such a high rate, that you
quickly figure out that the details don't matter. If the movie had a
smaller scale, or a more claustrophobic feel, I think it would have
worked better. In a mind-bending movie like this, usually noticing
details is what pieces everything together. But here, most of what
happens turns out to not be of any consequence. The ending only serves
to ram this point home - it seems like they just ran out of ideas and
wrapped it up as quickly as possible.I think this was a good film... but with a steadier pace, a tighter
narrative, and a stronger finish, it could have been great.
