Did I see a different movie than everyone else that has raved about how good it is?

I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan
movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much
money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship
getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then
remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly
defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a
plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach
with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers.
Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this
being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something
special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic
movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show
with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My
biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making
it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me.
