Nope. Don't do it.

Dear lord I want those two hours back, I just can't, there is so much
wrong, everything, the whole thing. Just no. No. Did they know they
were making a film people were actually going to watch? Why so bad?
Answer that in the next film! Dream sequence maybe? I am right, not the
other people who gave it 2 or 3 stars,they do not know what they are
talking about. Trust me. I am required to write more so here is a
rhyme. Allegiant was so bad, I wish I was not so sad, that I watched
that whole film, and now I feel like I wish I had more time, to help
tell you the crime..s.. these people should be charged with, hating the
world, murdering my mind, with their pointless story and waste of time.
The end
