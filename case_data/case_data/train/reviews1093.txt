playing it cool

Excellent choice of Music selection, love the editing and the cast
wow, I think Chris Evans nailed this one really well. I like the semi-
narcissistic introduction of the movie, and I think it really worked
well for the overall production of this movie. Story-wise, I've watched
a few (okay, maybe not a few but a Ton of Rom-coms) and this one really
has a very different feel. The characters were relatable for writers
and also to those who want to find another perspective when it comes to
love itself. I won't really reveal more about this story but, I will
tell you thisit has one of the best romcom scene's that I've ever
seen.
