What the movie needed was a better ending!!

----SPOILER ALERT----Overall, its a good movie. I enjoyed watching it, was on the edge of
seat at times but I was expecting it to end in a more satisfying way,
which I would say did not happen. It was not an all our Lake Eden or
Funny Games (utterly stupid movie), so the end had some redeeming
factor.And I could not believe that the boyfriends were being bossed around by
this 12 year old idiot, I would have liked some better characters
there. Except for the girl no one tried saving themselves and were
acting like idiots, so no regret their characters were killed off.Finally, a better ending would have been the boy falling off the roof
while his parents were back and paralysing or impaling himself, would
have been a good lesson for a narcissist psychopath like him who would
not give a s**t about killing his best friend.
