Not disturbing or funny

I don't see the appeal here. This is just the sad, unpleasant
rape/murder fantasy of a child. There's nothing particularly dark or
disturbing here that we haven't seen much worse of in other, better
movies. It starts out acting like it's going to be a comedy too, yet
nothing funny happens after the kid's annoying reign of terror begins.
It's not scary and it's not funny, so what exactly is the big deal
here? It's just a couple of annoying children acting like stupid, inept
villains.
