Punching above its weight.

There is nothing very groundbreaking about the style or narrative arc
of this wee gem; there have been more realistic and more intense boxing
scenes over the years, more emotional ones too, but where Bleed For
This wins is in the casting and the superb performances from Miles
Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Ciaran Hinds, all doing incredible character
work, with hair second only to anything in American Hustle.Directed with a fondness for the late 80s and a good eye for detail, we
come to care about this story purely because Miles Teller makes us care
- real, energetic and unsentimental, he takes us on the journey with
him every step and every punch. That it is all very predictable and
mostly lacking in tension in the ring doesn't stop it being a powerful
film, just because the relationships are so well drawn.No Warrior. No Rocky, even. But a decent small story remarkable in its
truth.
