A New Horror Camp

The writers of this film stated that they didn't like how the horror
genre has become. Full of unlikable characters that we don't care if
they live or die. Cabin in the Woods sounds like a generic horror film
with a generic premise and generic horror characters. When you see it
closely, it's an intriguing high concept satirical horror film. It may
look absurd but it's actually brilliant and smart. It has campy scares
and some good laughs. Cabin in the Woods is an enjoyable horror film
with an unlikely twist.Horror movies have lost its suspense because we don't care about the
characters and the characters are particularly dumb to make decisions
to survive. It make sense in this film. The actors did a great
portraying these clich√©d characters. Chris Hemsworth and his body
already makes a good jock character. Kristen Connolly is pretty
likable. Fran Kranz steals the show as the pot headed dude.Some will say it's generic but it's actually intriguing. I'm not gonna
give everything away but I'm gonna say it's a bit absurd but it's smart
and inspired. It's also a bit scary, though some of the jump scares
didn't work but it's much better when the scares goes campy. I'm not
gonna reveal the monsters either. There are ridiculously hilarious
moments which lightens the grimness. The thrills and suspense are
always there.At first, you thought it's just another horror film but when you pass
through the rest of the film, you will realize that this would be a
remarkable experience. I have to agree with one of the critics, "The
less you know about Cabin in the Woods, the better". It looks absurd
but it's smart and creative. It gave substance to all generic horror
movie nonsense. It's Campy, Hilarious, and Fun.
