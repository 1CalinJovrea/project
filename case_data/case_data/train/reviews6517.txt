Timepass Movie-watchable One time.

Its a usual Will Ferrell movie that has laughs at only when he is at
his usual outburst. Mark Wahlberg adds up to the support and behaves
same as he did in 'The Other Guys' , which also had Ferrell. The kids
are irritating . Actress doesnot have much to do apart from looking
beautiful , which she definitely is. Mark and Will have a good
chemistry. Ending is not upto the mark. Will's Boss also has a
laughable role (not pun-intended) in the movie. Character for the black
Guy is funny. The scene at Basketball stadium had me in splits due to
Ferrell's outburst. :) Overall: A one time watch which if you need few
Ferrell Laughs.
