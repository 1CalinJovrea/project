Pablum Served Up Hollywood Style

The Plot:Based on a true story. A team of African-American women provide NASA with important
mathematical data needed to launch the program's first successful space
missions."Based on a true story." Hollywood's way of saying they made the entire
thing up. Filled with early 60s stereotypes to fit Hollywood's revisionist views
of history the film moved from insulting to engaging. Bottom line is
this: It's a well made movie but it's sugared pablum for the masses and
for undeserved academy awards.When are you clowns going to get real and stop pandering to political
correctness?
