Feels like a big-budget television movie

"HHhH" ("The Man with the Iron Heart") is a decent historical war
drama. It scores high marks for authenticity regarding locations,
costumes, mores and props; however, with the exception of a few bare
breasts, feels like a television movie. Although several thousand
people are brutally murdered, the violence feels antiseptic, with a few
spurts of blood and red stains on costumes, but no sense of either
physical or emotional trauma. The nearly universal use of jiggly-cam
shots serves as a constant distracting reminder that somebody is
holding a camera, preventing the audience from ever fully suspending
disbelief. Performances are good, but seem repressed, even when
Reinhard tears up a room in frustration. At the end, the viewer is left wondering what it all means. Tremendous
risks were taken, resulting in terrible consequences. The filmmakers
offer no interpretation or moral and insufficient perspective for the
audience to make their own judgment.
