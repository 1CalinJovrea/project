An insult to our WWII Vets

I walked out of the theater speechless, that it is 2014 and we can
still produce movies that are so historically inaccurate. Heck I dug up
my old IMDb account just to neg this movie.Like my title says, this movie is an absolute slap in the face to the
millions of World War II vets who fought to secure our freedom. The
conduct and parlance of these soldiers was extremely out of character
with the 1940's. Please, don't curse like it's 2014 when you're
portraying an event that happened 70 years ago. They couldn't even
display proper military discipline. I knew it was going to be bad just from a the first few minutes of
dialogue and acting, then the combat scenes began!So totally unrealistic you can't even suspend your disbelief and enjoy
it. Were the Germans firing blanks? Hundreds of dead Germans with only
a few GI casualties. The Waffen SS - the most revered fighting force of
the time - running aimlessly into machine gun fire like a cheap video
game. Missing their mark at point blank range. Germans typically
portrayed as weak, inferior and dumb. I think you could live in a test tube and probably be smart enough to
realize the final battle was a JOKE. So silly nothing more needs to be
said. The reality is, all four tanks would have been likely knocked out in
the first battle by the Germans in the tree-line with their AA and
panzerschrecks. The Tiger tank in the second battle would have knocked
out all four Sherman tanks, on the first shot, Fury never would have
got behind it to make the kill (research some famous tank battles). The
SS in the final battle would have made short work of their disabled
tank in a few short minutes. This movie best exemplifies the quote:"History is written by the victors"
