A promising premise that falls in the clichés of found footage

When I saw the trailer for The Houses October Built, I was very
intrigued by it. It's a found footage movie which is easily in overkill
these days, but the premise was interesting. I always liked the idea of
a haunted house that took it too far in terms of scaring people to
potentially harming them. Unfortunately, despite a promising premise,
the movie still falls prey to the clichés of the found footage subgenre
to make a rather forgettable entry.Good: Like I stated, I really like the premise of a roaming haunted
house that take their fear measures to the extreme along with a group
of people who go on a trip to visit haunted houses. I think the found
footage angle is necessary here unlike most of the movies released
nowadays. The scenes involving the haunted houses are fun and they put
you in the middle of the attractions. There are also some creepy
moments thrown in there mostly involving clowns.Bad: Unfortunately, the movie drags a lot when it isn't concentrating
on the haunted houses. The characters are all very bland and
uninteresting and we see a lot of conversations that add nothing to the
story. This adds to the time length and it just meanders. Then the
movie just goes full on Blair Witch/Paranormal Activity territory and
it doesn't generate much suspense in its familiar scares.Overall, while I do enjoy the premise and it does have fun sequences
involving the haunted houses, it still isn't that scary and it drags
too long to be effective.
