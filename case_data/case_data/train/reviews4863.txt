Best Film in Years

This film was so good that I joined IMDb just to say it is amazing!As big budget films go this one takes the cake, great story line, great
action, great heart melting moments!I heard that this got bad reviews.... well in my opinion its better
than the avengers and avatar combined! 10/10 best film to fail at the
box office since Fight Club!!!Need I say more? Well I plan on watching it at least 10 more times!!!I now plan to read all the books this was based on, as i haven't felt
this excited about a film since well I don't know.I am still in shock at how kick ass this film was... Even the ending
was great.Now what else do I need to do to get you to go see this film....?
