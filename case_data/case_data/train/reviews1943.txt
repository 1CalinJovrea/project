Great Adaptation

What impressed me the most, was that all of the major elements of the
Anime were captured without the really sexual or violent aspects of the
story. It makes it safe for a younger crowd, without ruining the
original story at all. The other thing that really stands out is how
many scenes are identical to the Anime, at the major plot points it's
done seamlessly.This isn't Anime which should be obvious, but it seems some folks are
struggling with that. If you miss some part of the Anime, go watch it
again. The Anime nerds ripping it apart should consider live action
adaptations are going to pull back to low budget B flicks from all of
the ignorant reviews. As it stands, they'll likely go dig another
crappy DC/Marvel story from the bottom of the pile before ever funding
the finish of a live action Ninja Scroll, or Akira.
