Not even worth watching after Divergent

No character evolution, plot is very hard to believe and not reasonable
at all. It seems like everything that has happened in the previous
movie is just forgotten. Plot without any logic, no innovation, just
repeatedly using the same plot lines again and again. Characters seem
to forget everything that has happened to them, they often choose
incomprehensibly redundant actions and take irrational decisions. It
makes me feel sorry for all the people who spent their time on the
special effects, which look great, but unbelievably poor plot just
destroys the whole experience, especially after so great first movie
Divergent. The first movie must have attracted many fans of titles such
as Hunger Games. After watching the first movie, I couldn't wait to see
Insurgent. But, unfortunately, now I must say that comparison to Hunger
Games is not relevant in this case. Although the special effects are
traditionally on a very high level, the poor plot together with the
shallow adaptation of potentially very dramatic and epic scenes makes
me feel like I should have skipped this movie and rather consider
Divergent as one complete story without any follow-up.
