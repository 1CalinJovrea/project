What were they smoking?

I don't remember the last time I went to a movie, and almost walked out
in the first 5 minutes to ask for a refund. That is how quickly I
sensed I was in a disaster.I usually enjoy sci-fi movies and don't nitpick them to death. I'm used
to being let down by the likes of Green Lantern and John Carter, and
still finding them adequately entertaining.However, this was some convoluted mess. It seemed slapped together. The
soundtrack seemed like some stock hack job. Characters were not
developed at all. Stuff randomly jumped around. The "universe" seemed
inconsistent, incoherent, and generally muddled. This just outright
hurt to sit through. I gave it a chance, but it didn't get better. I
tried wondering if I'd have liked it if it was my first movie, and I
was maybe 12. No, I don't think so.Anyway, this is now at the top of my Razzie list for at least the last
couple decades. I've seen a *lot* of movies. Though I'd normally rather
watch Mila Kunis for two hours over John Travolta in weird space
dreadlocks... I think I'd rather watch Battlefield Earth again over
this... thing. Wow. This was really really really bad. It's not even
worthy of Showgirls-like cult status. This one should have people
mocking it for at least a generation. Especially the ears.
