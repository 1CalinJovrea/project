Extremely weak drama with dirty porn.

Danish writer and director Lars Von Trier delivers an extremely weak
drama/documentary film full of dirty porn (from explicit oral sex to
anal sex and vulgar sex and nudity), Lars Von Trier claims that he is
treating the problem of a nymphomaniac woman called "Joe",but in
reality we trace the story of a dirty whore who becomes a sex slave and
who have all kinds of sex and flesh pleasure for the sake of pleasure.
The vulnerable drama is obviously seen in the monotonous Dialogue
between Joe and the old man. I am extremely astounded Why Uma Thurman
agreed to act in a dull movie like this that contains filthy porn !.
Nymphomaniac Volume I is a movie to avoid because it is too boring and
totally silly to watch even for porn lovers it is a trash movie.
