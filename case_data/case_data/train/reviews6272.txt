Blood, dust(?), blood, fireflies(?), blood, ash(?), blood

Is there a point to this movie? And what's with all the stuff blowing
around in the background? At one point, I decided that the theater was
having problems with the film and almost left to speak with an
employee, but then it was never there during the battle scenes, so it
must have been SOMETHING, but it was soooooooo distracting.Not that there was much to concentrate on. Absolutely ridiculous and
ultra violent, along with an--Spoiler ALERT--unpleasant sex scene.
Another reviewer mentioned romance--no, there was none of that.I went for the special effects, the ship battles, of which there were
several. Hundreds of men standing on a flat ship's deck, with no sides
or rails, plummeting down the face of a wave of Poseidon proportions,
and the men don't even sway a bit. Women engaging in sword fights in
skirts (and the men in capes).And the blood. All over the place. If the word "overkill" ever applied
to anything, this movie is it. Just when I finally had enough and was
ready to walk out, the show mercifully ended.Snickers throughout the theater--and I'm not talking' about the candy
bars.But really, what was with the dust/fireflies?
