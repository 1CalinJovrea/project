Surprisingly good

When I saw the first previews of "Rise of the Guardians", I thought
that it was going to be dumb movie, something like an animated
equivalent of films like "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" or
"The Brothers Grimm"...To my surprise, this movie turned out to be much
better than I was expecting: The story was fast-paced and entertaining
to watch, the characters were likable and interesting and the whole
movie had a quite good balance of comedy and seriousness.The animation was good too. I liked a lot the characters designs, which
(in my opinion) were much better than anything that Dreamworks have
done before (Specially compared with the ugly designs of "Bee Movie"
and "Megamind") The main characters had a very appealing appearance which combined a
certain level of "cutesy" with the "edgy" portrayal that they receive
in this film. The result was more than satisfying.Is sad to see how incredibly underrated this movie is, considering the
many virtues that it has. Personally, I consider this to be a much
better film than stuff like "Shrek" or "How to Train your Dragon".8.5/10
