Watch it with your own eyes

Went to the theater, expecting to experience the dark side of Angelina
Jolie who plays a vengeful fairy with lofty wings and left the theater
feeling astonished by how beautifully the movie has changed my
perspective towards the antagonist.The remake of the classic Disney movie, "Sleeping Beauty" timely and
soundly pans out by wonderfully depicting both beautiful and gloomy
sides of fairy land of Maleficent that feud with selfish humans. The
Visual effects and acting are so magnificent that mysterious creatures
and the cast look totally in sync. The plot naturally goes along with
coherent and succinct narrations that add an in-depth storytelling. Not
to mention a good composition that captures significant moments without
boredom. There are a lot more to feel, enjoy, and learn from what I would call,
"One of the most underrated movies of the year" based on how the score
is given. Not a Disney movie fan? Doesn't like a female protagonist? I
don't think it will matter because once you start watching, you will be
mesmerized by the imposing world and the ambivalent emotion of
Maleficent.
