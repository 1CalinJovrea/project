10
Glorious pixels!

I only give a movie a 10 if it's perfect in some way. The Pixel
characters and effects were perfect, and it would have been so easy to
get it all wrong. Hint: They were supposed to be blocky, that's what
pixels are. Adam Sandler is the last person I ever thought could get a
10 out of me, but then he isn't the star of this movie. The pixels are.
I seriously doubt any 80's Arcader gave this movie a bad review because
it captures perfectly the beauty, joy, love and excitement of classic
arcade games. Not since "Last Starfighter" has a game paid homage to
Arcaders and classic games like this, and Adam Sandler is now on my
favorite movies list with what I consider to be his most enjoyable
movie. The cast did a great job in keeping the characters fun and
entertaining and not taking themselves more seriously than was
necessary. The haters picked the wrong target this time. Arcaders will
treasure this movie for a long time.
