Not A Journey You Should Go On

The previews for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island made it look better
than it actually was. The movie was only slightly better than I was
expecting. The premise for Journey 2 was good. I enjoyed the idea, but
the movie was taken to a really cheesy level.Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Josh Hutcherson were truly the best part
of this flick. They had good chemistry, and their characters and acting
were decent. Yes, they brought some cheese, but very little in
comparison to other characters. Vanessa Hudgens was OK. She really
didn't bring much to the table neither through the character or her
acting. Luis Guzman's character was AWFUL. He apparently was suppose to
be the comic relief, but there was nothing funny about him or his
jokes. His character actually brought the movie down in terms of its
likability.I also found this movie to be somewhat flawed in its creation. For
instance, the jelly fish should have been large, but instead were
regular size. I realize this is a kids & family movie and wasn't
created for extreme accuracy, or Oscar wins. I, however, still enjoy
consistency in my movies.Journey 2: The Mysterious Island wasn't all that original, and
EXTREMELY predictable. I pretty much knew everything that was going to
happen before it happened. Some aspects of this movie felt like they
were straight out of "Honey I Shrunk the Kids".All-in-all, this movie was just alright. For a kid, it might have been
much more enjoyable. For an adult, it was just too flawed, corny, and
cheesy to amount to much.
