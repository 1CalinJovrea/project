Why are these people allowed to make movies?

The good news is that this is better than the last turtles movie. The
bad news is the last turtles movie was horrendous. The title should
tell it all. I really don't understand how certain people retain their
jobs in Hollywood. The only reason this movie is afloat is due to
legacy. It could have been written by kindergartners and it would have
performed just as well. Might as well let someone new have a shot
instead of paying these idiots for doing average or below work.Back to the movie, the writing is horrendous. The only thing that is
makes this better than the last movie is the action and graphics are
better but that is just because it is more modern. There is nothing to
like here. Characters are forgettable to unlikable. Jokes were not
funny. Hip hop culture references are embarrassing... reminded me of
the horrible transformers movie with those dancing autobots... wow that
was bad. Slow motion action scenes are cheesy and overdone.Absolutely no good points to make about this movie.
