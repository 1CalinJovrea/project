Lacks intelligence of all previous

Lacklustre story line lacking intelligence, dialogue, and character
development. I am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too
high for this sequel. Was hoping for same kind of substance and kept
waiting for something impressively unexpected, like previous. Legacy
was a better film. Even fight scenes and car chases from all previous
had a different "feel" than typical action films, but formula made
these redundant and confusing, not fun like others. The predictable
plot had me thinking, hoping for intelligent twist that did not happen.
It's a good rental I suppose.
