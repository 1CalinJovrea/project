I have to confess I really enjoyed it!

I expected this to be another identikit kids animated movie like we've
seen so many times before over the years. You know....typical cash in
on a franchise or trend doing the rounds at that time.However I will admit I really did enjoy this movie. It has some great
music in it. Some unexpected (and great!) 80s covers included
throughout and overall it did have some great dialogue and funny little
moments mixed in there.Yeah so the story is pretty predictable but the voice talent and the
animation carries it off so well you don't mind so much.Its not gonna win any awards but there are worse ways to spend an
afternoon with your kids.
