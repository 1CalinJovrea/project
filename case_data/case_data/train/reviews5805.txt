If you know what being in the moment means, or like sci fi, then watch this film!

I liked this movie. I nearly didn't go to watch it because of the sea
of bad reviews but then I remembered I enjoyed 'the last air bender',
by the same director. I also thought, I like getting lost in a sci-fi
flick, I like Will Smith and I'm bored so off I went for a later
showing. I was expecting drivel and to be bored stupid with no real
mind stimulation at all... but this didn't happen. I'm not a writer or
a major film buff so can't review too thoroughly here but I was
entertained for the whole movie, had a tear in my eye at times and
easily got lost in the universe that this film is set in. BUT! What I
really liked about the movie and what bumped it up to 8 out of 10 is
the message that the movie makers were clearly trying to get across.
They succeeded and I don't want to spoil it for anyone but I certainly
left the movie grounded in the moment and free of fear. I don't care if
I don't sound cool or in the know like the other critics, any film,
book or stimulus of any kind that helps free me from my mind in this
way gets a massive thumbs up from me.
