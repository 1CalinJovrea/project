Do not pay for this!

The storyline was slow, and the whole movie was built for the 10 years
old children to understand whats happening. It was filled with clich√©s
and was not creative at all. I was so disappointed after watching this.
I watched this with my friends and they are on the same opinion. The
worst Batman / Superman movie ever I think. Ben Affleck was not a good
choice for Batman because he is not "blue blooded" enough and was not
able to act like them.Spoiler alert! Why did they need Wonderwoman? She was really
unnecessary. (Only for the Hype maybe?!) :/ :/ :/ :/ PS.: Why they did
not ask for David Mazouz to play in the first part?
