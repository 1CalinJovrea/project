This one is different, in a good way.

If you're into horror movies, you already know that a modern,
moderately unknown horror movie receiving over a 6 on IMDb is a good
sign. As usual, with the films I like, I think it deserves better.This movie is different than others in this genre. It's well done and
the subject matter is perfect for a horror movie. Oh sure, there's
things you can pick apart if you're into dissecting every plot hole or
unbelievable character action. But if you just sit back and enjoy the
ride, I guarantee you'll find a movie that surpasses many in this genre
in sheer plot alone. The acting is good and the movie builds and builds
to a satisfying ending.I've re-watched it over three times. Half the horror movies nowadays, I
turn off in 10 minutes.8/10
