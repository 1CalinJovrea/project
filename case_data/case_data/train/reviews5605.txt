The best way to end this year- Watch PK!!! Ride of laughter and reality

Mixture of comedy and some lifetime lessons together constitute PK. A
journey in which you will learn the life lessons and face the reality
of our society in a different way.Amir's acting, Anushkha's cuteness and Shushant's innocence will win
your heart. Thanks for making this film Mr. Hirani. At least somebody
is there don't make movies just for money. Every dialogue, every scene
was so perfect that you will a smile on your face all the time. Loved
the simplicity of the movie. Beautiful locations, amazing songs and the
funny dialogues adds spice to the movie.A must watch movie for all.
