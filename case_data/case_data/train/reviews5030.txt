Madea is back

In the three years since the last madea movie a madea Christmas, Tyler
Perry returns to his signature role of madea with hilarious results. In
this film, Brian has been struggling with being a single father to his
daughter Tiffany and son since his ex wife Deborah from diary of a mad
black woman cheated on him. Brian asks madea to watch his daughter
after she tries to sneak ro a fraternity despite being underaged. I
will say it was good to see him return since it portrayed the character
as someone who has a fear of ghosts which was hilarious to watch. The
film also brings back bam from madea happy family who provides the
comedic relief
