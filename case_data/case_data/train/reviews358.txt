honest, deep, dramatic and beautiful

I loved this movie. My favorite part about this movie is the idea - being true to ones
feelings, being destroyed by pain to the point of loosing oneself and
having the strength to finding it again; having the strength and
incredible will to let go and move on. I find it deep and insightful.I also like the presentation of this idea - in a simple, very honest
way. That's why I think, the symbolism they used fits in so well, even
though it's a bit obvious - the heavy bag she carries at the beginning
of the journey, bleeding feet, getting new shoes that fit, throwing up
(as letting all the bad things out) and coming to the gods bridge. All
of these are classic, obvious symbols, which are in tune with the
simpleness of the presentation of the idea. This brings me to another point I like about this movie, how it
contrasts this very simple plot and very simple presentation to very
complicated 'things' inside the main character. I also have to mention
the script, because its loooong time since I have seen/heard such a
good script - communicating the drama of one's life without overdoing
it. And OK, there are some factual errors in this movie, but they are not
so important and Witherspoon did a great job as an actress and a
producer. For me it's her best movie so far. So to sum it up - strong drama, in simple, honest presentation,
inspiring to return to your good self, no matter what may happen. The
way we deal with our feelings, is the way we leave.
