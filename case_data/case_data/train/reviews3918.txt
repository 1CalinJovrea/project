Style Over Substance

Style over substance is how I would describe The Man From U.N.C.L.E. as
that often used expression is the first thing that comes to my mind as
I dwell on the character of Napoleon Solo as played by Henry Cavill.
Though he is supposed to be the main character he never goes beyond a
superficial caricature of James Bond. On the other hand the characters
of Ilya and Gaby become more human as the movie goes on. Napoleon Solo
on the other hand remains glib. He could practically not be in the
movie at all as the story revolves around the romance of Ilya and Gaby
and I now struggle to remember what Napoleon Solo was doing in the
movie at all.The story of this film is generic with nothing special about, but while
I've seen worse I can't remember a film that bored me this much. The
Man From U.N.C.L.E. is in that awful middle where it's not good OR bad
enough to be entertaining. There are some humorous scenes but the movie
can't decide if it wants to be campy funny or serious but funny.Also it feels like a bad prequel or one of those first films of a
franchise, that exists only to get the team together, before the second
much better film. Hence there are no real stakes to the plot and the
origin story is not convincing.Overall my low score is because I can't name single thing about this
film that would serve as a recommendation for seeing it.
