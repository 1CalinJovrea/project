Ignore the bad reviews comparing this to the original

This film is far better than than 6.2 rating it has received which
seems mostly to come from those wanting to compare it to the
Argentinian original. I am rating this as a separate film and not
comparing it to the original. The acting is top notch and believable.
Ejiofor, Kidman and Roberts all do a great job. It's an interesting crime thriller with some twists and turns. It's
about a team of rising investigators, along with their supervisor,
whose worlds are suddenly torn apart during a homicide investigation
that hits close to home. It was completely watchable and entertaining.
I'm not saying this is a high brow, blow your socks of type of movie,
but it certainly deserves a far higher rating. I am certainly not saying that the original might not be much better. I
have it on my list to watch but in my opinion, if you like thrillers
and movies with some twists and turns and want to be entertained I
recommend giving it a chance.
