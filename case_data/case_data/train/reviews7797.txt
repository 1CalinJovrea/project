Underrated good movie

I am not even sure this is a movie to be considered in the horror
category, but I suppose it contains some pretty scary moments that
qualify it for this genre. Well, in my opinion, this movie is more than
a mere horror. Since people don't seem these days to appreciate movies
that promote, even delicately and in a non-intrusive, dogmatic way,
Christian faith, I believe that might be the reason for its low scores.
I don't apply some rigid criteria in order to judge a movie, but
whether a movie is able to convince me, make me travel and stay with me
some time after it's over. Also, whether its characters, ideas, story
touch me intimately is an important element that I take into account.
This one managed to make me travel, it has touched me and still stays
with me. It has fully convinced me. I haven't seen a single fake note
in the actors' play, the images are great and, beside a solid, touching
story, it provides the opportunity to visit nice places in rural and
urban Romania that are exquisite and astonishing in terms of
sightseeing. If you happen to have the opportunity to come across this
movie, give it a try: you'll see it's way worth your time and money.
