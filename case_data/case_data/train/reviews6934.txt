I enjoyed it

I watched this film last night and enjoyed it. I found it very
thrilling and intense and needed to know the end. A few scenes and
story lines didn't seem relevant to me, especially after watching it; I
thought to myself "why did they even include that? I don't see the
relevance of this to the story at all." In particular Det. Hood; he
began to try and get close to the case but that storyline didn't really
stick and fizzled out rather quickly. Looking back, I thought Amanda gave a very strong performance, the
strongest I've seen her do. I recommend watching for yourself before judging!
