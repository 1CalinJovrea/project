Not what you might expect

When you walk into a film with not one but two leading performances by
Tom Hardy, who's back catalogue brings nothing but pleasure (apart from
This Means War, but we'll let that slide), you cant help but feel
disappointed when you leave the screen completely unaffected by what
you've just watched, and that was certainly how I felt hen it came to
Legend.Labelled of course as a Kray twin biopic, it sadly offers no real
insight into their story and only grazes the top of their criminal
wrong doings. Instead it goes down the route of Reggie and Frances love
story, who is a character so under developed that the fragility her
brother so often reiterates, isn't actually explained what so ever and
prevents us from feeling anything towards her.As for Hardy he plays both characters exceptionally well, particularly
Ronnie who's insanity and subsequent spontaneity provides some comic
relief to it all, however his psychological state is something that
could of been explored more thoroughly instead of labelling him as just
nuts. The supporting cast, including Taron Egerton and Christopher
Eccleston, also do a fine job though Ecclestone's police officer almost
gets ignored completely.The violence is also few and far between but when it appears they
definitely don't hold back, providing entertaining scenes more
reminiscent of other crime dramas and what you would expect going in.
It shows us the real consequences of the lifestyle they live which does
its best to offset the fairly superficial painting of 60's London but
isn't enough and so the 'glossy' comments its been receiving are sadly
warranted.In the end this adds up to a rather dull final product that wastes so
much potential in this genuinely interesting real life crime
partnership.
