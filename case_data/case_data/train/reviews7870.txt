Best Movie I've Seen I Quite Awhile

I was a huge fan of the original Dark Shadows serial soap. Watched it
every day until it was preempted in Los Angeles by the Senate Watergate
Hearings. Tim Burton's version of Dark Shadows staring Johnny Depp and
Michelle Pfieffer is a great send-off to the series and other 70's
horror movies. Green puke: The Exorcist. Wearwolf: Wolfen. The boy
staring in the hall: Damien from The Omen. And the 1970's soundtrack
was second to none, starting with "Nights in White Satin." It was
tacky, funny, a little scary, and definitely another Burton hit. I
would go see it again in theaters, watch it every time it is on T.V.,
and go see the sequel too. This is one of few movies that I see out of
the over 40 new ones I see per year that I can truly say: You gotta see
this flick!
