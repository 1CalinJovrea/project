Painful to watch

So awful that the pain enduring it was visceral. I was actually
compelled to create an account and write this review (my very first for
anything, EVER) about how incredibly sub- standard and lifeless movie
was. It tries to hide its redundancy with a "hip, indie" vibe and
"snappy" dialogue but the reality is it's a script where the words that
come out of the characters mouths are recycled from every single
rom-com from the last 3 decades. And they just don't. stop. talking.
Just shutthehellupalready. The clich√©s are endless and the story drags
like a dead elephant being hauled by an aging horse. "I'll look if you look"?!?! Jesus, are you serious? Was that actually
written in the script by someone who got paid? There was a critic
review that said it best when mentioning that is also fails to address
proper boundaries in relationships and it absolutely does. The
characters are shallow, and one-dimensional. There is zero character
growth. It takes an easy and sleazy cop-out for an ending that is both
unoriginal and cheap and I can't believe I wasted 90 minted of my life
to it that I will never, ever, ever get back.
