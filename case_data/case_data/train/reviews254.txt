Very entertaining

I went into the movie for my birthday, being a young woman my twin and
I were initially attracted by the 2 leading male actors who were
captivating & handsome- but is that enough to make a movie watchable to
a certain degree? No. But this movie beat my expectations. I had
already read some online reviews by critics but to be honest I don't
know what movie they had went to see since the reviews were
overwhelmingly negative but it couldn't have been 'The Man From
U.N.C.L.E.'. It was a witty, and smart movie where each actor didn't
outshine one another. I personally do not trust critics since they tend
to like boring movies like 'The Lincoln Lawyer' that put me to sleep.
It's almost as if the movie was too witty for them & the quips and
snarky comments went over their daft heads and left a sour taste in
their mouths.I recommend this movie to anyone if you liked the Robert Downey Jr.
Sherlock movies then you will thoroughly enjoy this. My only wish is
that it was a little longer but that doesn't detract from the quality
of the movie.
