This year's most surprising blockbuster movie so far

With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly
intellectual storyline, "Edge of Tomorrow" shows a real deal of summer
blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after
unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks
familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined
perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited
're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping
it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting
lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise
and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall "Edge of
Tomorrow" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and
shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's
definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to
re-watch it over and over again.
