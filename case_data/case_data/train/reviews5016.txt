Over rated IMHO

Yes, the action was continuous, however, it was TOO repetitious..The shooting was so repetitious throughout the movie, It should have
been labeled 'John Wick the Non Stop Shooter'.. Sorry fans of this
movie, just too much of the same shooting over and over, and my
Goodness, with those multiple hard impact car hits and more, John Wick
legs have to be made of titanium..Sorry, too many unrealistic scenes for me.
