"And if you need to break things, then by God, you break them."

As someone who had read the book and really liked it, I found the movie
as compelling and it excels at additions that are not in the novel such
as the last scene which happened after the ending of the book. However,
they also removed some good parts from the book, but were offset by
visuals and score and the spot on performances of the characters
especially Lewis MacDougall (Conor) who nailed his role in the movie.
He sure knows how to cry. And that needs pointing out as a lot of kids
in movies are sometimes annoying and difficult to watch. Felicity Jones
(The Theory of Everything) and Sigourney Weaver (Aliens) who were both
Academy Award Best Actress nominees were as good as anyone would expect
them to be. And Liam Neeson's voice was the perfect choice for the
monster's. Haunting, cold, deep, and soothing. Also, the other thing I
found striking was how the book played out as a movie. Aside from a few
differences (the adds and minuses), almost everything else is as what
the book is. Impactful scenes as how they were narrated and readers
imagine them to be and dialogue and life lessons as how they were said
in the book were same as in the movie. If you have read and liked the
book, then watch this. If you have not, watch it still, as long as you
have a heart and know what you're getting into, chances are you'll like
this gem of a movie.
