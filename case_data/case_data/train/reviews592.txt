Passable film

Would You Rather takes an interesting look at a common children's game,
playing it for the delight of a rich man with far too much money. The
plot tells a story of a young girl whose younger brother lives with her
after her parents have passed on, leaving nothing but mounting debt.
Her brother is dying, her house has been sold, and ever job lead seems
to fall through. One day somebody offers to pay for everything and find
her brother a donor, at a price. This being said, the piece was decently acted, standouts being that of
Sasha Grey and the always delightful Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator). The
movie found ways to make you cringe without ever resorting to full on
sight gore, the worst parts were left heavily to the imagination. This
was a film that actually benefited from a lower budget, seeing that in
a heavy budget one might be forced to see the over usage of all the
stunts. The movie is certainly not without its faults, first and most
prominently is the lack of a decent score. The film never really
utilizes music to draw you in, which is especially noticeable at the
beginning and end of the film. The ending also felt so flat that it
could hardly produce sympathy from the audience, an attempt to cater to
the twist-necessitating crowd that has been delved since Saw's low
budget first film hit our eyes. Unfortunately, it is such a negative
that it makes one wonder if the whole damn first 30 minutes of the film
were worth anything. This also repeats itself with a worthless subplot
involving the doctor. The amount of filler placed within this movie
alone degrades it, and unfortunately tampers an otherwise great horror
gem to unnecessary viewing. For all the gripes, though, the film does its job when it finally gets
there. If I were to simply judge the 2nd act of this film it would get
an easy 9, however, that being said, I believe a 6 is not only fair but
accurate.
