A dark and daring detective drama that's never as straight-forward as it threatens to be.

Splattered with surprising amounts of grisly gore, layered with darkly
mature themes and brimming with otherwise brutal viscera, this
Victorian-era detective drama is a much more nuanced affair than first
advertised, playing out not as a simple whodunnit but rather as an
exploration of theatre vs reality and the pantomime roles all of the
key players (whom are all written and acted wonderfully) inevitably,
and perhaps unknowingly, play; while I had successfully figured out the
identity of the killer before the second act had even begun, it didn't
take anything away from my enjoyment as all of the pieces were on the
board from the beginning and each twist made perfect sense within the
narrative, there was no cheating and that alone is to be applauded, so
in the end this became a very enjoyable and gripping thriller which was
as fun to unravel as it was to passively watch, working well also as a
sort of meta-textual commentary - after all, when the audience wants
blood, it's blood they will get. 7/10
