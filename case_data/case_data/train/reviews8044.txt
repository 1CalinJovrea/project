Try to guess the solution of this mystery with success before the last 7 minutes and ...you are a genius!!!

At first i must say that in my opinion the makers of this wonderful
movie intended not to make just a story that their audience will sit
and enjoy the -well done- build tension , but they wanted to amaze
their audience-and in my case they did it! You 'll not believe to your
eyes at the last 7 minutes of this piece of art , of course you can try
guessing about 10 scenarios at the first 94 minutes the solution of
this mystery ...unsuccessfully . The actors were well selected and i
must admit that they did their jobs very professional and they helped
in the creation of this -almost- masterpiece ... I don't want to spoil
anything , i recommend everyone to see this movie and some of you(like
me for example) try not to stay with your mouth open at the end ...
