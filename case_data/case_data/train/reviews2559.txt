I walked out after an hour.

This is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Cruise acted
downright silly and the whole thing came off as a joke. I couldn't tell
what the genre was suppose to be. A drama, a comedy, adventure ??? It
reminded me of a little boy who loves airplanes so he made a movie just
so he could fly one or pretend to.In all seriousness, I thought it was
insulting.
