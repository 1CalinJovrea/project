Best Movie in Years

A real movie should entertain you -- with a great story line and a
message that touches you; with real acting that allows you to connect
with the characters to make you believe them -- make you love them or
hate them. It should include real cinematography, directing, editing
and music that are like the ingredients of a fine gourmet meal. Each
element has its own unique flavor, texture and color, but when put
together, the end result is a delectable, savory treat for the senses.This movie was just that. It is a beautiful love story about an
incredible couple played very convincingly by Corden and Roach.Corden did a spectacular acting job. Watching his facial expressions
and the look in his eyes during different key points of the plot was
thrilling, moving -- at times taking our breath away.If anyone doesn't absolutely love Alexandra Roach in this, there is no
explanation. We couldn't get enough of her on the screen. All the cast
members did a stellar job. We felt both the beautiful classical and catchy popular music blended
in with the already-spectacular film, and worked to make it even more
of a top-notch hit."One Chance" is an incredible movie based on a true story, and it was
wonderfully and skillfully put together. We can honestly say we
wouldn't have changed a thing. It didn't insult us; the filmmakers felt
no need to insert anything gratuitous for its own sake, as most
filmmakers do these days. It was realistically and tastefully done. It
made us laugh. It brought tears to our eyes. It made us angry. It made
us cheer inside. Bravo to all involved. It was indeed, a delicious
feast. We can't wait to experience it again.
