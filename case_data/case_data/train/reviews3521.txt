ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! Ultra violent. Trailer is 100 % misleading

I hated this movie. It's not just a truly horrible film. It's so
incredibly ultra violent. It's like the video game Grand Theft Auto
with zombies. Only worse! This was the most disgusting type of
violence, gratuitous and glorified. Truly over the top. The trailer for
this movie is 100 % misleading. It makes it look like a James Bond
movie. In reality it's more like a zombie movie. Horrible. Horrible.
Horrible. I wish I could un-buy this movie ticket. I wish I could
un-see this movie. It's truly the worst movie I've ever seen.
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! I gave this movie 1 Star but if I could I would
give it a minus 10. I feel sick to my stomach. Most definitely!
