Excellent Experience

Once again Disney, Bruckheimer and Depp make for an excellent movie
experience. When you watch a television show in black and white growing
up, you don't always know what to expect as an adult to see it as a
feature length film. I enjoyed this movie tremendously. The
storytelling and writing was excellent. The fact that Lone Ranger isn't
a "Disney character" meant that I had no other reference but the
television show to go on. This is one you have to pay attention to.
Don't get up in the middle to get a refill on your popcorn because you
may very well miss part of the story. Depp plays an older tormented
Tonto sharing his experiences meeting the Lone Ranger with a young boy
who attends the local carnival. And so the story begins. The element of
greed in American history and what it can influence people to do is
closely examined throughout the film. Therefore you get entertainment
and a lesson and it's cleverly written so that even young adults will
get it. No need to explain how dad and granddad use to watch it in
black and white back in the day. This is one of the better "reboots" of
the summer.
