Understanding what you value in life.

When you are compelled to write a review, and you realise this is your
first ever review of a film, you then understand the impact that a true
classic has.Sally Hawkins, Ethan Hawke, well done! If you want to sit down to a
less than fast, but utterly embracing film about life's journey, and
how individuals are valued, how they react to outside pressures and put
their whole world at risk, then this is the film for you .Simply.. Brilliant.
