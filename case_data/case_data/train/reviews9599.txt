An statement about the opposition between youth and elderliness...

Paolo Sorentino's Youth isn't one of those movies that aim to be
something else... It is a statement about life in the form of
incredibly realistic paintings. Above all things, the movie isn't about
the characters or their story, about the hotel or the beautiful setting
in Switzerland, it isn't about Mick's movie or Fred's concert. The
movie is simply a exposition of the opposition between elderliness and
"YOUTH".The photography is pretty much impeccable and as I said every frame
looks like a painting, I mean, ANY still of the movie would look
amazing in your living room wall. The hand of the director appears in
many of those shots that you can only say, "Oh my"... And it is pretty
much only production design and camera... The only two times you see
special effects, they kinda suck...About the acting... I don't think there's much to say... Lately, in the
non- blockbuster flicks, I watch Michael Caine and just see him doing
his thing... Pretty much as him playing himself... And he's good, even
very good, but there's not that spark that makes it a "brilliant
performance". I feel the same way about Harvey Keitel. Rachel Weisz was
good, but I don't think her character was so well constructed, Paul
Dano's on the other hand had the most interesting character of the
whole movie and was impressive as Jimmy Tree. Jane Fonda received a
nomination to the Golden Globe, but she was on screen for two scenes
only, so... I don't know...The movie was pretty much about the visual and left the story to be
read between the lines (or between the frames)...The story is pretty
good but the movie is not about it... Is just a way of expressing an
idea...At the end of the day... Paolo Sorentino will be indicated to every
award for directing, this season... The movie is a work of art, but not
to much as cinema indeed...
