Les Insufferables

I am quite frankly flabbergasted at the amount of positive reviews by
viewers and professional critics given to this movie. I do not remember
the last time that an audio-visual experience inflicted me with so much
pain, both mentally and physically. I think my theatre seat still has
indentations from me clutching the chair frantically throughout the
movie. I felt like the Clockwork Orange protagonist when he's tied down
to a chair and fed those nauseating stimuli (the main difference being
that he got to listen to some quality music in the process). It is
probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot of
hubris in my time.The review by MouthyMatthew summarises it the best. Over the top.
Chords and themes excruciatingly repetitive (How possibly wouldn't they
be? I mean, every line in a 159 minute movie has been "sung", down to
the most banal mundane statement you can imagine.). The movie
successfully drains your life energy as it progresses, since you have
to employ a supernatural effort to stick with the characters' lines. What would be a series of seemingly important storyline details ends up
receiving a very cursory treatment. For instance, Fantine's tragic life
trajectory. Furthermore, why on earth would they hire Hollywood
bigshots with a singing talent of a sexually frustrated walrus to play
these parts?? And the accents, oh, for the love of god. What the hell?
Overall impression: laughably sappy (yet unconvincing) and above all
insufferable.In my humble opinion, I think people should not see this movie if they
have not been exposed to the story earlier, by reading the book or
seeing a good musical production of it. I truly hate that this will be
my first impression of both the story and the characters, the one that
I will always be stuck with.
