Good and Properly Stupid

All these reviews are bashing the crap out of this movie. 'It's aimless
drivel and only for mindless idiots'. Well....Yeah. When I watch a
comedy like this that's what I hope for. Sometime you just want to turn
off your brain for an hour and a half and watch two familiar "actors"
play out ridiculous but easy enough to grasp scenarios while they
foolishly react. A post-viewing critique is pointless because the
directors have no intention of it being able to hold up on creative or
any kind of artistic merit. If you want to think about what you're
watching, or enjoy good story development, or simply see some great
acting then there are plenty of movies like Rashomon, Eraserhead, The
Man from Earth, Memories of Murder, Hitchcock films, Miyszaki films, or
something like Life Is Beautiful or It's A Wonderful Life(I forget
which is which, both great). And there's nothing wrong with a good
documentary know and then either. But something good and properly
stupid can be just the right thing when you need to take a respite. Not
all comedies are going to be a quipping Woody Allen flicks. It's really
about getting a good balance in your movies types and picking the right
one for your current mood. In other words this movie is just what it
intends to be and just what wanted it to be. Pure and easy
entertainment....Now I'm going to get my Audrey Hepburn on and watch My Fair Lady.
