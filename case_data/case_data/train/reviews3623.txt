What's with all the 1 Star votes?

Yea, so this movie wasn't exactly stellar, but I can't understand why
there are so many 1 star votes for this film. I just got around to
seeing this movie last night and it certainly wasn't the worst film
I've ever seen, but reading some of the reviews around here (and on the
critic sites) one would think this film is just a steaming pile of
poop.Well, it wasn't. The acting was decent, and I thought the lead was
reasonably good. There were more "jump scares" than I would've
expected, since the real horror of the games stems from atmosphere and
a feeling of isolation. The monsters and CGI were passable - not great
by certainly not bad by any means. The 3D was actually VERY good (maybe
the best I've seen), though there were a couple of times that the use
of the 3D was pretty clich√© (think knives COMING RIGHT FOR YOU!!!). The
only real gripe I had was with the scripting/story. I was impressed
that the plot stayed as true to the games as it did, while still
meshing well with the story from the first movie. I'm sure this was no
easy task, but the amount of story they crammed into this film was too
much considering the runtime of the movie. The exposition dialogue was
REALLY cheesy at times, but I can understand the need for such when
considering probably half of the target audience will have never played
the games. I just would've hired a better writer.TL;DR: Not as bad as the critics say, but certainly not the film I was
hoping this to be. Worth the price of admission for 3D, as it's really
well done.
