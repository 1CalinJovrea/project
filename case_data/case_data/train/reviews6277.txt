Delivers as an Action/Crime Thriller with one of Arnold's Best Performances To Date!

Don't listen to the critics! Go see this movie if you are an Arnold
fan! Unlike The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head, this is a straight
up dark gritty crime thriller with some great action sequences. While
most of the team was unlikable, all of the cast gave good performances
aside from Olivia Williams who's accent was pretty bad. The story was
good and had enough twist and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat
for the majority of the film. The action scenes were fantastic and the
violence was incredibly brutal and gory! This is one of the most
violent mainstream movies I've seen in a long time! Trust me when I say
this movie earned it's R rating! I loved how David Ayer managed to
combine the genres of action, crime drama, and western elements
together while keeping the tone ultra dark and gritty. Arnolds
performance here is also one of the best of his career in my opinion.
If I had any complaints it's that it is true the characters are very
unlikeable and while they are suppose to be, you do get tired of their
crudeness pretty fast.Very good movie and defiantly worth seeing on the big screen! Don't
listen to the critics! If you are a fan of action/crime movies you will
enjoy this!
