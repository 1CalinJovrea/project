Hypocritical much?

A gentleman said it best in one of the reviews below: "Personally ... I
see no need to belittle and offend those who are (Christians). While
projecting a supposedly tolerant and nuanced worldview ... the film is
actually quite intolerant and demeaning of conventional values."The acting is great, but this film is so hypocritical that it's
difficult to see how anyone can take its message seriously.Underneath all its pretentious language, this is a story of an
anti-Christian man who brainwashes his children to steal and be
intolerant of others. If you want a well-written indie coming of age story instead of this
propaganda-filled drivel, then watch The Way, Way Back.
