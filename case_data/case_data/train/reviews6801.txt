Brilliant film

Having watched the series of Britains Got Talent and remember seeing
Paul Potts do his audition I can still see the nervous man walk onto
stage amongst giggles and snickers from the audience. Once Paul started
singing the hairs on my arms shot straight up and a cold shiver of
amazement ran down my back at the magnificence and power of his voice.The film shows most of the life of Paul before going on the show and
the hardships he went through still believing in his love for opera and
wanting to sing so much.An absolutely brilliant film and well worth the watch as it has a great
support cast with lots of humour, and by the end of the film you'll
want to know more about the man from Wales.
