The 1971 version was way much more interesting and thrilling

Yesterday I watched the remake of The beguiled and I found it much less
impressive than the film made in 1971, but I couldn't remember so well
the older version because I watched it more or less 20 years ago so I
decided to watch it today to make a comparison. I find that the new
version was completely spoiled by PC fanaticism. I don't understand why
Sofia Coppola left out Hallie the slave, slavery was a key point on the
American Civil war and Hallie was an important character with lots of
interesting dialogues. She also left out the scenes of the crush
between the soldier and Amy, the 12 years old girl in order to not
shock people with paedophilia. The incestuous memories of Martha were
also left out. In summary, she impoverished the characters, their
relationships and their thoughts to avoid shocking PC people and
replaced the interesting varied characters by a group of pretty
blondes. The first version is much more thrilling and interesting. It's
a shame that now with much better make up and photography the core of
the film was spoiled.
