Van Gogh's art comes alive

This beautiful work has made history in the genre of Animation cinema -
a precious gift from devoted film-makers. The story is well known - a
matter of history. Vincent painted the portrait of Joseph Roulin,
Postmaster of Arles. The film tells us the story of Vincent's life and
last months before his death on 29 July, 1890 (aged 37) from a
self-inflicted gun-shot wound, via the device of the postmaster's son
being sent on a mission to deliver a letter from Vincent to his
brother, which has been returned. Vincent and his brother Theo were
very close, and Theo supported Vincent with regular gifts of money, and
painting canvas and tubes of paint. The postmaster Roulin knew and
loved Vincent, because these two loving brothers kept up a very
frequent correspondence. These letters have been published elsewhere
and make very moving reading. The son of Roulin goes to Paris, and to
Auvers-sur-Oise where Vincent had been in care after he had an
emotional breakdown, and talks to people who knew him. He is at first
unwilling, but becomes interested, then passionate to find out the
truth of the man whom he is now starting to fully appreciate. The
remarkable aspect of this film is that the entire story, 95 minutes of
it, is told in hand-painted oil paintings, done in the style of
Vincent's own work. Scenes begin with an image that Vincent himself
painted and if viewers are familiar with all his works, they will
recognize the people and the places. But now they are moving, they are
speaking, they are telling their stories, and their impressions of
Vincent, the man. Some were fond of him, some ridiculed him. There are
various points of view.Technically the film "Loving Vincent" is a wonder of animation. One
hundred artists in two countries, (Poland and Greece) working in
Vincent's own style contributed full colour paintings for "the present"
and black and white paintings for "the past" as the story is being told
by the people who knew Vincent.The film is made up of 853 'shots', and each one began with a first
frame of a full painting on canvas board. As the animation photography
was done in 12 frames per second, the first painting, would then be
photographed, then painted over, with each gradual change to certain
details or all of it, until the last frame of the shot. (This is in
place of the use of animation cels, which could not be applied in this
style of work.) At the end of the 'shot' the film-makers were left with
an oil-painting on canvas board, of the last frame. So at the end of
filming 853 paintings remained, and 200 are being auctioned off, and
many have already sold, (as can be seen from the films own website)
although at the time of writing the film has not yet premiered in the
USA. The size of the works was usually 67cm by 49cm. Bear in mind that
for one hour of film, 43,200 paintings were required, and you will
begin to see the extraordinary ambition of this project. Additionally
90 design paintings were created in the planning stages during the year
before shooting started. The purpose of these was to define the style
in which the artists would all re-create Vincent's style of painting
and make it move, live and breathe. 65,000 painted frames in oils were
made for the whole film. The story moves along briskly and is full of
wonderful characters (the people in Vincent's life). The dialogue of
the characters is full of expression, as are the faces, and the
characters have been created to really "live" for us. This was done by
casting well known and excellent actors in the main roles, and filming
them in live-action, then using those 'normal' cinematic images for a
basis of the key paintings for each 'shot'. As the film went on, I
recognized (from other films) certain of the painted faces of the real
actors, who are also giving voice to the painted characters on the
soundtrack. This type of animation has never been done before, and as
it took seven years to make the film, it might never be done again. The
ingenious planning of how to actually do it is brilliant and has been a
great success.Vincent, who suffered, from what we now call bi-polar disease, was an
intelligent, deeply sensitive man, who had a sad childhood in a strict
bourgeouis family, and was something of a misfit. He showed immense
natural art talent. This can be seen clearly and unmistakably by
looking at his early drawing. Later he used brush techniques that
imitated the 'signature marks' in his pen and ink works. He was
understood and saw visual texture.From Paris Vincent went to Provence, and lived in Arles. He begged his
friend Gaugin to come and join him. Vincent was over-joyed but after a
few months, things went wrong between them, and Vincent seemed to
become very distressed. When Gaugin departed, he was inconsolable.
After the famous incident of cutting of his own ear in his distress, he
went into care of Dr Gachet in Auvers, where he found a kindred spirit
in Gachet, who loved art, and recovered. There he did quite a few more
strong drawings and paintings. Vincent saw the world in a kind of
almost violent motion and most of his works, drawings and paintings
show this. It's as if the wind was visible to him in the air itself,
not only in the resulting movements of trees, and fields of grain, or
the moving sea.He never sold a painting in his own lifetime, but gave away some, and
sent many to his brother Theo who attempted to sell them in his Paris
art gallery. And yet now his works hold the record as being the most
expensive ever sold Â– which happened in modern times.
