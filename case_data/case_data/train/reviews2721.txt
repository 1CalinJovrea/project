A disappointment

I'm a fan of the first movie, even though I never played one of the
games. And I was disappointed by Silent Hill 3D, mainly due to the weak
plot, gratuitous violence, and bad dialog. Finally there is a pink
bunny that shows up seemingly every ten minutes throughout the movie,
for no reason at all. Why? The script writer generally added horror
elements that have no connection to the general plot, and those
elements are really clich√© to the extreme (an Indian cemetery? so
lame).The amounts of gore are much higher than the original movie, but the
lack of a mystery and no connection to the plot whatsoever leaves a
feeling of emptiness. The actors go through their lines in a very
unconvincing way, and the ending, well, is underwhelming to say the
least.In the end, Silent Hill 3D is a mediocre horror movie with violence
that would fit more in a Saw movie, and really undeserving of the
"Siling Hill" moniker. The only two good points that I can see (pun
intended) are 1. the 3D and the visual effect and 2. the scene with the
clown, quite chilling and well done.
