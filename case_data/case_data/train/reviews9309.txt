Nothing much is happening here, but it takes a long time to arrive

What is it with so many movies these days? Mumbling, diffuse dialog
that can barely be heard, never mind understood. Worst offender - Emily
Blunt. She breathes or snorts or exhales out her nonsensical, spare
lines. When combined with a horrendous character that has no back story
or dimensions whatsoever, her role is probably the most frustrating
aspect of this movie.Oh yes - there are long scenes of lines of shiny SUVs driving about. I
won't spoil it by telling you where they are going or why, but in
places this looked like a Chevy SUV commercial.Ultimately, some stuff happened, and it did show the horror and tragedy
of drug cartels. It also was a movie with a tissue-thin, predictable
plot, awful character development, inane dialog.This is yet another example of either padded ratings on the IMDb, or a
public that really hasn't seen very many truly great movies. This is
not truly great, or even good. It ended up being a few hours of my life
that would have been just fine NOT watching this movie.
