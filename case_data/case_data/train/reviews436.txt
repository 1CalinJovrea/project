Where did it go wrong?

I saw trailers for this in the cinema and considered going to see it. 

Thankfully I didn't waste Â£8 paying for a ticket. The premise for this 

seemed great- OK reminiscent of True Lies- but there seemed to be 

potential for comedy and drama. Potential that is sadly never realised.



Tom Hardy and Chris Pine are both charming leads (Pine needs to stop 

doing that chewing with his mouth open thing)Reese Witherspoon is possibly a little old for this kind of 

role- or at least this kind of role with Hardy and Pine- but she plays 

the role well enough.



The problem is that there is no plot to speak of, very little action 

and precious few laughs. The film is beautifully lit but the editing is 

horrible. It reminds the viewer of Quantum of Solace with its action 

sequences that could be memorable except the viewer can't see what is 

happening. It doesn't look a cheap film and the cast and premise could 

have made for something memorable but how could the end result be so 

unsatisfying. Vapid, bland, predictable and empty its like overdosing 

on cake icing because there is no cake underneath.



All the way through I couldn't help wonder how so much could have gone 

wrong until as the end credits rolled I saw it was directed by McG . 

Nothing more to be said.
