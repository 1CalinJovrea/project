Just awful

This is one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen. A torture. I
could barely stay still on my sit. I almost left the room 1 hour before
the end. But I stayed, hoping for something good to happen. But
something good never happened and the ending is even worst that my
worst expectations.The trailer was such a lie. I was expecting something dark, mysterious
and brainy. Something like The Dark Knight. Instead it's only military
crap, dinosaurs fight and worthless American patriotism. Makes me sick.
The movie dies with Bryan Cranston. The only problem is that his part
doesn't last half an hour.Godzilla wasn't an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon. It was just sh*t.
