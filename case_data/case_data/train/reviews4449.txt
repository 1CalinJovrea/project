Super unrealistic like every other Fast movie but still fun scenes.

This movie wasn't 2 hours and 40 minutes tho. Literally started at 7:30
and ended at 9:35. THATS ONLY 2 HOURS AND 5 MINUTES. Did anyone else
notice this? Decent movie though The story line was pretty obvious towards the end.
Like obviously it would end that way.
