really loved the CGI and the rihanna scene

took a chance and went in for the Thursday eve. premiere. really worth
the effort and the cost. CGI, i would say were on par with the best
like star wars. chemistry between the lead pair was well scripted.
story line was confusing at start but gets predictable soon, nothing
remarkable. but the screenplay and graphics keep you glued in...this is my first review. felt it deserved much better than a 7 but
falls short of a master piece.
