Upbeat positive story for the whole family.

I looked forward to this movie since seeing the trailers. The stunning
visual of Britt Roberts transported to an other worldly place, then
George Clooney asking "do you want to go?". Seriously? Heck yea! Maybe
I'm a hopeless romantic, but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise
of adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic. I was not
disappointed. Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me--adventure,
mystery, characters to love and root for, surprise story twists, laugh
out loud moments, and, the best magic of all, hope. Saw it twice,
second time with grand kids. I will be adding Tomorrowland to my Disney
collection.
