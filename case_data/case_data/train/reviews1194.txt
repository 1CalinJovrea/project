Too thin...

Saoirse Ronan plays Eilis, a young Irish girl exchanging her hometown
in Ireland for Brooklyn New York. After the long voyage she finds
employment and a husband. When her sister back in Ireland dies, she is
forced to go back home and has to deal with the lure of both homes.Brooklyn is a well made movie with superb acting. The story however is
surprisingly thin, predictable and too slow paced towards the end to
hold one's attention. There's simply not enough conflict and the
characters are not fleshed out to any satisfying degree, rendering them
little more than stereotypes. 6/10
