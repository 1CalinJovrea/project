The Judge

I was able to see this before the October release and although I read
some of the reviews that were released recently I started to have some
reservations however, I have disagreed with some critics in the past
and figured I'd make up my own mind about this film. Gratefully I did
not have to worry because it was time well spent. The performances were
excellent and it was witty as well and engaging. When looking at the
posters (without giving much away) I got the impression that this film
looks like something out of a John Grisham novel or an episode of Law
and Order, and while there is the trial going on, the movie is more of
a focus of this man's (Downey) relationship with his father (Duvall),
his family, his unresolved issues with his present life and the life he
left behind. Downey and Duvall don't disappoint as well as the ensemble
cast. If you're looking for a movie with heart, engaging performances
and not a "courtroom drama", this is definitely the right film.
