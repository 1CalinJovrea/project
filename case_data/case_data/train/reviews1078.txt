Unwatchable nonsense, as stupid as can be.

This elaborate mess of a movie couldn't be more boring and silly. The
premise is astoundingly dumb, far worse than the original and a non
existent plot you can see coming a mile away.The acting is wooden, the emotions fake and the direction dull.I would say this is for kids if not for the whole murder aspect but you
would have to be a child to like it. It comes off so hammy and unreal.
I think I was about to fall asleep about ten times.Please don't make a third one.This is what we can expect from a generation of writers who have no
sense of real drama, the Harry Potter and Twilight crowd who flock to
this garbage like a moth to a flame and come out raving about it.
