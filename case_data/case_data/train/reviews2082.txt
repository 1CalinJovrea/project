A masterpiece of overindulgence

In this Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Pi) written and directed film,
Jennifer Lawrence (Hunger Games, Silver Linings Playbook) and Javier
Bardem (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) star as Mother and Him, the
couple in question. First Man (Ed Harris: Gravity, A Beautiful Mind)
and then Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer: Stardust, Scarface), a thinly veiled
Adam and Eve, invade their space, then their sons Oldest Son (Domhnall
Gleeson: The Revenant, About Time) and Younger Brother (Brian Gleeson:
Snow White and the Huntsman, Assassin's Creed), followed by more and
more until they are overrun.Despite excellent acting from Lawrence and Pfieffer, Bardem sadly is
less convincing, the film is an exercise in overkill. From the burned
heart turning into a crystal (it would really turn to ash that would
float away) to the patch of blood shaped like a vagina that refuses to
go away, this is a film that wallows in self- indulgence and, despite
what some critics may say, lacks originality. Anyone that knows their
bible can see the Cain and Abel and the plagues etc. but the allegories
and imagery he has taken from the Bible are ruined by deliberate shock
tactics, robbing them of any true meaning leaving a film of no
substance where nothing really happens. If it was supposed to make me
think, I am afraid all it left me with was 'there's 121 minutes of my
life I won't get back.'
