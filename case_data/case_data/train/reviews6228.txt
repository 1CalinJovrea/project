the stench explodes

I was forced to watch this horror by people who should have known me
better. (The only movie I really wanted to watch this week was a Polish
film, Ida, which was playing nowhere).Godalmighty, what a stinker this was. Character development? None.
Dialogue? Laughable. Plot? Who knows.Against a ridiculous and badly done Washington process screen, I saw a
ton of cgi star trek crap, mostly consisting in four-frame quick-cut
scenes of people (?} kicking each other to no effect, a hell of a lot
of useless machine-gun fire to equal effect, and explosions filling the
screen followed by firy explosions filling self-same screen, giving way
to yet more kicking and firy explosions.It did occur to me that I was not the target audience for this total
crap, but then, as I have said, I was dragged to it.
