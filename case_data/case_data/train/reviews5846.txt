Fun Family film

Very fun and entertaining movie for the whole family, lots of laughs
and surprises. My 3 year old (also named Chloe) actually behaved
throughout the whole movie, of which she was also holding on to her
stuffed Chloe Doll that she picked up earlier that afternoon. After the
movie she commented that their were two Chloe's now. For a movie that
didn't have a lot of media attention I am glad I took the family to see
it and it was money well spent, fun for the whole family. My favorite
part would have to be the one that they show in the trailers, such as
when the poodle switches the music from classical to heavy metal. There
I think that is ten lines.
