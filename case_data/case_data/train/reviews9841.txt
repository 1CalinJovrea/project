I did not expect to like it, but I LOVED IT !!...

...to be honest, I generally do not like these type of movie, because
it's kinda stereotypical , but I FREAKING LOVED DINA!!!in the movie.
She made me laugh so bad...I had to be shushed. For me, DINA turned
over the profits for this movie. My work colleagues watched it first
and they would not stop gushing about it, so I went to the movies and I
am glad to say, I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.Many of the reviewers said it was trash, but each to their own. I love
a good comedy anytime and I also love men.lol
