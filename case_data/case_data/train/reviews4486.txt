I never want to date the scriptwriters

I really wanted to like this one Â— it has a solid cast, and the
promotional shots of Chris Evans in a variety of costumes (including a
WWII sailor, a chain-smoking film noir hero, and an astronaut) looked
intriguing. All the actors do sterling work, particularly Anthony
Mackie and Topher Grace (who are, respectively, the film's id and
superego). Unfortunately, not even these talented performers could make
up for the clumsy, sexist script. I was especially appalled by how Mr. Shafer and Mr. Vicknair treated
Aubrey Plaza's character. I mean, her consolation prize for not
becoming the narrator's girlfriend is an evening out with a guy who has
problems taking no for an answer. The fact that Evans's next romantic
picture, "Before We Go," was also written by this duo does not inspire
with me confidence.My recommendation? Skip this and watch "Some Like It Hot" for a
hilarious rom-com with male protagonists and three-dimensional female
characters who are treated with sympathy and respect.
