JLaw sold me more than just a mop

I heard that this movie received negative reviews and feedback, so I
was pleasantly surprised when I enJOYed the movie as much as I did.There is no denying that the grand appeal to the movie was Jennifer
Lawrence's compelling performance. The movie's story itself does not
seem like it has much to offer. A poor, overworked woman selling a
plastic mop does not sound that thrilling on paper. However, Lawrence
takes it up a level to a powerful story about a woman never giving up
and making her own opportunities happen against all odds. She takes you
on an emotional journey from start to finish. Lawrence has the
undeniable ability to make you ache along with her struggles. This can
be uncomfortable for the helpless movie-goer, which leads me to wonder
if this is the reason so many people had distaste for the film. No one
wants to be told that hard work and strong will are not enough to
succeed in this world, and, as a whole, "Joy" does just that. That being said, "Joy" still left me feeling inspired. As a young,
aspiration-filled woman myself, Lawrence's portrayal of Joy makes me
feel like I can take on the world (which is dream that current American
society consistently crushes on the daily). Lawrence's deadpan stares
as she struts in and out of offices along with her turning point
bathroom haircut, confirm that both Jennifer and Joy are a force to be
reckoned with."Joy" also possesses a subtle humor, although many reviews seem to deny
its existence. The purposefully over the top soap opera scenes obsessed
over by bed-bound Terry (played by Virginia Madsen) are just enough to
raise the otherwise dark tone. Lawrence and David O. Russell take you on an emotional journey with
"Joy." It may not be the uplifting movie you want this holiday season,
but I would argue it is the movie you need.
