I hated myself for watching this egotistic rubbish

Convinced by friends and a 7.6/10 rating I decided to watch the
impossible. I would have loved to have a camera on me to watch back my
facial expression change as the story unfolded. Eventually, when the
film ended I simply hated myself for glorifying such self-centered
middle-class rubbish. Basically, this is the story a rich white family
that lost their luggage and had to search for each other for a couple
of days to then fly away in a private jet arranged by their insurance
company. After the film I decided to document myself a little further,
hoping to be wrong about the whole thing and watched, amongst other
footage, an interview with the mother of the actual family. This only
confirmed what I suspected. The part of the interview that did it for
me is when the mother recalls the following: The film was shot during
dry season and yet it was raining a lot and the director was getting
restless because of this. The mother spoke to the director and told him
that it was OK, that he did not have to worry, all that rain were the
hundreds of thousand of tsunami victims crying. Since then I can't stop
hating myself for feeding this egotistic rubbish.
