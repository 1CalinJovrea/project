This one blew me away!

So I watched this movie, already kinda knowing the feel of the story
but wasn't too sure of the premise. But as time progressed, it became
crystal clear where this movie was going. This is the kinda of movie
that really have you think that people are people, are not people, but
live very dark lives, and that, nothing is as it seems. This one blew
me away. Even after realizing what this film was about, I was still
taken aback of how the story unfolded. This movie is definitely not for
the faint of heart. For mature audiences only. Overall I love it,
story, characters, even the ending took me by surprise. This is a
conversation movie, you know, the kind you talk about after leaving the
theater. I'll watch again, this time with friends.
