An immersive sci fi film soon to become a classic

This is about a deaf mute cleaning lady learning to communicate in
secret with gentle giant of a creature being experimented on and
tortured by a US government agency. She pities the way he is treated and that leads to displays of kindness
and affection that are returned by the monster.It is a lavish production with a few twists and turns along the way; it
is suitable for all. I think it will become a classic before long.A wonderful bonus was the way the two leading ladies played off of each
other.Truly a delightful film.At my screening there was a very memorable Q&A with the director that I
would like to share.There were some rather technical questions about Japanese influences in
his film (I will look for when I see it again). The amount of time and effort to make a real (man in a suit) rather
than CGI monster and that he financed it out of pocket for more than a
year before he got financing from Fox. A question about his colour pallet, and a comparison of his film with
Beauty in the Beast from a little girl in the audience who spoke in
Spanish.He used this question as a springboard to talk about a few topics that
were on his mind. You might know the director is from Mexico and now
lives in Toronto. He went on to say that many of the problems in the
United States are not the fault of Mexico. Also, that the reason that there is so much conflict in the United
States is because it is intentionally being done by the government. It is pulling people apart and making them fight each other, because,
it doesn't want people uniting together to go after the real problem,
the 1%.He said this to great applause. I hope that he has an opportunity to
speak to many people about his view of America.This film BTW was filmed in Toronto and premiered in the theatre that
was used for many of the scenes.
