Hours of American waste of time

Sorry to bring the joy down people, but I've been wasting my time for
the last 2 hours... When you watch the trailer, you do know what to
except of the basic story, the funny/weird romance, etc... what you
don't know is how slow & weak the action & dialogs take place. It is so
painful to see good actors led to play in such a disastrous direction.
Main characters seem to play a caricature of a mentally ill person like
"cuckoo's nest" basic redux, poor deniro seems to be stuck in the role
of the good old grumpy/lovely dad/step dad for the last decade now.
Actors are plainly hysterical, going in circle for the whole movie. I
couldn't relate, not one bit. When you go to tragi-comedy genre, you
expect to get emotionally involved, I was clinging to my seat after an
hour trying to figure out if i had to laugh cry or just get out of the
room... The staging & editing is extremely weird but not in the good
sense. I wont mention about the American sport community thing, though
it made them look all the more pathetic (ok i just mentioned it).
Terrible. The last movie -and they are few -that gave me that feeling
of total emptiness was "How Do You Know", boy i had hoped it would
never happen again... well it is !!!
