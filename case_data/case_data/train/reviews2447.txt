Brainbleeding intesifies

Of course this movie is made for a very young female audience so I have
problems to identify myself with the targeted audience. The good point
about the movie is, that the heroine is not complelty depending on her
male counterpart, so its none of the
"girls-are-mentaly-and-physically-too-weak-to-exist-without-man"
movies, but thats about it. If you want to watch something about strong
female characters try the legend of Korra. The rest of this movie is
terrible, especially the huge amount of brain bleeding inducing logic
errors.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! For Soldiers knife throwing, jumping from trains and
excessive hand-to-hand combat are the most important skills. As well as
being complelty fearless...people throw knifes at you and you aren't
allowed to be afraid? Yes, thats the stuff marines are made of. Being a
soldier has nothing to do with endurence, guns, tactics and unimportant
stuff like that real life soldiers train.Being "divergent" not fitting into a faction is something rare...at
least thats what the characters say...funny how the rarest thing turns
out to be a majority.The training officer sits at the same table as the rookies, but the
rookies aren't allowed to talk to him? Yeah, makes sense.A rookies says something stupid to a teacher...and they put in into the
world wide newspaper...yeah, nothing else interesting happening.Oh, I nearly forgot, the actual most important thing for a solider is
house climbing. Know a soldier who hasn't climbed the empire state
building? He's a noob.These are just some of the terrible brain bleeding inducing logic
errors in this movie. If you are a 8 year old girl you might be able to
accept them, but for everybody else this movie isn't watchable.
