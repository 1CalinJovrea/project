You too, Ridley?

SUCKED BIG TIME! The story was all over the place, most of the
characters were completely unnecessary and underdeveloped, and there
were no creatures to talk about really. I wasn't even tensed up for a
second, let alone being scared.Can you imagine a biologist guy, signed up for a mission to explore a
different race, shitting his pants and literally leaving the scene at
the first sight of an alien body that's been dead for 2000 years? Well,
Ridley Scott could. However, the same guy goes ape schit over a real,
moving alien cobra-thing and wants to cuddle her! Perfectly consistent
character writing! And what the hell was that android guy trying to do
with his plots and schemes? What was your plan? Who actually did you
serve? And Shaw who did nothing to fill in Ripley's shoes... She
attacks the crew, performs a surgery -I'm not even gonna touch that
one- that probably overthrows a plan in motion, comes out covered in
blood and no one even says "Hey! What the heck?" and they go on another
expedition together? And what was that space jockey's problem!? Relax,
dude!! I mean you have to be a really mean bastard, consumed with rage
to come out of a crashed ship and go after a woman you missed the
chance to beat up before.The final suicide mission could easily be completed with 1 guy.I will never understand what Shaw hoped to achieve by going after "our
creators" to "find the answers". What answer are you gonna find with a
beheaded android by your side from a race that clearly thrives on rage
and hostility? And finally, this was the most UNNECESSARY use of Guy
Pearce ever in a movie.Making fun of a Ridley Scott movie... Wow, I thought THAT would never
happen.
