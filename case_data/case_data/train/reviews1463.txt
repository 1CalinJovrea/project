An Unforgettable Experience Brought By Muschietti, Del Toro and Chastain ! !

First of all, my fellow moviegoers and horror-fans, i must begin by
saying, that, even in a decade's time, i doubt that my instant love for
this film would have changed in any way.Was it because of the wonderful work of the entire cast and crew on the
film that struck me?Or even that rare feeling you get, when a film has
been carefully nurtured with love and selflessness and raised up to be
one of the best in the genre to come out for a good long while?Or is it
the wonderful Jessica Chastain with a little mix of Nikolaj
Coaster-Waldau's assuring performance as Lucas, and of course, Isabelle
Nélisse's and Megan Charpentier haunting performances of Lilly and
Victoria.And once we are rolling and underway, Muschietti and Del Toro never
really let us go.Their ideas, their intelligence and vision, along with
some brilliant acting, made this film a special cinematic experience.Suspense and horror wise the filmmakers have made a wise choice not to
go with blood, gore and other clichés nowadays horrors are filled to
the brim with.Another great choice is the masterful cast they have
chosen-Chastain, Waldau the whole cast.And since i'm very fond of
Chastain, i will get on the subject thoroughly in a moment.The film was
shot in incredible style not revealing in the opening scenes and ,step
by step, showing more and more, both story and emotional wise.Not only
that, but with the titular character of Mama, we find more about her,
we see more of her, and in the end, we experience what means being her,
being all of them.This storytelling arc i found very suspenseful and
the great character development in Annabel and Victoria, the bigger
sister, lead up to the climax, which is very heavy on emotions, pain
and a triumph of the director's extraordinary vision.Which, in my humble opinion, leads to the strongest quality, that this
film has in it's possession:the cast!!Game of Thrones's Waldau does a
really solid job portraying Lucas, the uncle, who never gave up on his
nieces and kept searching, when nobody else did, he never let go.Isabelle Nélisse and Megan Charpentier are great playing the two wild,
insecure, girls and manage to find the perfect line between this world
and the civilization they are so reluctantly brought into by their
uncle and his girlfriend.Although the word "girlfriend" is very
misleading in this situation, it does no justice to the relationship
between Chastain's Annabel and Waldau's Lucas at all.Throughout the
whole movie we have seen real love and real human feeling, not just a
bunch of teens sleeping together and fooling around which basically
happens in every horror movie.But here, people are full-blooded, real,
emotional, humane.So, they clearly love each other, after all Annabel
stayed with him in order to help him raise his nieces, they moved in a
new house together, she left her life of the tattooed, beer-drinking,
guitar-playing, Rooney Mara-resembling woman, that was not yet ready to
be a mother.At the end, Annabel has become so fond of the girls, that
she takes the role of a real mother, caring, protecting and loving
them, when Lucas in not around.She is risking her own life for them and
is gifted with the love of the bigger sister, Victoria, in return,
which ultimately proves to be at the center of the main conflict-the
unconditional love of two mothers towards the two sisters, and the
choice that they have to make.A real mother, or Mama-a hurt, but
jealous ghost, with a history of her own, a mother, who is able to take
a life in order to preserve it, a mother, who defended the two children
for years in the wild, as if they were her own, but not a real,
full-blooded mother at all...There is no right choice here, which means
things are ultimately going to end bad in one way or another...So, for those who were able to bear with me for so long, i'm going to
wrap it all in a nutshell:this film is an experience, that needs to be
seen, an experience, resembling a beautiful, but also painful story
with no winners and real, human emotions.It reminds me of Nicole
Kidman's The Others in a way...And being introduced to Jessica
Chastain's warm and full-blooded portrayal of an otherwise clichéd
character, that she shows has been played the wrong way all those
years, is the most important experience for me.She was brilliant, and
as i have grown to love Chastain for her roles in the past two years,
for her devotion and skillfulness, she is the best choice for this
role.If horror movies had more overall quality and were higher-regarded
as movies not only made for the purpose of cheap jumps, but for
enjoying a piece of film making of real cinematic value, in a world
where scripts are better, Jessica Chastain could even get nominated for
an Oscar among other high-profile awards for her mesmerizing and
beautiful, yet humane portrayal of a forced-by-the-circumstances
mother, ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves.So, with the 1000-word limit upon me, for one of the best films in the
genre for the last years and a wonderful film as a whole, this piece of
devoted filmmaking and acting, will keep you mesmerized until the very
end and you'll be discussing it even afterward.It definitely left an
impression on me, and i can't wait to see the beautiful Chastain again,
as soon as possible, as she has proved to be equally impressive and
devoted in every genre she has worked in and every role she has
taken.The one-two, that's shaping up at the U.S. box-office this
weekend for her, proves she covers more cinematic ground than most, and
that the future is bright in her presence!I wish her the Lead Actress
Oscar this year, as she absolutely deserves it for her work on Zero
Dark Thirty!My rate:a deserved 10/10 !!!
