Implausible..... but I somehow got hooked

Let me start by stating this isn't the greatest movie ever made -
You've only got to look at some of the other reviews to see that.
However...I actually really enjoyed it (maybe because I'm the father of a 10 year
old girl, and so could perhaps relate easier, IDK??). Anyway, it really
got me hooked from the beginning. Sorry all you haters but it deserves
better than a 5/10 score.Many people moan about the confusing timeline. I honestly can't say I
struggled with the story going back and forth. The actors appearances
altered accordingly with age, hairstyles, etc... the story actually
seemed fairly straight forward to follow without any difficulty. I can
easily get muddled up in an awkward film if I lose interest - maybe
that's what happened to all the negative critics on here??? Overall, an
enjoyable movie (despite the disturbing story) that I'll undoubtedly
recommend to family and friends.
