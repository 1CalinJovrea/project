Cheesy forced humor, save your money

AS soon as I got out of the movie, I came home to give this movie a
horrible review. It was so cheesy, it was almost unwatchable. The lines
are very corny, the acting is horrible...I love Owen Wilson AND Vince
Vaughn, but this was just painful to watch. The plot line was
ridiculously predictable. There was hardly any "conflict" or adversity.
Poorly produced... a lot of big names in the movie makes it even worse.
Will Ferrell's character was embarrassingly bad. He was not funny, and
overall he was really unnecessary. This movie was such a waste of time.
Basically a two hour long advert for google. Don't waste your money.
Rent Wedding Crashers instead
