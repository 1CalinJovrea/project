Don't pay attention to the bad reviews.

Switch of for 90 mins. Enjoy a movie for what it is. Don't compare to
others, criticise, judge or hold a candle. Just watch the movie with no
bias and expectations and ask yourself at the end did I like it?I did that and I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh. Will and Amy
were great as the quirky couple who will do anything to make sure their
daughter gets a good start in life. The supporting cast were funny and
believable (In that zany movie dimension) and I enjoyed the other
characters as much as the main cast."Will it win an Oscar?" Hell no... "Will it go down in history?" I
doubt it.... "Is it the funniest film ever?" No way.... But give it a
try. It's ten thousand times better than most of the garbage that's
been released this year.
