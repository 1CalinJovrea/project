Came in the cinema with little expectations, but left with tears

This movie is amazing. It is cheesy, romantic and touching all in one.
I first expected only a story being the two leads in the movie poster
(i did not see the trailer), and thus I expected it to literally be a
long road trip or something. However, I was wrong. It is a story of how
two couple's story got woven together somehow, after one faithful
night. It touches on some things rare in today's world, such as the old
fashioned chivalry in Eastwood's character, which I loved. The contrast
yet similarity between the two couple's story is amazing, as the young
couple learns of what it means to love, and of sacrifice in love. And
in the somewhat similar narrative way I have come to love in the
notebook. Stories read off letters and from memory and pictures, and
how the one picture back then was so precious, without the technology
we have today. Also, the lack of technology back then meant that the
old couple had to suffer certain ordeals back then which wouldn't seem
like a big deal now.Also, I found the ending beautiful, as the old man did something I
didn't expect. Just see for yourself. While Nicholas Sparks stories
have a tendency of being predictable, the ending was really sweet to
me. All in all, this is a long ride indeed, and I can't recommend it
enough. Go for it. It is by far, IMO, the best movie after The Notebook
among Nicholas sparks adaptations.
