Not worth the Journey

I just thought that this attempted to be like "Oceans" but was no where
near clever enough, I honestly got bored thought the plot was thin, and
whilst the leads were both beautiful they had nothing to work with in
terms of plot or script. The twist isn't really a twist more of a
'tw..' as it is so painfully obvious...... yea the clothing and
locations are good but this film needed to deliver a bit more. I think
that the supporting actors were amusing (ish) but there were very few
actual lol's... I think most people stood up at the end of the movie
and were like is that it???Like both actors, but wouldn't bother with this one.
