Right up there with the very best gangster movies.

A couple of years a go it was Scandinavian TV that was all the rage and
now , thanks to the brilliant Gomorrah it seems to be Italian language
mafia based TV that is the in thing. Suburra is in the same mould as
Gomorrah although the protagonists are a little higher up the food
chain . This is the story a politician who gets caught up with the
local mafia when he asks someone to help him sort a problem that
involves a dead girl in his hotel room. Firstly let me say this film
looks stunning. The cinematography is breathtaking at times and it's
complimented by a fantastic soundtrack from M83. There are some good
performances especially from Pierfrancesco Favino (Malgradi ) and
Alessandro Borghi (number 8) who I think we might be seeing more of in
the future. Suburra is a film that will stay in the memory for a very
long time. Highly Recommended.
