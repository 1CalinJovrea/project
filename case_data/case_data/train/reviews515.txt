Very Average.

While the acting was good and the general premise promising, I just
felt they struggled to give it that old-school feel constantly pumping
period music and resorting to every possible clich√© from that era. Frankly, it was an assault on the senses. Some of the fight scenes were
brilliant. But the plot is a bit contrived.
