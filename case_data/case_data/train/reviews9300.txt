Faaantastic!

Quick, honest review here - saw the film last night, it premieres
tomorrow. Here's what I think:Real Fans of the Furious franchise will absolutely love it, it
delivers! If you're a fan, you know exactly what to do going into this
feature, just sit back and enjoy the ride. It's a good one, enjoy! This
movie is so very clearly made for the fans.If you're not a furious fan, maybe haven't seen the ones before, don't
watch this movie, go watch the other ones first and then see this
movie, you'll have a more enjoyable time. If you don't like the
previous films, you won't like this one.P.S. - If you don't like this film because of the plot holes or bad
acting or cheesy moments, then you are watching it wrong! :-)Have fun!
