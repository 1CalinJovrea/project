A solid 7 leaning 8 for a "realistic" action film.

This is my first review. I have finally gotten tired of fake reviewers
and haters rating films poorly because they don't like the actor and
likely never saw the film. Reviewers are offended because he was
working outside without a shirt on or because his shirt sleeves were
short? Give me a break. I've seen plenty of 1 and 2 star movies, but,
this was not one of them.What I want to know from a review is whether or not a movie is worth
watching. I do like action films and I don't dislike Sean Penn. This
review comes from that angle.You're not going to find cars jumping between sky scrapers, people
falling 100s of feet and walking away or phony cliffhangers in this
film. What you will find is an attempt to show necessary action in a
mostly realistic way.Sean Penn's role is more like Rambo than Superman. The action was
original, clever and well executed. The dialogue was realistic and the
acting was believable.The only reason I didn't give it an 8 or 9 is because I felt it tried
to do too much in too little time. That having been said making the
movie longer wouldn't have worked because it would have taken 5 hours
to do it right. The first 20 minutes could have been its own 2 hour
film.That having been said it all made sense. I didn't leave the theater
wondering why or how anything happened. I would have cut several of the
longer scenes short in order to tell more of the back story.If you are looking for something fun to do on a Saturday afternoon you
won't go wrong by seeing this film.
