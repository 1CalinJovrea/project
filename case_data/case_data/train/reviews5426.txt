Brainwashing left-wing propaganda

This movie has an agenda. The left-wings in Hollywood is branding
others with terms such as "right-wing sociopath", etc. This movie is
comparing the right with "white power" to create assumptions. It also
makes the president look like some picture perfect guy that is against
war. B.Obama against war, absolutely not. "I know you're into peace and
everything." (spoken to the president). Is that why he drone bombs and
continues with the corrupt control freak wars?It also makes the parents of military personnel look like the enemy.
Shameful. Many people in the military have had parents, grandparents,
and more in the military before them.This movie is a joke all the way. Anyone who gets through this movie
and doesn't see the messages all throughout is most definitely a
"sheeple" (another term used in the movie by the terrorists of course)
blindly following without knowing what is going on in this country.
Wake up America, this is more brainwashing. Freedom is the best thing.
This government lies constantly. The president lies constantly. How
many times have we seen this administration doing the exact opposite of
what they claimed they would do? Quit being fooled America.
