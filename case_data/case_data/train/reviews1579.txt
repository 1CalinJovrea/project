A Crazy Parable

First I want to say that this is one of the best (and entertaining as
hell!) social commentary films I've seen since Terry Gilliam's Brazil
and Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. Yes there are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense if looked
at from the perspective of our "reality." But this film does NOT aim to be "realistic." In fact, I'd say the goal
of the director is to make it as "surrealistic" as possible. And I applaud him to be so successful in that: in many moments during
the film, I felt I was experiencing a fevered dream of a fried fish. --
That's how insane this film is. It takes great genius to present something as insane as the plot of
Snowpiercer.This film will be remembered, analyzed and revered for a long, long
time. The icing on the cake is that the social commentary content is actually
intriguing. The film is decent enough to leave enough ambiguity so that
the audiences can make their own conclusions. 9 out of 10.
