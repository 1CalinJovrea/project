Cyber-punk-ish masterpiece

I will not babble and will write just enough to get through IMDb
system. This movie starts as a boring "i've seen few like this" type of
a movie. But after few minutes, if in right mood, you'll start thinking
a bit and than... it grabs you and doesn't let you go till the very
end. Quite nice ending, to add. Loved it! It is low-budget gem. A masterpiece. Main actor starts off as
dull, but you get to like the guy and soon you find out this man can
actually give even more in terms of acting. Movie has amazing "near future" atmosphere, darkish-futurism. Not many characters, but when you write script like this, you don't
need more than 3-5 characters!Awesome, well done and medium-speed clap to creators of this movie. I
enjoyed every minute of it... Every minute after first 10 to be exact. Must see.
