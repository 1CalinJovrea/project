A welcome return to Form for Tom Cruise !!!

I have to Confess i am not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but when i got a
chance to go to an Advanced Press Screening of his latest movie with my
Brother, who works in the press i reluctantly gave it a shot. I surely
had a pleasant surprise in store, with the movie being a blast from
start to finish and had a ton of retro 80's music. After the disaster
that's THE MUMMY, Tom Cruise returns to form with some of his best work
in the last 10 years outside the Mission Impossible franchise. Its a
story based on the real life events of Barry Seal, a pilot who plays a
crucial role in the Iran-Contra Affair, here we see Tom Cruise return
to familiar territory where he makes us fall in love with a Semi-good
guy who does bad things but we are not quite sure and root for him,
because Tom Cruise makes us fall in love with him with his 1000 Watt
Smile. The supporting cast was serviceable but make no mistake this is
a Tom Cruise vehicle purely designed to show everyone he still has it
!!!
