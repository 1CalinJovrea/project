Very poor script don't waste time or money

I had waited a long time for this movie. I loved Peg in several movies
from Hot Fuzz to Shaun of the dead. This had the Monty Python cast and
Peg so it had to be great right? Nope WRONG. From poking at all the
politically correct things being white to American you would have
thought that Kyan West wrote the script. Couple this with the fact that
its just not funny nor entertaining I found myself fast forwarding
through parts to get to the end. It was a classic we have great talent
so it just has to be good no matter what we do. Its like saying the
best chef in the world can make a dog crap pie and it will be great.
NOPE its not. If you have time to kill and I mean to absolutely waste
and you get a free copy of the DVD from a friend then go ahead but
don't waste a dime on it, Wait even then don't waste your time. If your
a die hard peg fan that could watch him eat monkey brains and think its
good cinema then this may be OK for you. But if you expect the minimum
of good writing then this is a skip at all costs.
