The Sun Gym Gang

You know you have made it when others try to imitate your directing
style, cough Battleship cough.Michael Bay's Pain and Gain is the director trying to be different with
less of the bombastic overtones of his action flicks and more entering
a blackly comic Scorsese territory with multiple narrations.The film is about three muscle heads who kidnap a rich guy and try to
get him to sign everything over to them and then ineptly finish him
off. Its based on a true story with Mark Wahlberg playing the muscular,
management guru spouting personal trainer who fails to realise he is
dumb as hell. Joining him is flaccid Anthony Mackie and born again
Christian ex-con Dwayne Johnson. All contenders to be the next Three
Stooges.The heist very much goes off plan, luckily for them the police are not
interested as their victim was so unlikeable until that is when a
private detective (Ed Harris) enters the frame who brings a little
sanity to the proceedings.Bay captures the film in a multiple viewpoint, he has his classic
kinetic action style but mixes black comedy with action and trusts his
actors to deliver. Wahlberg gives one of his better performances but is
outmatched by Dwayne Johnson who once again shows that he is packing
more than muscles and a wrestling persona. Just as he did in the film
'Be Cool' Johnson goes out to the edge playing an ex con wanting to go
straight, finds God but goes down a slippery path that leads to drug
addiction and trouble yet still makes his character likable and
believable.Its an adult film with beautiful babes, beautiful big babes even,
torture in a back of sex toy warehouse and cutting of body parts by
chainsaw. This is certainly not aiming for the Transformers crowd. The
film is a little overlong and could had been tighter, the multiple
narration can be confusing and maybe could had been more dark and
comic.
