TRULY FUNNY....Comedy Gold...B++++

Just been to see this film and could never stop laughing. Sacha Baron
Cohen is a true comedic talent...an excellent writer as the jokes in it
are genius. The film is short but packed full of laughter. Perhaps I'm
an easy laugher, but what can I say, I liked it!!! A LOT!!! As well as
the comedy being brilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also.
From watching the trailer, and then watching the film, it was actually
a completely different story to how I thought it was going to be. I
wasn't very excited to see the film after the trailers, but decided to
venture in... I enjoyed it much more than I expected and will likely
see it again! It isn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort
of humor then you need to go and watch it now!
