Wow!

Finally got around to watching this gem over the weekend. Absolutely
stunning, both visually and with the story and characters.I'm impressed! Foreign flicks are killing it right now. I'm surprised
this didn't win an Oscar to be honest. It was really well done -
superb, really! - and stuck to history very well (well, from the little
I've researched it online!).I highly, highly recommend watching this movie. It was like being
transported into a completely different world. It's been a long time
since I've watched a movie, and what was 2 hours felt like 15 minutes.Definitely worth your time!
