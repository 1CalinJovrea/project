I was with the Navy. Not the Navajo.

As an Avid Jurassic Park fan except for JP3. This film hit me a well
thought after movie. There were some draw backs that you read in the
comments pages like how could Claire out run a T-Rex in hill and
another which i do agree with is that the kids should have been eaten
because they were to whiny. It hard to replace performances from the
original cast who played lex and tim. As for the CG and Graphics I'm
always blown away on how it keeps changing and the dinosaurs always
look better. as well as adding a hybrid well, let me tell great choice
of adding a raptor rex mix. As the film progressed I was hoping for
more dinos in the scene such a the mosasaurus. Other than that I give
this film a big thumbs up.
