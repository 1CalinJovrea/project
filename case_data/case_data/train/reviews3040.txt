A cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming adventure you will definitely enjoy!

At first I had pretty low expectations for this film because of its
first teaser, but then the first full length trailer made me look
forward to it, and now that I've seen it, I have to say, you will enjoy
this once you see it. It's very vibrant and filled with colour, which
makes for a bright and exciting time, the trolls themselves are all
really cute and colorful, and they are usually really funny in a
situation and they are always positive and full of hope. It has a very
well thought storyline, even if it does sound a bit generic at first,
but it feels new and so fresh and original when you see it. And there
is a lot of signing and dancing, and a lot of musical cues, and the
songs really do get to you, as they are very catchy. And at times this
film is very heartwarming, and a bit emotional at places, but that's
sort of what you'd expect from a film like this. So overall, definitely
see this one, as it is a cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming
adventure that the whole family will enjoy!
