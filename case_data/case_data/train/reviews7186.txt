Loved this low budget horror movie with suspense

So rare to see a low budget horror movie this successful. If you like
horror that makes you think you should enjoy this. It is suspenseful
from the outset and has lots of twists and turns to keep you jumping. I
like the way they created a real world in that crazy house with all the
dynamics of family and servants. Extremely creepy.The girl was a good little actress. Combs was suitably crazy as the
administrator of the game. He definitely made the movie. I was
surprised with some of the actors they got to fill out the game. I
think I recognized each one, including the ex porn star and the drunk
John Heard.
