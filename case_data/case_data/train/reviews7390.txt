Heavy, but real.

Don't go into this expecting a comedy, even though that is one of the
tags on the IMDb page. Though it does have elements of dark comedy.This is not a lighthearted movie, to say the least; yet I would
describe it as powerful and very "real." It is the complete opposite of
a fairy tale and the complete opposite of romantic comedies - and that
is very refreshing. It will cause you to think long and hard about your
own relationships. You will continue to think about the movie long
after you have left the theater.If you like thought provoking movies that have very authentic
characters and story lines, then I recommend this movie for you. The
movie isn't all dark, it does have it's lighthearted moments and I felt
it did a great job building the emotion as the movie went on.
