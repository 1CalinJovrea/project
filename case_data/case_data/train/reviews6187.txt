Reviewing this because its better than its rating

Compared to 70% of the garbage in theaters, this movie is both quite
deep and fun to watch.It is not a huge budget movie, it doesn't have a perfect script or
story overall, but the acting was great and the overall fantasy feel to
it mixed in with samurai lore was really enjoyable.I expected this movie to be less than average due to overall scores.
Don't pay attention to them. I'll be purchasing the bluray after seeing
it just now.It has a slower beginning but it helps give characters depth. The
ending is also quite spectacular because you're involved with the ronin
every step of the way. The last 1/3rd of the film is as usual where the
major battles happen, but act two does not disappoint.In my books this is a 7.5/10, gave it an 8 as its under rated on here.
Approach it as a really good B movie and you'll love it. If you expect
an Oscar nominations and a $200 mil budget for this, you should
probably not be reviewing these sorts of films.
