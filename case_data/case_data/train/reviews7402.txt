Are you ready for your first dare?

Vee (Emma Roberts) and Sydney (Emily Meade) are besties. Sydney plays
an on-line game called "Nerve." It is like truth or dare except there
is no truth. You pay to watch and you get payed to play, taking the
dares of the watchers. Sydney coaxes Vee into playing and Vee quickly
becomes more popular than Sydney as competition across NYC escalates to
the point of being criminal.The characters were very good and the film has a message about the
responsibility that the viewer has, although that didn't play into the
film until the very end. The production is aimed at people half my age.
It is much better than a bunch of the cyber BS that is out there. So if
you have grown weary of watching big foot found footage films and the
cinnamon challenge on U-Tube, try this out.Guide: No F-words that I recall. No sex. Emily Meade shows her butt on
a dare.
