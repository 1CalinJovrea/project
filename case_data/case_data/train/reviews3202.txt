Capitalist adventure movie

Essentially, 'Gold' is an old fashioned adventure movie. A hostile
environment, changing fortunes, shifting alliances, unexpected
adversaries, a seemingly betrayed friendship: it's all there. But the
setting is out of the ordinary: it's the financial world with millions
of dollars pumped into promising mining stocks. But those millions can
just as quickly be withdrawn when the prospects change.The adventurer in the midst of it all is Kenny Wells, son of a Nevada
gold prospector and heir to an almost bankrupt mining company. In an
all-or-nothing attempt, he travels to Indonesia for a meeting with a
legendary drilling expert. The next step is to find the money required
for the drilling. What follows, is a roller-coaster ride of successes
and setbacks.Matthew McConaughey is amazing as Kenny Wells, a raving maniac with a
fearless can-do mentality and a complete lack of respect for Wall
Street hotshots or mining moguls. This is one of his best roles ever,
and it's worth an Oscar. You can see the doubt in the eyes of everyone
he meets: is this a madman who doesn't know what he's up to, or a
go-getter who doesn't give up until he reaches his goal? Wells is both,
and McConaughey makes his complex character completely believable.There are some extra layers in the story underlining this complexity:
the relationship with his wife Kay, and the friendship with his
business partner Mike Acosta. The latter is responsible for the
spectacular ending of the story, with a really nice surprise in the
last seconds.The whole story is based on the Bre-X scandal, which hit the worldwide
headlines in the nineties. Some details are changed, but on the whole
the story follows the real events pretty accurate. The scandal was a
prime example of excessive capitalist greed, and the film is a nice
reminder of it.
