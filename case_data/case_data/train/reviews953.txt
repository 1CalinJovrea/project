A wonderful breakdown of modern horror...

"Insidious Â– Chapter 2" takes place right after the events of the first
movie. In order to bring the audience up to speed, it opens up with 15
minutes of purposely stilted exposition. But not only those first
minutes are a true gem of writing! Dialogues throughout the movie will
fascinate every viewer, in how far removed they are from actual human
speech and emotion. To emphasize this disconnection from the human
condition, all lines are delivered by a group of wooden mannequins
cleverly disguised as actors. Although this has been a bold choice by
the director, the expression known as 'dull surprise' is always spot
on. The film also raises many questions, it boldly does not answer: Why is
a suspected murderer not in custody? Why does a wife and mother, who
must know that her husband is possessed by a ghost, does not act on
this knowledge? How do the two paranormal investigators know, that a
knife was just pulled? And does a knife really make a 'swing' sound,
although the one who pulls it just held it behind his back?This film uses all the horror-film tropes you love and can't get enough
of, like: 1) The ghost in the mirror! 2) The false 'standing behind the door' reveal! 3) Baby in danger! 4) Scary children! 5) Scary nursery rhymes!6) A abandoned hospital/mental institution! 7) Ominous pointing. 8) Ghosts ominous pointing. 9) Ghosts ominous pointing white screaming and/or cackling.10) The "...you cannot have seen him, he just died this morning."
Scene! 11) At least five instances of a noisy, scary and inexplicably moving
toy! 12) Ghosts wearing antiqued clothes while sitting with their back to
the camera! 13) The self-unscrewing screw! 14) Explaining the obvious! 15) The murderous husband bashing through a locked door! (As seen in
"The Shining") 16) The son disguised as his mother, murdering people! (As seen in
"Psycho") 17) Dissolving walls! (As seen in "Silent Hill") 18) An ending that sets up a third installment!This movie also takes a break from well-timed, well-placed,
non-predicable and terrifying jump-scares. No longer will your
heart-rate be raised by a sudden shock, that impairs your
movie-experience! No, this film fires so many Jump-scare-'duds' and
loud noises at the viewer, that after the first third of its runtime
you won't care anymore . And if you expect the 'loud noises' to match up with the pictures you
see on the screen, you will be pleasantly surprised, because "Insidious
- Chapter 2" breaks new ground! These noises always come a bit too
late, which gives you the opportunity to be prepared and not startled
by the sudden increase in volume. Especially noteworthy is the one scene, where the baby-bed is revealed
to be empty. A dramatic zoom, a loud noise and then BANG!: The instant
reveal, that the baby just had fallen out of the bed. Scenes like this
are a well thought out statement, how horror movies are desperately
fishing for cheap scares.But wait there is more! Like the well-beloved "weak wrist" camera-work, when a scene is meant
to be truly intense! A blatant and artistic disregard for how tin can
telephones are supposed to work! A time-travel story! Time traveling
ghosts! Where else, outside of Doctor Who, can you find something like
this? I warn you! This film is a movie you should not watch alone, because
all the quips and witty remarks you will inadvertently come up with,
would be otherwise lost to the silence. ---The Insidious Drinking Game: "Fake" Jump-Scare (x1) Scary Toy (x1)Jump-Scare Sound-Mismatch (x1)Tin Can Phones don't work that way (x2) Drink one each time you think: "....sure this isn't Christian Slater?"
