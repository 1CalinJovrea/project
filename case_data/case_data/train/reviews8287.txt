It has nothing to do with Agent 47

If you have played one of the video games for at least 45 minutes you
know that Agent 47 is all about discretion. DISCRETION!It's all about how he blends in, how he hides in the shadows. If you
have to physically engage guards or any other people except your target
you feel like you did something wrong.This movie was just an action movie that tries to get some of the
video-game franchise fans to pay for the ticket. Bu that's about it. So
instead of discretion, finesse, elegance... you have speed, force,
super-intelligence... Not bad but NOT AGENT 47.Looking forward for a real Hit-man movie.
