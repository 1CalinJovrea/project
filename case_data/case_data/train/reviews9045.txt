Absolutely awful.

I would have given this movie a 3/10, but the lower rating is from
sheer disappointment. This movie had such a great idea, but was
executed so poorly.We see a hard-working mom of two with the stereotypical doof-ball
husband, dealing with PTA moms who seemingly have nothing better to do
than make her life harder.Aside from the TERRIBLE acting, horrible cringe inducing dialogue, it
just wasn't funny. The countless crappy attempts at "humor" fell flat
on their face over and over and, had I not been with a friend, I would
have left after 15 minutes.But I had to endure a SAGA of ridiculous story lines, and so many loose
end tie ups. By the end I was actually willing the movie to stop so I
could leave.Just, so awful. Terrible performances, a terrible script, a disgrace to
the film industry and moms everywhere. Save your money and your time.
