Man of Steel 10/10

I am a big superman fan and luckily got a chance to see its early
screening and believe me it was a brilliant movie. I had very high
expectations from the movie and this film has completely exceeded my
expectation. The visual effects and action sequences in the movie are
actually the best I have ever seen. It easily overcomes The Avengers in
every single way and will for sure emerge as a big blockbuster film at
the box office. I don't know why the critics are saying that it focused
more on the action than on clark kent's character. It was completely
balanced in all ways. Its a must watch movie for every one and in my
opinion its not only the best movie of this summer but also the best
comic book movie of all time. And yes with a better score also put in
by Hans Zimmer. 10/10
