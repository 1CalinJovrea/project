Marshall is both entertaining and an important  lesson in history

What a shame that this movie has not been better promoted! Even in
Seattle, a movie town, I had not heard of it, except for one review in
the Seattle Times, which gave it a 3.5 out of 4. Thurgood Marshall
accomplished so much in his young life fighting for justice and civil
rights (listed in the credits). His courage in the darker days of
racism is little known, I wish more teenagers would see this movie to
gain a better understanding of just how bad it was. See it, you won't
be disappointed.
