More Blood Than Purpose

In most cases when an established director's name appears before the
word PRESENTS  in this case Quentin Tarantino presents THE MAN WITH
THE IRON FISTS  it means they served as executive producer and the
film will somewhat bear their directing style (think Steven Spielberg
with POLTERGEIST or GOONIES).Well QT's name is nowhere in any of the credits, including the story
conceived by The RZA  who provided a fantastic soundtrack for KILL
BILL  and Eli Roth co-wrote the script. But there are certain aspects,
like the exploitative/gratuitous homage to the drive-in Kung Fu flicks,
giving the impression the PULP FICTION icon is somewhere in the
building: But that's about where his signature ends.Set in 19th century China we have a score of science-fiction (or comic
book) elements: a man who can morph into steel, weapons with a variety
of functions, and people flying around like twirling bats. Suspension
of disbelief is essential and you should ignore all the plot points
within the first half hour that can be somewhat confusing: Just know
there's a bunch of gold and several factions want it. That being the
nefarious Lion Clan who kill their leader in cold blood  his son (Rick
Yune) wants revenge. He eventually bands with Russell Crowe's tough and
tubby maverick Jack Knife and a black blacksmith played by RZA himself,
perhaps the most sympathetic character with a backstory and handicap.As a director, the talented musician seems to mimic KILL BILL but
without any characters to invest in  while his lethargic acting's
nothing to brag about. That's not to say there aren't a few cool fights
worth watching, although the overabundant (computer generated) blood
and guts become distracting. And the title character is but a
formidable adversary with a lot more iron than just his hand. Perhaps
his description makes the coolest sounding name on the marquee, but the
people who really shine are Lucy Liu's gorgeous brothel vixens
including (and especially) Jamie Chung  she alone is worth the time
and money.Everything else feels like a lotta running around with rap and soul
music blasting at every turn. Perhaps if RZA went for more dark comedy
and put the melodrama aside, we could laugh along with the corny dialog
rather than cringing at it. Yet everything leads to another round of
kicks, swinging swords and flying limbs: so if that's all you're after,
look no further.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com
