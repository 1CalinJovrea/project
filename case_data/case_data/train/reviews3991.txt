The Accountant does not add up.

In this silly convoluted tale that seems to take place in a vacuum
somewhere in Illinois Ben Affleck's stilted acting abilities find a
home as an adult savant with autism. As Ben belts out his monotone
performance we are treated to some major heat and flash of copious
violence, ancillary padding and remarkable coincidence before it is all
put to rest with a touching reunion mid- massacre. Christian Wolfe (Affleck) is a brilliant numbers guy who has cooked the
books for some heavy hitters throughout the world. He has become
enormously wealthy (Renoir and a Pollock adorn his Airstream) but all
the money in the world cannot normalize his ability to communicate with
humans. With the Treasury Department chasing him for evasion he takes
on a legitimate payday with a Fortune 500 like company but they are
knee deep in a multi-million dollar skimming scheme and Christian has
to revert to his other specialties to win the day.As Terminator with a CPA, Affleck's wooden Wolfe lacks the Austrian
accent but remains Arnold like in an All-American way. Besides being
brilliant around spread sheets he is also a superb shot with all types
of weapons as well as a karate kid, not bad for a child with a
handicap.The most amazing thing about Christian though is his ability to hide in
plain sight while he wipes out poorly shaven baddies with computer game
efficiency while Treasury agents sit around and wax nostalgic about
their imperfect pasts. Director Gavin O'Connor directs with a heavy hand as scenes sink into
bathos, his entire cast, save for when there is action, looking
fatigued. Building his story like a sloppy sandwich you won't be able
to fit into your mouth with banal subplots he attempts to give the film
an emotional pull through flashback but the story stretches credulity
constantly while the abysmal climax of discovery and gore is so
dreadfully paced, the surprises along the way anything but, While it
does have its books in order for a sequel the Accountant, nevertheless,
goes bankrupt in no time.
