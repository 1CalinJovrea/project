A Great Entertainment

The siblings Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are
left alone in the woods by their father and captured by a dark witch in
a candy house. However they kill the witch and escape from the spot.
Years later, the orphans have become famous witch hunters. When eleven children go missing in a small village, the Major summons
Hansel and Gretel to rescue them, and they save the red haired Mina
(Pihla Viitala) from the local sheriff that wants to burn her accusing
Mina of witchcraft. Soon they discover that the Blood Moon will
approach in three days and the powerful dark witch Muriel (Famke
Janssen) is the responsible for the abduction of children. She intends
to use the children together with a secret ingredient in a Sabbath to
make the coven of witches protected against the fire. Meanwhile Hansel
and Gretel disclose secrets about their parents."Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters" is a great entertainment for ordinary
viewers like me that like the genre of fantasy but based on the
Metacritic Rating, it is not recommended to intellectuals. The story is
very funny and the special effects and make-up are top notch. Gemma
Arterton is one of the sexiest actresses and it is good to see her
again. If the viewer likes this genre, he or she will certainly enjoy
"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters". I do not understand why people that
like art movies spend their time watching this type of movie and
writing bad reviews. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "João e Maria: Caçadores de Bruxas" ("John and Mary:
Witch Hunters")
