Not as bad as everybody told me !

I wasn't that eager to watch this movie, because I had seen some clips
on TV shows reviewing it, and read reviews in newspapers...and none of
them were very positive.But on a rainy Sunday night, nothing else to do...i thought to
myself...why not !? Have an open mind and go and see it.And i must say I was pleasantly surprised !!! YES every normal thinking
adult must know that the things you see in this movie are outrageous
and simply couldn't ever happen that way. But so is most of what
happens in any Bond movie ! So just forget about that part of it
all...and decide if the movie is entertaining, and i thought it was ! Channing Tatum, James Woods, Maggie Gyllenhaal and little Joey King did
really good work ! The only negative for me in this movie was Jamie
Foxx, and I don't even know what it was that bothered me about him in
this movie, but I just didn't think he was the best choice for that
part !
