Writer Director Alex Garland is a powerhouse of talent

I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm
going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an
amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently
written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the
direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary
it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a
disciplined mind.The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters
are simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the
perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being
too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it. Best seen in a cinema I reckon.
