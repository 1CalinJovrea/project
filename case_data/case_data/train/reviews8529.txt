well wrapped

Why as a seasoned movie addict and theatre visitor am I always amazed
at the way the " Blockbusters" get all the press and gossip and
fantastic movies like this slip through the net. Like last years
immense " The Babadook ", this directional debut by Joel Egerton is a
really good thriller and has had nowhere near the media coverage it
deserves. It makes me so angry that the Marvel franchise gets rammed
down our throats on TV and in fast food cafes and masterpieces slip
through the net. Excellently directed and very well acted,this clever
little well - wrapped gift is all we need to let us know that the
proper movie making process is still alive and kicking. Very few
special effects and perfect use of sound( or lack of it in some cases)
with 1 or 2 shocks to keep us going,it carries a clear message of our
past waiting to wreck our future. I think it cleverly slows pace half
way through then wakes up in the last third.Grab it while you can guys
cos this will just go after a week or 2.
