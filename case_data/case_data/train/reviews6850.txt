The dreadfully deranged spidey !

It has been 24 hrs (app.) since i have seen the movie and i am still
desperately trying to understand what was the target market in the mind
of the director ? The movie was too complicated for children and was
strange for adults like me.Despite of Emma stone and Sally field being totally wasted in their
respective roles. I still thought that Andrew garfield would do a good
job in the movie or at least justice to the spider-man character but he
too seemed lost in the school (He is only 28years old) Why did peter
and gwen need to go to a school school which occupies half of Manhattan
? as if that is possible in NY.Dr. Connors seemed deranged more than seeming like a genius. when you
see a Marvel movie you expect the villain to display a lot of shades of
grey and here we had an antagonist who seemed to be obsessed with
improving mankind of all its weakness.our dear Dr. Norman Osborn seemed to be dying in the movie (God save
the green goblin, what are we going to do in the sequel if the green
goblin is not saved !!!) Irfan khan was visiting from the sets of MIB4
or maybe 5 he seems better suited there and not as a scientist dressed
in all black.Peter's parents have a small side track which is left unexplained that
it leaves viewers perplexed as to why did we just waste 20 minutes
talking about them !!! A dying police chief applauds spider-man for his
service to NY and tells him that he is meant for great things but also
makes him promise to stay away from his daughter. The man just gave his
life for the country but seems to be an overprotective father.I had gone in thinking that i would see a movie as amazing as The
Avengers but clearly i was disappointed. Sam Raimi was better and we
want him back.
