In shock

I genuinely cannot believe that this went forward and was turned into a
genuine movie. I actually have a very high tolerance for useless films,
but this was on its own level all together. I'm surprised it even has a
5.3 rating.A lot of people are discussing how Scott Eastwood should be getting
better gigs etc, but he is possibly the worst part of this movie. A
main actor who can't act, who has no charisma, he really can't deliver
a line. The secondary acting was also shocking, the horrific french
accents and the forced lines, especially by the two girls, its like
they had never heard or seen real people interact.I think (though to be honest I'm not sure) that the film was meant to
give off a sense of style and suave, but it failed at even that. It was
all tacky and just name dropping of various big cities around the
world, the budget wasn't tiny on this either so that's no real excuse.People are calling it a poor mans (also completely whitewashed) Fast
and Furious, but that's a bit too generous, its so much worse than
that. There is an absence of logic when it comes to the story. I felt
like i was watching a sequel to which I hadn't seen the predecessor.
Things are mentioned but not explained and left hanging. Like they
stole one guys cars and then another guys with no repercussions? nothing much else to say except that Eastwood Jr's career deserves to
be heading in the direction that it is, he is completely void of
talent.
