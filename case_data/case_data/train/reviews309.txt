Disappointing

the first movie was good, i love it in fact. All the tricks were kinda
impossible, but at least its all make sense after they showed us how
they did it and added with an interesting plot twist at the end. Now
you see me 2, however, went to the next level of bull tricks and
meaningless story line with "crunchy" jokes. It was boring and
confusing. I wasted 2 hours for nothing. I used to think that the characters in the first movie were good and
well tough out - they were good as a team and fun to be watched. Now,
they are just annoying and try soooo hard to look cool with their
crappy dialogue and outrageous tricks. Its a movie about magicians
right? Not witches nor wizards. I mean, can they really throwing cards
from one to another without anyone noticing? Can a card slide through
your body that easily?To summarise, the movie is bad in everything (story line, acting,
dialogue) Don't even bother to watch it.
