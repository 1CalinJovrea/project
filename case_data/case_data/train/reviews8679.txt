Superfluous film. Adds nothing new to many other films and TV series about the same social environment

I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I must confess upfront
that I find this film superfluous, given the overload of TV series and
films that also center around high schools and their population. One
might falsely think that striving to be popular and "cool" is the main
occupation of an average adolescent. This film adds nothing new or
original to this overload, and does not even attempt to show that there
is more to the subject. Further, this film concentrates too much on a
single person, the alleged "wallflower", and leaves the remaining
persons very much as entourage.What hinders me in the scenario is that our main character can only be
considered a wallflower for a relatively small time frame. He gets some
friends in an early stage of the story, albeit all these are older than
he is. What helped in acquiring these friendships is that he could show
several talents in the context of prose and poetry, and that he also
had some talents as a stand-up comedian (probably only when under
influence, but still).I scored a 1 (lowest) for the audience award when leaving the theater.
I am at a loss why this film ended on place 8 for this award, with an
average score of 4.52 (out of 5). I can only assume that other people
find interesting material in these stories, which theory seems
confirmed by the scores on IMDb. Maybe I'm just too old (64) for this.
