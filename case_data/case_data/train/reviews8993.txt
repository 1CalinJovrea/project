Too Long and Boring Franchise

"The Divergent Series: Allegiant" is another part of this too long and
boring franchise. The saga of Tris and Four and their friends is
repetitive and predictable, using clichés and special effects. The
screenplay is poor and stupid. For example, David is capable to close
doors and remotely controls the city; why does he need someone to
release the gas in Chicago? The worst is that the story does not end
and there will be another sequel to gross more money for the producers.
My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "A Série Divergente: Convergente" ("The Divergent
Series: convergent")
