My Turn!!

Jess (Scarlett Johansson) is running for public office with a prude
image. She goes to Miami with three old college friends and an Aussie
friend for a bachelorette weekend only to have the film go south as the
scripts deviates from the whole bachelorette story into a murder cover
up. Kate McKinnon was great, Jillian Bell acceptable and the rest don't
know how to do comedy.NO NO NO This is not as funny as "Bridesmaid.' Kristen Wiig got more
laughs in one airplane scene than this whole film. If you watch the
previews,you have seen all of the film worth watching.F-word. Sex talk. Near nudity (Demi Moore is in it.)
