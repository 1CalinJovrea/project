How can something so boring be considered a thriller

Nothing to review except this film is a complete bore!!!!! Nothing good
about it so it is hard to complete 10 lines for submittal. I can't see
how anyone could say that this film keep them on the edge of their seat
the whole time? It was more interesting watching my neighbor pick their
nose then watching this. I enjoy being stuck in traffic on the Beltway
more then being tortured watching this. I would rather watch Ishtar
from 1987 and considered one of the worst movies then this. If you need
something to help you sleep watch this. If you enjoy torturing yourself
watch this. If you wonder what a bad movie is like watch this. Please
do yourself a favor and never watch this - you have been warned.
