An excellent example of a modern teen comedy.

A film that was expected not surprise, but he did happily. Fun, shows
modern and contemporary themes with a comic and natural touch. It
presents an interesting terminology. It is predictable in parts of the
plot and has clich√©s, but still the good parts of the film stand out
more.Mae Whitman provides a lovely, funny and intelligent character, Robbie
Amell was interesting and fun too. One possible bright future for both.
Allison Janney always great.A nice movie with several moments to laugh and better than the other
trash teen movies. I enjoy it a lot. 8/10
