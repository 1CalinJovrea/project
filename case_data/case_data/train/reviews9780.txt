Worth the wait

I was a little disappointed about the critics' review of the movie,
since I adore Johnny Depp and had been waiting for the movie to release
for months. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was lovely. It had
action (as promised), a good plot and pretty generous doses of humor
for a movie of this genre. Depp stole the show with his portrayal of
Tonto, but the other actors were great as well. The obvious comparison
of this movie is with the Pirates of the Caribbean series because of
Verbinski and Depp. There were parts of the movie, especially those
where Tonto's actions generated laughs from the theater, which reminded
me of the latter. Both have Depp in eccentric roles which provide ample
comic relief. But since the themes are completely different, I feel
that a comparison is not exactly fair. All in all, it is a good,
lighthearted, entertaining way to spend two and a half hours, and I am
considering hitting the theater for it again soon.
