Google Commercial Disguised as Heartwarming Buddy Comedy

First off, like most of you, I loved Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson in
Wedding Crashers and like most of you, I went into The Internship
hoping for more of the same.What I found was a very safe, very by the numbers 'under dog' story
featuring two ageing salesman trying to start over in the tragically
cool world of Google employment. Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are two veteran pitchmen who learn their
current company has just gone out of business and, in a reality only
Hollywood could create, there are no other sales jobs anywhere in the
universe! We know this because Vince spends 3 minutes using Google (not
Workopolis or Monster??) to find a new gig only to have a sudden and
unexplained epiphany that the search engine he's using to find a job IS
the job. Deep.What follows is a stock plot about the seniors taking on a group of
outcast geek interns and teaching them to party, keep it real and -
this is new - there is more to life than computers.The film, written by Vaughn, plays it very safe, heartwarming feel good
lessons replace well, comedy.On the positive side, if you want to learn A LOT about the hipster,
self absorbed world of Google this film is for you. Nowhere is the mega
company joked about, ridiculed, parodied or in anyway presented as
anything other than the ideal final destination for everyone on the
planet who wants to ride silly colored bicycles and waste their lives
typing code.Rent Dodgeball. A FUNNY Vaughn movie with the same plot.
