This movie sucks bad. It's about a bunch of meatheads trying to live
"the American dream" regardless of the cost.This movie is based on a true story of these idiots who KILLED innocent
people and now the victim's families must watch those same killers get
glorified on the big screen by roided actors. Sick isn't it? The
director tries to make these murders likable when he should be making
them completely hateable. These weren't honorable soldiers, assassins
with a conscience, etc.Mark Walhberg is awful. He just stinks up every film he's in with the
same stupid face he makes in every other film he's in. Why is this guy
even getting work?1/10 total crap.
