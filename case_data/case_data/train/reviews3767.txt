Unfunny and Moronic Comedy

Becky (Rebel Wilson) summons her high-school slut friends Regan
(Kirsten Dunst), Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher) to be
bridesmaids of her wedding with the handsome Dale (Hayes MacArthur).
The trio spends one crazy night of drugs, booze, sex and confusions in
New Yorkr trying to fix the wedding dress of Becky that they have torn
."Bachelorette" is an unfunny and moronic comedy with unpleasant
characters, gross jokes and stupid situations. The three friends are
drugged, alcoholic, envious and promiscuous women. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): "Quatro Amigas e um Casamento" ("Four Friends and One
Wedding")
