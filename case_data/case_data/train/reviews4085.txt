Captivating from the opening scene...

Wow, watch this!Maybe the best film I've seen this year, up there with Whiplash and
Birdman...From the very opening scene I was immersed just like the first page of
a fine book.. I immediately cared for this character within minutes.
That's great writing. The dialogue was superb. Every aspect was in
fact.I must say the two leads were stellar... and the film had a bit of
everything...The sense of travel, emotions, the score, location,
cinematography...A phenomenal film, you'd do yourself well to watch this immediately!
