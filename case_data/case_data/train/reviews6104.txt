Strong movie totally focused on single character

Michael Shannon is one of the character actors catchy to watch even
then when the topic or method of depiction is not your matter of taste.
In the few of them I have seen, his presences provided additional value
and, moreover, it is hard to forget his expressive face and height. In
The Iceman, Shannon's performance of notorious Mafia hit-man Richard
Kuklinski is catchy again: depiction of a man with many faces,
including cruel and caring, is not easy, and his character is
continuously on screen during the 1 hour 40 minutes. True, the cast is
evenly strong, supporting performances by Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo,
Winona Ryder as Deborah Kuklinski, Robert Davi as Leonard Marks,
Stephen Dorff as Joseph Kuklinski are memorable as well, although their
appearance on screen is rather limited.As for the plot, I have read that many viewers find it unrealistic. But
in the pre-Internet era, when even a pager was advanced technical
widget and the use of phone booths was wide, was much easier to live
double life and much harder to catch those the authorities suspected.
Well, present-day people used to Google and cams may have difficulties
to comprehend this... The only thing I would have like to see more how
the plans to capture Kuklinski were made and how they found out about
all his past - thus the part of the police and ATF could have been
bigger. Recommended to all who like movies dealing with actual villains. As for
Shannon, I will search others movies with his presence I am not aware
of.
