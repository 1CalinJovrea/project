Burning woman.

Hoo boy. This movie requires some effort. What starts off as a brutal
exploitation flick, surely to weed out the meek, evolves into an
absorbing treatise on primal human conditions in a barren, deserted
wasteland.While Ana Lily Amipour's sophomore effort contains pulpy roots,
littered with outrageous characters and circumstances, it also tackles
some grand topics. Our white trashy heroine Arlen is unceremoniously
turfed out of society to fend for herself behind a Texan fence, where
lawlessness and depravity are the rule of the day. She is soon captured
by a tribe of cannibals, and mayhem ensues.Dystopian futures as these don't seem all that far fetched any more.
"The Bad Batch" may serve as a warning, but chiefly it serves as dusty
entertainment. Much like the "Mad Max" franchise, it is a world full of
crazies scrambling to survive in glorious sunbaked vistas. Sporting a primo porn stash, Keannu Reeves pops up as a bizarro, robe
clad cult leader. Giovanni Ribisi slips in several rambling, asylum
escapee diatribes, but it is an unrecognizable Jim Carrey who
absolutely steals the movie as a wizened bag man."The Bad Batch" has the art junk, lost inhibition, drug and music orgy
feel of Burning Man, and because it's stealthily asking tough
questions, has much more going for it than the cheap veneer may
indicate.
