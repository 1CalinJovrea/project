Tell a 2 hour story in 20 words

Before I started reading reviews on IMDb I actually thought the cinema
was a form of entertainment. Now I realise I was totally wrong. A silly
comedy like "Meet the Fockers" or" Legally Blonde" is condemned as a
complete waste of time."I want my life back" But a film lasting two and
a half hours which shows a man kidnapped into slavery,beaten half to
death and then rescued is considered worthy of 5 stars. If I had gone
to the cinema alone I would have left after 15 minutes.What sort of
people can enjoy watching other people being beaten senseless for two
and a half hours.The only thing that kept me awake was the hope that
the slaves would rise up and cut those nasty white throats.No such
luck.The slave was rescued.A weak ending to to a weak pointless film.
