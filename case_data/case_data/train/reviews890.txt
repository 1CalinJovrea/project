This movie gave me brain cancer

OK, so typical sappy romantic BS, but this time they have cancer? Oh
give me a break. Yeah, thank god they're wealthy, attractive white
people so they could have their little romantic adventure. My cousin
got lymphoma at age 16 and could barely eat because of medical bills,
his parents are so deep in debt they had to sell their house as no
insurance would cover him. But the "tragedy" here is that pretentious
d-bag Gus (and his cringe worthy pseudo intellectual metaphor) died
*after* traveling to Europe and banging a hot girl. Oh the humanity!
This is a love story written for the 1%, where the biggest tragedy in
life is that spoiled little daddy's money babies Gus and Hazel couldn't
live to 90 off their parent's dime, probably in some Malibu beach
house.If you're a rich white person with no concept of real life, you will
enjoy this. Otherwise steer clear of this formulaic love story tripe.
