Very fast paced action! Loved it!

Well! I loved the movie as I was entertained! Isn't that is why we
watch movies, for me movies should be entertaining first whether they
can satisfy the critic's or not. This part is very fast paced u never
get bored for a minute, its is action truly underworld style. Sometimes
its very hard for me to believe that how movies like twilight(Boring
love story and action nothing to speak of) work so well at the box
office and underworld doesn't. Maybe its a personal choice of viewers.
But if i have to rate vampire movies i would certainly rate
Underworld(any part) higher than any of the twilight movies. Overall
this movie is for those who liked previous parts of this movie! So
enjoy the confrontation between VAMPIRES, LYCHANS AND now HUMANS!
