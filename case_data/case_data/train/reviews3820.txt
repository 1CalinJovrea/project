Simply Not That Interesting

Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie.
And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comic
book. "The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although there
are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve
the problem"The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic
superheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say "so what?". The movie
didn't really establish why I should care about much of what was going
on on screenit was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequences
that were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at character
development.
