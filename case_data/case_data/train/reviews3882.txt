Deeply disappointing

If you film a story like this one, with one of the most insane,
twisted, gruesome characters of all time, you need a deep psychological
advised script. No way the character displayed on this movie could ever
turn into the one portrayed by Gunnar Hansen in the original 1973
movie. This story needed to show the serious traumas that person could
have suffered to become such a monster: not only a cold blooded killer
but a grave defector and a cannibal. Nothing of that is here. Plus
there is no continuity with TTChM: the beginning. Pity, because that
one (at least) gave us a nice clue with the horrendous birth scene.OBS: the term "bi polar disorder" first appear in the scientific
community in early 1950's. No way a mental institution in farmer Texas
would use it officially at that time.
