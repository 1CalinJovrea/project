The best film of 2013 is Her.

I saw Her this weekend, and it's my favorite movie of the year.
Everything about it was fantastic: the acting, the directing, the
writing. It could've easily been a clich√©d look at technology or the
future, but it's fundamentally a very human story about evolution. It's
about having to deal with unfulfillment and things like divorce and
loneliness, but it's also undercut with hope, whether it be through
Theo's relationships with Samantha (Johansson) and Amy (Adams) or even
the stylistic touches, like having Theo's red clothes set against a
muted Los Angeles background. There are parallels drawn between all the
characters' journeys without it feeling contrived, and even Theo's
job--writing letters for other people--represents his relationship with
his OS; on the surface, they may seem like "just letters" or "just a
computer", but they're outlets for his emotions and desires.Oh, and everyone in the cast is phenomenal; it's a shame Johansson is
"ineligible" for an award. BS. She's fantastic, and this is an even
tougher role to pull off.This is a story about life, and it's perfect.A.Full review: http://polarbearstv.com/2013/12/30/her-review/
