Awesome

Cars 3 is probably just as good as the first one. Way better than Cars
2! It is really emotional. It has some good laughs! The story is
amazing! The characters are great. I liked the new trainer Cruz
Rameriez's character. We get some older cars and new younger
generations like Jackson Storm. Good Ending (NO SPOILERS I PROMISE!).
If you really like Cars 1, you're gonna love Cars 3!
