The Knife Before Christmas

Greetings again from the darkness. Whether you saw the first two in
this series will directly correlate to whether you head to the theatre
for this third entry. The filmmakers' attempt to attract a younger
audience by adding a "new" crew and dropping to a PG-13 rating
backfires, and will not provide the legs this franchise needed for more
installments.The regular old geezers are back: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham,
Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Jet Li (briefly), and
Arnold Schwarzenneger. In addition, we get new "old" blood in the form
of Antonio Banderas, Kelsey Grammar, Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, and
the dominating presence of Mel Gibson as the bad guy. The young blood
comes in the form of Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell, boxer Victor Ortiz, and
MMA superstar Ronda Rousey. The blandness of the newbies simply steals
valuable screen time for the old folks, and the movie suffers because
of it.The film's biggest flaw, however, comes with the biggest screen hog of
all-time: Mr. Stallone. We understand that this is franchise is his
baby, but why field an all-star team if you won't let them play? Snipes
gets some time early in the film, replete with a reference to his real
life prison sentence for tax evasion, and Ford and Arnold get in a few
shots, but the only savior here is Mel Gibson. It's a reminder of just
how good he can be on screen ... if we could just forget what a
horrible person he can be off screen.There is no need to go into detail on the plot or describe any of the
characters. You know what you are getting if you buy a ticket. It's
just a shame the film's direction and script aren't at the level
deserving of a cast that includes: Rambo, Mad Max, Blade, Conan, Han
Solo, Hercules, Zorro, The Transporter, He-Man, and even ... Sideshow
