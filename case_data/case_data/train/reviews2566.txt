A Film in Which the Protagonist has no actual problems

I had little empathy for the heroine of this story because she has
almost no obstacles to overcome. Okay, she's got a cranky boss.
Fortunately, her sister has saved up enough money to send her to
America--where the parish priest has already found accommodation for
her. And, where everybody is nice to her. And where a sincere, kind and
handsome man courts her and proposes marriage. Oh, and the parish
priest pays for her schooling. And she breezes through her exams
because she's smart as a whip.Then, about halfway through the movie, tragedy strikes. But it's an
event so sudden and so far away that there's really nothing our heroine
can--or is expected to--do anything about it. So while it's sad and
unfortunate, it's nothing she can act on.Phew! For a moment there, I thought our protagonist might actually have
to do something besides accept the next kind offer of assistance.Returning to Ireland, she's courted by considerate, handsome fella #2.
But to make matters worse. . . she's offered a high-paying office
job--doing the very thing she aced all her exams in! Will the
tribulations of this woman never end? For a while, I was afraid she
might win the lottery.The worst thing to happen to her is that she gets seasick and is locked
out of the head. SHE HAS TO USE A BUCKET. Oh, the humanity! Someone
should have told the screenwriter that this is an insufficient problem
to build a drama around.
