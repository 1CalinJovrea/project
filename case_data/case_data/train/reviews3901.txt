Absolutely terrible film.

I cannot believe that ANYONE actually liked this movie. I was shocked
that so many young actors I normally love to watch agreed to be a part
of this terrible work. The only decent character in the entire film
spent the film being treated like utter trash by the other three
characters, who I guess we were supposed to sympathize with? I was
consistently disgusted with how cruel, dishonest, and totally lacking
in any kind of caring all of the 'bridesmaids' were. How did these
people ever even become friends with the bride? They made fun of her
and seemed to hate her behind her back. There was nothing funny and
certainly nothing inspirational about anything that happened in this
movie. All I could think was that the bride deserved better people for
company, and that all of these people were total dirtbags. I kept
hoping for things to turn around and someone to learn an important
lesson or at least make a really good joke, and it just never happened
at all.This movie was a waste of time, and put me in a bad mood for the rest
of the day. I literally registered on this website just so I could warn
people about this awful movie. Yea. It was THAT bad.
