disappointing

my girlfriends and I were so excited to see this, we were thinking it
was going to be a fun movie with some hot guys. Let me put it to you
this way. In the beginning all the women in the theater were cheering
and clapping like they were in a real strip club so I thought yaay this
is going to be fun, then after the first hour there was no more
clapping or cheering, you could hear crickets and I felt the same way.
By the end, nothing gets resolved for anyone and you're just left
thinking "what just happened" I give it a 2 because SOME of the dance
numbers were fun and Channing was very nice to look at. As another
reviewer said, if you rent the movie, fast forward to the strip dance
scenes I promise you won't miss anything else. It's sad because I
really wanted to like this movie :(
