Marshall 2017 - Superb Film Making

The actors in this intelligent film are all first rate and believable
in their roles. Film is strong in mystery and suspense. The film is
part of history but very entertaining from start to finish. It's an
uplifting and positive film for everyone to enjoy. There are great
believable interpersonal relationships. The film is high quality
production including the music score. There is no detail that was
spared. Plenty of great symbolism in the film for example the images in
wall frame pictures in court room. I do expect actor and/or actress and
other film awards in the future. Marshall 2017 is a must see film.
