Are you kidding me?

I don't like to be the downer on this movie, but I've just got back
from watching it at my local cinema and I've already forgotten about
it! I was expecting good things, 215 million spent on the movie, Emma
Stone (big fan), Andrew Garfield (up and coming, great in Social
Network) and Martin Sheen as a co-star, come on it should have been
better.I got lost in the lack of a plot, it felt like it all happened over a
day or two, the acting was limited, even Emma Stone only seemed to
convince in a few scenes. At times it was as if I'd gone back in time
and was stuck watching the Hulk again! please, please, not again! It
just seemed so mixed up,there were a few, and when I say a few, I mean
more than two! decent scenes! a couple of jokes thrown in, but then it
was back to mediocre, what the heck happened to Denis Leary, after
Rescue Me, you'd think that this guy could act now.For me, and this is only my humble opinion, it was a bid disappointment
that made me wonder why I went in the first place. Once again Hollywood
got me, with their big budget advertising machine. But maybe it's me, IMDb's never wrong is it? and maybe, just maybe, as
I didn't watch it in 3D and could see the movie this time, I'm wrong!
