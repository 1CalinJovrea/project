Musical done right

This new comedic musical is right on pitch. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a
student at Barden University whose dream is to move to LA and become a
DJ. Beca is uninterested in college, to say the least. Her father is a
professor at her school and he advises her to join clubs to get more
involved. Beca starts to work at the school radio station along with
her admirer, Jesse (Skylar Astin).When Beca's voice is heard by Chloe (Brittany Snow), one of the main
girls of The Barden Bellas a capella group, Beca is recruited into this
singing group. Jesse ends up joining the rival all-boys a capella group
called The Treble Makers.Beca soon realizes that The Bellas need some new music in order to
improve their reputation and make it to the finals. However, the leader
of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp), is quite headstrong and refuses to
change their music. The tension between these girls and The Treble
Makers continues to grow and everything begins to unfold.Walking into this movie with very low expectations, I definitely was
pleasantly surprised. It is a musical done right. There is no breaking
out into song; the only time people sing is during competitions. In
fact, the music is terrific and I can't wait to download the entire
soundtrack.I was expecting slapstick comedy, especially with Rebel Wilson in the
cast, but "Pitch Perfect" rests at the borderline. Speaking of Rebel,
this movie would be nothing without her. Hilarious lines mixed with her
perfect comedic timing equals a workout for your abs. It comes very
close to stupidity but it doesn't quite cross the line."Pitch Perfect" is cute, silly, and fun. If you're looking for some
laughs, take a watch. I give it a 7 out of 10.
