"The selfish man is like a mangy dog chasing a cautionary tale" (dialog)

OK OK I get it.This may not be the overall "best" animated film of all time but, now
that I have seen it six or seven times, I think it is not only ONE OF
THE BEST but also it excels at the following: * best use of video games as a metaphor for an action story.* best atmosphere -- just when you think you are comfortable with the
interior of one game, they introduce another. It is like a 3D film
without the actual need for the glasses.* best matchup of voice actor and personality -- every animated film,
now, in the past, and yet to come, strives for this. Many die-hard fans
will say that Ellen Degeneres as a fish nailed it. Well, I don't think
so. The voice acting of Sarah Silverman matched with the animated
character (which I swear seems to be just Sarah herself when she was
maybe 5 or 6 years old) is the most perfect meshing of the two I have
seen.The story, the acting, the direction, all perfect -- this is an amazing
movie that really did not get the attention it deserved.
