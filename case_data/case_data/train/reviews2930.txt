In a word, brilliant

Science fiction has been dominated by 'space westerns' for so long that
the occasional concept- based story situation hits a big number on my
personal richter scale. What does it mean to be human? And if we create near-humans what is our
responsibility to them and what is their relationship to us? These
themes underpinned Blade Runner and Spielberg's A.I. And Sci Fi of the
50s and 60s dealt with machine self awareness. None of the films that
touched on this subject in the past presented it so thoroughly,
intimately and believably. Her is in the near future, but everything we see is within reach now:
the isolation and starkness of the "business district," the oppressive
scale of the architecture (with thin, clumsy attempts to soften its
sterility) and the need for continuous connection to remote voices.A personal assistant that learns independently and takes initiative for
its hapless user, "Her" is at once the ideal tool and  who knows 
perhaps closer to the next level of evolution. Pitch perfect performances and direction kept me in the story. As
others have said, the locations, cinematography and even music shine in
the fabric of this film. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the
top of his game. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the
other leads. Even Scarlett Johansson, who has not always seemed a
strong actress to me performs utterly convincingly. It's an adult-themed film in more ways than one, but especially in the
best way: it makes you think about a reality that's right around the
corner.
