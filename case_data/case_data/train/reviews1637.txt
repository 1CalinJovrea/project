Last good MCU movie

What I liked1. Ant Man and Micheal Douglas's performance2. The redemption story felt like Iron Man 1 but it still was well done3. The father daughter bond4. The train fight5. There was actual progression with his becoming a hero6. Ant mans friendsWhat I didn't like1. The villain wasn't all that investing2. Falcon's scene3. Too many avengers referencesOverall while this is actually a pretty solid effort for the first time
in a few years, it does fall to the whole constant avengers references.
It could have been a great movie, but instead we have a good movie.
Which sort of sucks. But it is truly the last good effort by MCU
