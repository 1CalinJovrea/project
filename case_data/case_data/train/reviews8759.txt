2
What a let down

Now listen to me, very carefully, script writers. The plot for "Taken
2" is rubbish. If you don't sort it out, I will find you, and I will
kill you.No, it's okay, I won't actually kill anyone, but the above serves to
highlight all that remains of the "Taken 2" legacy: parodies and
spoofs. Where the first film focused on Liam Neeson's character as
being resourceful (and then threw in some no nonsense action for good
measure), the second film uses plot points that make me wonder if the
script writer(s) engaged their brains at any point. The daughter fails
two driving tests, and by the end of the film she is driving in a high
speed chase, performing hand brake turns, and throwing grenades in
random directions. Grenades that, you know, the Turkish authorities
don't mind anyone bringing to their country on a plane. Grenades that
evaded metal detectors. Then there's the 'we will kill you, but it will
be slowly, and with us not in sight, giving you the best chance of
escape, Mr. Bond'-esque sequence. And oh yeah, he's still got a mobile
phone after being kidnapped, because evil Albanian baddies are actually
good sports who don't mind giving their captives a fair crack of the
whip. And while we're on the subject, you have a mobile phone, and you
know the number of your ex-CIA associates who could help you in an
instant. At what point in the film do you call them? When you're
dangling from a pipe in a cellar, or when you're on US soil in an
embassy? Go figure.I really enjoyed the first film, but this was rotten. And in fairness,
in hindsight, it would have been tough to measure up to the first one
on the basis that there is very little more than could have been done
with the idea, short of seeing Neeson kidnapped and his daughter
deliver the "I will find you, and I will kill you" spiel. To be honest,
that might have been better.
