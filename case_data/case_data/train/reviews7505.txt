Definitely worth seeing for two amazing performances from Downey and Duvall.

I saw this film twice at TIFF and was quite impressed! It's getting
some harsh reviews, undeservedly. Yes, it's too long and yes, director
David Dobkin needs to work on his tone and pacing, but the story is
great and the performances are fantastic! Not a simple courtroom drama at all, the story is more about Hank
Palmer (Downey)'s struggle to understand his relationship with his
father and to accept where he came from. It's about identity, family,
and all the messiness and contradictions of life. If you are a teenager who can't sit still through a more-than-two-hours
long movie, or expect some type of John Grisham or Iron Man-like action
from this film, you will be disappointed. If you are a true film lover
who revels in watching great actors practice their craft, you will not
be disappointed by The Judge. This movie is definitely worth sitting through for amazing performances
by both Downey and Duvall, who could both be up for Oscar nominations
for their roles as the son and father, respectively. There are many
very funny moments as well as many touching moments between father and
son, brother and brother. The audience I sat with at Roy Thomson Hall
loved it, frequently expressing their appreciation with laughter. See
for yourself on October 10--don't let a few critics spoil it for you.
