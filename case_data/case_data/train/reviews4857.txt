loved it

I can't understand the negativity some people feel for this film. Its a
really exiting story, The cast are great, the stuntwork is great and I
want to see more films with these characters.That is pretty much all I wanted to say but I suppose I have to say
something else to meet the minimum ten lines.OK Keremy Renner is a great new lead. I may actually prefer him to Matt
Damon already and if he does another one I think that'll be a
certainty. He is more expressive than Damon, more convincing
physically, more likable.Rachel Weisz is the only lead female in this films I even care about.
She can act! More than can be said about Damon's girlfriend or wife or
whatever it was that got killed at the earliest opportunity in the
second film of the series. Certainly better than Julia " I look 12"
Styles as a tacked on vapid love interest.Norton was underused that is true,Keach was too. Why Scott Glenn was in
this I have no idea. He looks like the living dead and can barely
speak.Motorbike chase was epic. I want a sequel.
