room is perfect

Too many tears, too much sadness. Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped,
raped and made a mom. And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from
the world. Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be
4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the
arms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he
wants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his
first 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he
knows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the
room has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights.Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the
screenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are
terrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy
screenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's
grandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent.
Definite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in
every scene.
