Quite possibly the worst turtles movie ever made

Story, presentation, originality, humor, character presentation and
acting are all things obviously left unexplored in this epically
abysmal 2014 installation of the turtles franchise. The action sequences are bland but plentiful. Faithfulness to the
original series is lost. Megan Fox acting is quite possibly the worst
part of the movie, unbelievable and disconnected throughout. With as many franchises that he shits on, I advice you to try to stay
as far away as possible from anything Michael Bay touches in the
future.If you look at it objectively it's like a mash between most popular
action films with extremely distinguishable parts taken from others.
Combind that with a story so shallow and predictable that a 5 minute
trailer video would be a more appropriate medium for this release. We
mourn the times when action movies didn't make us cringe in every other
scene.
