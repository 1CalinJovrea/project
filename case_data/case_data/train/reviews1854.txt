Worst Ghostbuster Movie

Crappy story with nothing sensible, utter nonsense ! Graphics look
cheap, like some world of warcraft game graphics. Then there is crappy
performance from crappy actors spare Chris Hemsworth who has done a
good job as always ! Melissa McCarthy is a huge disappointment. This is
the worst Ghostbusters movie ever. Don't waste your time over this
movie, watch one of the old ones if you must.
