uninspirational piece of crap

I had mediocre expectations for this movie. However, when the movie
started it was a lot worse than my expectations. Even my dog can make a
better movie than this. Storyline, acting, SFX, the 'jokes' all are below accaptable level for
a movie that got released in 2017. My advice: don't waste your time with this movie.
