Meh. A pretty boring and average movie.

The beginning was pretty interesting to me. But honestly, I expected
more from this movie, more from Disney. So like I said, the beginning was pretty OK. But to me it just got more
boring the more you watch it. Even the ending 'action' scene was pretty
boring. I fell asleep 1/4 of the way into the movie, and I woke up on a
scene kind of towards the middle. So it's pretty easy to say that the
movie wasn't that good and it was too boring pretty much from the
start.But my opinion might be because I like watching movies that are for
older audiences, and Disney is just getting too old for me, but
honestly, this movie isn't really that good in my opinion.I'd give it a 5 out of 10 because Disney didn't make this movie
interesting enough for some older audiences to enjoy.
