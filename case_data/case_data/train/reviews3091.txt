Meh... Fast and Furious in Space. *FAMILY*

What's Hollywood's obsession with family these days? Wonder if it has
to do the the growing culture of nepotism elsewhere. Regardless, a
script cannot rely on simply yelling "FAMILY" as the motivation for
EVERYTHING. And this movie works that clich√© to DEATH. *LITERALLY*Not worth a 1/10, more like a 6 plus (which I'll adjust when they stop
manipulating the ratings. Forgettable at best, and you know the story
is crap when all you can remember is CGI baby Groot. Suffers terribly
from Bond villain syndrome, in that villains needs too much exposition
(AKA weird and unexplained motivations).Actual line in the movie, after one character tries to murder another,
"You needed to win, I just wanted a *RELATIVE*." *slow claps* that
TOTALLY explains attempted murder. Did I mention there's attempted
genocide too?! For reasons that only Gunn will know.
