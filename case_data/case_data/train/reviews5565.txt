Mostly Unfunny, unredeemingly ugly, and a bit boring really.

I really enjoy Amy's TV show and was expecting big things from this
movie but ended up feeling I'd wasted my time watching it and it's off
delivery leave a bad taste in the mouth. Was it that Amy just wasn't up
to a feature length film or was it Judd Apatow's direction that made
this not work. Where Amy's mischievous bad taste gender stereotype
flipping gags work on her show, here they were missing the knowing nod.
Amy fitted her self centered character's skin too well and at feature
length you started to believe this was a real person and someone you
wouldn't want to spend time with, even in a movie. Schummer was too
ugly, and I don't mean that in a physical sense. Hader was good, as
were most of the actors, apart from the product placement sports stars.
It really started to drag in the last 3rd, possibly because it had
nowhere to go, which is exactly where it ended up.
