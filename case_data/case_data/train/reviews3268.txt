Superb In Every Way!

Days of Future Past continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. I have
to classify it as a work of art/comic book pulp fiction. The
characters, effects, and story are outstanding. Everything in this
movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then even the first two films
and First Class. Like X2, the acting is superb and the dialogue is
rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every
side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones
who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and
bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its
predecessor X3 in every way. It restores the sense of epic adventure
and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of
most alleged blockbusters.This film is far more sophisticated and has a better story than any
X-Men movie to date. Here, the characters previously introduced but
under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the
newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story.
The music is very good as is the special effects. The budget clearly
hit the screen fully and there are truly some amazing sequences to
behold. The cast-selection is still perfect.Overall, this is one of the best genre films of all-time.
