A perfect recipe for a terrible movie

I just watched this movie earlier, and I did go into the movie screen
expecting not a lot as I hated the first one.*NON-SPOILER* The first thing I noticed in the movie was the terrible
CGI, that stuck out like a sore thumb among the background. And the
next thing I noticed was the mediocre acting, worsened by the dozens of
cheesy, humorless and cheesy one-liners throughout the movie.*SPOILER* The story was downright predictable also, as it ended as most
generic action/adventure movies ended, the bad guy releasing they had
done bad and the main character killing the main baddie.*NON-SPOILER* The only good thing in this movie I could think about was
the locations the characters found themselves in. The locations ranged
from cities, to woods to the middle of the ocean.The main character, Percy Jackson is supposed to be the half-blood son
of Poseidon (a water god) and barely uses water AT ALL throughout the
movie to his advantage. *SPOILER* And an even particularly silly scene
where they are about to be swallowed by a large water monster thing,
the water powers Percy has don't actually 'work'.All in all, this movie is a complete waste of money, complete with
cheesy one-liners, boring story, tedious acting and just an all-over
negative viewing experience.3/10
