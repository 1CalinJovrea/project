Very disappointing...

I was so amped for Mad Max after seeing the average review was high...
WTF? Is it mob mentality or is it crafty advertising because this movie
was not good... No character arcs except for Nux and his was so
contrived and abrupt that it shouldn't count... the basic story was
very lame... the plot was goofy... all the 2D character villains with
their bizarre mutations (the hovering baby-man? This movie had shades
of Total Recall)... 12 year old boys should like this movie ... When
Furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that
was very poorly done... I wanted to scoff out loud but I didn't because
I was in a theater... but I'm sure many there would have appreciated
it... I see in the user review section that there are a significant
number of equally bad reviews... thank you to those intelligent members
of the IMDb community for the support... so I don't think I'm insane as
Mad Max too for not liking a popular movie... I'll investigate the user
reviews here more closely next time so I don't get burned again... I
still hope to see some awesome Furiosa cosplayers in the future so that
adds a few stars.
