awful adaption of the book

=spoiler-I just came back from watching this at the cinema. I only read the book
two weeks ago after seeing the trailer and was so hooked went and got
the second book. Well this film does the book no justice. Half the
characters are missing and the main characters in the book do not have
the same characteristics. I found it completely different. Its almost
like they re-wrote the whole book (a very sub-standard version). I
almost left half way through the movies but stayed just to see it
through. The end of the movie. I'm sorry, but it was completely awful. I don't know how they could even make the sequel as half the main
characters aren't even there.Ridiculous.Rant over
