I loved it!

I just loved this movie. Its billed as a comedy and I did laugh out
loud frequently but it is also a touching drama of relationship and
illness and the quintessential American story of the immigrant family's
son and the white bread girlfriend. It had a very sweet touch, mixing
the comedy and drama. Ray Romano was fantastic as the father of the
girlfriend and I also really liked the girl, Zoe Kazan. Sorry, this
isn't much of a review except to say that it was really very good!
