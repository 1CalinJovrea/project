Seriously... Another One?

After the dreadful predecessor that was 'On Stranger Tides', I entered
the cinema with rather poor expectations... how I left with even lower
enjoyment is beyond me.Perhaps it's the fact that a theme park ride can't sustain a story for
an entire film franchise? Maybe it's the fact that I've seen this story
before in four other films? Perhaps the lack of character development
and me not giving a damn about any of the new characters? Or maybe it's
just because it's an orgy of CGI madness? Who knows? Either way, this
film is a complete over-the-top mess. Watchable? Yes. Enjoyable? Hell
no!I admit that 'Dead Man's Chest' and 'At World's End' weren't
"fantastic" movies, but they rounded off a rather enjoyable trilogy,
especially following the ultimately brilliant first film. But the two
sequels' success should not have been an excuse for a fourth and now a
fifth film, with each film the reception lowers and the standards and
eagerness for the next further lowers. However, Disney as the
opportunistic blighters they are, take their box office success with
stride and look to creating the next underwhelming, money-making
sequel. This time it's in the form of 'Dead Men Tell No Tales'.The overuse of jokes we've heard on several previous occasions, the
fact that the beloved Jack Sparrow is now becoming a character we look
at in contempt because he's worn out, much like the franchise. Scraping
the bottom of the barrel, milking upon its previous success... both
terms that can be applied suitably to this movie (if that's what I can
call it). And do you know what the worst part is? This film will make
its money back, it'll double, triple, quadruple its budget in box
office returns, thus giving the producers a reason to create
yet-another dull sequel.All-in-all, I actually think I had an aneurysm whilst watching this
film...
