A terrible film

This is a slasher flick disguised as an art-house horror movie with
some clunky dialogue in Act 1 and some gestures towards emotional
complexity of the characters. What's the easiest way to do that? One
dead child, one gay couple, one failed business. Bingo, there you have
it. The other thing that pisses me off is the minimum ten line length
for reviews. IMDb, why would you do that? Why would I waste my breath
writing really long reviews for shitty movies? Are you trying to
encourage the watching of bad films, because people who dislike the
movie don't want to spend time and effort reviewing it? Well, you can't
stop me because not only was this movie awful, it was pretentiously
awful, and I would like to extend my hand to other potential viewers
and tell them: stop. it looks like chocolate, but it isn't.
