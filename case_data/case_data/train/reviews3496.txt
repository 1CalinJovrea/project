Brilliant! Great thriller

The Invitation is by far the most suspenseful and creepy movie I have
seen in a long time. From the very beginning I was pulled into the
story and the characters, couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I can't
say enough about the actors, they made the characters come alive and
you felt something for each of them and their situations. Tammy
Blanchard was superb as Eden, the goddess of her own home. Michiel
Huisman, as her new man, delivered a fantastic performance as he
carefully balanced that line between good and evil. And Logan
Marshall-Green made me feel his grief, even before I knew what he was
grieving about. The rest of the cast is equally as good. Some of the
best moments are between Huisman and Marshall-Green, like two alpha
males posturing for the upper hand.This movie really makes you feel uncomfortable with its awkward dinner
dialogue and questionable party games. Its a slow burn, but not as slow
as I was expecting as the dinner party antics keep you engaged. I loved
the pace - I could feel my tension grow and subside along with the
scenes. The ending is superb and thankfully not too drawn out. This is
one where you say "hold on tight and enjoy the ride".Kudos to Karyn Kusama for giving us this gem that I might just break
out at say, a dinner party?!
