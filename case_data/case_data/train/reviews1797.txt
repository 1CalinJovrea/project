Excellent sequel with a touching message

Summary: Bellas Barden made an huge opening mistake that cost them
their reputation as professional Capella group. In order to regain
their status as a group and friend they need to win World Championship
of Acapella.In my opinion, I loved 100% this sequel due the excellent choices of
songs, hilarious scenes, goosebumps reaction of the final performance
that actually made me cried because I felt what they felt of the fear
of the tomorrow after graduation. Loved the voice of Emily Junk wow
speechless. The song Flashlight wow, i cried a lot, beautiful cover
song by Anna Kendrick. For me, I believe they need to leave this sequel
as the final closure of Pitch Pecfect. I recommend it without a 2nd
thought.
