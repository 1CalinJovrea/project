Tra-La-Loved!

One of the least boring movies I've ever seen. With the un-cynical
bigness of Jimmy Neutron & the meta tone of Rocky & Bullwinkle, it's a
wonderfully buoyant big 'C' Cartoon about childish friendship &
creativity. It relishes in joy & silliness, & even its gross-out humor
feels sincere (it DOES have the word "Underpants" in the title). It has
focused stakes, fantastically cartoony animation, LOL humor, & a strong
(if predictable) message about the balance between fun &
responsibility. Very few skid marks here.
