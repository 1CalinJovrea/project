Surprised that this film is great indeed for kids and adults too.

Hotel Transylvania 2 is a 2015 American 3D computer animated
fantasy-comedy film. The film is the sequel to the 2012 film Hotel
Transylvania.Hotel Transylvania 2 takes place seven years after the first film, with
the hotel now open to human guests. Mavis and Johnny have a young son
named Dennis, whose lack of any vampire abilities worries his
grandfather Dracula. When Mavis and Johnny go on a visit to Johnny's
parents, Dracula calls his friends to help him make Dennis a vampire.
However, an unexpected visit from Dracula's old-school human-hating
dad, Vlad soon turns things upside-down.As an adult,I quite enjoyed watching this excellent movie. If you are
looking for real Comedy/Adventure movie with perfect action from start
to finish,then you should see this masterpiece movie.
