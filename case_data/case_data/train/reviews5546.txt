Not as advertised

Hello fellow movie lovers. This review contains spoilers.The trailers I saw for this movie made me believe it was going to focus
on Hercules and his legendary battles with monsters from his labors.However, they quickly gloss over those monsters in the first few
minutes, then say "this is the story of the real Hercules," and the
movie doesn't contain any Gods, magic, mythological beasts, or demi
gods. Instead, the movie says there was only a man, a mercenary, who
happen to have people spread myths and legends. That he also was never
alone, but pretty much always had the backing of his friends in battle.As a huge fan of Greek mythology, I went to the theatre expecting what
the trailer advertised, and was hijinxed by another "Brothers Grimm"
that didn't even make up for it by adding some magic later, but left
one wanting... The story was way too easy to call as well. I'd love to
have seen another "Brothers Grimm" after seeing its value upon
rewatching, but if they make a sequel to this Hercules, I think I'll
pull an Autolycus, only I won't be returning.Only surprise to me, was them chaining up the "animal" at night because
he suffers PTSD, then having him unchained at night in another scene
helping Hercules with his "ptsd." Pretty sure they just missed the
error but it still made no sense.All in all, I gave it a 4/10 because it was watchable and had some nice
action. The advertising for this movie lost it a few points alone since
it wasn't what was advertised, the acting was OK but who in their right
mind would ever have cast the baker who moved to Germany in "How I Met
Your Mother" as a fighter...also her scenes seemed like they just
wanted to add a Legolas character as well as a female to the ensemble
of characters. I love Atalanta, but wow what a waste of her myth.
