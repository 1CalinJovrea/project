Best Unexpected Comedy Horror Thriller

I thought this was going to be one of those awful movies you cringe at
because of the terrible cheesiness and awful directing. It was quite
the opposite. The lighting was playful and dramatic, the directing/camera was on
point, the pop up text was as good as Scott Pilgrim, and the acting was
terrific. The story left the audience with plenty of ah ha moments that
didn't take themselves too seriously, but walked the delicate balance
of humor and thriller. Samara Weaving was perfect for this role, it's too bad Netflix didn't
put her on the cover. She's the quintessential dream girl for all boys. I'm glad films like this get made. It's film's like this that allow the
rest of the independent film world to keep on doing their thing and
maybe get a nice sized budget like this one.
