Forgettable ...

This is a very slick found footage horror film, featuring a group of
young locals who agree to lead Professor Scarlett Marlow (Perdita
Weeks) through the catacombs underneath Paris to find the legendary
Philosopher's stone. As is only right and proper in situations like
this, there is nothing but grisly trouble for these entrepreneurs. It's
difficult to pinpoint exactly why this film fails for me. I'm generally
a fan of the found footage genre and feel that, if used skilfully, it
is still a terrific, intimate way of telling a story. But, while the locations are excellent and the cast are capable
(especially Weeks, who avoids allowing her character to becoming the
headstrong know-all, as written), there's nothing particularly scary,
or unfamiliar here.Soon after the ensemble enter the catacombs, any individuality they
initially had evaporates and they all become a mass of screaming,
bloody noise blurrily picked out by the ever-shaking camera. After a
while of this, it is all too easy to lose track of who is who and just
what is going on. The last thing this jumble manages to be is
frightening.
