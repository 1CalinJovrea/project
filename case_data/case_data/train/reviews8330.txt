Not as advertised

Is it possible to "un-see" a movie? I wish I could erase the last
couple of hours from my memory. Have you sat through the first fifty
minutes and are hoping it's going to get better? It's not. You're at 1
hour 20 and still hoping? Give up. This is not Tarantino. It's not
building up to something monumental. It's just awful, soulless. Bleuh.
