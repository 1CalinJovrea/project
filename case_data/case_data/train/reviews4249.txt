Enjoyed this because I loved the book

I am a 63 year old female so my tastes differ from those of the younger
demographic. I enjoyed this movie, I think it follows the book fairly
closely. Read the book a while ago, so I don't remember exactly.
Michelle Williams was good considering she mostly had to stand around
looking scared, great English accent. Kristin Scott was icy and
imperious. Maybe a bit over the top.Very authentic. Good costumes, sets, location. Yes this movie had a soap opera feel, that was the type of story it
told.The tragic thing is that the author Irene Nemirovsky was betrayed by
her countrymen to the Nazis and died in a German concentration camp.
Her daughter found the manuscript in her belongings many decades later.
So the novel was written during the time of the Second World War, it's
more authentic than novels written decades after.
