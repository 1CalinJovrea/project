Great Atmosphere, Great Sound, Different Kind of Movie

I found "The Witch" to be a generally unnerving film, and one
which--though I would not place it in the pantheon of scariest flicks
I've ever seen--had some moments that I'll not easily forget.The atmosphere Eggers creates alone is enough to wrench serious dread
from scenes other directors would be otherwise unable to make even
remarkable. The score, too, helps cull this dark tone and adds life to
a film that can be borderline tedious.That being said, "The Witch" is not for everyone. It is strange, slow
but steady, gruesome at points, and almost un-watchable at others.
There are two sides to this film; one which I had hoped the director
would stick to concerning the family and their struggle with religion
and isolation; and another which plays as an undercurrent to most of
the film and then takes charge in the end. Sadly, it is this second
side which keeps me from giving the film a better score, and that
ultimately hurts the film in the very final scene.Overall, I enjoyed "The Witch" and its originality. Eggers has achieved
a film that, for all its low-budget and independent film background,
feels richer and better made than many horror entries of late. Should
you decide to see it, a word of caution: do not expect a fast-paced
movie full of jump scares and creepy crawlies emerging left and right.
As the opening credits remind the audience, this is a folktale. One
that does not shy away from exploring the real dark places.
