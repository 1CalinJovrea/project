Nihilistic and tiresome

I think this might just be one of those high-concept movies that works
better as an idea than as an actual film. I've been following Ilya
Naishullers work as the frontman of Biting Elbows for quite some time
now and I was really impressed with those first person shooter style
music videos he made with GoPro cameras for two songs of the band. I
had my reservations when I first heard that he will attempt to turn it
into a movie and in retrospect I think I was right. These POV movies
never really work out as feature length movies and this one is no
exception. It just gets frustrating after a certain time that the whole
thing resembles more a video game than a movie. It lacks the
interactivity of the former and the intimacy of the later. We do indeed
have the POV of Henry but we can not identify with him because there is
no character development or conflict to this character at all. It is
just cold and alienating. It also does not help that the movie uses
violence as in a rather nihilistic and senseless way. All that is left
are nice camera tricks and some genuinely amazing stunt work. But those
two things can not sustain a complete movie. This is a typical case of
style over substance. Nice to look at but ultimately empty.
