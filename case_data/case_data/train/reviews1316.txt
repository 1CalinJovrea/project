Impossible to fault

I'm widely known for enjoying French cinema, however I believe this is
the first Spanish film I have ever seen. I'm glad to confirm that it
will not be my last, because this movie was incredible. It was the type
of film that I like more than any other type. A mystery thriller that
is guaranteed to have a twist. It's also a type of movie that Americans
don't do overly well. They always seem to think that a movie needs
endless car chases and shoot-outs and that the story should just be
there to facilitate those. The Europeans seem to understand that the
true brilliance in cinema comes from the writing side of things. The
intricate webs they weave never cease to astound me.It's always a little hard to judge acting in a subtitled film, but I'm
pretty confident in saying the acting in this film was superb. The
entire cast found a perfect balance of charisma and mysteriousness to
surround their character. The story is crafted exquisitely and has a
lot of rewatchability factor. In fact it's almost a must to watch it
again, knowing what you now know. I love films that do that.It's very hard to find any negatives with this film. In fact I've just
spent 5 minutes trying to come up with some and failed. That should
indicate just how good this movie is. I hope films like this never stop
being made because they are an absolute delight to watch.
