Old, but not obsolete

The story starts a bit confusing, but after a short time it's back to
business. It's a great addition to the series and it's nice to see
Arnold back in this role. The special effects are not always the best,
but most parts look great. The new type terminator is great, but the
old T800 is still not obsolete. The story is convincing enough and can
be the prelude of new additions to this series. I hope Arnold will be
part of these. It's a pity 3D is still the norm in most cinemas. This
movie is best viewed in normal 2D. It's dark en there are no special
benefits in 3D. The movie gives also a good critical note about our
dependency of our smart-phones, tablets and the Internet integration.
Genisys might be more true that we realize ;)
