Terrible movie if you haven't seen the others.

Growing up, I was never interested in watching raunchy comedies and R
rated movies. As I grew older however, they became more and more
interesting to me. I am here to review this movie as nobody else can,
seeing as how everyone I talked to has seen at least one other American
Pie movie. This is a terribly done movie ONLY if you have not seen any
of the others. Sitting through this I was bored to tears and hardly
laughing at all. I am told that this is because I haven't seen the
others and didn't understand the jokes since they all reference
previous incidents. The first time the gang was together on screen, I
thought that Stiffler was the antagonist, trying to tear everyone
apart. In order for a movie to work, I think that you shouldn't have to
see the other movies in a series in order to understand the current
one. I think that they should all be original and introduce characters
in their own way instead of relying on the audience to automatically
understand them. That being said, everyone else I have talked to said
it was just as good as the original, so if you have seen the other
American Pies, go see this movie. If you are a "Pie Virgin" like
myself, stay away.
