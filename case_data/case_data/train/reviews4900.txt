How to make a NOT funny movie

The premise looks funny. The trailer is mildly amusing. The final
product is lame. Unfortunately, the funniest parts are all in the
trailer, so after about 30 minutes it just felt like I was sitting
around waiting for the next scene I had already seen in the preview.Some of the scenes seemed like first takes. I felt like I was watching
DVD extras. I highly doubt they had a completed script. It felt like
they were winging it half the time, which basically means Seth Rogen
playing Seth Rogen, which was old ten years ago.Skip this and go find yourself a midnight screening of Revenge of the
Nerds.
