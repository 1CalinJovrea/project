Karl Urban IS Dredd.

I've been a Dredd fan for thirty years now, but I'm not about to give
this movie adaptation of my favourite comic character a ridiculously
high rating purely from some misguided sense of loyalty. Instead, I'm
going to give it a deservingly high score because, quite simply, it is
a very good film, one that successfully captures the essence of the
2000AD strip, delivering brutal action by the bucket-load, excellent
central performances, and inspired direction, all enhanced by
breathtaking state-of-the-art 3D special effects.After the debacle that was Stallone's Judge Dredd (1995), the makers of
this movie have clearly made their prime directive to please hardcore
Dredd fans, and it shows: the screenplay, by Alex Garland, remains very
faithful to the spirit of the comic, and in Karl Urban, we now have the
perfect DreddÂ—all raspy voice and humourless grimace, it looks as
though the character has jumped straight onto the screen from the pages
of 2000AD (helmet intact). Similarly, it would be hard to imagine
anyone more suitable than Olivia Thirlby as rookie Psi-Judge Anderson
(and believe me, I've tried!).Is Dredd 3D my 'ideal' Dredd movie? Not quite... made for a
comparatively meagre budget of $45million, it would be hard pushed to
live up to my impossibly high expectations (just realising the
Mega-City One of my dreams would require way more money than it cost to
make this entire film). That said, it is definitely a massive step in
the right direction, and if it is the financial success that it
genuinely deserves to be, who knows what treats await us in the future:
The Cursed Earth, Judge Cal, Judge Death, The Apocalypse War.... I'm
salivating like a Klegg just thinking about it.
