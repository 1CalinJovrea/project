It's like Portal, but without the portal gun.

Doesn't have much of a plot. The protagonist's backstory is filled in
throughout the movie, but it's basic, nothing exciting. There are no
twists or big reveals. You learn early on that story centers around a
modern semi-dystopian narrative. Most of the time the film drags with
its repetitiveness. Frank is stuck in a room, accompanied by a computer
by way of a security camera. That's it. The ending was anti- climatic
for me and predictable. If you are bored and have nothing else to
watch, this will kill 103 minutes of your time. If you skip this film,
you won't miss anything either.
