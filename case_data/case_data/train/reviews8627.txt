Very Underrated

Even know this movie might not seem amazing to most people now, I can
guarantee that in about a decade or even less, the movie will gain a
following and it will be big! Absolutely great! We need more movies not
based on any books, comics, movies, games, anything, just original
ideas is what we need! This is a fantastic film! There are a few flaws
in it though, but I do not want to spoil the film. Ryan Reynolds gives
a very good performance in the movie, Ben Kingsley also does, everyone
gives a good performance except whoever played the mom. Just wait,
there will be a following for this film, there will be t-shirts and
merch for this movie years from now when more people are seeing it, it
should not have been released in Summer, where it is going to get
killed, should have came out in September or October.
