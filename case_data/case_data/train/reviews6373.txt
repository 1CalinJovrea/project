The "why" movie

I went to see this movie with friends the first night it was out just
by pure chance without too much prior research. Earlier I saw a trailer
and figured it would be quite good. Well, there was a plot twist.The only thing that was good about this movie was the blank looks on
people's faces when the movie ended and the lights were turned on. It
was that moment that actually made me feel like we're all united and
human in the end. THAT was a good moment, the rest of it was just
painful.Leaving the theatre people were sharing their feelings about the movie.
I don't think it's allowed to post that kind of language here. You get
the idea though.It was one of those movies that make you want to ask for a refund
because you feel like somebody ripped you off. It was one of the worst
investments time and money wise I've made in the recent past.To explain my review title: why, just why did somebody decide it would
be a good idea to make something this pointless and empty? Also, why
did I fall for the trailer and thought it would be a good movie?
