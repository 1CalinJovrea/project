Not a typical date night movie, but still a good date movie. Much better than any Katherine Heigl rom-com.

"If it's too simple you've got no reason to try and if you've got no
reason to try you don't." Wallace (Radcliffe) has just come out of a
relationship and is forced to go to a party with his best friend and
roommate. When he is there he meets his roommate's cousin Chantry
(Kazan) and the two immediately hit it off. At the end of the night
Chantry gives him her number and then rushes in to see her boyfriend.
Wallace decides to stay "just friends" with her but that doesn't really
go has planned. I am not a huge fan of romantic comedies. I will admit
that some are funny and aren't terrible to watch but for the most part
they are just generic and full of fluff. Those movies are needed but
they just aren't for me. This one is one of the rare exceptions where a
romantic comedy actually contains something more than just surface
feelings. This one feels more real and isn't the typical boy meets girl
and they live happily ever after formula. This movie is more along the
lines of 500 Days Of Summer, Spectacular Now or Gigantic. This is one
of the few romantic comedies that I can recommend. Overall, not a
typical date night movie, but still a good date movie. Much better than
any Katherine Heigl rom-com. I give this a B.
