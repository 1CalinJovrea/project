Uninspired and less exciting than the first, "Taken 2" is a barely passable sequel

Liam Neeson's action-man renaissance in 2008's "Taken" was a most
unheralded critical and box-office hit for a seemingly generic revenge
flick. Writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen managed to captivate
audiences with a streamlined story of a retired CIA operative using his
skills to locate and rescue his kidnapped daughter. It was a simple
concept in that it utilized family bonds as motivation, but it was made
exciting through a mixture of intriguing resourcefulness and crafty
violence. Everything about the story of "Taken" was so concrete, that there
didn't seem like any obvious direction for a sequel, but a gross of
$226.8 million on a $25-million budget talks, and so we have "Taken 2,"
but what Besson and Kamen have come up with this time fails to measure
up to the original in almost every way.This shouldn't surprise anyone considering, again, no justification
existed in the original story for a sequel. Kim (Maggie Grace) couldn't
just get taken again, and part of the intrigue was Mills (Neeson)
having to find her despite being hours behind her captors with no idea
of where they might take her. In "Taken 2," it's not as complicated and
the stakes don't feel nearly as high.Simply, the Albanians that Mills killed en route to finding his
daughter want revenge, so they track him to one of his private security
jobs in Istanbul. As it happens, Kim and her mother, Lenore (Famke
Janssen), decide to surprise him by flying to meet him there, though to
be fair it's not that obnoxious of a coincidence, as Mills had invited
them to come after hearing Lenore's current husband had canceled their
family trip to China.During their first full day together in Istanbul, Kim gets the idea to
let Bryan and Lenore have some alone time in hopes of rekindling their
relationship, but when they go into town they are followed by the
Albanians, and despite Mills' best efforts, he and Lenore are taken.The entire setup here is forced  really forced. It feels as though
every single plot point or detail exists solely to create circumstances
in which our main characters can get kidnapped, with ample occurrences
both inconvenient and convenient to allow for problems and general
suspense while also providing enough room for a solution.We already know what Mills is willing to do for his family, so his
motivation is identical to the first film, plus we know he's too
skilled to stay kidnapped for long. What's required to compensate for
not raising the stakes in terms of both motivation and danger is
substantially more creativity, and that's where Besson and Kamen really
come up dry.There's one scene early on (as in once the film gets going early on) in
which Mills uses Kim to help pinpoint his location in the city,
instructing her to set off grenades so he can figure out how far away
she is by how long it takes for him to hear the blast. It's just a
tease that the film might reach its predecessor's level, however, as
the ingenuity never gets any more exciting than that.Director Olivier Megaton, a frequent Besson collaborator, takes over
for Pierre Morel, and does nothing to help nor hurt the picture. His
style is a bit more frenetic as he heavily edits the action sequences
to the point where you don't get more than a second and a half at any
one camera angle, but that's not a problem so much as the film's
failure through and through to prevent the audience's indifference to
what's going on. We were given plenty of reason to doubt Mills' success
in"Taken," but this time around we haven't a shred. There's a moment in
which we think something might take a surprisingly darker turn, but
it's over in a flash.The script also attempts to be a bit more theme-driven than the first
film, whether just because or in effort to compensate for its
pointlessness. The father of one of the Albanians Mills killed (the
infamous Marco from Tripoja), the "main bad guy" played by Rade
Serbedzija, has a few conversations with Mills about taking the lives
of family members and when revenge is or isn't justified. It's
legitimate notion, but a bit out of place; we're asked to consider the
feelings of the random European thugs who we normally see as killing
fodder for our action movies. We don't care if you're someone's son 
you're a tattooed meathead who deserves to be offed if for nothing but
our amusement."Taken 2″ isn't offensively bad, just uninspired and unable to make the
case for its existence. At 91 minutes, it's a harmless exercise in
generic action filmmaking aimed at placating the folks who clamored to
see more of one man's particular set of skills, even if they're the
exact same skills applied in a less-than-spectacular manner.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com
