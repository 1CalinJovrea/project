Worth watching

This film is worth watching, it is very gripping and suspenseful. There
isn't much dialouge at all, it is mostly just atmospheric. The plot is
relatively simple, a chain of people killing others who are then linked
to someone else. The ending is left open to your imagination too. There
are some really gruesome scenes in this movie but this sort of thing
was needed to keep the viewer gripped on the way the story was
unfolding. Ryan Gosling was a very mysterious character again (as in
Drive) and he portrayed this very well. The supporting cast were also
good.Overall I found this film to be quite good, was a relatively short film
but I didn't feel it was 'dragging' like some said. I preferred 'Drive'
but this one is still worth a watch. 7/10
