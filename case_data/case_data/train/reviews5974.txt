The Lego Movie is a unique and very refreshing animated film!

The Lego Movie is a winner on several levels. There is a good amount of
clever gags and I was constantly bursting with laughter. I was
surprised by how it contained so many memorable cameos, pop icons and
film references, providing a strong nostalgia factor to older viewers.
The playful approach towards movie clich√©s made it a really enjoyable
and refreshing watch. The animation is absolutely stunning and the
blend of CGI with stop motion worked brilliantly. Everything can be
attachable, making the vibe of each scenario feel very unique and
unlike anything you've ever seen. The Lego Movie has plenty of heart
too by the end of the journey and it's going to be really tough for
another animated film to surpass its inventiveness and charm.
