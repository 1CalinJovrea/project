Unique and darkly funny

Two movies for the price of one. That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked,
but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard "did
he or didn't he" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the
perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're
watching  perhaps  the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen. Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together
extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to
inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's
Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying,
hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all
at the same time.David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and
several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his
brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint
would be over the length  it really didn't need to be two and a
quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in
the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to
the point just a little more quickly.Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such
largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all
(with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially
those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.
