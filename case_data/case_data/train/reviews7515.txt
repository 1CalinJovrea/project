Spellbinding

Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian
director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding
and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame
and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron
Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller,
bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses
serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast
doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano,
Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is
not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next
year's Oscars.
