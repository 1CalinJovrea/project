poor movie, poor acting, poor story, don't waste your time

The movie was poor, I was expecting a real rag to riches story and the
films to portray the troubles of easy e, as he made nma.Instead it hown
him to be a money grabber, when in fact that was dr dre and ice cube.The movie is a typical " lets make black people cool" movie, gloryfying
mindless violence, over the top swearing, and thuggery, its not cool,
its not big and its not clever.It really is a poor portrayal of what could have been a half decent
movie, It if would have employed decent actors, stuck to a real life
story and made the characters more likable then it might have made it
but it was just another " lets glorify black men as being cool thugs"
movie. Boring, over rated, tedious, and had every stereotype under the
sun to go with it. who ever rates this movie above a 1 is either a
mindless teenager or someone who knows absolutely nothing about movies.
