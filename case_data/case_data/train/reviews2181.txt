Powerful storytelling and splendid performances presented in a brilliant 3D

With his latest movie, "Life of Pi", Ang Lee further establishes
himself as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors. Starting
from his Taiwanese beginnings, and his highly enjoyable,
family-harmonizing "Father Knows Best" trilogy (1992-1994), through his
Academy Award winning works on gracefully choreographed, highly
spiritualized Far East martial arts tour de force "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon" (2000, best foreign-language film) and on an uncommon
yet nostalgic portrayal of the Old West in "Brokeback Mountain" (2005,
best director), to his other titles like "Sense and Sensibility"
(1995), "The Ice Storm" (1997), and "Lust, Caution" (2007), quality and
Kubrick-like versatility shown in his movies offer continuous
attraction for wide audience of his admirers.Lee's latest and, so far, easily, greatest movie, "Life of Pi" is based
on a screenplay adapted from the acclaimed fictional adventure novel
written by Canadian author Yann Martel.Throughout his childhood, due to matching pronunciation of French word
"piscine" (pool, swimming pool) and English word "pissing", Piscine
Molitor Patel, named that way after later abandoned Parisian swimming
pool, so predictably suffers from being nicknamed "Pissing Patel". In
order to avoid it, once in high school he finally shortens his name to
Pi Patel... Nowadays middle-aged Pi tells the story of his life to a
visiting writer, apparently a book author Yan Martel's alter ego, who
is seeking for the literal inspiration. Retrospectively, Pi divides his
childhood and adolescence into three segments. In the first segment he
gives shorter account of his life until the age of 16, describing his
interaction with his family and schoolmates, in particular his
relationship with his father and a girlfriend, concentrating on his
exploits of God and spirituality, meandering between multitude of
religious practices while in the last one he briefs about his
testimonial given to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport,
investigating the reasons why the ship his family was relocating on
from India to Canada sank. Most detailed, and therefore the longest, is
recollection of his 227 days in a lifeboat, an extraordinary ordeal he
went through after the ship has capsized and everybody else, crew and
passengers, died Well, everybody human, but not everybody living. Namely, a number of
terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo, offered for
sale and brought along with other family belongings, have survived,
too. But, not for long, because, while confined in the most limited
space as they were, surrounded by vastness of the ocean, the law of the
"survival of the fittest" prevails, takes its tall, and pretty soon Pi
finds himself in a company of a single one topping the food-chain, a
Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker. Not to reveal the story further, it is with greatest pleasure to inform
that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories: in
an engaging talewhether allegory or depiction of realistic, believable
events, filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity, imagination
and his often reasonably unanswered doubts, encouraging the same in
viewersof an uncommon character, indeed, brought to on-screen life by
outstanding performances from two contributing leads, remarkably
presented via ubiquitous, yet inconspicuous animation, exceptional, CGI
aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography, all along
complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly
together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard
Parker, complex yet basic, difficult yet simple, initially charged with
Pi's dreadful fear, swiftly shifting to respectful care, instantly
boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving
his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and
maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive
survival techniques 16-year old Pi usesamply benefiting from his
instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son, certainly well
acquainted with animal psychologyto suppress the fear and convincingly
impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate "killing
machines" among mammals, desperately striving for his own survival,
nevertheless, generously, for survival of his seemingly sufficiently
tamed companion, but still, initially and ultimately, magnificent
adversary, Richard Parker, as well."Life of Pi" is, certainly, one of the most impressive movies of 2012,
year that has just come to a close.
