Best Spider-Man Yet

This is the best Spider-Man yet.This Spider-Man film was the closes to
the comics.The characters were really close to the comics.Why?Andrew
did better in both Peter and Spider-Man.Proof!Andrew did better as Peter: Andrew's Peter looked more to the comics
and plus he created that "cuotion" that turned Connors into Lizard.He﻿
also created the Web- Shooters meaning he used his brain to create
them.Andrew created the silk trap which was his idea as a design of a
trap and hey it's sorta smart.Andrew found out that problem in "Oscorp"
that got the 3 legged mice to grow back their feet even though it was
nerdy as well.My point is Andrew did better.Andrew did better as Spider-Man: He has Web-Shooters.Spider-Man
actually messed around in the movie like he's supposed to and
Spider-Man was also way more agile and powerful on this one.This is
proof since in the movie Peter Parker found out that Dr.Connors(The
Lizard),was going to turn everyone into over-mutated- lizards,so Peter
put on his Spider-Man suit and went to swing into action.Yet,he got
shot but re-fought and it let into him swinging in the scene "The Crane
Swing" where Spider-Man shows his great agility in swinging.Results: Real Spider-Man fans look at small details which leads to The
Amazing Spider-Man being better but only the characters and acting were
completed right in Amazing Spider-Man and also the beginning,but The
Spider-Man also did awesome in plot,so I don't think one goes to choose
but appreciate what was done.Other:In my personal opinion,Amazing Spider-Man had the characters cast
perfectly and the story started of the way it's supposed to.If you are
a huge Spider-Man fan.Watch this great movie now.I also like The
Amazing Spider-Man suit better.This movie deserves 10.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(10/10)
