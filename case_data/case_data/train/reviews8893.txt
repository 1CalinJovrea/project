One of the most pointless and degrading movies this year

People say this movie is like the old Sandler movies, but it's not even
close. It was awful and full of retarded humor, that was cringy. The plot didn't have any progression, and there weren't any lessons to
be learned from this movie. I get that it's a comedy but it still has
to have a good plot, like "Nature Calls" for example. Every character in this movie was degrading and portrayed as a loser, I
would not want my kids to learn their actions.Overall if you want to watch something that is mindless, stupid, and
cringy then watch it, but for people who don't like fart jokes, stay
away from it like fire.
