i thought it was really great

I'm tired of people friken saying the movie is bad, i thought it was
really good, one of the best movies this year actually, and i don't
care if people judge me, going to the movie i expected something bad,
but the i got the idea out my mind and really enjoyed it, the media is
a bitch, sorry for my language but it is, you cant let some you tube
video or some famous person tell u when something is bad, that's the
mistake i made, but i learned, make your own decisions people, don't
rely on others to make em for u, stop being misled so easily, u don't
haft to agree with other people, its not going to help u get popular,
that's why were all becoming dumber, anyway i thought it was good, also
its towards kids so if your under like 16 u have a bigger chance of
liking it, so most of the people who said its bad either were misled by
videos or are over 16, so yeah, make your own choices people, and this
was mine.
