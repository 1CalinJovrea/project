Movie Had Potential, but Unnecessary Garbage Ruined It

This movie could have been cute and sweet, but there were so many
unnecessary attempts to attract the teen crowd -- at least I'm guessing
that's the age group targeted. Children using foul language is not
"cute" or humorous. Seeing animals copulating added no value to the
story line, nor did the focus on the masturbating 15-year old. And what
kind of mother buys her son a porn magazine because she "violated" her
son's "privacy" by looking under his bed and tearing up a pin-up
poster? The story had many sweet moments. Too bad Hollywood couldn't be content
with that.
