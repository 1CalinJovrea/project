WOW!  What an Amazing Movie

Rarely do I find myself so moved by a movie. So I was pleasantly
surprised. This movie offered a lot for adults that enjoy great acting,
amazing cinematography, and scripts that make us think about what it
means to live, love, fear, and overcome the seemingly impossible. I
found myself mesmerized by the chemistry between the two main
characters and how they experienced different feelings while being
present in the exact same circumstance. It's an incredibly compelling
story. I don't think a love story of this kind has ever been made. As
far as the bad reviews go, I'm convinced that most of the people
writing bad reviews and giving low ratings, NEVER saw the movie and
have an agenda. Do you remember how people reacted to the infamous
interracial Cheerios commercial? Well the same thing is happening here.
The truth is that the movie is excellent and should be nominated for
Best Picture. I'd even see it again. The ending is one of the best I
have seen.
