Disneys absolute worst in many years

One of the worst Disney animated movies I can recall seeing. 75% inane
songs, way to obvious plot even for Disney. Very, very little humour.
Bland characters and just plain below par compared to what Disney and
other animation studios have been able to produce in the last 10 years.
The usual villains and sidekicks appear but with nothing new to offer.I could not stop myself from skipping at least a minute from most of
the songs. The voice acting was, well, bland is the best word.
Absolutely mediocre. I was thoroughly disappointedDo not by any means pay to watch this and be sure to be in the company
of easily amused small children.
