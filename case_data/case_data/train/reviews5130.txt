What a disappointment...

I rated this movie with 3 stars, because I actually like Chris Evans. The movie, though, is awful! The storyline sucks and doesn't have
anything interesting in it. It is so clich√©, my eyes hurt. The
characters don't have any depth and many of them have no reason to be
in this movie in the first place. The whole sketch thing is something
out of a bad parody movie. I screeched every time those sketches showed
up. I liked the whole idea with the heart being outside of his body and
actually be portrayed by him, but they didn't take very good advantage
of that. I liked how Evans and Monaghan played their roles, but there
is only so much you can do with a bad script. In conclusion, it is a silly movie, that got me to crack a smile or two
a few times, but it didn't do anything else. I kept checking how much
time I had left of this movie, because I owed to the people that worked
for this film to at least finish it. Let's just say that it is
definitely a movie I won't ever see again, even if I randomly find it
while channel surfing. It was sad seeing Michelle Monaghan in a movie like this one and it
concerning seeing Evans play in a movie like this, since the only major
things he has done by now are Marvel movies. I'd hate to see his acting
career drive of the bridge like that, when he is only starting.
