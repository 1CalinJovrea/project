The Drab Seven

Another MADE-FOR-TV movie brought to the screen.More of the same from Hollywood.Lets re-make a classic, but ensure it's politically correct and an
absolute that it represents every race, so as not to step on any toes.Oh,and lets give everyone modern-day attitudes and dialects, because
apparently no one has the capability of acting with the original
language or mannerisms associated with the time-period depicted.Filling a movie with a handful of 'regular stars' does NOT assure the
film will succeed. This one is like the recent 'TARZAN' movie.Save your money and watch the Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven
(original) to see film beauty and entertainment.
