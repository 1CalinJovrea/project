Daring Fun with the potential of becoming Iconic

#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that
saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't
let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the
end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema. Great lines, never laughed this much: Bond with a wink and fresh edge.
Plus super shot "martial art" action that should make the Matrix
jealous. The action has its true Shakespearian/GoTh moments and all
supported by cool tech-stuff. Great aspect in this movie is the music,
an extra comic dimension. When you see the movie you'll know what I
mean. Next too all the clever fun and furious action, it touches on
petty crime poverty and home violence. Matthew Vaugh captures the
grimness yet doesn't loose it's lightness ... and I like the message:
"a gentlemen is not born, a gentle(wo)men is someone who chooses to be
one." The young gang, like Sophie Cookson, held up well and Taron Egerton
established his position in the gang of giants. Colin Firth's aloofness
was crowned with a kick-ass bite, Samuel Jackson brings his role back
to old fashion comedy, strongly supported by Mark Strong and Michael
Caine. It is a big 9,5 - this movie just nailed it.
