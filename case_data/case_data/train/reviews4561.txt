13 Hour: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi

I had to give the movie 13 Hours a solid 10. I am a huge fan of true
stories and movies that are based off books, especially when the story
is filmed true to the real. This thrill riveting masterpiece not only
captivated the lives of these six soldiers and the people trapped
between this battle between the Libyan rebels, but Michael Bay did an
excellent job with his use of guns and sound system that he always does
so well. You can't help but stay on the edge of your seats as you hope
these brave men all make it to the end of the movie. This movie has non
stop violence while these heroic soldiers attempt to rescue the
ambassador as well as help the American residents escape. This movie
will have you racing against time as we relive this Sept 11, 2012 event
also called the "Battle of Benghazi."
