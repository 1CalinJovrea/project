Decent action, but trying to be more clever than it is.

This movie was pretty decent, it did try to be more clever than it was.
It's not flawless. No movie is and when Stallone and Arnold are in it
its worth watching. The thing that took me by surprise was Arnold's Acting, he played
actually good and not over the-top neither did Stallone. I saw it without subtitles and i can understand why some doesn't gets
its plot, because the two are pretty hard to understand sometimes. In one of the first scene Stallone greets a Warden, and i swear to god
i thought he said "What up" instead of "Warden". The best scene most be with the scenes where Arnold is co-acting with
the bad Guy Jim Caviezel. The Bad guy here is the kind of really evil bastard, your meant to hate
but he is kind of funny. His death was a laugh, it was cheesy and i
loved it. This is not a movie with the biggest explosions, its a Arnie and Sly
film with a cool bad guy. The plot is predictable really, there is a
twist who didn't take me by surprise but i guess its a trend to have
some twists and curls in action movies these days. This is not a movie i'm going to buy, but if you like movies with Sly
and Arnold and you want to see them together. Even now when they are
old, they are pretty badass in this movie. I recommend it because it's
fun, funny, good chemistry with the two action elders. 7/10
