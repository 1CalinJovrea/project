9
Great Time watching this movie.

I read some critics about the movie and hey it is Adam Sandler, that
movie is not going to win an Oscar, and he makes that kind of movies
only for entertainment. This movie makes fun for everything related to
80's and how we can miss that age and the idea to mix those feelings
were really great. I grew up using Arcade Machines (I'm from 90's
generation) but I played those video games. I laughed a lot, and the
other people at the cinema did it as well. I gave it 9 because I had a
good night laughing, and the last part (Spoiler): with Peter Dinklage
looked at Serena and Martha Stewart was hilarious, that Look of
degenerated he did was awesome.
