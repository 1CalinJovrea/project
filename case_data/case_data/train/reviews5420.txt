Another disappointment from Teller..

Based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim
Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm
America's allies in Afghanistan. War Dogs is a bad copy of Lord of War
with Nicolas Cage that was released on 2005 it lacks originality and
it's really boring as for the 2 leading men they both were mediocre
with Jonah Hill having one of the creepiest and most annoying laughs
ever and Miles Teller really needs a win because Fan4stic did damage
his career and this film won't save him unfortunately. War Dogs lacks
originality and it's uninteresting and boring most of the time and i'm
gonna give it an 3/10
