Investigated with nice action stuffs !!!!!!!!

I donno why the critics are cursing this movie , I'd love this one. Its
really a good action movie. It holds you up with the crime investigation like all the other crime
movies does. Its done with a better action stuffs and Cruise justified
it very well as he always does. Pike looks amazing with her role and
look as well. It doesn't have lots of twists in the tale but the
investigation itself turns as it flows. Flaws were less unless you are
a movie maniac to find one.I don't see any lagging or unwanted scenes. Everything just fits in so
well. Each character are very much needed to the story line. I love it, i bet you'd too.Recommended for all action lovers. 8/10 for this one.
