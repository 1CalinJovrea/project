keep your eye on Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris

The reviewer's dilemma (and it is a dilemma reviewers LOVE to
encounter) is, in a superb film with superb acting all around, a superb
script, and superb directing, you still need to pay special attention
to those actors that, in such a competitive environment, stand out as
something "extra" special.In this mesmerizing film, special attention has to go to two actors who
steal every scene they are in and silently promise the viewer that the
long and bountiful careers ahead of them will deliver even better
performances down the road.I am referring first to Mahershala Ali, whose magnetic presence made
him the centerpiece of Luke Cage (where he competes with, and
surpasses, actors with much greater experience). If you watch this
actor closely, not only is he in the moment, but his body seems to be
in constant motion even when he is sitting still. Like a hummingbird.
Awesome to behold and although he has been lately playing characters of
"dubious morality" one gets the feeling he could play a hero just as
easily.And then there is the performance of Naomie Harris, a performance so
strong and memorable that I began to recall that, in the Golden Age of
films, they used to refer to performances like hers as "searing" -- but
lately I have not seen the term used very often in a review.So in honor of Ms. Harris I will say for the record that her
performance in this film -- with minimal screen time -- is searing and
unforgettable.Highly recommended.
