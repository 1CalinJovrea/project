The Final Chapter - R. E.

Based on one of the most popular zombie games ever, R. E. - The Final
Chapter supposedly lets Claire Redfield, er, Alice, try and tie up all
loose ends and stop the spread of the horrible T-Virus, which turns all
people into flesh-eating zombies.People who have followed this series should know that, save for some of
the monsters, those involved with these films have not stayed too close
to the games...and that didn't really bother me. After all the turds
(and believe me, there have been plenty) produced in the same vein,
anyone who thought they were going to get another "Gone with the Wind,"
really needs to step back and reevaluate! I have stated several times
that all I ask ANY movie to do is entertain me. Anyone who reads my
reviews should also realize I am not easily entertained. R. E. The Final Chapter at least MOVED. The action was practically
non-stop, and I like that in a movie which is basically "fluff." The
acting was also decent enough; everyone knew they were not doing "King
Lear." Paul Anderson, the director, said this was going to be the final
installment in the series, yet left a little opening should he change
his mind.Rated "R" for non-stop violence and language, R.E. The Final Chapter
may not be the best movie you'll ever see, but it will be FAR from the
worst one.
