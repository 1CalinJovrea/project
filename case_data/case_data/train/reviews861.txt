These movies have become white noise

I'm confused so much, all these movies sorta blend into each other.
Since they are tied together. Hulk, Thor, Cap America, Iron man,
etc.... Since the avengers were in this I assumed it was another
Avengers movie.But no it's Captain America: Civil War? Huh? Don't you need the
Avengers for a civil war? What it being CIVIL and all. Umm....so
confused.Where is Thor and Hulk, and Loki and and and.....I can go on and on,
but you get the point. We really know it was budget issues. They are IN
the Avengers, SO why are they not asked to sign? ?????Confusion. WHY do, ALL OF A SUDDEN, half the avengers seem not to trust
Cap???? OH right since that is what the plot needed. This whole movie
is just trash. Random spider man and ant man thrown in too, why not?
Just whatever at this point. Explosions and random sh*t. Can anyone
make sense of these movies anymore?All started with Cap, the Nazis stole something from Thor/Loki....then
he was frozen, woken up....umm Tony Stark's father knew Cap. Umm Cap
almost banged Peggy? She did stuff created shield or something....then
Hydra got in. Then Loki went crazy, and Thor stopped him, or didn't.
Umm then Iron man made suits....Black widow wore tight tight clothes.
She was in ballet??? Kissed Cap, but loves Hulk??? Umm....wtf is even
happening any more. Robin hood has a secret family??? And who was that
guy in a panther suit. RANDOM AS F***! LOL ?????If you LOVE confusing white noise this is the movie for you!!!!!
