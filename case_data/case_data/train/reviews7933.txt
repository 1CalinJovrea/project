A spectacular visual treat of a visceral emotional turmoil.

A one word review of this movie would be the easiest thing in the
world, safely beating such acts as breathing, eating, and, if you are
in a country like India, reproducing.It would read Luke Evans.And like most one word reviews, it would be gross injustice and more
importantly not accepted by IMDb.The movie is a visual treat. The story line is very much present, much
against what the staggeringly misinformed critics seem to be saying.
The fight sequences though not many are well crafted and tread the fine
line between satisfying the action heads among us while not making the
more delicate among us not throw up.And for the purists out there, please understand the title. It says
untold. So if you want to whine, do so elsewhere and stop lowballing
what is easily among the best movies in the last few months.It is a perfectly balanced movie the right doses of action, emotion,
intrigue, and as an icing, a great ending.Whether it is a weekend watch, or a quick afternoon grab, or something
to kill time very very pleasurably, the movie ticks all the right
boxes.
