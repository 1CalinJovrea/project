Just awful

A disappointing end to the series, to say the least. I haven't been
this bored watching a movie in a long time. Everything just seems
half-done and half-explained. Jennifer Lawrence's acting is also
horrific in this one; it seems like she either doesn't identify with
her character, or just does NOT want to be there making this movie.
This might be the fault of the writer having no idea how to
intelligently end this story; but it is all of us who suffered because
of it. For context, i really enjoyed the first two movies in the series
- but this one just lacks any kind of excitement, feeling, or sense of
purpose. I also hate it when writers use children for cheap pathos -
this movie was especially offensive in this regard.
