Best Jackie Chan Movie in a Long Long Time

Was a huge fan of his movies made earlier in his career. Lately, most
of his movies had been nothing but disappointment, until The Foreigner.Jackie Chan isn't young anymore, but he was able to show that he still
have some juice left.Pure action, his stunt trademarks, and not too much of CGI (unlike
recent movies where poor CGI effects really spoilt the films).I will not spoil it for you, just got watch it, and you'll not regret
it.
