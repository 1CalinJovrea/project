awful

Dear movie goer, after seeing one half of this movie and shutting it
down in disgust, I am wondering what happened to the Tyler Perry who
brought us Madea's Family Reunion which was hysterical, but thought
provoking with a stellar cast. This was unfortunately a foul mouthed
piece of garbage.
