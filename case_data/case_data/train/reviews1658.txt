Interesting and well made

Greetings from Lithuania."Ruby Sparks" (2012) is both intriguing, a bit fresh and very well made
romantic drama with some fantasy elements. Script was very interesting,
the premise turned out to be better than expected. Acting was good by
all involved, i wish there would have been more scenes with Annette
Bening and Antonio Banderas characters, they both had excellent cameos
(yes, unfortunately they were to short to call them a real
performances) - terrific sequence at the middle within Calvin's mom's
house. Overall, "Ruby Sparks" is a intriguing and a bit surprising movie. I
really didn't expect it to be so good. Basicaly the best parts of it
were it's unpredictability. When you start to think that you know in
what direction this movie will go, it surprises you, and that's a very
rare in these days cinema. "Ruby Sparks" is surely not to be missed.
