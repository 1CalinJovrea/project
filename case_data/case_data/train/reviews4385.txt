Potential that fell flat

In summary: A family has to move to a new town because the 15 year old
daughter was raped (statutory rape) by her school teacher. The father
was just satisfied to beat him up, but he then felt inclined to move to
some outback, flea-bitten, middle-of-nowhere, run-down, trash dump to
start a new life.His daughter is a nymphomaniac who makes it with anything with two
legs. She is suffering from a personality disorder that could probably
be cleared up in five minutes using NLP, but these people are part of
the ignorant animals roaming the earth.The girl wanders off one night following her brother and is never seen
again. That's it.That acting was OK. The story and behavior of the protagonists was
ludicrous. The town sheriff apparently didn't know about what an
all-point bulletin is because once the girl was officially considered
missing, he didn't do anything about it.And one of the irritating things that has been becoming more frequent
in movie making these days is having no ending. The movie just ends
with the husband and wife sitting on the porch feeling sorry for
themselves which is how I felt for wasting my time watching this movie.
