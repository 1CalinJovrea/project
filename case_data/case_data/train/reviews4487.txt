Loved and hated it

I watched this movie yesterday in a art-house cinema. It's a lovely
setting for this movie, small and intimate, I don't think big cinematic
rooms with a 100 muttering teens won't do this movie any justice. Before I start off, I haven't read the book so I won't judge on how
well it's transfered to a script. To me, maybe because I haven't read
the book the movie was quite difficult to follow as it felt that a true
story line was missing. it was just a bunch of lost youngsters trying
to find the essence of living a life. The whole movie felt like
somebody was telling a story about how to make and loose friends in a
split decision and how to ruin your life royally. I absolutely loved Tom Sturridge. He plays this gay poet with so much
depth and essence. You can see he really tries to feel what Carlo has
felt.I also think it was one of Kristen Stewart's best performances. the way
her story flows through the movie is refreshing. You see Marylou grow
and develop the realization that even with all the living, life filled
with sex and drugs isn't full filling her needs and that she needs
more. It's well played and Stewart just embodies the sexuality that is
needed in this movie.I loved Hedlund's performance... he was clear in his emotions. though I
really didn't like the character, Hedlund made me feel sorry for him in
the end. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by Riley's performance. I felt
it lacked emotional dept at moments were I thought it had to be more.
especially the moments he spend behind the typing machine or with his
family. Overall it was not my type of movie but a good choice if you want
something different than the straight forward happy ending
blockbusters...
