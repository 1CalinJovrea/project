30 Minute Story Stretched to Nearly Two Hours.

I watched this movie because I was looking for recent, highly-rated
horror movies on IMDb. I felt pretty misled by the rating which was 6.9
at the time of watching.The premise of the movie stoked my curiosity. I wondered how a woman
being handcuffed to a bed could play out in a movie-length production
since there didn't seem to be much to go on. Well, it's even more
boring than you would expect.Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad and the cinematography was a
bit above-average as well. However, the story and dialogue dragged on
horribly.At first, watching the interaction between the older couple feels
incredibly awkward--and this is good because I think the film is
intended to provoke this feeling. It's as if you are invited over to an
older couple's house and they break out into an hour-long
passive-aggressive fight in your presence. But it just doesn't stop.
The characters make obviously stupid mistakes both in their
relationship and in their kink-play. Since they make such stupid
mistakes it is incredibly hard to relate to them or care about them.I kept waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen only to
find that there was no pay-off. Avoid this movie if you are a horror
fan looking for something scary or exciting. This movie is entirely a
drama with some dark elements so maybe watch it if you are more geared
towards that genre.
