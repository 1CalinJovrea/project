Disappointing

I agree with the review that says Rogue One is the end of an era, but
for another reason. Honestly, I have watched the original installments
and liked them so I was very disappointed with The Force Awakens
Episode Seven, but my disappointment here is for another reason. This
is the first Star Wars movie with no Jedi, light sabers or any real
force. I know the Asian dude keeps saying he has the force, but of
course it is a wish on his part. He is not Jedi or padavan and the
force does not surge within him. A Star Wars film without force, Jedi
or light saber is not really Star Wars is it. Some might say that with
what happened in Episode Seven maybe that is a good thing, but I prefer
to think there is certain elements that are a must for Star Wars. Also,
in case anyone didn't notice the film does not start with a rolling
storyboard.I guess Disney needs the money, but honestly we are the ones giving it
to them. I went with my boyfriend and his coworker and none of us
really enjoyed it. It was just OK, I guess. At least we went home and
had some serious good sex that lasted until after midnight so it was a
good Christmas after all lol.
