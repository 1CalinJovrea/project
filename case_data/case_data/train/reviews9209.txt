Overrated

I was very excited to see this movie, but got very disappointed with
what I saw. Despite the good performance of Naomi Harris, the move is
very boring for me taste. The movie is very slow and way overrated. I
really don't see the deal with the performance of Mr. Ali but maybe
it's just me...
