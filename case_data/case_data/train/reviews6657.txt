Old geysers thinking they are funny

This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, it's such
an unfunny pile of crap and it should be nominated for worst comedy of
2013. In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at
theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45
minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most
unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good
chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway
mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie,
because there isn't much to say about it.I didn't find anything clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think
some of the set designs looked okay. This film is a huge waste of time,
don't bother wasting you're money on this garbage Just avoid this. It's
not even worth a rental. Don't waste your time on this garbage
