I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.

Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost
none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to achieve what the
other one couldn't.I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me,
and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading
female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie
had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old
places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line
quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out
quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed
in the saga would also enjoy it.
