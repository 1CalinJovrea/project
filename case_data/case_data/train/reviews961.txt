As a casual Marvel fan, I was disappointed.

It's like they didn't watched the movie before releasing it. There's no explanation for Viper's motives, and why did she change her
skin in the middle of a fight scene, which didn't made her stronger at
all. It made no sense. They should be a lot clearer in let us know the time line. After
searching Google, I found out this is after the third movie, X-Men:
Last Stand. Wolverine has a lot of dreams/hallucinations about Jean.
They should have started the movie with a scene right after the ending
of Last Stand, so the audience would get a clearer picture of what was
going on. Not just a scene where he wakes up in the woods after ??
years after a war.Also when Wolverine's powers was disabled, he took a lot of bullets and
jumped from a high building, but he just kept on running like it didn't
hurt him at all. Plot holes and an overall boring move makes me give this movie a 2/10
