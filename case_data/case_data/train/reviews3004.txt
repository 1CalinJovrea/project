This is how a sequel is supposed to be done!

When you make a sequel, make sure it's better than the first or at
least as good as the first one in every way. Out Of The Shadows has a
better story line than it's predecessor, it has a much more energetic
and extremely catchy film score, the performances, editing and
directing are a lot better.The first movie is forgettable, but Out Of The Shadows will be
remembered due to it being watched more than once, it's so entertaining
that you'll want to experience the chaos and fast-paced action again
and again.
