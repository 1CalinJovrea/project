Terrible

I loved the LOTR movies despite the liberties Jackson took with the
story (especially in The Two Towers) and I found the first Hobbit movie
tolerable but this one stinks. Jackson seems to think that we like his
story-making over Tolkien's. He has used his gratuitously added action
scenes from those movies as the basis for almost the entirety of this
3+hour movie.There is maybe 15 minutes of this movie that is from the book. The rest
is stuff that Jackson wrote and never-ending CGI action shots that have
such fast moving elements that you can barely tell what is going on and
the characters perform feats that stretch belief so far that even the
fantasy-world of Middle Earth cannot overcome. The character of Bilbo
is diminished almost to a supporting one. The main characters of this
movie are Tauriel and Legolas (the former made up by Jackson, the
latter never appears in The Hobbit) and Bard. The character of Bard is
totally changed from the noble protector of Lake-town to that of a
ruffian on the margins of Lake-town society. The dwarfs were portrayed
in the book as being a little cowardly, very greedy and bumbling. In
the movie they are like a pack of Jackie Chan's with beards, even
taunting the dragon to chase them through the halls of Erebor to try to
catch him in a trap. From a cinematic critique Jackson continues his
habit of massively exaggerating the scenery vertically so that as the
party is making there way up the side of the Lonely Mountain it seems
like they are climbing the Matterhorn.I could go on and on. Bottom line is this movie is lousy. I have
watched each of the LOTR movies several times; I don't think I could
sit through this movie for a second time.
