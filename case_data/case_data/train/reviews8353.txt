Watch out - you're going to like it whether you want to or not!

We two 50+ grandmas went to see this film on the spur of the moment
because we enjoy musical movies. We were probably the oldest people in
the audience which ranged down to younger teens but everyone,
regardless of age, was laughing and having a grand time. Much less
schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing
and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously
quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat
Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer,
and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking
comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur. Fun, feel-good and
highly entertaining.
