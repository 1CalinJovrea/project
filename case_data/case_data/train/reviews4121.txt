Total waste of time

I had been waiting to see this with much anticipation and what a
complete let down. I can honestly say I have not seen such an awful
film for a long time. After watching San Andres Fault by mistake I was
so hopeful that nothing could be quite as bad as that. I was wrong. I
know it's a big blockbuster and made to leave the viewer in awe, but I
just laughed at it. My partner and I sat and said what was going to
happen next and it did. The plot was dire from the start and I was kind
of hoping the film would end before it had even got half way through
it. Why do they always have Brits in American films who sound like they
are so posh? Totally not called for. The acting was OK and I like
Dwayne Johnson, but this was beneath him. The most ridiculous film in
years.
