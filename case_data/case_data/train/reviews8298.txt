Please don't waste your time and money.

I will be plain and simple, this has to be one of the most horrible
movies i have ever saw. I will make topics about what is wrong about
this "movie": -The plot makes absolutely no sense. -The characters
despite being children never act like a "normal" person would act on a
similar situation. -On the whole "horror" movie there where only 1 gory
scene and 1 jump-scare in my opinion. I can't tell more about how awful
this movie is without spoiling for the poor people who will waste their
time and money watching this garbage. I actually didn't dislike the
Conjuring series until now. I cannot understand how this movie has 7.1
rating, it blows my mind.
