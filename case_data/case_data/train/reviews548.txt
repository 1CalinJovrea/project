Dares you to watch but you may bail!

I found the synopsis intriguing, but despite a fairly novel concept, I
thought the movie itself was lacking in something. The acting was okay,
for the most part, but the whole idea was a bit far-fetched. Yes, I get
the moral message, but the idea that this could actually happen, in
real time - is nuts! I hope to god this doesn't spawn several Internet
themed movies, in the same way 'found movies' did. Haven't we got
enough social media in the world, without making movies about it? I
suspect this will appeal to the younger person, but it just didn't do
it for me. I feel this movie has missed the boat somewhat.....we've
already had the ice-bucket challenge, cinnamon challenge, drinking
challenges etc etc etc... I agree totally that some clown will try to
invent something like this and there will always be bigger clowns who
will try to compensate for their lack of a brain by morphing into a
sheep and BAAAA copying it. I dare folks to live without their phones
for a day - now wouldn't that be something? Okay for a watch, but
absolutely no classic!
