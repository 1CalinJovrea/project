Best vampire flick since Let the right one in

This poster drew me to this film. Not the poster shown here on IMDb,
but the colorful green, yellow and red which are used other places. I
wasn't expecting too much, but was surprise ad when I saw the casting,
and that it was a Neil Jordan-flick. I've admired Jordan since I saw
The Crying Game.This story reminds me quite a bit about the Swedish "LÃ¥t den retta
komma in" ("Let the right one in"). It has the right realism which made
the the Swedish film so special, and the same coloring tone. The
scenery in the beautiful harbor tine of Hastings are perfect, and it
really made me want to visit there, which I will, most certainly.
Combined with the Dickens inspired older sessions in the movie.If there were justice in this works, this would have had the success of
"Twilight", or rather instead of. It's very British, stylish, bleak,
beautiful, and the casting is simply perfect, like it seems in all
British films. The idea is simply brilliant, and I love the idea of vampires running a
brothel, as well as the depth of the longing for a different life. It's
desperate. Saoirse Ronan is once again electric, and the third film I've seen in a
short time with Caleb Landry Jones (both fabulous, "Antiviral" and
"Contraband") convinces me he is a big star in the making. Gemma
Atherton is perfect.I found the storytelling excellent, and I was very entertained all way
through, though this isn't really my type of story. I think the ancient
part of the story is good, but I think the red bloody waterfall is a
bit over the top, and also slows the story and the believability. But
otherwise this is grand film making.
