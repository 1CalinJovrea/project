I loved it!

Yeah, yeah; it's getting lacklustre reviews, and I half understand why.It's not a timeless piece of comedy, but it's got spunk, wonderful
production values, inspired comedic acting (even the 'bit' roles), and
it has well-turned moments of stunningly genuine romance. Of note: If
other comedy films are "better", why did I find more good ol',
down-home belly laughs in this one? I think I know why: Sure,
MacFarlane can play it blue and scatological, but he also values that
other timeless comedic tradition; that which is Truly Funny Because It
Is True.Special Mention for Sarah Silverman. I think she struggles to reach out
and touch with her unique and beautiful style, and goes largely
unappreciated. MacFarlane gave her a great vehicle, and she lived up to
it with the kind of aplomb and vivacity that I've certainly come to
expect from her. I sincerely hope moviegoers will recognize this and
watch her career with heightened expectations.One thing I thought a bit odd: The Onion reviewer's main critique was
that MacFarlane was "recycling" gags. I was half-expecting to find a
tiresome rehashing of a few gags. I started watching, and found it
engaging and surprising.Anyway, it sorta looks like the horse is out of the barn. The flick did
sh1t at the box office, and it'll go to DVD and maybe recoup its
outlays. Too bad! It deserves better.
