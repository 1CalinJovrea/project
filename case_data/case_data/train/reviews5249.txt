one of the worst films I've seen in the cinema!

First time I've ever wrote a review on IMDb.The title says its all, if you're going to watch this film, watch the
first 10mins and the last 20mins, you could go out of the cinema
mid-way through and hardly miss anything.The first planet of the apes was the best, 2nd was good enough, 3rd is
just is just rubbish.Spoiler Towards the end of the film there is a massive oil tank in the
middle of the compound where the soldiers were holding out (dumb place
to put it), then getting attacked by Apache helis, you would think the
massive group Apache helis could take the compound out about a mile
away, instead they are flying all beside each other flying over head.poor story line, poor acting, poor directing, awful film, don't bother
wasting your money.
