Fantastic

I wasn't sure what to expect but I was terrifically surprised. Great
story with lots of intrigue and action. Excitement and thrills
throughout the film. Probably not going to be an Oscar contender,
although Michael Keaton did a superb job in my opinion, but I don't
care it was just awesome.
