How to make money by selling your used toilet paper.

First off this screenplay makes Rocky 5 look like a Shakespearean
masterpiece. Whomever vomited this forth knows nothing about boxing.
Knows nothing about managing, promoting or training a boxer. Has never
seen or possibly even heard of an actual boxing match.They know nothing about HBO, HBO sports, sporting fans or anything
related to any sport of any kind.They also know nothing about bankruptcy, foreclosure, family services,
anything related to being poor, anything related to being rich, anger
management, losing a loved one, dying from a gun shot wound or anything
related to anything a child may ever do or say in the real world.This most amazing thing about this screenplay is somewhere out there in
the real world someone got paid (for real) many thousands of dollars
(for real) for this handful of used toilet paper.So, from now on instead of flushing my own used toilet paper I am going
to stick it in a envelope addressed to Hollywood and give each piece a
title like "Southpaw", "Hockey Stick" or "Field Goal" and wait for the
checks to start rolling in.
