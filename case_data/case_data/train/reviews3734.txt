Ridicule and disrespectful account of historic figure

This is a intense disappointment. After reading few reviews I was
expecting something epic at the minimum for the 2h40min that the film
run.... however after the first 45min I was sure that there was no way
this films could reach nothing then laughter. There so many clich√©s
that after a while you cannot avoid the laughs when is supposed to be
dramatic. The plot is interesting but all the aspect that make it
special are not explored nor developed. There many characters that
seems to vanish without sense and the encounter with the natives at the
amazonian jungle are absurd and implausible under the conditions shown.
Just for context, Bolivia and Brazil have a significant variety of
native dialects ( more then 300 ) this means that many of this areas
where not in contact with the Spanish or the Portuguese. The acting,
UFFF painful and excessive like in a soap opera. Anachronism in
language and behavior... Shame that they miss a great occasion to do
something espectacular.
