Well I enjoyed this messed up movie

Never again would I look at Clowns in the same way after seeing this
movie but that get's me thinking, when did I like them in the first
place.The story to Clown is about a father discovers the clown suit and
decides to wear it for his son's birthday party. However, he soon
discovers that the suit turns the wearer into a killing machine.Clowns never scared me because I always know it's somebody else in
cheap looking make-up trying to make you laugh but really they creeping
us out. I have seen many movies and TV shows with scary looking clowns
in it and yes I can see why people are scared of them but they never
took a big effect on me, until I sawed this and for now on I will stay
far way from clowns if possible.You can hate or like the film Clown if your a horror fan or not, for me
I like my horror movies best served cold and freaky, and Clown to me
isn't a bad flick. I can see a lot of effort went into the make- up and
the design of the monster clown.To those who have seen the movie did you think for a second that Eli
Roth directed this movie, yes I know he stars in the movie but the
movie has that style look to it that Eli Roth himself would use and I'm
saying that has a positive.The acting in the movie was surprisingly pretty good from Andy Powers
and Laura Allen. The directing as well was pretty good from other
horror movies today. Normally I don't like over the top gore in movies as I think it's a
cheap way to get 18 rating or if your American Rated R, and to be
honest I didn't get that in this movie for most of the time you don't
really see much of guts flying everywhere but most of the after math of
what happened.For problems with the movie I have some like: The characters in the
movie are mostly forgettable and I'm not talking about Laura Allen or
Andy Powers characters, I mean the other supporting or the background
characters that always seem to get screen time which they shouldn't
because they stupid and dull to watch.The movie dose have some clichés that really stick out and I thought we
are already pass some of the clichés when it comes to horror movies
today, but luckily after a while the movie forgotten the clichés as it
went on. Oh remember when I said some of the acting was good well the
kid actor was a bit noticeable that he's trying to be scared but I
didn't buy it not for one bit.Besides that Clown overall isn't a bad flick, now some people may not
agree with me and that's fine you got a opinion and that's awesome I'm
not going to be like those dick heads that start yelling at you for
nothing. Well I enjoyed this messed up movie.
