What did I just see

Listen, I have been trying to write a decent review. But I just can't.
This movie is just senseless. This pretty much sums up the story: -I
have a perfect life, I have a perfect girlfriend. -Baby I didn't cheat
on you. -Oh hey sweet and shy girl, let's make the most mainstream
couple ever. -OMG you're so special. -OMG I told you to get out of my
car! -OMG I'm sorry you were almost killed because of me. -I love you
so much I will leave you alone in embarrassment. -I will just send an
awesome college application, writing the most mainstream things ever,
and I'm totally getting in.I see no story and no character, just moody drunk kids who have no idea
what they're doing. Weird movie. Don't waste your money.
