Meh. Next.

Perhaps you'll like this movie. Watch it for yourself. It is truly
different. Haven't seen anything like it before I guess. My opinion? I
didn't enjoy it as much as I thought. Seemed like a majority of people
enjoyed it however. As for me, I was more annoyed but to each their
own. I'm simply writing my experience. Do not read as there are
spoilers ahead.I saw that this movie had pretty good ratings and I was interested in
watching a horror movie right before sleeping. It all seemed like a
normal home invasion where two kids and the babysitter fight against
robbers. Nope. I also assumed that there would be an actual invasion
after the prank by the boys on the babysitter. Nope. I just didn't want
to believe that the kids were actually gonna go on a murderous spree. Luke's bratty attitude is really not like-able. I was so damn annoyed
after the prank that I skimmed bit by bit and realized that he went
craaazy. Depending on how you like your movies, either you'll want
justice (like me) or not. The kid almost gets away. At least there was
some sort of justice at the end.
