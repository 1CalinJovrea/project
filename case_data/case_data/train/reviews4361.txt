Nothing new in this high-octane sci-fi flick, but Beckinsale rocks

I HAD high hopes for this flick as I really enjoyed the 1990 original
on DVD. You can read my review of the original flick, which I had
written last month.Where did it all go wrong? Quaid (Farrell, whom I last saw in a sex
tape) just runs and runs and surmounts every obstacle thrown in his
way. However, the action is nothing new and viewers would have seen all the
running, explosions, bullets ricocheting and close-combat fights in
other flicks.The flick does pause for a brief moment to ruminate on Quaid's desire
to find out about his past, while the rebel leader tells him that the
heart wants to live in the present. What new age mumbo jumbo is this?Another problem with the flick is the casting of Farrell. In the
original, Arnie looked really confused by what was happening around him
and viewers would have empathized with his predicament.Farrell, on the other hand, just seems to be going through the motion.The movie's atmosphere is also nothing new. The teeming crowds amid the
rain come from 'Blade Runner' and 'Fifth Element'. The car-chase scene
comes from 'Minority Report' and 'Fifth Element'.The idea about robot cops getting ready for an invasion comes from 'I,
Robot', and the look of the robots also comes this flick. The one good thing about this flick is Kate Beckinsale, the director's
wife, who plays Quaid's wife. She's not one person viewers will want to
mess with in a dark alley. She exudes arrogance and strength, and a
certain amount of sexiness and sultriness.
