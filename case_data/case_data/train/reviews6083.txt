Don't watch, Unnecessarily Depressing

Caution: Contains SpoilerCharacterization: -5/5 Script: -5/5 Direction: 0/5 Acting: -5/5 Overall
Rating= (-)0 Notes to Director: Please don't make a movie again.I have watched at least 1 movie a day for past 17 years, and some 2000
movies before that but I must admit that this is the only movie I won't
be able to forget or recommend to anyone, not even to an enemy. Sadly I
have found the first movie that I hate!Unnecessarily depressing script, writer had no idea about human
emotions & psychology. After watching this movie I had to watch 2 more
movies to get over this crap.This film is special in a way that some scenes were just filmed but
nobody actually directed those scene (scenes in hospital towards the
beginning) Worst acting ever in any of the Hollywood movie! Whole scene
was badly performed & poorly written. Asian doctor looked more
embarrassed but not worried at all, like it was all her fault that
patient has got a heart disease?When Casey saw the doctor in hospital he was supposed to ask him if his
brother was okay, not if he is dead. "Which brother can ask a doctor
"hey doc is my brother dead?" & then tell his nephew I don't know why
did I see your dad's dead-body in the morgue & I don't know if you
should see it yourself or not?Patrick being the only kid, specially in absence of his mum, was
supposed to be more attached to his dad & not F@@@ing neighbour's's
daughter the very night his dad passes away.Just to make it more depressing writer burnt Casey's home & 2 toddlers
in this movie & Casey watched it all holding milk in his hands the
whole night. No Father would do that.Comparing Frozen chicken to a human Deadbody was disgusting!Could someone please ask the writers to read the script and find a
single realistic conversation? Even there were repeated dialogues in
the movie!To be honest It costs me 50p to watch a movie in cinema, but today I
felt like I have wasted 50p on this crap.AVOID AT ANY COST
