Goes down as One of My Favourite Comedies

"What We Do in the Shadows" is a mockumentary about four vampires
sharing a flat together. Going into this movie knowing nothing but the above, I did not have any
idea what to expect. What I got was one of the funniest movies of this
year or any year for that matter. The jokes where brilliant and more
importantly, they were frequent and consistently brilliant. I loved the
interaction of the main characters with each other and the supporting
characters.Each of the main vampires had their moments and were all equally funny.
The movie even had werewolves and they were also hilarious. I was also
surprised by the special effects which were really well done.At one point it did feel like the jokes were getting old, but just as I
had finished that thought, the movie changes and ends brilliantly. Even
though there isn't much of a story, it doesn't really matter for this
movie. Just watching some of the hilarious chaos that ensues in their
everyday life is enough.There are not many movies that make me actually laugh out loud, but
this one did on several occasions (usually comedies, even great ones,
just keep me grinning through out). This is easily one of the most
enjoyable experiences I have had at the cinema.
