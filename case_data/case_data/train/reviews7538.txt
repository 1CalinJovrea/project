Well done

This film rather caught me off guard. At the outset, I thought it might
be merely sensational -- exploiting the quite reasonable idea that
attractive middle-aged women could take up with men a generation
younger, just as some older, usually affluent men sometimes have
affairs with younger women, or pair up with them and start second or
third families. And when the women turned out to be so close that some
acquaintances suspected them of homosexuality, and their sons had been
raised almost as brothers, the narrative began to feel creepy. (I have
to say, if the film had been about men taking up with each other's
daughters, it would have been way too creepy; on the other hand, there
was Blame it on Rio . . . )But the tone of the film almost turns it into a morality tale,
suggesting that these women brought difficulties and grief on
themselves through their self-indulgent behavior. They experience joy
for a time, but it comes at a great cost. Most women don't take up with
their best friend's son for very good reasons. On the way, we're
presented a complex plot with overtones of some ancient myth, high
drama, and terrific acting.I confess I decided to view the film when I saw Robin Wright and Naomi
Watts were in it. Can you imagine two better-looking grandmas? Robin is
as gorgeous as she was 23 years ago in State of Grace, and Naomi, of
course, is beautiful as well. But their looks aside, these actors took
what could have been a maudlin and trivial story and crafted it into a
unique and affecting piece of work.
