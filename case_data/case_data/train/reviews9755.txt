Good October Fun

Okay folks. This not an Oscar film for sure. It is also not ground
breaking by any means. Hell the only thing even remotely true about the
film is the first maybe three minutes. This is every horror movie you
have ever seen rolled into one. One minute you feel like your watching
Rosemary's Baby. Then Rosemary is in the Amityville house. The next
moment here comes Chucky with even a little Helter Skelter thrown into
the mix. But everything I could say that is wrong with this film is
exactly why it works. it embraces its cheese factor. Even revels in it
at times. The film has some great scares and in a few cases some real
interesting ones. It is just simply a lot of fun to watch with a lot of
people. So much so, when Annabelle reveals herself fully you find
yourself really into it. I thought the ending was weak but by the time
you get to the end it would be very hard to raise the level suspense
any higher. There is a scene with a sewing machine and Jiffy Pop which
I think should go down in horror movie history for the right way to
build suspense. It was funny listening to the audiences nervous giggles
as something was about to happen. Go to this as entertainment and
nothing more. Nothing deep here. Very little real here. It is based on
a true story. However, based is a very loose word here. Three minutes
is based upon a true story. Just good October fun.
