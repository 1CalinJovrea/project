The long and winding road

I am the daughter of a mother who recently passed away from lung
cancer. She never smoked, like the protagonist mother. I cried many
times during this movie. It made me think a lot because like the lead
character, i often ruminate over the past; i have a lot of flashbacks
and memories of my mother keep replaying in my head., and the things
she said to me will forever echo in my brain. In terms of the sex and
the drug taking, i think Resse did very well in portraying the daughter
who completely lost herself and the desire to live with the loss of her
mother. I also grew up in a single household and my mother and I were
always together, our identity are intertwined; it was us against the
world. Losing our mother is like losing more than life itself, I am
still finding myself lost and struggling to find meaning in life. It is
a constant struggle to not give up and give into self destruction and I
am very thankful that the protagonist captured this feeling very well.Like the life of a lot of people, this movie is about the journey we
take. Its not about the destination or achieving a particular purpose.
It is deeply realistic, and i am glad it doesn't lecture or give a
moral lesson on how we should be ,or a happy ending because we don't
always get that in life. Life is ugly and it doesn't always end in
happiness and things don't always happen for a reason good people do
not always get a good ending and normal people can do bad things to
themselves and to toh others due to pain brought on by unbearable
grief. This movie inspires me to maybe run a marathon.Walking, hiding and running are very meditative and its like a metaphor
for life, no matter what happened, all we can do is keep walking.
