Excellently Shot & Acted

A beautiful, dark story of true Christianity, and true demonic
activity. There is abandonment here, and need for love, and terror, and
horror, and non-narrative. Not often does a film disturb me like this
one does--and I am a published writer of Horror. Watch this one more
than once.
