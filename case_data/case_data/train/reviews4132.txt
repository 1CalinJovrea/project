Eye opening - very interesting and funny look at arms dealing

The story is eye opening, relevant and very clearly told with a
humorous tone through the serious subject matter. This is based on a
true story with some fictionalized elements to make it entertaining. A
massage therapist links up with a childhood friend who is a small time
arms dealer. Very interesting to get a look at the legal but morally
questionable world of arms dealing. I thought this would be a juvenile
buddy movie with a bit of war thrown in but it isn't.Jonah Hill has some funny lines and he does a great job with the over
the top character but he can be subtly sinister when he needs to be.
Miles Teller plays his character sympathetically and I liked him here.
Quite different from the rather annoying characters he usually plays.
Bradley Cooper who produced the movie and has a small but pivotal role
and he is effective as an arms dealer.Quite a transporting experience as the action takes you from Miami to
Jordan and Iraq with some funny situations there and Albania.Watch this movie. It deserves to do better than it has so far.
