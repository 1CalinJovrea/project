Great style, crap everything else

1 out of 10? Yep, it was "awful".The story is okay, if thin. It seems to be trying to be arty and
stylish, but despite looking superb, there is zero substance. There are
no real questions being asked, no real characters being developed, and
a threadbare story. All that means is this is a film of art for art's
sake, which was always the refuge of the uninspired.Ryan Gosling sucked. He just stands around, saying virtually nothing,
no expression, no emotion, nothing. It was bizarre. Maybe that's how it
was supposed to be, but all that means is that you have a dull,
lifeless movie.Kristin Scott Thomas sucked. Zero acting effort.The script is s**t too. Very little dialogue, which would be fine
except that the end result is weird conversations with zero emotion,
zero acting, and bizarre pauses where no one talks.And then there's some reasonably serious swearing, which when added to
the s**t dialogue just sounds weird and odd.The best parts were the Bangkok night scenery. The lighting is great
(lots of red light, purple etc), but it is simply a s**t film. This
film deserves nothing but contempt for wasting my money and time. If it
had been free, it still wouldn't be worth it, but at least I'd only
have my wasted time to complain about.
