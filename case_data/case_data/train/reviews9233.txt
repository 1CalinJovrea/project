A confused film, avoid it.

I couldn't quite figure out what kind of caper movie Focus is trying to
be.If it was a light comedy in the vein of Oceans, The Sting, or The
Italian Job then the tone of the film is completely wrong. The cast try
to be light, fluffy and likable. There is a smattering of sexual
tension, which seems very forced. But the characters aren't funny and
you can't empathise with them. They steal from ordinary people and
relish that fact, referring to victims as 'suckers'.OK then, this must be a serious caper movie in the vein of The
Grifters? The kind of caper movie where you're supposed to hate the
lead characters and everyone comes to a sticky end? Well, no. The film
just isn't bleak enough. Largely absent are gratuitous lashings of
realistic violence; overly profane language and there are no dark
overtones.When we finally come to the consequence of the lead characters actions
it's a weak conclusion. What did our character learn from his journey?
Spiritual enlightenment? That crime doesn't pay? No, only that he
should never lose 'focus'. Seriously, that's it!?Don't ever get me started on the plot.The whole movie is a gigantic mess. Avoid it at all costs.
