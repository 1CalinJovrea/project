What a joke

This movie is an insult, not only to Alien fans but to each and every
cinephile. Hollywood has been happily churning out a lot of garbage
lately, it's all about the money, they just bank on the name, doesn't
matter if it's good or not as long as they make a profit. Hope this one
loses money, I feel bad cause I got suckered into going opening day.Like the video game crash of 1983, maybe one day, one day soon there
will be a movie industry crash when people won't even bother going to
see any more crappy sequels/prequels, unnecessary reboots, and other
misleading bad creations of Hollywood, this is not entertainment, it's
a just a kick in the brain.I feel bad for every Alien fan out there, I found nothing to enjoy
here. The direction they took the Alien lore is just... dull, even
Prometheus was more enjoyable.Alien Covenant - a waste of talent, time and money.(This is my second review, I wrote more harsh things and it got
deleted)
