I thought this movie was awesome!

Spoiler alert. I was apparently at the same showing as the previous
reviewer who did not enjoy this movie. I was one of the 150 wait listed
and just barely got in to the sold out show. Only ten on the wait list
got in. I am so glad I did because this turned out to be my favorite
film at Sundance - I liked it even better than Whiplash which won the
Grand Jury Dramatic prize and Audience award.It had a similar impact on me as did the movie, Contact. It asks what
if? It explores the intersection of the spiritual and science - just as
Contact did. The science of biometrics is relatively new and I can
imagine a growing data base of biometric eye scan data where
supposedly, there can only be one signature per person just like
fingerprints. If that is so, then what might it mean if duplicates are
found? What might it mean if a duplicate is found of a deceased person?
What if a person who has a duplicate of a deceased person's eye scan
also has a deep, unconscious memory of things in the deceased person's
life? This was not a perfect movie - left hanging was what should be done
about a severe breech of ethics on the part of a medical doctor who
wanted to examine the protagonist's child on the "pretense" of
following up on early signs of autism. Also, the protagonist had a
serendipitous experience with the number 11, the meaning of which was
never resolved.Still, I expect this movie will generate a lot of dialog and buzz as
more and more people see it.Great movie.
