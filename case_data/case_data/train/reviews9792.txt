Top 5 worst movies I have ever paid for.

This movie was so poorly written, I felt the need to make as many
people aware to avoid paying for it. I think I have written a handful
of reviews but here is my short take on it...It was a story line that
never developed, childish "illusions," and attempts at humor that made
me roll my eyes. The characters were painful to watch act as the lines
and script was so awkward, they could not even make it look good. My
friend summarized the "entertainment" best by imitating the illusions
saying, "It's not in this hand because look! It's in my other hand!"
That corny. I watched two different couples walk out before they
delivered some illogical obnoxious explanation on the "eye" and then my
friend and I walked out asthey continued to explain. The first movie
was very entertaining but this may be the worst sequel ever produced.
