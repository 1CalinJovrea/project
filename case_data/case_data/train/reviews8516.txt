An Insult to Comic Fans

This movie was awful. As a comic book fan I felt like Josh Trank just
slapped me in the face by using so very little of the actual comics. He
basically used the name of a comic I love to get me to see it and then
gave me a different movie. The casting was awful (none of the
characters matched their comic counter part. They were all too young so
of course Reed Richards didn't have gray streaks, who thought it would
be a good idea to make a tiny guy the Thing?, and was it really
necessary to make the Storm family have a "modern home"? That's more of
a story that would fit in the X-Men), the origins dragged on for too
long, and their origin wasn't even the same! The Fantastic 4 is
supposed to be all about space travel not going to other dimensions.
That's Dr. Strange's territory. I walked out of this garbage and got my
money back.
