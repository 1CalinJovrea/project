An absolute must-see, consistently entertaining from start to finish.

Hollywood has a long history of taking beloved relics from our 

childhood and adapting them into big-screen entertainment, with the 

unfortunate truth being that the final product often bears little 

resemblance to the source material that our younger counterparts loved 

so much. Typically we're left with something that feels like a cheap, 

hollow cash-in (The Smurfs, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks), or a 

bloated, special effects-laden monstrosity full of explosions and poor 

acting (Battleship, Transformers, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra).



So it was with much trepidation that I sat down to watch The Lego 

Movie, steeling myself for an experience that would be little more than 

a two- hour commercial designed to drive traffic into the nearest toy 

store, coaxing money out of the wallets of parents and into the pockets 

of the Danish toy company. Instead, I was treated with one of the most 

original, creative and entertaining films I've seen in years, which has 

quickly cemented itself as the first must-see movie of 2014.



Emmett (Chris Pratt) is a construction worker, obediently carrying out 

his daily duties in accordance with the instruction manual provided to 

all Lego citizens by President (Lord) Business (Will Ferrell), an 

obsessive compulsive, maniacal CEO bent on world domination. Think Lex 

Luthor, but as a complete control freak with less intelligence and more 

mustache-twirling insanity.



A chance encounter with the beautiful WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) leads 

Emmett to the mythical Piece of Resistance, an ancient relic spoken of 

only in prophecy that can be used to save the Lego citizens from their 

impending doom. Wyldstyle quickly whisks Emmett away and brings him 

before the Master Builders, which include the sagelike Vitruvius 

(Morgan Freeman), the manic 1980s astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and 

WyldStyle's boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett, in perhaps the film's most 

hilarious vocal performance). Together, the Master Builders formulate a 

plan to defeat Lord Business by infiltrating his massive high-rise 

fortress, using the Piece of Resistance to defeat him once and for all 

Â– provided they can escape the clutches of the terrifying Good Cop/Bad 

Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business' most loyal henchman.



From the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless 

array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil 

Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert 

grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that 

every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's 

best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles, 

and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules 

established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen 

must be possible to construct in the real world.



There's an especially clever twist that occurs during the third act 

that, if attempted by less talented filmmakers, could've easily 

derailed the entire experience, but Lord and Miller's pitch-perfect 

execution makes it work. With lightning-fast wit, a surprising amount 

of action, and perhaps a bit of attention deficit disorder, The Lego 

Movie is consistently entertaining from start to finish. It's a 

brilliant mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great 

foundation to build on.



Sorry, I couldn't resist at least one Lego-related pun. But seriously, 

The Lego Movie is fantastic.
