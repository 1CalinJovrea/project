Family huh?

I know the Wrong Turn franchise is not for everyone, blood, gore and
minimal story telling but it's easy watching horror.Please believe me I was looking forward to seeing no.6 but sadly it let
me down. I was expecting dodgy acting, very little story telling and mostly lots
of squealing laughs from 'Three fingers' the ugly blonde, along with
plenty of bloody deaths.Yes the acting was dodgy, but too much story and not enough bloody
deaths. It left me feeling nothing but bored. Sorry
