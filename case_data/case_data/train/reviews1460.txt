Good to see the old Creeper again after all these years

Well just got home from seeing the movie tonight. Thought the movie was
better than I thought it was going to be. All the moments that the
creeper was on the screen was great. The acting could have been better
by the characters. The new more developed character in this movie was
the truck. Won't spoil it for anyone, but the truck has a few new moves
this time. Really as creepy, and surprising as the creeper himself. Yes
we also finally get to see Trish a little bit. This movie starts at the
end of the first movie and ends at the beginning of the second. You can
seamlessly watch the 1st one - the 3rd one - then the 2nd
chronologically. One problem with the movie is they seem to figure out
where the creeper came from ( quote from movie ) he is ancient. Then
they don't tell you?
