HATES is a solid thriller

**Alert: Spoilers Included**I watched an advanced press screening for this film, and I have to say
it was not the dead-girl-haunts-house horror story I was expecting,
which turned out to be a very good thing. FYI: This one's more thriller
than horror. There's no doubt that Jennifer Lawrence makes this movie. The rest of
the characters are underdeveloped and one-dimensional and it becomes
difficult at times to separate Jenn in this role from her role in the
Hunger Games. For about half of the film, we're led to believe that the little girl
locked away is a rabid serial killer. However, there is a HUGE plot
twist at the end --one that is smarter and scarier than the standard
horror fare we're used to. With that said, the first half of the film drags (do we really care
about Jenn's rock concert practices?) but certain parts are mysterious
enough for viewers to put in the effort to connect the dots. If you're a Jennifer Lawrence fan or love Criminal Minds/Law and Order
SVU, check this movie out. If you're looking for a haunted house movie,
you've clicked on the wrong flick. As for me, I was pleasantly surprised!
