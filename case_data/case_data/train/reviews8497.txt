enjoyable, but arguably the most disgusting film ever made

Every human being on Earth other than unfortunate post-colostomy
patients, can relate to this film. Arguably, it's the most disgusting
film ever made. Nevertheless, you just can't help but like the
protagonist and even empathize with the ups and downs of her unique,
and absolute, obsession.Our spunky, sexy protagonist falls in mutual love with a very cute
medical professional, and you really believe it's true love. She also
has testy relations with her own parents, but she's a pure soul, and
despite continuous mistreatment and neglect, she only wants them to get
back together and be in love.Don't be an ass and miss this funny, endearing film! ;)
