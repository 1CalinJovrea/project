A stunning achievement

Co-written by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain, and adapted from a
collection of short stories by the American author Craig Davidson,
Jacques Audiard's genuinely moving Rust and Bone is the story of two
wounded people who form a bond based on recognition and acceptance of
the others pain. Supported a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat, the
film is marked by astonishing performances by Oscar winner Marion
Cotillard as Stephanie, a young whale trainer struggling to recover
from a horrendous accident, and Matthias Schoenaerts as Ali, a brutish
ex-boxer who is unable to acknowledge or express his feelings.Rust and Bone is not a film that is easy to describe. It is raw and
visceral Â– a punch in the gut, yet it is also a film of intelligence
and sensitivity, certainly an art film but one that is also geared to a
larger audience, to anyone who has suffered pain and loneliness. When
we first meet Ali, he is a man with dreams of making it big in
kickboxing, but who is now at his lowest point. Unemployed, he has just
left Belgium with his five-year-old son Sam (Armand Verdure) to live
with his sister Anna (Corinne Masiero) and her husband in Antibes, a
French resort town on the Mediterranean. As Audiard describes him,
"he's nothing, he's a bum, he's nobody. He looks just like the people
lining up at soup kitchens." Though Ali appears to have a good relationship wit Sam, he relates to
him more like an older sibling than a responsible father, as someone
able to provide unconditional love. That the film allows us to see Ali
as both a man of ferocious energy and innate sensitivity, a
three-dimensional human being who elicits our empathy, is a major
accomplishment. Stephanie, who works as trainer of Orcas at a local
marine park, is rescued by Ali from an overaggressive pursuer in the
club where he is a bouncer and the two begin a tentative relationship.
In a moment of honesty, Stephanie tells him that her greatest pleasure
in a relationship is to be observed, "I like being watched," she says.
"I like turning guys on, Get them all worked up, but then I get bored." The nature of their relationship, however, changes forever when
Stephanie is seriously injured in an accident at the pool, losing both
of her legs and, with them, her reason to live. The scene when
Stephanie wakes up in the hospital to discover that her legs have been
amputated is one of the most gut-wrenching I've seen. After a period of
recovery, Stephanie, now fitted with artificial legs, reaches out to
Ali for companionship and finds him open and receptive but brutally
honest. For her, he is the only person she can trust to listen to her
without judgment even though, in his brutal frankness, he tells her
that she is "dressed like a whore," and casually suggests that they
sleep together just to see if "she can still do it." Despite showing concern for her needs, Ali has moments of cruel
insensitivity when he picks up a girl for a one-night stand even when
Stephanie is with him, prompting her to ask him, "Am I a friend, a pal,
a buddy like the others? If we continue, we have to do it right. I mean
consideration." Ali is determined to become a professional fighter and
becomes engaged in illegal activities such as street fighting and doing
surveillance work for his sleazy friend Martial (Bouli Lanners), an
activity that damages his relationship with Anna and forces Stephanie
to be a spectator from the sidelines. Although the film is raw, there
are some moments of exquisite lyricism as captured by cinematographer
Stephane Fontaine, in particular, the scene where Stephanie interacts
with a killer whale through a glass partition in an underwater tank.Despite the fact that there are some contrivances and melodrama in the
plot that do not mesh with the film's gritty naturalism, Rust and Bone
is a stunning achievement. As Eli moves to a new level of growth, not
only with Stephanie but also with Anna and Sam, a haunting picture
emerges of two people whose inner strength allows a crisis in their
life to turn into a spiritual awakening, an opportunity to experience a
new sense of being alive. As the Greek tragedian Aeschylus expressed
it, "Pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until,
in our despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace
of God."
