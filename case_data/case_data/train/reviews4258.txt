Best Movie I Have Seen In A Long Time

Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading
reviews with One Star because the movie had "Foul Language" and "Sex
Scenes" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate
for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of
research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not
With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and
writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are
easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie
for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for
2 straight hours you will love this movie.
