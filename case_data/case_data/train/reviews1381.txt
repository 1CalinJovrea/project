No,no,no,

This is what I was afraid of when Disney took over marvel,it should
have been called Spider-Man,high school musical ,I know it,s comic-book
movie ,but we came a long way to show that comics are not just for kids
,but this sets us back ,none of the characters are like they are in the
comics ,Peter was a nerdy school kid but not like this ,flash was a big
school bully ,but this flash is a wimp ,my grandmother could take him
,and aunt May is a hottie in this movie ,not the old caring aunt of the
comics ,why ,why ,hope this is not a trend ,the suits sucks too.i know
they are trying to hit a new up to date audience ,but really.good
graphics and action but lame characters and story .guess I,m just
getting old .
