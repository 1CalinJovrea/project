Propaganda for patriotic violence porn fetishists and imbeciles.

I was traumatized by this film. Never in all my years of sitting
through war films have I been so offended. I've played Call of Duty
games with more authenticity and conscience than this travesty. I
expect this level of soulless drivel from Bana and Wallyberg but Foster
is going to be yogic flying for the rest of this life and a few
reincarnations to make up for this one. Kitsch, well, Battleship looks
pretty good in retrospect.S P O I L E R S (as if there was anything here to spoil)The story goes something like this. 4 no neck meat-heads try to out
macho each other in a vain attempt to keep their homosexuality buried
deep in each others closets for half an hr before they are dropped into
Afghanistan where they kill a hundred or so Taliban whilst running
away, falling down cliffs (on purpose), being shot and blown up until 1
of the 4 is left barely alive and is extracted after being helped by
some locals who receive no thanks and will be targeted for doing so
(except for Wallyberg, he squeals a few thanks in his prepubescent
shallow breath tone before being carted off). These guys make The
Terminator look frail. Actually, that synopsis makes it sound way better than it is. I'm sure
there are a bunch of intellectually impaired patriots out there (some
on here already) for whom this film will bring a tear to the eye,
prompt a swift foot stomp and heel click before an obligatory salute to
the stars and stripes. If you breathe through your mouth a lot and
think you might be one of them, feel free to imagine an extra 9 stars
on my review. For everyone else, this is only worth watching if you're
feeling masochistic and want to see how bad it is.
