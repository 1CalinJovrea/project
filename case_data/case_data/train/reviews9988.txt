Noah- A Sinking Ship

Noah (according to Moses) tells the story of a man, husband, and
father, who due to his holy life, gains favour with his creator.
Through a dream, it is revealed that God, fed up with mankind's wicked
ways, has decided a great flood will wipe humans from the face of the
Earth. Noah is tasked with building a great ark and starting over with
his family and a male and female of every living animal. Noah,
according to Darren Aronofsky and Paramount Pictures, is the latest in
what will be a string of many grand scale films based on biblical
stories.Aronofsky and studio executives unfortunately struggled with using the
simple story laid out above and decided to weigh down the plot with
extraneous side stories that turn this apocalyptic tale into an
obligatory blockbuster. From teenage tantrums of not being able to find
a spouse in time, to Noah turning into a deluded psychopath considering
infanticide, to a more than contrite final showdown between Noah and
the leader of a small tribe. While dedicating screen time to these mini
conflicts, we eventually lose the humanity behind what is meant to be
the end of the world and therefore lack emotional investment when all
is eventually lost and then found again.Russell Crowe does do justice portraying the reluctant titular hero and
gracefully transitions from environmentalist to tyrannical ship captain
to doubting man whose heart wrenching struggles go unanswered by a God
who has gone silent. Crowe's acting ability is one of the only things
that makes Noah remotely watchable for all its 138 minutes. One thing
also worth mentioning, is the films beautiful visual effects, some that
bring about awe inspiring images from stony fallen angels, to the
massive deluge from first drop to global wasteland, and finally the
most stunning representation of the creation story that I've ever seen.We live in a time where technological advancements will allow us to
imagine and portray the imaginative stories of the Bible but this
cannot be the only focus of these films. Unfortunately for Noah, the
visuals, while gorgeously executed, and the competent acting were not
enough to float this drowning drama.
