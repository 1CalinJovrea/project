Refreshingly Good.

So I went out last night and saw this movie, ended up with the entire
theatre to myself. Great movie! It was fun to sit through, not as
tedious as Groundhog Day. Though it can be a predictable movie, as far
as whodunit, it is a fun, campy romp of a movie that isn't afraid to
mock itself. I'd watch it again.
