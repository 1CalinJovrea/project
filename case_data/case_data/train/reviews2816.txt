Flawed but never boring

I am really surprised at the mediocre reviews so far of this film.
Honestly when I first heard about the film I had little interest in
seeing it, but the trailer was better than I expected, and when has
Christoph Waltz been anything short of terrific in every role he has
played, but particularly when he is a bad guy. (Come to think of it has
he ever been a good guy?) The whole cast is solid, and I really liked
the historical setting concerning the Belgian King Leopold and his
exploitation of the Congo. I found all the animals and the CGI to be surprisingly cheesy.
Undoubtedly the weakest link in the film, but that factor did not
subtract much from a constantly entertaining and solid story. Besides
the cheesy CGI the rest of the film looked terrific. I would recommend
to see it on the big screen. It will probably lose a lot on smaller
screens. Good summer popcorn film.
