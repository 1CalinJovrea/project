Confused and shaky in delivering the message

In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally
disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself
to such a low lever of performance.Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics,
unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects
leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my
negative impression. Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter,
older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting.
The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two
other guys add to the story?Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy
spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm
hole, in "another galaxy" seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in
a US interstate highway. Why would a director hire a "Black-Hole-World-Expert" as an executive
producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper
and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in
Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge.Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message:
Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity
theory to common movie goers, or the power of love. Each of them bold
and superficial.
