Uneven 3 part film

The first section holds promise of a tense thriller as Ryan Gosling
gets addicted to robbing banks and using his motorbike riding skills to
escape at high speed until...... The second section focuses on Bradley
Cooper's cop, hailed as a hero but who finds it a mixed blessing
carrying both danger but also opportunities worth exploiting. Once the
headline appears on screen 'Fifteen Years later', we are in the third
section and it's here that the film completely falls apart. The story
becomes melodramatic and utterly predictable; the coincidences and plot
contrivances are just ridiculous.To make matters worse we are served up
a load of cod-psychology about fathers and sons. If only the director
had stuck to making a solid thriller without all the pretentious
overtones, this would've been a really good movie.
