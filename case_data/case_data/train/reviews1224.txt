Enjoyed It

Wasn't sure if we should see this movie or not reading some of the
reviews on IMDb. My daughter wanted to see it and nothing else was
playing so we went. We enjoyed it so much. It was funny and the 80's
songs through out the movie were great. Once in awhile you would hear a
little Olaf from Frozen come through seeing the actor who voiced him
was in this movie. Adam Sandler was pretty good in this not his goofy
self. It is just a fun movie to see.The Pac Man scene was good with the mini coopers. Donkey Kong was great
too. The special effects were good. Go see this movie and judge for
yourself.
