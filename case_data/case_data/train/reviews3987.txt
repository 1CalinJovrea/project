A must see and then again, and again...

I was lucky to see this in a cinema where no one spoke during the
entire duration of the film (a rarity I find nowadays) - it may be
because people were holding their breath in anticipation of what was to
come next. Wow. Had me transfixed the entire way through. Those
familiar lines no less haunting for the multiple times my eyes have
seen them and my ears heard them. Some clever interpretation of the
original text including additions that were only spoken of in the
original play script. Some purists might not like these additions and
interpretations but I found them equitable to the original. Fassbender
was amazing. Understated where needed, alternately a powerhouse. I can
and will watch again.
