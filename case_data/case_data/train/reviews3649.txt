American Classic

This is simply the best movie I have seen since Shawshank Redemption.
It tells the story of a family living in the wilderness who are forced
to face modern society. Its funny, with a pinch of sad, and a huge
dollop of thought-provoking.Matt Ross is a genius who has found his voice and style in this film.
The direction is just incredible. The script has all the fluff stripped
out so it moves along at a great pace. It is edited to perfection so
every scene draws you further in. It feels like "Into The Wild" as
directed by Clint Eastwood. I have been going around telling random
people about how great this movie is and how it will clean up at the
Oscars.I don't see it appealing to everyone however. That is what makes it
such a great film because no one left the screening ambivalent. The
open-minded Austin, Texas audience was vastly in the Fantastic camp,
but I can see this film is not going to go down well everywhere with
everyone. If it did, it would be some fluff piece and not the classic
it is destined to be.
