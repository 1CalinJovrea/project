That Dame can act!

Some good performances to support another superb performance by Judy
Dench. Izzard was a revelation. Good pace, good camera work - More history well told than masterpiece,
but a good night out.More comedic lines than I was expecting. Is the racism at the core of
the film as much about class as religion?
