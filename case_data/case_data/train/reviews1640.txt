Good Movie

This is the last time I take into consideration negative reviews + a
low rating. I was very undecided about going to see this movie due to
this bad habit of reading reviews on IMDb. It is not the first time a
low rated movie turns out to be great, but it is certainly the greatest
contrast between reviews and the actual movie. This just proves that
most users are probably persons who don't understand a well constructed
narrative and don't have an eye for beautiful cinematography. Ryan
Reynolds does a great job and so do his co-stars. I also admire Mr.
Atom Egoyan for writing, directing and producing this movie. It is a
good movie. Go watch it and don't let the rating create low
expectations. Hopefully it will exceed the current 5.8.
