Waste of time

What a piece of crap wannabe blockbuster . If it was not by the fact I
got free tickets for the premiere, I would be p***ed off to waste my
money in vain. Well, my time was wasted anyway...The plot is the epitome of stupidity: shallow characters and a
predictable story made me wonder what the director was thinking. The
history of Pompeii and its fate was completely ignored (I have visited
Pompeii myself) - the tsunami scene was only one of the non sense
historical goofs. The movie end is absolutely stupid and I was relieved
it finally ended. If you want to waste your time, this is the perfect opportunity.
