Huge disappointment

couple tiny spoilers*****Apocalypse....I give it a C and I'm being nice, what a disappointment
but it was expected, can't believe what singer has delivered, I would
rather see Justin Lin make an xmen movie! Singer needs to go! I could
not let go my disgust with apocalypse costume design. I just couldn't.
I see why they went with the look they have, because to singer he
wanted to show Oscar Isaac face, to show the man behind the make up
sort to speak. But it's terrible! He's apocalypse I don't need to see
the damn actor playing him!! First whole hour is terrible, only thing I
enjoyed watching was magneto's story line, quick silver steals the show
once again and wolverine does as well. Disgusting what singer has done!
