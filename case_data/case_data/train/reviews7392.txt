Predictable, had a message but is cheesy

The film has a message basically making people aware of the power of
the internet and the consequences of trends and pressure to do things
to stay in the spot light . I just thought the acting was quite bad ,
the story was predictable and all the characters were really
stereotypical ( the un confident best friend , the nerdy Chinese girl )
I also thought the designs of emails , messages on phones on the screen
because annoying and looked quite low budget. The film does have a
message but it was a bit of an anti climax and the way everyone just
kind of got up and walked away and forgot about it at the end was a bit
too boring and could have had a twist to go with it .
