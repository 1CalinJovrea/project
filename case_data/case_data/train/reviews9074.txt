The Absolute Action Movie

This is definitely one of the best action films ever made. And this is
how action films should be.The acting is perfect, a very good effort in direction, effects are
very impressive and some lines unforgettable. About the plot, it is
just an ordinary day in job - no history of the character, nothing
unnecessary. Just action!Karl Urban really surprised me with his acting - a fantastic
performance! Really suitable for this role. I knew that Lena Headey is
a very nice actress and she proves it once again in this film. Olivia
Thirlby also gives a remarkable ''rookie'' performance.I believe that this Dredd deserves a sequel, with the same attitude and
for sure Karl Urban as Dredd. If you are in the mood for an action
movie, there is no way that this film will disappoint you: 95 minutes
full of action.For sure one of my favorite action films ever!!!
