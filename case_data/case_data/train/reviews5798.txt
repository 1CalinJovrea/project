the ending will blow your mind...good movie but not that well romantic thanks to Lasse Hallström

if you are looking for a love movie then you had made the right choice
this movie is a simple story yet good story lining not as well as your
expectations but you will love it. if your hoping for a second notebook
you have to know its not that good...okay maybe Julianne Hough is not the right actress to be in this role
but she did her best and you may like her innocence in her role but i
didn't like her so much...Directed by Lasse Hallström, the movie will teach us that in the
darkest hour, love is the only light that shines there in the darkor
something like that. An affirming and suspenseful story about a young
woman's struggle to love again description will work out just fine...i don't want to talk so much about the movie go watch it what are you
waiting for and maybe you will use some tissues so go for it and have a
good time...its my first review and I'm not good as well in English hope it helps
tank you for reading...
