Everything that is wrong with cinema today is seen in this movie

The movie feels like it was written by a ten year old girl hooked on
drugs. Cardboard characters are so undeveloped that they should have
stayed in authors womb for few more months/years. Bad acting and "I
don't care about what is going on" attitude from the actors brings
final nail to this movie coffin. There is nothing substantial in this
movie, nothing that can teach us something new about ourselves or the
world around us, which is quite odd for the science fiction movie. True
the cinematography of the movie is first class, but it only saddens me
that it is used on such bad material. In the end don't get fooled by
this movie. Its only purpose is to take your money with bright lights
and a false promise, but it will leave you with a mouth full of ash,
wondering why you wasted your time.
