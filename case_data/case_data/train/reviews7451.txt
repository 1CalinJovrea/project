Unlikable film with an even more unlikable lead

I gave this movie an extra point for Woody Harrelsson and for the witty
dialogue, but besides that, there is absolutely nothing likable about
this film.Nadie is a whiny and self-centered young girl, with imaginary problems
and self-created drama. Besides this film being obvious and so boring
that you sigh out loud several times, there is just nothing redeeming
about Nadine. I can see that she has had a rough time in life, but her
father's death doesn't seem to disturb her nearly as much as her friend
dating her brother. And it kind of leads you to think if this is a
movie about mental health issued mistaken for a comedy, because Nadine
is just angry and rude. I found it hard rooting for a girl that is just
a horrible person.The worst part about this film is the message it sends, "Your life is
worth nothing if you don't have a boyfriend" because that is what is
all comes down to. Krista just like Nadie have a 180 on their
personality as soon as they get a steady beau. Then you can be open and
social and make new friends, if you are single you are not worth
anything and you should just stay in your room and get drunk.
Alternatively kill yourself, because loosing a parent is not enough to
put you over the edge, but your friend dating, that is want to make you
jump in front of a truck. I would have wanted this script tossed in
front of a truck, and I wouldn't have wasted a Sunday night watching
this useless mess.
