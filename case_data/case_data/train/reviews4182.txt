Why, oh Why

First: Zombie with white teeth. Because if there's one thing the human
flesh eating undead care about, it's dental hygiene. I'm in the first
37 mins of this movie and I can only ask myself why I wasted my time
(seeing it free so not my money). And what is Hollywood's obsession
with trying to make young ladies like me fall in love with zombies,
werewolves and vampires. Are they just setting us up to lower our
expectations about all men? Choose between an animal, the undead or the
actual dead. Honestly, I'm watching this movie as a parody because I
cannot see how it can be addressed otherwise. I will not address the
plethora of faults in every scene and in the plot because my fellow
reviewers have done it justice. Skip this movie. To my friends who are
making me watch this un-ironically; we might have to reconsider our
relationship.
