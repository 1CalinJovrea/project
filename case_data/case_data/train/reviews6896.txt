Surprisingly Good

With no expectation at all for this film. Turned out it's so much
better that just another silly class B zombie clone.And it's not just particular part, but for overall writing, directing,
shooting, lighting, acting, music, etc. The opening gives me the tense and the acting of Janitor (Blake
Anderson) is really great. Other male casts are alright, but could be
better. I know they need to look "scouts" but come on, these are the
guys saving the world :)The acting of Sarah Dumont is so cool and tough, very nice. And I wish
to see more Halston Sage (who wouldn't?) :pHighly recommended if you haven't watch it yet.
