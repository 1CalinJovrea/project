Don't let people mislead you with sentimentalism, it holds it self by its own as an excellent movie

Is a solid movie and it holds itself as a trilling experience for
everyone. Yes, people from the original cast are not there, however
there is actually not a logical reason in the time line to make them go
back. Taking out this little detail, the acting is amazing and Chris
Pratt holds amazingly as a main character again . Animations are better
than ever and the story line even if a little prematurely developed is
exciting and looks to reward the new audience as well as the hard on
fans. Overall is a great movie which promise enjoyment. I loved it and
I will recommend it for everyone that is a fan and for the ones that
just want to see a movie that will print a smile at the end.
