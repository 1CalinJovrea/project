Fantasy Supreme

Why is it that WWll lasted as long as it did? After all the Germans in
all these movies are killed by the bushel and have absolutely no
tactical battlefield ability! Fury brings this to a new height with the
final battle scene. An entire SS Battallion armed with Panzerfuasts
decides to attack a disabled Sherman Tank frontally not once but
repeatedly! Say Hans you think it might be better to pin them down with
fire and circle round to the rear of the tank to finish it off with the
Panzerfausts? No I think sacrificing the entire battalion in a frontal
attack makes more sense. Besides doing it the right way destroys the
tank in fifteen minutes and turns a heroic stand into the suicidal
idiotic idea it is in the last month of the war. Please Brad stop
playing Achillies in every movie!
