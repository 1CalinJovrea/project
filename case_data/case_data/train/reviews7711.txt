The Night we knew and loved is finally back.

Well that took a while but I can now say that he is back. I think this
is the kind of film where he thrivesÂ– low budget, small and intimate
domestic settings and a smaller scope. It has echoes of Signs, The
Village and The Sixth Sense. I see that critics are comparing it to The
Conjuring and I would agree to an extent yes, it has the same level of
information withholding.It's amazing how this film manages to be so wonderfully terrifying
without the use of much cgi or special effects. A couple of points in
the film I yelped and let out a nervous laughter (and I'm a tough guy).M. Night Bashers will continue bashing this film but I feel this will
stand the test of time, much like his best films. I hope he keeps this
up and makes two or three more of these 'small' films quickly and then
perhaps, people will eventually forget his larger failures.I say, watch it. If anything, it's a fantastic lesson in directing
horror through restraint.
