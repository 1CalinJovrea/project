Hacksaw Ridge: an emotional journey alongside the war-hero, Desmond Doss.

Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the
opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is
only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero
Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson
(director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead
the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced
the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions
endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they
also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller 
the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the
brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst
such chaos and terror  these elements are all present, but they placed
alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to
draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological
impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's
portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for
many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making
very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince
Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour
and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted
points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling
tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence,
love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way
a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey.
