Good but not great

I liked the movie a lot, especially now a days it's hard to find scary
movies. This didn't have a whole lot of jump scares, which I liked, but
definitely had the creep factor the whole way through. Lots of suspense
and wondering what was around the next corner. However it had a lot of
questions about how the characters could be so dumb. I felt as though
there were plenty of points where I said "STOP! TURN AROUND BEFORE ITS
TO LATE!!!" But that generally comes with the territory of scary
movies. I was glad I watched it, but not something I think I would
watch again.
