#Sh*tHappens

Wow, well that was truly disappointing. First of all I want to mention
that I have watched the extended cut which adds around 10 minutes more
of tediousness (no pun intended), and I honestly would have picked the
shorter version had I known how bad and boring this movie is.To be honest, one could tell that the ride is not going to be a fun one
after having to endure the opening credits dance sequence which is
strikingly reminiscent of that of the Family Guy, only it is almost 3
minutes long. Clocking at around two hours, the extended Ted 2 is full
of exhausting moralizing clich√© talks about how the legal system is
supposed to treat everyone equally, "protagonists going somewhere"
montages (and some other montages, like "protagonists prepare for a
court hearing"), unmemorable dialogues, unfunny pot jokes, more unfunny
jokes unrelated to pot (an added bonus is Mark Wahlberg covered in fake
semen. At least I think that it's fake. Maybe.) and occasionally, about
once in 40 minutes, gags that actually provoke some laughter. And those
gags are not nearly hilarious enough to justify sitting through all the
monotony in between.I truly liked the first Ted. I found "A million ways to die in the
west" to be inferior, but still enjoyable. This one, however, dropped
the bar so low you can see the rock bottom from here, gotta hope that
the trend with Seth Macfarlane's movies' quality turns around. The last
line of Ted 2 is "hashtag Sh*t Happens". That is quite ironic, as it is
a fairly accurate description of this movie's creation.
