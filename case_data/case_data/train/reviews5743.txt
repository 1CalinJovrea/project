Slow, brooding and unsuspenseful

Warning: This is not a spoiler but reveals key devices in the delivery
of the story.I really wanted to like this movie, but throughout this slow, brooding
interpretation of what might have been a good novel, I kept thinking to
myself "implausible implausibility." None of the characters reacted
believably to most happenings, and the spider came across as a red
herring to pass the buck onto the viewer to make sense of it all.The score was elegantly composed but used in a manner that lacked
suspense. The editing was slow and overused long tired close-ups as a
substitute for revealing anything. My impression of the film was that
it relied too heavily on pauses and silence rather than storytelling,
and the parts that were most dramatic came across as a yawn.If I had read the book and liked it, I would probably like this movie
less for failing to represent it well.
