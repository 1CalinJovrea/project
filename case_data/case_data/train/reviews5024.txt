it's a really funny movie

Well, many people says this movie sucks but I think they are saying it
because Adam Sandler is in the movie but I think this is a good movie,
it's funny, is not trying to be something it is not because is not a
movie with a super message obviously no, it knows that is just funny,
the animation is beautiful, the mayority of the characters are OK but
it have some flaws and they are: it have some characters that are in
the movie just because they have to be on it but they really
unnecessary and boring characters. The opening scenes feel very
accelerated and many things pass so fast that you can't pay attention
to all of them. I would say that is as good as the first one but I
think that isn't better and they are in the same place, none is better
than the other. Well I'm going to give it an 8.2 of 10, it's a good
movie that is really enjoyable to watch.
