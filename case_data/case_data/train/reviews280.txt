Cute movie made for kids

I loved the previous lego movies so I went in to this one not knowing
it's from a TV series for small children. To be honest it does stand
alone and if the kids in the theater weren't pointing out things from
the show I wouldn't have even known about the series. It does appeal to children under the age of 10 as the whole movie is
written in away that makes it seem like it's happening in an 8 year
old's mind. From the kindda corny dialogue to the super obvious "hint
hint" that was happening... also sharks, why would a mech shot sharks
and crabs at you.... meh whatever.It was corny, it was a bit too obvious but in the end I wasn't the
target audience for this movie and I still had fun with silliness and
some of the jokes in it come at you from left field. There was more
then one child in the theater pretending to do karate while the movie
was going on and once the end song started so I'm going to say the they
had their audiences attention. A good movie for a family night with the little ones.
