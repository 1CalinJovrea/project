Asian stereotypes galore

These are just in the first 30 minutes of this piece of crap.1. There's the "this Korean, that Korean" in buddy's engagement party
song 2. What's with the inexplicably mute father's Asian girlfriend? 3.
Why does the Asian guy at Michigan have the phoniest accent? 4. There's
the Indian guy at restaurant he's applying for, from 40 year old
Virgin, who I guess is funny, because he says "fuck" with a Jamaican
accent.Stopped watching this crap after 30 minutes. This is why Hollywood
sucks. There are too many white, Jewish guys who have their yarmulkes
so far up their privileged Lilly asses, they don't know what the world
is really like.
