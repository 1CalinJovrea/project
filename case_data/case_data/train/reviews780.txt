delicate perspective on love

this is the first film directed by Chris Evans that I saw.it is well
directed,well acted. it has an interesting and delicate perspective on
love,lost,sadness and making choices based on profound love and not a
little lust. I liked a lot and I enjoyed seeing it 2 times.both actors
are comfortable in this position,I liked that there is no much passion
and more friendship and real understanding.it is more a chick flick,but
if there is a man who wants to be true to himself ,he will also enjoy
it.it is wonderful and you will feel good about love and life and
yourself ,you will feel hope and happy to be alive after seeing
it.enjoy.
