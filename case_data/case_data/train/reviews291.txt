worst movie ever

Well I'm an atheist... but this movie made me pray on my knees to God
to please stop my suffering and make me blind.So Noah has visions, pretty short ones in my opinion and suddenly he
know's what's going to happen?Movie makers tried to add elements to the movie to add action, drama,
romance, etc. Only to make a really crappy plot.So Noah had an paranoid schizophrenia episode he must have been
snorting "crocodile". ABSURD and then he goes sweet to the bottle?Please don't waste your life or money on this movie.Not even Emma Watson can save you from fleeing the theater.
