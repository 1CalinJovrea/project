Twighlight officially sucks after watching this!!!!!

YES..it is another vampire love story movie, but guess what? There's
better humor and of course the point where its definitely a unique type
of story. The part of the movie that makes it more interesting is they
made it to the way comedy/love/vampire gore and most of all action
scenes to were they should be placed at the right moment. Although, its
the typical zombies eat human, who would ever thought of why not making
a Romeo and Juliet zombie kinda movie. Its pure genius, Better
yet..Props to the person who wrote it. This definitely makes that
OVERRATED Twilight series SUCKS MORE after watching this. I would
really recommend watching it.
