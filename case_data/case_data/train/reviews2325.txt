The Ghost is the missing Story

My sister and I went to see this movie together.... Mistake! This was
the worst movie I have ever seen, and I see movies almost every week.
It started, we thought the film got stuck, and we should have followed
our instincts and left. The entire movie is silent and leaves the movie
watcher waiting for something to happen, anything. I do not understand
the positive rating of 7.8... Maybe I expecting too much when I am
hoping for some dialog, anything (the Ghost do "talk" to each other,
HA). I can see this movie being replayed on Saturday Night Live.
