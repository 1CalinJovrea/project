good but not memorable

Lawless was extremely well filmed, looked great and stayed true to year
it was set in. The cast was strong and all delivered good performances,
especially Tom Hardy, who once again showed how much of a versatile
actor he is. Shia LaBeouf was also a stand out performer for me.The plot is simple but easy to follow. There are some extremely
gruesome scenes and some bits of good gun action. Apart from a few
scenes, the film was pretty much just dialouge. There wasn't much going
on really. It was a decent film but ultimately it is something that I
won't remember in a few weeks. I can see why some have rated it so
highly, I guess this just isn't the sort of thing I normally like. It
was good but I wouldn't watch it again.7/10.
