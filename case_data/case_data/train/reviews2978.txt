Overrated movie written by a 12 year old.

Its an overrated movie with curses written by some 12 year old. No
story, no real plot, the film could have done without the villain. This
film deserves a 5 or 6 stars at the highest. The reason I am giving it
a 1 is due to its over rating. The film mainly attract audiences of
16-25 years. Just a cash grab film. Simply marvel's worst. And there's
the feminism there. The heroine always has to save the hero now. Ryan's
acting was good in this movie. It suited him. The cgi wasn't bad. But
if this movie were to come out before the Iron man then it would've got
4-5 stars. There are some marvel films which deserve higher rating
instead of this movie .
