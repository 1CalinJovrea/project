Long And Drawn Out

This movie should have been a 15 minute short story. I'm so upset I sat
through it wasting an hour and a half of my life. Arnold did an okay
job in his role, and I love Abigail and her acting abilities. However
this was a waste of their talent. The trailer (like in most cases)
showed this movie to be suspenseful, maybe a few "jump" moments, etc...
Alas, none of that. Just long, drawn out, and frustrating. The ending
was far less than thrilling, and should have occurred 15 minutes after
starting.If you're expecting a good thriller, or a "Walking Dead" movie scenario
you're sure to be disappointed. I'm unsure as to how this movie has
even 3 stars, it was so dull. The potential was there, but it fell
short.I will say the makeup was decent. That's about it, the story itself was
a total bust.
