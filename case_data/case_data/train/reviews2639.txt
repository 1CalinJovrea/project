The absolute greatest movie of all time

The absolute greatest movie of all time. Hands down. My future wife,
Alexandra Daddario, and future second wife, Kate Upton, play best
friends competing for the affection of a man who I would kill to be. Both actresses really bring their best... "assets" to this movie. My
eyes were glued to the screen because I couldn't look away from
their... "acting chops." Their "talent" really shines in a scene which
takes place in a swimming pool where both women are just being the
greatest thing God ever created. They are living proof that there is a
God. They deserve Oscars for their performances. The producers,
writers, and casting directors all deserve Oscars for putting Alexandra
and Kate together for our enjoyment.This film is also very emotional. I went through at least twenty tissue
boxes watching this film. I'd give it an 8008 out of 10 if I could.
