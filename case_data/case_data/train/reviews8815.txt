As I say simple and lazy or tight budget but which don't spoil the film

REVIEW - THE WHEELMANA friend at work recommended this film and as I'd never heard of it I
thought why not. So I have a simple question for you, do you think the bigger the budget
the better the film? Case in point The Wheelman.Obviously a tight budget but the in car camera shots are very original
and actually add to the suspense of the interesting story being told
but......During the film there are silly lazy errors that whilst don't detract
from the overall film do irritate. For example driving past the same
neon lit shop front 5 times, having the hand brake light illuminated on
the dash board, using the same frontage of a bar to drive past and
later walk past. As I say simple and lazy or tight budget but which don't spoil the
film. Plot moves along quickly enough with a few twists and turns to keep you
interested. Rating 7 out of 10
