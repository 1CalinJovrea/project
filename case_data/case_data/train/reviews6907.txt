An average film ruined by Franco and Kunis

I'll keep this short.The movie was pretty average and the casting of Mila Kunis and James
Franco was the nail in the coffin.Mila Kunis is just plain bad, wooden and awful in the role of Dizzydora
or whatever. One of the worst performances I've seen. Really shockingly
bad.Every time she opened her mouth I couldn't stop thinking "Shut up Meg".James Franco, as other reviewers have said, comes across as an
unsympathetic, slightly creepy Oz. His performance is uneven to say the
least. Over the top in some places, half asleep in others.Franco's "likeable conman" Oscar Diggs, entirely misses the mark, you
won't hate him, but you won't give a crap what happens to him.The dialogue isn't strong, some of the visual effects are a bit dodgy
and there are flaws in the direction. A strong performance from the
leads could have easily saved this movie. Sadly, the terrible casting
decisions rendered this film pretty much unwatchable for me.
