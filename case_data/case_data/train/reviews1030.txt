Naive attempt at making a good comedy - DECEIVING IMDb SCORE

I felt inclined to write a review for this film, only to help a random
reader in realizing that THE IMDb SCORE, IN THIS CASE, REPRESENTS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I can't even imagine how socially damaged a person must be in order to
find this amusing, funny or controversial in any way. It's full of
clich√©s, starting with this need Indian movies have nowadays to shoot
some part in Europe or any other candy-eye setting, even though it
plays no role and it's completely out of context. The script is
embedded in a corny emotional discourse and jokes are funny only
because they lead you to think they were written by the fart of a 3
year old mentally retarded royal family member that has been fed with
pop corn his whole life. Technically it's flawless, like a Korean music
video, with good cinematography, but absolutely no substance. I don't
know if the high score is due to a marketing campaign or the utter lack
of taste and/or intellect of its fan base.
