Great but horrible

This movie was a good movie in my opinion. The story was well-
constructed, the themes were relevant and compelling and the acting was
extraordinary, especially the reverent and Dakota Fanning (saw her in
American pastoral too the other day, she is a force to be reckoned with
in the acting world). So yes, this is a good movie.But would I recommend watching it to any of my friends or family? No,
probably not, because although it was a good movie it made me feel
horrible afterwards (as in crying in the bathroom horrible), and this
is coming from someone who has seen her fair share of horrors and
thrillers throughout the years. I don't know why, but there was
something so incredibly heart-wrenching about this movie for me that i
have barely slept last night. It was not because of the graphic
violence per se, although it didn't help of course, but just because of
the atmosphere created throughout the movie.So if you are planning on watching keep in mind that it is not for the
faint-hearted (I feel like Albus Dumbledore warning about the Triwizard
tournament lol)
