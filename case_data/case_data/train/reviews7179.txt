A welcome change

I'm a little perplexed having read a couple of user reviews - one of
them said this was movie was unbelievable and unconvincing due to the
fact that it had a love theme going on? huh? I suppose the film 'A
Nightmare on Elm Street' is unbelievable too? In fact, how many movies
are believable? 'The Dictator' is a comedy, nothing less and nothing
more than that, and that was the intention. Whether it's believable or
not is irrelevant. The movie had plenty of laugh out loud moments.I'm glad this movie headed in a different direction from his previous
efforts. Had the film continued in the same fashion as the reality TV
way, then I don't think it would have stood any chance of working, not
with this new character anyway. So to those who are expecting and
hoping for something similar to Bruno and Borat you may be left a
little disappointed, but for those who wouldn't mind seeing something
slightly different, and can take a movie for what it is, then you
should enjoy this, as I did.
