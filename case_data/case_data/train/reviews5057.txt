Terribly Disappointing

Loved the first Divergent movie. Then read all the books and thought
Neil Burger did a great job turning the first book into an accurate and
entertaining film. I was so sad to know he was not directing Insurgent.
And after seeing Insurgent, that sadness was justified.Robert Schawkle or whatever his name is did an awful job making the 2nd
book into a movie. The 2nd book was lamer than the first, but it had a
much easier plot to deal with. This movie strayed so far from the story
in the book, title should be Insurgent Undone.They even had a bigger budget for this film, yet made it shorter in
length, cramming scenes in with minimal creativity and almost zero
character development. Almost everything that occurs is not true to the
narrative in the book. Johanna appears to have no scars on her face and
she's fat, wtf. The entire villain of Jeanine is tarnished by a
completely different take on her motives. Book readers of this story
should not watch the film nor appreciate its utter suckiness. Did the
director even glance at the book? Did Veronica Roth really approve this
movie? I am appalled?
