Unusual, interesting and highly entertaining

Normally I don't write reviews but these movie differed so much from
what people told me I fell compelled to give my opinion. Because of the
bad reviews I didn't expect anything at all. In fact, I expected a
killer heroine who would beat her adversaries to pulp. However, I got
an extremely interesting, unusual and highly entertaining story, that I
found quite fascinating. Of course, it's completely unrealistically,
but the whole idea is quite funny and unusual. I generally like movies
which manage to introduce new ideas or differ from the same old boring
patterns (Iron Man 12, Final Destination 14, Transformers 8). Lucy does
that. Its just, well, cool. I absolutely enjoyed the Science Fiction
aspects and seeing Lucy developing her powers was just pure gold. So if
you don't break into tears because the movie operates on ridiculous
scientific premises, watch it and have fun. It's different, it's
interesting and its extremely entertaining.
