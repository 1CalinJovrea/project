Contrived, forced and pretentious, this movie is over worked

It took me about an hour to stop being irritated by the movie's self
consciousness, to sort of enjoy it... but the damage was done.As viewers, we have no reason to believe in the love Anna finds. He is
creepy and give us no inkling of why she might ruin her life for him.Kiera isn't bad, just annoying, considering we have no empathy for her
self indulgence. If her husband was worse, her love a lot nicer, and if
we could feel electricity between them, it would be a different matter,
but the fact is the movie is too busy being clever... it misses out on
having a heart and soul.The theatre gimmick got in the way, and seemed like a cheap way of
having Moscow backdrops without actually traveling there.5/10
