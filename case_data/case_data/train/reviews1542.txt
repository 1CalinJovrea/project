Small but cool thriller

I expected a movie in the vein of Transporter but was delighted to see
a very character driven suspense filled ride where the camera hardly
leaves the car. Fans of Frank Grillo will love this one. It's just him
driving around, swearing the entire time, trying to to survive and sort
out a huge mess he's found himself in as a getaway driver. It's simple
but that makes the surprising bursts of violence and cameos that much
better.
