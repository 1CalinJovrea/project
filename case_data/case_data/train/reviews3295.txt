What a house!

This movie was a pleasant surprise to me because I thought it was going
to be more of a "horror" movie...I wouldn't call it that, I'd call it a
terrific suspense thriller with good twists here and there. I liked the
casting and the storyline. The actors did a good job, esp. the young
college student male lead. This is a story that could have actually
happened, imo. The music was a big part of the movie, too. Good
soundtrack that, while I was aware of it, it did not take away from the
scenes but built up my anxiety! It was like another character.
Definitely worth seeing for all the right reasons. Very entertaining
and kept my attention throughout. All this without "blood & guts"
galore - made me think of the old Alfred Hitchcock-type thrillers that
depended more on the viewer's anticipation and imagination. Lastly, I
thought I had the plot figured out, but I was surprised at how wrong I
was. Smiled on my way out of the theater.
