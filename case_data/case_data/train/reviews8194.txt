thriller divided in three parts and directed by Chan-wook Park. The
first part is slow paced and shows the development of the relationship
among Sook-Hee, Lady Hideko and "Count Fujiwara". The second part shows
the abusive relationship of Uncle Kouzuki and Hideko since her
childhood. The third part has many twists and shows the fate of each
leader character. The cinematography is very beautiful and the
eroticism is elegant and stylish. The screenplay has surprising plot
points. My vote is eight.Title (Brazl): "A Criada" ("The Maid")
