The tale of two movies.

Let me just start out by saying that this movie is literally two
separate movies, that are merely tied together by a brief moment. The
first half half was engrossing, rich in character development, and
extremely well paced.Without spoiling anything, I would just like to say that I would have
given the first half of this movie an 8 or 9. Unfortunately for
whatever reason they decided to tell a story that was a great injustice
to the quality cinema that was setup. In the end you get the same story
that Cillian Murphy trudged through almost scene for scene recently. If
you are a fan of the pervious movie, and want another take on the
situation, I do recommend at least watching this film for the first
half. Otherwise it has been done before, and much better in all
aspects.
