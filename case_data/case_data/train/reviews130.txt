Zombie Love Like You've Never Seen

Going into Jonathan Levine's (50/50, The Wackness) new film Warm
Bodies, I was intrigued. I didn't know quite what I was going to get as
the concept was fresh and unique.Zombies have taken over, yet one zombie, named R, played wonderfully by
Nicholas Hoult has a mind of his own and is not your typical zombie. He
has a conscious mind at work, and soon he falls for a pretty girl named
Julie (Teresa Palmer) that he encounters.This is where the movie puts a twist on the whole zombie genre. He soon
becomes enamored by her and becomes more human, as she has stimulated
his heart. Can a zombie find solace with another person and...love?
That is the main theme of this movie, and it's a damn good one.Their chemistry will draw you in and actually make you buy it, no
matter how ridiculous it is. R's friend, M, played hilariously by Rob
Corddry steals the show with funny scene after funny scene.With Warm Bodies you get a mix of comedy, romance, and zombie-horror.
It's a fresh spin on all three, and it was truly a fun time at the
theater. It's well paced and has a great feel to it from the get-go,
mostly in part to wonderful narration from Holt, and smooth direction
from Levine.It's only February but I already found one of my early favorites of
2013.
