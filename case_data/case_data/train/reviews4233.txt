Not good.

Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler has done it again. Made another movie
that is. But I'm sad to say that, except for "Jack and Jill", it's one
of the worst movie's Adam Sandler has ever made. The movie just gives
you the feeling that they are trying to hard. Sadly both Drew and Adam,
in this movie, are'nt even funny. It's mostly the kids and Terry Crews
that supply the comedy, and it's not a lot of it. Terry is funny the
first time's you see him in the movie, but frankly, he get's old pretty
quick. So, to sum up. The movie is'nt terrible, but it's not a movie i
recommend either. The acting is kinda stale, and the jokes are so-so.
So for me, it's a 3/10.Hope you like my review!
