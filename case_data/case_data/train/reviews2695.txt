Fails Spectacularly as a Movie

When you go to a movie whose book you have read several times, You
expect it to compromise the story a little. But I did not expect it to
fail so spectacularly on every level.No character development. You get no sense of who any of the characters
are. The battle game is barely in the movie. Ender gets Dragon army; He says
"training begins now" and then it just cuts to an image of Dragon
moving up the leader board. At no point do they attempt to explain why Ender is chosen to be the
commander of the entire Earth fleet. They show none of his innovations,
leadership ability, and he is downright unlikable at times. Everyone
moves to his lunch table because he insults Bernard in class? What?
That's why people will follow him to their death? Snark?I've known for two years that they cast an Ender that's too old but I
didn't expect him to be a FOOT TALLER than Bonzo Madrid. They call
Ender a Third several times but don't bother to explain what that
means.The acting is awful (especially Ender, WE DID IT!!), the dialogue is
pathetic. The special effects are nothing groundbreaking. The simulator
scenes are pointless as you can't follow what's going on. Command School is "near the bugger home world". WHAT? How did they get
there in time?? The fleet left right after the buggers did! And it's
Molecular Disruption Device, not a Scorch the Surface of the Planet
device.Three stars just because it was recognizable as Ender's game
