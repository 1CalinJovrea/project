Not as good as the first one, but still a very enjoyable action spy flick

I found the golden circle to be a bit too clich√© in some parts, and the
antagonist's role to be somewhat forced. There was plenty of good
action and humor though with awesome references to the first movie. For
anyone considering watching this who hasn't seen the first part, please
make sure you see it first so you're much more "in" on what's happening
with this one.
