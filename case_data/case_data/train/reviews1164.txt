Happy Death Day 7/10 This is the first day of the rest of your life ....

I had low expectations and I have to say they were totally exceeded . This is an enjoyable Romantic Horror with more than a passing reference
to GROUNDHOG DAY - and the occasional reminiscing of the 15 year old
Shaun of the dead . Plus a bit of Scream , scary movie and a number of
other slasher movies . Jessica Roshe was brilliant in the starring role , you believe in her
character , her charm was endearing and despite the 10 years between
her character and actual age she played the combination of innocent
romantic with a touch a modern feisty independent female in control of
her own destiny . The only poor point was how the inevitable twist was handled - that
could have been slightly better but definitely worth seeing . Pad.A 7/10
