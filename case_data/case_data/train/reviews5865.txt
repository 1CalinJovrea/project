Long shots and long silences

The last time I was this bored in a cinema it was during the era of the
French New Wave: films like Last Year In Marienbad and Hiroshima Mon
Amour, which were all about Style (if you can call it that) rather than
Substance.Scarlett Johansson plays a mysterious woman who preys on hitch-hikers
and dropouts in Glasgow and the Scottish Lowlands. It isn't confirmed
until the end that she's a PREDATOR-style alien being, but the critics
have not kept this "spoiler" from us, so I guess it's okay to mention
it. Based on a cult novel and with a cult director (Jonathan Glazer:
SEXY BEAST), the film is full of long shots and long silences. It's
also filmed in near-total darkness, presumably to keep down the cost of
special effects, but this means the viewer can't actually tell what's
going on most of the time. Is she just killing her victims or is she
'assimilating' them? Don't know and - sorry! - don't care.I can't imagine why they needed a star of Johansson's magnitude for
this low-budget tosh. Nor can I imagine why she took the role. The
SPECIES movies covered the storyline more thrillingly and more
viscerally. If this is meant to be a pretentious "art-house" film about
an alien predating on alienated members of Scottish society, all I can
say is it definitely alienated me!
