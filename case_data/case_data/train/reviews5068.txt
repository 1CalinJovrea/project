We walked out

I cant tell you the ending because we didn't last that long. I saw
people say that bad reviews are for those who just don't get it...if
that is the case then I accept I didn't.I typically do not need dialog to explain a movie or a plot spoon fed
for me. I have an imagination and am OK with strange pacing but by half
way through the movie I should know a little more than what I knew when
I read the brief descriptions online of the movie.There was definitely interesting camera work that can be seen as
art...however, this was being shown as a movie in an everyday movie
theater. I have seen video art that I have appreciated but not in a
movie theater where the expectation is to have plot and character
development throughout the movie. A woman eating cake that is then spit
up or having a man become a flesh balloon just wasn't significant
enough for a little over half way through.I honestly have only walked out of two movies in my life and this is
one of them...we also left after another couple walked out (which
equaled about 20% of the audience).
