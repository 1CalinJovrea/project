Ice Age 4-A worthy sequel

I loved Ice Age the first one to death when I first watched it. I own
it and every once and awhile I go to my DVD cupboard and pick it up and
watch it. I disliked the sequel, Ice Age: Meltdown. The second sequel i
hated too. They added new characters and I missed the chemistry and the
funny lines that happened between just Sid the sloth, Manny and Diego
the sabre tooth tiger. They added new characters which were sometimes
funny but I missed the same three from the first one. In this third
sequel the team must have realized this by splitting Sid, Manny and
Diego with Sid's funny, odd grandma sloth away from the others on a
race to get back to the herd and to get rid of these pirates. The
pirates are entertaining as ever and very funny, the monkey played by
Peter Dinklage is really good and the main plot flies along at a
terrific pace. The jokes are fresh (most of them) and funny and you
can't help liking this film. The side plots can get a bit clich√© but I
ignored them.
