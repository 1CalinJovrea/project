park chan-wook sycophants

One of the other review writers termed it perfectly. Style over
substance. All the critics (and most of the reviewers) could talk about
was how lovely everything looked. No one cared about the story, or lack
thereof. There is no real plot, the ending has no meaning, but heaven
forbid we offend the visionary park chan-wook. Whenever someone did
comment on the story, they did the easy thing. They blamed the writer.
If a lesser known director had been in charge, and if he hadn't
compensated for lack of a good story with fancy camera techniques, thus
wowing the critics, this film would never have been given a second
look.
