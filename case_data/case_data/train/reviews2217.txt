On the sideline waiting for On The Road.

One of the aspects this film really lacked was an understanding of the
zeitgeist of Beat America in the late forties and fifties of Post-World
War Two America. The conservative middle class that Ronald Reagan
defended was in full swing and there were those who did not fit in and
did not know where to go, and this is where the Beats fit in. It was L
seven heaven square land and people with creative vision didn't have
the flavor for materialism. The idea in the mind was just as secure as
house in the suburbs. Plus I saw no James Joycean stream of
consciousness with the speed, booze and the jazz. Where was the poetry?
You see people moving around, dancing, snapping fingers and being "hip"
but no expression of what was going on within. The characters I saw
were 21st century self-centered users, dopers, and boozers who could
not afford a day of tasting wine in Napa Valley, so it's everyone
else's fault. The most real character in the film that captures the
sense of the time was Viggo Mortensen's Old Bull Lee/William S.
Burroughs. That worked. Carlo Marx, the Ginsberg attempt should have
been called Harpo Marx. I was howling at the idea that this was suppose
to be the person that wrote Howl. The art direction and cinematography
did keep me watching instead of leaving. But remember, it does say
based on the book On The Road.
