Waste of time and money

I saw the original mad max... it was violent, it had car battles, it
had minimal character development. I had very realistic expectations
going into the theater to see this new version.Never have I been more disappointed with a movie. The acting on both
leads parts was mediocre at best, with the male lead switching from
being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting.. The story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial
English students, the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack
any character development, it has horrible motorcycle stunts... and
guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all things.and come on.. a flame-throwing guitar and fat women being milked for no
explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing
guitar?... it's full of shitty clich√©s... badly cut scenes.. and lots
of explosions. Save your money see anything else and you will be better off.
