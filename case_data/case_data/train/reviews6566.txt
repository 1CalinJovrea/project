Not the Book

About 5 years ago I read the book by Michael Faber. In the book, a
strange looking woman with big boobs picks up Scottish hitchhikers,
ascertains if they're alone in the world; if they are, she takes them
to a secret place where they are anesthetized, then castrated and de-
tongued. They are then fattened to be used for food in the place she
comes from, an unnamed planet. She has had her face altered to look
human by removing her snout. She feels very ugly because of this. At
one point a male she was in love with comes to visit the secret place
and she feels terrible because of her "deformity", realizing that now
he will never love her. At one point in the book she is almost raped by
a very crude man, and blinds him with her nails. The poor men being fattened for food are depicted as being very
pathetic, and I originally thought it was a protest against the way we
treat factory farm animals. Michael Faber denied this, and maybe that's
why he hasn't protested this very vague use of his work. And, maybe
he's just hungry.This movie is so far from the book it's ridiculous, but that would have
been OK if it weren't so boring. Some of the special effects and music
were just weird enough to make what happens almost believable. Had it
been shortened; had it been a little more obvious why the men were
being caught and imprisoned in the jello stuff, I think I would have
enjoyed it more. As the previous reviewer pointed out, the scenes were
just too long.
