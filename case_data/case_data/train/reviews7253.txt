What was I thinking

Been working a lot of hours lately and called the Mrs. to say let's go
see a movie. She brought this title up and I said sure, let's go. In
the interest of full disclosure, I am not normally a guy who likes
mindless action movies (Die Hard 1 was good, 2-10 not so much), but it
had Foxx and Gyllenhaal in it, so it can't possibly be as bad as, say,
Independence Day. But, without research, I didn't realize the movies
came from the SAME GUY.But ultimately I was right, ID was a 1 star and WHD is a 2.Character and plot development? They didn't have time, they had 2
million rounds of various calibers to expend so it was laid out in the
fastest most clich√© manner possible.I am a left leaning person but the "bad guys'" and their "motivations"
were about a subtle as an anvil dropped on Wiley Coyote. And the bad
guys were a grab bag of the worst nightmares of a liberal. It seemed
like a Batman movie where the Joker, Riddler and Penguin all got
together to fight the caped crusader Tatum. Really? The only saving
grace was the $100 mil of CGI of the WH being blown up which offered
momentary respite from the, gulp, dialogue.My brain feels insulted and I feel sorry that Jamie and Maggie were so
desperate for a payday, they appeared in this. It got so bad, I excused
myself for the last 10 minutes to go to the bathroom because she bought
large drinks. Thank God.Next time, I pick the movie.
