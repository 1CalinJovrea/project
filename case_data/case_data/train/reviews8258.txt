a slight disappointment.

Sully, 2016 *Spoiler/plot- A almost documentary like bio-pic about the events
around the passenger plane emergency landing due to bird strikes in
both engines that landed the aircraft in the Hudson River off New York
City under the capable hands of Captain Sullinberger and his first
officer and flight staff.*Special Stars- Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart. DIR-Clint Eastwood.*Theme- Computer simulations are often not correct in finding true
results without including the unknown the human factor and actual
emergency timing. *Trivia/location/goofs- Most shot in and around Hudson River front near
New York City.*Emotion- A interesting story to tell about a potentially large scale
airline disaster in New Your and the Eastern seaboard post the 9-11
attacks. The film was more like a news story than watching an
experiment in dramatic cinema. That caused the film to be a slight
disappointment.*Based On- The events of the 'Miracle on the Hudson" news event during
that time.
