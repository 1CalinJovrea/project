Not quite over the rainbow

Oz the Great and Powerful .. or maybe not so great, but still highly
watchable.Franco plays the little man behind the curtain, while Kunis, normally a
favourite of mine, appears to be stuck in that tornado. Neither manage
to defy gravity but the rest of the cast were pleasant, especially
Weisz - even with her Emperor-like green force lightning. It would have been a more visually stunning Oz had the effects been
simplified. Conversely, the story lacked depth and with some rather
clumsy dialogue (especially for Kunis), it was all perhaps a little too
light and "Disney".Doesn't quite get the ruby slipper, but maybe 3 out of 5 wands.
