If it weren't for the photography, I'd rate it 0.

In 1992 (or there about) there was a fairly decent move called Point
Break. This version is loosely based on the earlier one. But the basis
is only that the characters have the same names. Point Break is an
action film best suited for testosterone-charged teen boys. The plot
goes nowhere. The acting is weak (at best). The film's attempt to
attach a philosophy to the extreme sports is juvenile at best. Point
Break is too loud. There were too many tattoos. The FBI does not really
run independent international operations. On the positive side (yes
there is one--barely), the 3D photography is spectacular. The extreme
sports scenes are impressive. If it weren't for the photography, I'd
rate this film 0. The last 3D film I saw was Friday the 13th, Part 3.
It's plot was no worse than that of Point Break. The real star of the
film is the 3D photography. It is a shame that a better plot could not
have been found. Lacking that, making an extreme sports documentary of
the sports scenes would have resulted in a much more enjoyable film.
