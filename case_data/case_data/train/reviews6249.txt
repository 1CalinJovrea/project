Gun buddy film that I found completely ordinary

I was recommended this as a no bullshit film. Well, it wasn't a
bullshit film, but it wasn't a very good one either. Or perhaps I am
just automatically annoyed by movies about people killing and double
crossing each other on a joyful American country music soundtrack. It
just feels fake.The cast is pretty good. I like Mark Wahlberg and there was a time when
I liked Denzel Washington as well. Bill Paxton used to be one of my
favourites as well, while the likes of James Mardsen, Fred Ward and
Edward James Olmos complete the cast. However, except some bad boy
posturing by Paxton and Olmos, the film is almost entirely Wahlberg and
Washington. That lead me to high expectations which, unfortunately,
were not met. They do a decent job with the script they have, but the
story is just another heist deal with a bunch of people following and
shooting each other over money.The twists were pretty predictable, the action scenes were too over the
top, while the incessant dialogue that was supposed to be funny was
mostly annoying. My conclusion: average at best, but hey, friends of
mine liked it.
