A Brand New Superman You've Never Seen Before

This is not like all the previous Superman movies. This is not
"Smallville". This is not the sequel of "Superman Returns". This is
"Man of Steel"! This movie is awesome.I am not a big fan of Superman but this is the best Superman movie I've
ever seen. (Christopher Reeve's version is also good, but this Man of
Steel is better. And.. the Brandon Routh's version? Naaaaah...) The
plot is really structural. Not so many flashbacks, so you won't get
confused. The whole storyline is just really simple. It told the very
beginning of Superman and then, yeah, his adulthood.The special effects here, I think it is as awesome as Marvel's
Avengers. Yeah, alien and superheroes, what do you expect? Battle
scenes are good, I can feel Zack Snyder "300" sensation in here.Henry Cavill succeeded bringing a whole new version of Superman to the
big screen. He wiped out all our knowledge of the previous Superman
movies and replaced it with a darker version of Superman (Nolan's kinda
"darkness") This movie is enjoyable. See? There's still hope for DC
Comics' superheroes movies.
