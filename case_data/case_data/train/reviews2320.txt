Waste of time

I saw this on telly and rang a mate. He put it on his list. It came and
we sat down to eagerly watch. First thing to happen, girl dies. We
don't known why. Then we are bored to tears for 30 minutes,so time for
a little nap. Finally some action but even the clues we are given are
soon not followed. It only walks in a straight line, bull. It crawled,
climbed,turned and otherwise did not listen to the "plot", if there
even is one. We don't know where it comes from, how it works, who it is
or anything. This movie was a great waste of time and space. Anyone
suckered into paying to see it should demand payment back and time
spent.
