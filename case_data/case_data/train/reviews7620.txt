Pure nonsense

The movie is so bad I cannot even decide what to pick to begin with.
Everything was wrong in it. Possibly one thing was good in the movie -
that it finally ended. Although I heard they plan to make a whole
franchise out of it. Back to the bad sides - the film is nonsense in
every aspect - the very idea of holding people under control by forcing
their kids to kill each other? What the...? The Capitol so rich and so
big, yet all its residents being free people. Where are all servants,
all people who provide services? In districts? But hey, someone needs
to clean those streets or polish toilets. In the film only people seen
in the Capitol are gay-like citizens and soldiers. Next, premise is set
as if the film is a teen flick. Yet, it has quite disturbing idea
behind - teens killing each other in picturesque fashion. Another thing
- couple of kids teaming up to kill other kids, while there could be
only one winner (putting aside slight change just before the end with 2
possible winners). Also, acting of young actors is wooden as hell. Last
thing that comes to my mind - advancement of the Capitol is sick -
cameras in every tree and creating(?) beasts and whatnot with some
fancy interfaces in headquarters...What the...? Where are boundaries of
their capabilities? And yet they have mines... for coal? Really guys, I
wish I hadn't spent my money for this crap.
