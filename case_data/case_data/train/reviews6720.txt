A Pointless, Plot-less and Ultimately Boring Movie

As a fan of "Boardwalk Empire" and any number of Prohibition-era movies
I was hoping "Lawless" would deliver the goods in the way its trailer
seemed to promise. But much like Shia LeBeouf's first starring vehicle
- - the HBO "Project Greenlight" film "Battle for Shaker Heights" --
this one suffers from the same lack of narrative arc and inability to
decide what kind of film it wants to be. There are a half dozen potential plot lines that pop up and, for a
split second, seem to be the point of choosing to tell this particular
story (it is based on a real life family). But just as quickly they are
dropped, never to be heard from again. You get the sense that there may
be a lot of material on a cutting room floor somewhere that might have
been assembled into a wholly different picture. The one thing the movie does accomplish is proving once again how
supremely untalented Shia LeBeouf is as an actor. Other than the
multitude of scenes where he is being beaten by one antagonist or
another (he does take a convincing a** kicking) he comes across about
as real as the CGI characters you normally see him playing against. Save your time and skip this one.
