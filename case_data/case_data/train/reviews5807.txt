It was so awful

Yeah, this movie could be probably good to some 12 year old, but to me
it was just simply awful. I went for the movie with my friend and
thorough whole movie we kept face palming and yawning from boredom.SPOILERS down there!So first of all, why did it have to be a little kid who leads the
'battle'? The older guys/commanders wanted to pretty much do what he
did then: destroy the planet because there are queens. They taught him,
and then he did the job they wanted to be done. I don't really see how
he was a 'genius' compared to those older commanders. Other than that
it was just so damn childish, the simulation battles? Really? They
wanted to make it super serious but it was just a bunch of kids playing
laser tag. No matter how hard I tried, i couldn't take it seriously. I
don't even want to describe how ridiculous was how they formed a team
of some outcasts and they just suddenly became awesome geniuses because
of Ender andd wuuuu And the ending! So basically at the end of the
movie he randomly meets with some bug, gets queen egg and says he will
now travel galaxies finding a home for it? Ehhh? What? Are you damn
serious? Come on, how dumb is that. yeah, it could be a good movie for
a kidBasically I advise anyone above 12 years old not to watch it.Also I did not read the book, just randomly went for this boring movie.
