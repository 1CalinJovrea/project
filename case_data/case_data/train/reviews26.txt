Entertaining, creative and good characters

First, I love that you put the song, Thinking About Your Love, by
Skipworth and Turner, in this movie! I've always loved their songs,
beat and talent. Great choice. The original music was also quite good!
Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly were great, as well as his wife,
Catherine Keener, who is always great, and the daughter, Hailee
Steinfeld. I love the whole idea of the movie. I could imagine it was
fun from the moment John Carney wrote it and set about making it in to
a movie. The idea for an album is too clever. Toying with love
interests also kept the movie intriguing as did the creative process
that was always at work, throughout the movie. My number one judge of a
good movie is did it hold my interest and this movie definitely did. I
think another way of putting it would be, did the movie seem like it
did not seem long, whatever the length of the movie, if it didn't seem
long, then it worked, because you lost track of time by being drawn in
to the story and characters. Great story and movie! I definitely
recommend people go see it and hope it catches fire, because it's much
better than most of the movies that are out this summer.
