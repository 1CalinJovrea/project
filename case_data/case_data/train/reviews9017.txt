A Lot of Questionable Parts

The overall ideas and the way they present the scenes were intense and
received quite the reaction it perhaps intended. First few minutes with
scary death bodies inside the walls were very promising. However, most
of the plots are poorly written, is it real that a big cartel was only
guarded by few people? But the other (men) lead characters played their
part okay, they lifted the poorly written story a little bit.Most critics go to Emily Blunt's character. Up until now, I still don't
get why was she even there. I don't get the "tension" or whatever it is
she's supposed to be showing, maybe conflicts? To me, it is unrealistic
for a field agent who's been "kicking doors since day one" really
follow the rules by the book with no adaption at all. And the
supposedly "smart" agent doesn't get how bad a cartel can be is beyond
me - I'm no police but I get how bad "cartel" can get, and I only used
imagination. I just don't get it, I feel only annoyed with the
character, she is really unnecessary. Overall, I only get this "annoyed by Emily Blunt" feeling after
watching the movie, not much anything else. I'm giving some marks for
the other actors and for the "tense".
