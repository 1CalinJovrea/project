Spoiler-free review

Well,I had mixed feelings about the first NYSM.It had its fair share of
thrills and flaws.But the movie left space open for a sequel,and here
it is.This time,Walter Mabry,a tech magnate,recruits the Horsemen into
pulling of their most impossible heist yet.Daniel Radcliffe does
justice to his role of the above mentioned tech magnate.The entire cast
returns,excluding Isla Fisher,who is replaced by Lizzy Caplan.She is
good enough to replace Fisher.Just like the predecessor,the movie's ending contains a lot of
explanations as to how they did what they were told to do.This movie
has a lot of thrills and some questions are yet again left
unanswered,but this time it is forgivable.It does have you guessing a
lot,and the characters are likable.The ending does seem a bit
implausible,and that us one of the biggest flaws in the film.Overall a decent thriller with a nice cast.I liked it better than the
first one,and hopefully the next sequel coming toward us will improve
on this one.
