Ugh...........

There's no denying that Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are comedy
magic. I've seen them be funny before in The Other Guys, a movie that
isn't groundbreaking by any means but is admittedly much better than
this movie. In Daddy's Home, I don't see that magic. So the plot is
basically about Will Ferrell who has a smoking hot wife (Linda
Cardellini) and two step-kids. Just when he thinks his life is perfect,
Cardellini's ex-husband (Mark Wahlberg) shows up for no real reason to
stay with the family indefinitely. Need I go on? This is basically Jack
and Jill without Adam Sandler. I do not feel that these hateful
characters are worth rooting for. There is a funny joke once in a while
(most notably from Hannibal Buress), but that's not saying much. I
found this movie to be more mean-spirited than funny. How on Earth do
people think this is a family movie? It's too vulgar and mean-spirited
for kids and too stupid for their parents. What is wrong with
entertainment right now?
