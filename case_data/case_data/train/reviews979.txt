Angelina Jolie is trying too hard to create an "oscar winning" epic WWII tale

Angelina Jolie's directorial debut is far too ambitious. She obviously
tried to win an Oscar for that one thinking all Hollywood WWII tales
are instant award winning movies. The problem with Unbroken is that
Angelina Jolie is a really bad storyteller. The movie drags for the
first hour and a half, with the story showing how Zamperini survived in
the pacific. While it is necessary to show how he survived the ordeal,
the way Angelina told the story is boring and completely uninteresting.
The cast is also lacking, and borderline amateurish, lacking any
emotional impact on the viewers. Jack O'Connell (Zamperini) is not
suited at all for the main role. The final scene in which he carries
the heavy wooden log over his head is far fetched and borderline
Hollywood fiction. Unbroken is ultimately broken on all parts. This 140
min motion picture is a pain to watch, and ironically the only
redeeming parts remotely interesting to me was the final cut of the
movie that shows the real Zamperini carrying the Olympic torch in
Nagano's 1998 Winter games. Save your money and skip this one.
