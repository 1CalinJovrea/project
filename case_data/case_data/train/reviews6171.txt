Great Film from a non manga fan point of view

First of all I have to say that I'm not a manga or anime fan even
though I've watched the GITS anime twice and think is amazingly deep in
terms of its story-line and philosophical topics. I went to see this
movie trying to forget the anime, letting myself be surprised by the
characters and plot. And must say that I really enjoyed the movie,
especially that "retro noir", post apocalyptic atmosphere a la Blade
Runner. I never expected to find the same scenes that appear on the
anime, that would be a complete waste of time and effort. What would be
the point on replicating the same scenes? Instead of that, the movie
adds a slightly different approach compared to the original story and
sacrifices some philosophical matters perhaps to keep the fast-paced of
the action. Another aspect worth to mention is the original score, so
magnificent, flowing with the scenes, helping to create that dark,
robotic and apocalyptic look.
