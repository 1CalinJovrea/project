this movie was simply an insult to superhero movies in general

Never watch this movie it is an insult to the superhero movie category.
Their is simply nothing good about this movie the scene were they are
drinking and chilling was OK but 99% of the film was cringy and simply
bad it ignored all sense of relationships or personal lives the
characters may have and pited them against a hastily put together
villain with the personality of a child who often had looney tunes
references and scenes, for example near the end Ultron is about to be
hit by the hulk and the whole world pauses while he has some cringy
unfunny one liner along the lines of "hey how about we call it a truce"
then he is punched away into the distance as the world starts back up
again it felt like the director had fallen asleep watching a wille e
coyote cartoon the night before filming this scene.The visuals were as great as ever but their comes a time when
explosions and different coloured iron man suits don't progress the
narrative look at the later transformer movies they made a lot of money
yet are awful films, it is disheartening that this trash is the highest
grossing superhero movie. The scripts are pathetic the MCU isn't known
for good script writing but this film is the worst of the worst every
single sentence feels like they are trying to get a cheap laugh out of
the audience and that might be OK if it was just iron man up to it but
its not every single hero and the villain are cracking wise in every
single scene and it isn't funny anymore the script writers need to be
sacked it just reminds you of green lanterns cringy script in his
standalone. A couple of the biggest mistakes in this movie from the endless list of
flaws would be how they killed off quicksilver... as any comic fan
knows you simply cannot kill a speedster with bullets it is the dumbest
way to get rid of such a character and this film did it proud by making
the stupidest portrayal of a speedster of screen their has been. They
didn't only mess up the characters origin because they don't own the
rights to the xmen which could be forgiven but they then released the
movie along side his actual portrayal in xmen Days of future past and
then went on to kill him off in the same movie he was introduced in i
mean really? Visions introduction in this movie has to be one the most
forced origin stories i have seen it didn't fit at all with the
narrative and they just kept pushing it down the audience throats it
was very poorly handled but as spiderman now holds the throne for worst
introduction into a superhero movie after Civil Wars lame ass
representation of the character it is less shocking as it seems like
the norm for the MCU to not give a crap about their characters :'(
