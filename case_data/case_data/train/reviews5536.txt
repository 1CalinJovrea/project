propaganda wins

with all the sponsorship of all kinds of commercial products and
exhibitions and promotions this rubbish has become a must-see and
nobody dares to say a bad word against it because you are not sure
people dare to agree with you while in fact almost everybody falls
asleep in the theater. you could only keep quiet during and after
seeing the movie. the story is not suitable for children. the plot is
so weak it can hardly called a comedy. the characters are a bunch of
scrambles. a total disappointment. the only thing i could do is to
sigh. in this generation we are living in a pool of propaganda.
popularity rules.
