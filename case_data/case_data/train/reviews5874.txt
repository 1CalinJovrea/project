Bad movie

Not only is the set very obviously there and visible there is very
little of it. The rooms depicted are historically quite incorrect as is
the outside depicting what looks like the back streets of London at the
time not the sort of place you would find a wealthy trader in Amsterdam
living at. But all that would be just a blemish on a otherwise average
movie. The main problem I have with the movie is that a very important
and by the clothing and position obviously wealthy man is depicted as a
man of color. Please bear in mind we are talking about 1636 - 1637
mainland Europe... There certainly where man of color but most
certainly not in positions like that this is before the slave trade had
well and truly started and +200 years before it ended. If you are
making a historical movie make it historically accurate. Just imagine
the outrage if a movie about the rise and fall of the Zulu nation was
made and a person of influence and power within the tribe would be
played by a white man...The ridiculous distortion of history in this movie is what earns it its
low score, the movie itself is not very engaging and would not have
scored higher than 6 stars.
