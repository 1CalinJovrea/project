Something Very Special

Just finished this and can't believe there's no buzz... I just HAD to
enter a review as its easily one of the best movies of the year. Take a
dash of your favourite exploitation film and mix it with your favourite
old school western and you almost have Bone Tomahawk. A movie that has
a simple premise of love and revenge. It starts out with 4 very
different characters traversing the old west frontier on a rescue
mission to save a fellas wife who was kidnapped by savages. Hilarious
one liners delivered with subtle perfection by our 4 heroes who you
will grow to love throughout this adventure. Richard Jenkins character
Chicory is especially endearing and it even features horror legend Sid
Haig, what a treat! However a little warning as what starts out as a western revenge
adventure turns into some visceral horror towards the end which may jar
some viewers. This movie has all of the trappings of a classic and it's really too
bad there's not more people talking about it at this point. If you are
a genre fan there is no way you will not love this movie. Really
something special that I foresee earning cult status, one of those
movies we will look back on and wonder how did the public and critics
miss this? Watch this immediately!
