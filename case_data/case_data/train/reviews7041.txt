"They knew what they were signing up for . . . "

" . . . but I 'Spose some people still will insist upon feeling sad
about so many Crispy Critters," D.J. Trump said after a recent advance
screening of ONLY THE BRAVE in our Oval Office. "However, I prefer
firefighters who don't let themselves get burned up; they're cheaper on
my budget," D.J. concluded. One might guess that Trump himself produced
this demeaning trivialization of America's Heroic First Responders, but
the movie credits claim that this hatchet job was sharpened by Japan's
Sony Company. Maybe the Japanese toss around terms such as
"Post-Coital" during their Locker Room Small Talk. Maybe the Japanese
would get a hoot out of one of THEIR Native People believing that the
Presidents on Mount Rushmore were "carved out by the wind and the
rain," as they say that "Cheyenne" does during ONLY THE BRAVE. Maybe
the Japanese F.D. wives would say lame things such as "It's not easy
sharing your man with a fire." But none of this hokum rings True in our
U.S. of A. Homeland. Nor does the notion that a junkie named "Donut"
would be allowed to direct his 19 buddies into the Flames of Certain
Death. Please join the Outraged Patriot Trustees in their boycott
against Sony's Trump-like War on American Values Today!
