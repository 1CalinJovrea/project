A review from someone that was actually there

I was there living in Boston at the time of the bombings. I was in the
city to try to get a look at the Marathon finish line. Luckily I didn't
get that close. I did see and hear the bombs go off. My God the blood
was everywhere I could see that from even where I was standing. It was
absolute chaos.This film is incredibly accurate. Mark Wahlberg's character is based on
several police officers experiences. There are some trolls on here
saying there was a political agenda or the facts are wrong in this
film?? They are completely out of their minds. Not even a hint of it.
Just the truth of what happened. I know I was there and I LIVED it.
Nothing hinting left or right.I had the bad luck of working only a block away from where they
captured the last terrorist in Watertown. I was stuck in our office
sitting on the floor with State troopers giving us water bottles for
like 12 hours. No one complained. The city was in lock down. I
shouldn't have even been in work. When the police and FBI captured him people came out of their houses
onto the streets clapping and celebrating as the police came by. It was
a lovely thing to witness. Rarely do films do it right like "Patriots
Day" but they some how managed to recreate that same atmosphere. It was
an extraordinary time to live in Boston with everyone coming together
and this film really depicted that.
