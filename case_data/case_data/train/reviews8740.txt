One of the unexpected.....

To sum it up, I never had even heard of Edgar Rice Burroughs even
though I read a lot of science fiction..., nor did I expect anything
from this film before going to it... I hadn't even watched its trailer.
I chose to go to it only because I had seen all the other films showing
that they were showing on the day.Result? I am very glad that I accidentally watched it! It's one of
those films... though maybe not the best of the best of the best and it
might lack some things / bells and whistles that some might want.. but
it is still one of those films that come out once in a while, which one
can watch over and over again..It will almost certainly take its place in my film collection..
