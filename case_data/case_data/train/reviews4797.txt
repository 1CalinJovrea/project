Great soundtrack, non-stop fun and chaos!

This movie tells the story of 3 teen boys, all with completely
different personalities, who decide to throw a fairly large birthday
bash, which in the end goes totally out of hand. The movie is based on
the real life story about a boy named Corey Delaney who threw a huge
party that involved the whole street. The movie has worried several
people due to the fact that teenagers are represented in a very
negative way. Reports of imitations of the Project X party have also
been in the news. I think everyone is overreacting personally but that's just me. This
movie is so much fun, and as much as it makes me want to go to a party,
I would never act so ridiculously as portrayed in Project X. The movie
can be compared to American Pie, Super bad etc with it's really
American humour and classic story line. It features filthy comedy,
naked teens, scenes of drug use and alcohol consumption and is a
non-stop thrill ride. It will leave you gritting your teeth and
covering your eyes due to it's absurd stunts and the cringe-worthy
events in it. It has a great soundtrack that makes you wanna get up and dance too!
However, the reason why I haven't rated it a ten is because towards the
end, it becomes a bit TOO dramatic and silly. But overall, it's fun,
sexy, funny, pulse racing & definitely memorable. Just like in Super
bad, you emphasize with each character and each one is completely
different to the other. If you like Super bad/American Pie, you'll love
this :)
