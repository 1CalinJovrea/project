Now I know why it's a 5/10 movie...

I'm a big movie bro man guy. Before I delve into a movie I first look
at the IMDb rating, read the summary, and then read the reviews. The
summary of the movie interested me but I did not have high hopes given
the 5/10 rating. Watching this film, I was actually very entertained. I
was hanging on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen.Right off the rip, the film lets you know what happens to the little
girl and who the captor is. The entire movie is the parents working
with what seems like the best pedophile detectives ever assembled
looking for their daughter. The movie does this Pulp Fiction thing with
the past and the present scenes flipping and flopping back and forth to
tell the story. No where near Pulp Fiction level, but the film gets the
job done telling the story with it.Viewing this movie it seemed more like a 7 rather than a 5/10. Until
the final 15 minutes... Once the climax has hit I like a film to build
its ending to a fulfilling satisfying conclusion. Once the end had
arrived everything was slammed at you instantly and "Voila!", movie
done. I'm not even exaggerating either. There was no build up or
suspense to it at all. I can't be remotely descriptive without
completely spoiling it. Poor finish to what could have been a good 7.5
film. The potential was there, the delivery was strong but poor finish.The acting performances were "good". Nothing award worthy or anything,
but the cast did "good". Except for Ryan Reynolds. I mean he could have
at least tried a little harder to actually look like a devastated
father who just lost his only daughter not knowing if she is dead or
alive. Instead he looked more like a father who just lost his daughter
at a Chuck E. Cheese's for 2 hours who was actually hiding in the ball
pit the whole time...
