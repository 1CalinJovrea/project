Two shining performances

Other reviewers have ably reviewed this film, so I'll just say that
this small gem is the best film I've seen so far this year. Both lead
actors give sparkling performances, and in scenes where they share the
screen, you might need sunglasses to handle the sun-bright intensity.Of note is that this entire film was shot in only 23 days and Leto, in
particular, said in an interview on the Daily Show, that he didn't have
much time to rehearse, making the performance even more impressive. The
only detraction was Jennifer Garner. She barely projects the authority
of a nurse, let alone a doctor, even though female doctors in the 70's
(and maybe today) were second-class citizens.
