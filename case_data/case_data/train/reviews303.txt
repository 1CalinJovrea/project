Inventive Use of Well Known Tropes

Bite was a fun, campy and compelling suspense horror in the same vein
as The Fly and every other transformation film. The characters lean
more to one dimensional but that's overshadowed by a good pace and
great storytelling. What is absolutely mind blowing is the practical
effects as our antagonist is slowly morphed into one of the more
memorable creatures in recent memory. This film is a definite watch for
any genre fan and may catch a few casual cinemaphiles off guard. I
can't play it off as a top 5 of the year but if you have the chance,
this is a must watch.Read this review and more at www.SlackJawPunks.com
