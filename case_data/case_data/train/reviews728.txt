what a delight!

Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are
breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is
such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is
such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana
is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so
great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy
and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such
heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way
Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and
it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see
it again!
