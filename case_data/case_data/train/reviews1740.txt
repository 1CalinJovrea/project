Badly executed

I watched the first 40min and was already bored, what was supposed to
be a fun introduction was sadly uneventful. The most exciting scenes
weren't all that exciting. Plot was to say the least confusing. He
rejects her and gives her the money, she is devastated. Next he sees
her during a job, she rejects him, he is chasing her, without any
explanation, suddenly Nicky is madly in love with her and there was no
indication of that whatsoever.Also Nickey completely forgets about a
big job he is supposed to do. And that only makes sense because he is
not good at 'expressing his feelings'. In the end, they are together
and in love and have forgiven each other everything. Really confusing.
I found myself forwarding trough some scenes after that first 40min. I
usually watch every minute of every film i start , even bad ones but
not this one. I love Will Smith but this was disappointing. It needs
more thrill, action and a plot that makes sense. Not recommending this
at all.
