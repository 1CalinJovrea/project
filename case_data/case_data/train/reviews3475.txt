Makes you reconsider Twilight as a good movie

After seeing the movie I just can't help but wonder why all those movie
stars agreed doing this? Sitting through the entire movie made me feel
very proud, afterward i felt really stupid.The main plot was terrible. I'm not going to explain anything because I
don't want people spending their money on this and frankly I couldn't
pay attention anymore. The funny jokes you already saw in the preview
and since you see them coming a mile away and the movie is an enormous
buzz kill you won't even laugh. If you do decide to go to Movie 43,
prepare to sit back, yawn, roll your eyes and if you're lucky you have
to go to the bathroom twice. I encourage you to get drunk.A special mention goes to Gerard Butler, who as a leprechaun does the
best work of his career in a segment so stupid it makes you want to
kick every leprechaun you will never see.This was by far the worst movie I've seen in a while.
