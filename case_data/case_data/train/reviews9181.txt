I am trying to collect myself...

Still speechless, I've come here to write this review. This movie is
one of the best movies I've ever seen. PERIOD. I loved it and am sure
YOU will too. I caught myself being suspicious of the final outcome but
it was nothing near as close as it turned out to be. Watch it. It's
thrilling, emotional, suspenseful, mind-blowing, an edge-of-your-seat
movie. These Spanish movies really are something. They manage to put
you on an emotional roller coaster and show you something you never
thought a movie could do. WOW!
