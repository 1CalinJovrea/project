Disappointing.... this movie cares more about jokes than a good plot

***Potential Spoilers***+Visuals were okay but not that great at some point it kinda looked
animated +Acting was perfect -but the plot was Horrible -Some of the comedy sequences felt Forced-Villian was underwhelming -Overacting -Pacing issuesMarvel overused their formula in this one & it just felt Choppy &
bloated there are jokes but by jokes i mean there are too many if you
are fan of Forced ripoff jokes then this movie is for you there wasn't
even much action You have a guy name Drax the Destroyer but you given
him only one Action sequence Come'on **Spoilers* Nebula tries to kills
herself to kill Gamora, and later on both of them forgive each other ?
It just felt messy The only thing i learned from GOTG 2 is that never go with high
expectation while seeing a movie
