Who are YOU trying to kid, paul-64175?

Aside from the central premise of a romance between a human woman and
an amphibious humanoid, "The Shape of Water" and "Mrs. Caliban" have
nothing in common. Dorothy is a bereaved mother estranged from her
husband who meets Larry after he's escaped; Elisa is a mute orphan who
finds the Asset while cleaning the lab where he's being held and
decides to help him get free. A cursory watching of the trailer for
"The Shape of Water" should make it clear it's telling a different
story than Ingalls' book.
