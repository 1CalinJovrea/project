Better than the first!

Was lucky enough to see an advanced screening the other day and was
glad I went! Not only was it a good horror movie, it was also actually a good movie!
The story line was solid and made sense. Far more creepier than the
original Annabelle, yet I found I didn't jump as much as I did in the
first film. Yet the atmosphere it created left me on the edge of the
seat the whole movie. Which to me is far better than jump scares! The
movie also had very few slow/boring parts if any. Some characters do
make stupid decisions which can be frustrating, but same goes for all
movies. All the actors in the film were really good, which surprised me
since most are so young. They're are a few hidden easter eggs
throughout the film that fans of Annabelle and the Conjuring series
will probably notice, which was really neat/surprising to see! This
movie also ties in perfectly the the first film in a very surprising
way that made the crowd of the theatre actually gasp in shock.Anyways a great horror movie and a great addition to the Conjuring
Universe! Will definitely see again when it officially comes out! One
of my favorite movies of the year.
