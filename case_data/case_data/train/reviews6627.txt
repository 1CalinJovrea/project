Too contradictory and illogical

The movie is watchable and perhaps entertaining, but my wife did not
like it at all. We both like thrillers, but this one was questionable
at best as such.Problems: A large group of teenage boys, on their own with no adult
direction or counseling, and they all seem to get along well? Ha! I was
in an orphanage where we were over 20 boys about the same age as in the
movie, and I can tell you that the movie's portrayal is not realistic.
These boys are at the prime age when sex is practically the most
important thing in their lives, there are no girls around, and
everything is OK? Finally, when a girl shows up, none of the boys has
any desire for her? Ha!And in spite of all this, some of the boys in the beginning appear to
be fine with the notion of not trying to escape?The filming of the boys fighting with the monster is poorly done and
the audience cannot tell what is happening. All the scenes are very up
close, short duration, and definitely nothing but confusing. Contradictions (maybe mild spoilers?) The boys have managed to create a
detailed model of the maze. Yet, at the beginning of the movie we are
told that the maze changes daily, and based on the changes we see
happen, there is no way that a model could be made. If the designated
boys would be capable of 'mapping' a portion of the maze each day, by
the time they mapped another portion the following day, the previous
day's rendition would likely already be obsolete.The monster evidently is man-made, and its legs, stingers, and so on
appear to be made of steel. Yet, the boys can hurt and even defeat the
monsters with crude wooden spears.
