Famous scenes and symbolism re-imagined beautifully but also problematically

"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel
like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the
people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'" I
have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to
read, but I do have the advantage of literacy. However, I am not Nick
Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens
Fitzgerald's classic novel "The Great Gatsby".The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguire's
Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This
Nick is a quirky, agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has
decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong.
Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish, boorish
ways of the old money and new money of Daisy, Tom, Jordan and Gatsby in
East Egg and West Egg. Much has been said about the lavish style of the film's sets and
imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly
works. I don't think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money,
extravagant mansions, brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively
score just make the whole story seem more fun. I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nick's bow-tie and
the strange shooting style (mostly prominent early on) just made
everything look cartoonish. At times, it looked like they were driving
Gatsby's yellow car through the set of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit". The
cartoon- stylings mostly affected Nick; Gatsby's parties are always
supposed to be at least slightly surreal.Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use
his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The
randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the
narrator we once trusted, was only re-confirming that this was in fact
the disaster many expected it to be. But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly, we met Daisy. And even
more importantly, Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live
up to the expectations about Gatsby Â– both the man built on wild
whispers of him being a war hero, but also the literary character so
ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective "great"
in front of his name. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone
could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in, and since Nick couldn't
do that, it was even more than I could ask of him.One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of
hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as
the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get
a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog
from the end of Daisy's dock. The one thing missing from DiCaprio's
interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a
photographer on a model shoot: "Now give me a look of hope! No, that's
anger. Give me hope! No, that's sadness. Give me hope! No, that's
frustration. Fine, just give me another look of despair."Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligan's Daisy was
probably the most accurate character re-imagined from the novel.
Starting from her introductory scene where she lay on the couch and the
wind rustled her white curtains and her diamond ring sparkled in the
daylight and then she turned to stare at Nick, she filled the screen
with her ethereal beauty and faux innocence. I don't think it's
surprising that the film takes its best form in the scenes where it's
just Gatsby and Daisy.It's hard not to get wrapped up in the grandiosity of Gatsby, the
grandiosity of the story, and the grandiosity of the film's visuals.
It's a beautiful story and it does look beautiful on the big screen,
but then comes the nagging suspicion that Luhrmann never actually read
the novel. After all, half of the quotes are just paraphrased and are
not the actual lines from Fitzgerald, and all of the scenes and famous
imagery are only the ones that have seeped into the public
consciousness (straight from the Cliffs Notes, perhaps). It should work
well as a way to introduce another generation to this accomplished work
of art, and I do applaud them for that, but it doesn't serve those who
already know the book well.
