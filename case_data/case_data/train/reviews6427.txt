Starts strong but fades by the end.

This movie could have been much more but instead, due to a nonsensical
climax, it is just another Hollywood very average effort. And they
wonder why box office takings are down these last couple of years. The
story line starts out believable enough - terrorists attack that kills
a loved one and a survivor looking for revenge. Formulaic but
watchable. The CIA, as usual in US movies of this type, appear far more
successful in surveillance and covert action than is often the case in
real life. The cast are OK and handle their roles well for the most
part, putting aside the usual clich√© or three re CIA/Special ops agents
in the field. I found the movie acceptable right up to the ending where
the bad guy sets out to Nuke the US Fleet. Nothing about that part of
the story line was in the least bit believable. It may well have played
out much better in the original book upon which the movie was based but
fails miserably here. A wasted $20. Better value waiting for the movie
to hit your movie streaming site of choice.
