Very predictable and extremely annoying

The ending makes the whole experience a huge flop and major waste of
money.Despite being a real fan of sci-fi, the ending doesn't make any sense.
If it did happen like that then none of it would've happened in the
first place as the older version would not have existed to begin with.
So, I am baffled that some one thought that would make a realistic or
entertaining ending. Really?? Like trying to pin jam to a wall.The action scenes are actually really good. Unfortunately that is the
only good thing about the movie.The younger version of the character is incredibly annoying. He does
not resemble the older version's character at all. It is really
difficult to bring the two together. The younger character lacks logic,
perception or any type of savvy. A complete moron. Again it doesn't fit
with the more sensible and intelligent older version that's trying to
save the world. I just kept wishing the younger version would grow some brain cells.
