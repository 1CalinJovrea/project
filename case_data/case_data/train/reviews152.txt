Way better than I thought!

I was so mad when I heard they were making this movie. I really thought
the real Stooges would be rolling over in their graves, but I was
pleasantly surprised how good this was.It really does a great job
getting the look and feel of the originals without being a caricature
of the Stooges. Really impressed with the actors.They all did a
wonderful job of paying homage to the originals and giving the movie
surprising heart. Larry David always cracks me up. Some of the gags
made me laugh so hard my stomach hurt. As usual I have to mention my
husband really likes this, too.Highly recommend for any Stooges fan and
great for the kiddies.
