Thrilling ride if you don't take it seriously

The sequel to the first G.I.Joe movie gathered some negative reviews
like its predecessor. This kind of thing doesn't deter me from watching
any movie and one of the reasons is because you have to understand what
kind of movie you're going to watch. I know that this is a mindless
action flick with a simple plot. It's entertaining and it doesn't have
to prove a point by being a perfectly constructed movie. It's meant to
look cool and lack any real depth. After getting that out of my system,
I can say that I enjoyed watching Retaliation and will try to watch it
many times in the future, as this is the kind of film I watch when I
wanna have fun. Ranging from The Rock to Willis this movie has very
stylistic characters that ultimately kick ass with the Snake Eyes/Storm
Shadow battles coming to mind. The special effects also look
impressive, particularly in one massive destruction scene. If you like
to just lay back and see great fights and a little eye candy then this
is the movie for you. Anyone trying to be logic about this I'll just
tell you that you are wasting your time.Rating 8/10
