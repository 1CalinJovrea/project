Stunning animation, entertaining situations

The first thing I have to say is that the animation is stunning. When
watching movies on TV, I often let my eyes wander, checking facebook
for a minute, getting up to do some exercises while I watch, but I
didn't do that for Rise of the Guardian, because every second of film
was worth watching. Imagery is very densely packed and things happen
very quickly.I also found the movie quite funny in that same quick, overstuffed way. And yet, there is something about the movie's story that kind of
bothers me. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but then I read a
review of it that described it as seeming like it was written by
committee, and I thought, yeah, that could be it. There is something
calculated and safe about the story that made me unable to entirely
connect with it. But it was still a fantastic experience.
