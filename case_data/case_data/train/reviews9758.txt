Deserves a much better rating than what people have so far given

I'll start off by saying I'm a huge Seth Macfarlane fan. I love Family
Guy and American Dad (Cleveland show has its moments too!) Ted was also
a great film in my opinion so I hoped this one would live up to my
expectations and it did not disappoint. I feel it got a low ranking
mainly from people who don't understand the sarcastic humour that was
obviously apparent throughout. I thought the film was incredibly witty,
extremely funny with constant laugh out loud moments and it also had a
decent plot with some great acting from Seth himself (who would have
known he was just as great in front of the camera?) The great cast
showcases to me that people could see great potential in the script and
all actors involved really held their own in making this film a
brilliant comedy. PS this is the first review I've ever written and I
registered specifically to help make the rating of this film more
acceptable.
