You canceled Blomkamp's Alien 5 for THIS?!!!

After the amazing Alien and Aliens, (and I believe the hard done by
Alien 3), we had a string of utter tripe from this franchise, and this
is no better. Character development is almost non existent, with the vast majority of
people there simply to die. Danny Mcbride might as well have had a leash on him, for all the acting
he was allowed to do, and James Franco showed more charisma than anyone
else in the movie...and he died before even having a speaking role.The film has gone down this ancient feel/setting, which didn't work in
AVP, or Prometheus, and just flat out bores to death in this film. And the "twist" at the end was so obvious that there was an audible
"DUH" and "NO SH*T" from onlookers in the cinema during the reveal.Ridley Scott's last two films have led me to believe a couple of
things.1. He can't do jack without a GREAT script 2. His movies look good, but
are boring as hell 3. Alien was a fluke! It was a mess of ideas that
all came together and somehow worked, but that was by accident and not
design...or at least not by Scott's design.Unless Cameron, or possibly Blomkamp (hell even give David Fincher
another go) get involved, or perhaps someone equally as talented, we're
just going to see Ridley Scott spew his old man, self indulgent
philosophical man juice all over our faces for the foreseeable future It was an OK by film standards...but by an Alien film standards it was
pure muck.And a final note. A TWIN ANDROID FIST FIGHT AKIN TO X-MEN belongs
nowhere near an Alien move.
