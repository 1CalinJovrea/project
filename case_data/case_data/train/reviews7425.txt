Top film!

Probably my favourite film of 2013 so far. Gripping all the way
through, with all the aspects you need from a feature length film. Yes,
it has the obvious overtone of 'filth', but it's not at all in its
nature... it's humorous and very touching at times. I think the casting
is brilliant and I have a new found respect for James McAvoy, who in
previous films I have found to be almost nondescript. He shines here,
brighter than most Oscar winning performers I've seen. Ray Donovan's
Eddie Marson is also fantastic in his role, so well cast - he's funny
and warm in such a subtle way. This is not one of those situations when
someone can rightly say 'the book is better' - I think the job has been
done so well of adapting it into film format that the book is not
better at all, just a different experience. It is honestly a film I
want to see again. I think an instant classic, not filthy at all, but
pure class.
