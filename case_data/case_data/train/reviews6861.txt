Kevin Smith makes Human Centipede

I haven't enjoyed a moment of this movie. I am sick to death of torture porn and I'm sick to death of critics
claiming these movies to be "social commentary" on all sorts of things.
And man do critics love that sort of shtick, starting with Salo and
ending with Red State. And people saying that this movie is not to be taken seriously - you
know, when a movie is bad, it's not necessarily 'ironically bad',
sometimes it's just bad. When something is funny - I don't have to pretend it's funny and go
into it with a certain mindset. Like I don't have to look at this sick
crap and pretend that it is somehow funny. It's too silly to be a horror flick and too disturbing to be a comedy.
It's like a bad joke.
