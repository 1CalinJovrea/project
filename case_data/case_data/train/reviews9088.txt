Unlikey story of Indian Moslem servant "capturing" Queen Victoria

Actually 6 1/2. First half of film enjoyable for its light humor and
contrasts. second half bogs down somewhat and becomes over sentimental,
but whole film enjoyable if you relax and enjoy it, even though in some
parts more ridiculous than a story I wrote wherein Disraeli, Victoria's
Prime Minister seeks help of Sherlock Holmes to recover the Queen's
stolen favorite tea cozy. Film really turns on savoring the Queen as
portrayed in an acting gem.
