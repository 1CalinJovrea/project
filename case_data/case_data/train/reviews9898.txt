Legal/historical drama, not action

Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting
yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally
about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were
exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like "The Americans"
(FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage
action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see
is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his
mission. Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my
preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts
right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge
of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of
talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a
little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you
might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But
thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie
instead.
