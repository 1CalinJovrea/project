This is not an Arnie action flick...

I think one of the reasons this film has a fairly low score is that a
lot of people are seeing Arnie/zombies and thinking they are going to
be watching a big budget blockbuster with Arnie running around blowing
heads off. This, for me, was much better. It was slow moving,
thoughtful and Arnie's performance as Wade in it was a revelation to
someone who has never been a huge fan. Breslin's depiction of a
troubled teen, Maggie, facing her own mortality and horrific end was
subtle but effective. A lot of people have been questioning why make it
a zombie film and not just any infection but without Maggie's disease
making her ultimately dangerous, Wade would not have had to wrestle
with his conscience in what he had to do, making the whole film
pointless. If you preferred The Road to The Walking Dead then this is
the film for you. If you're an Arnie fan expecting the usual fodder
then I would suggest skipping this and digging out your Terminator
box-set.
