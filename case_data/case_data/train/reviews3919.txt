I feel as though I am one of the cause

I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and appreciate most of the other
recognizable actor s in this film. This film is too long, too boring,
and meanders like a mid-western river. I kept waiting and waiting for
the story line to pick up, but it was at it's peak on the floor. Amy
Adams played a great antagonist, but her role was stunted. Joaquin
Pheonix did well to play an alcoholic with a few cards shy of a deck,
but hasn't everyone played that role well? Hoffman was not so
disappointing as his material was just not that good. This was not a
story line worth making into a movie. I wrote a better ending walking
out of the movie theater. After the master proclaims we all have our
masters, Freddie bashes in his head with a white statuette. The
antagonist returns to the room to find the new master in the chair and
she smiles. To heap any platitudes on this movie is to become one with
the cause. Stay home, save your money, clean your toilets.
