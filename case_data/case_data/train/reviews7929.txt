A really fun ride and I'll certainly watch it more than once!

A really thrill of a ride. The Indominous Rex was a really cool idea
and handed well. A lot of action and storyline. Most characters
developed well and the last scene was a peach! However, there were some
faults but they didn't destroy the film in any way, shape or form.The park was introduced in a very modern way and the teenager was like
he would be, on his phone when there are dinosaurs!!! Staring at girls
of course while queuing for the Gyrosphere was also very relatable.Glad the Trex animatronic came back...and didn't die because that would
have disappointed me as it would have been a Jurassic Park 3 repeat.
Though my jaw-dropped at the awesomeness that was when the Trex and
Velociraptor fought together against the I-Rex. Seriously a really good
film and (in my opinion) competes for the best of the four films.
