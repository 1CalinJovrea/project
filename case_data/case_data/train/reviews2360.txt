I will beat you like a Cherokee drum!!

Here's The Lowedown on "The Fate of the Furious" (PG-13 - Theatrical -
US)...I will beat you like a Cherokee drum!!Genre: Action/VehicleMy Score: 8.5Cast=10 Acting=6 Plot=7 Ending=10 Story=6 Action=10 Pace=8 F/X=10
Vehicle=10 Crash=8When a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of terrorism and a
betrayal of those closest to him, the crew face trials that will test
them as never before. "You're gonna close your eyes on world war 3 or you're gonna saddle up
and save the entire damn world." With a franchise that has the
blueprint on how to one-up the previous film, this is exactly what
you'd expect. It is full of over the top action scenes and well placed
puns. Unfortunately, the story played out without any real
surprises...I was calling every move before it happened. Good thing
that's not what I cared about...Bombs, Brutes, and Babes, baby!!!
