Hellishly stupid plot

If the whole plot basis of a film is that someone who owns an asset
that can generate 600 thousand dollars a year can't raise 40 thousand
dollars to pay off the loan on it, then you really beggar belief. Why
would anyone take part in several armed robberies and risk frying on an
electric chair rather than spending 30 minutes with a half decent
financial adviser is preposterous. If you can suspend disbelief over
the ludicrous plot then what do we make of the rest of the film. Jeff
Bridges does an amateurish impression of Marlon Brando in the Godfather
with his mouth stuffed with tissue so that you struggle to fully
understand a single sentence he says. How this film scores a review of
8.2 beggars belief and makes me lose all credibility in review scores
on this site. It is currently scoring higher than 'No country for old
men' when it's not a patch on that film.
