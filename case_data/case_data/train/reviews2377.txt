Unbelievable and way overrated

I cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching
a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there
are not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are
unbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the
wilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not
getting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold
water.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god
the list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me
started...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing
was a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to
back the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also
ridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.
