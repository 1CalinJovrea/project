Such a shame

I am a big fan of the first taken movie, it not only had professional
cinematography but great action, suspense and originality. Now this
sequel i am ashamed to say was a money grab by the producers. Now Luc
Besson and Robert wrote the original script without being pressured by
their superiors to be limited to a marketable plot, unfortunately thats
what has happened to Taken 2. The plot follows Liam Neeson after the events of the original and well
its the pretty much an identical situation. The climax however is the main issue , it's rushed. It just happens and
I was left wondering why it just ended so fast. I cannot say this movie was terrible because it wasn't, it was just a
movie that could not even close live up to its predecessor due to lack
of depth and originality. Don't waste your money at the cinemas Wait till its on DVD
