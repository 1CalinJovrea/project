Brilliant

Brilliant film! Taking a cutting edge look and delusion and feelings of
inferiority. It shows clearly what men will do if they feel the world
hasn't given them enough, that it's their birthright to own that which
other men have worked hard to have. The importance of introspection
can't be stressed enough here.Now to the film, the acting is believable, the humor is such that you
feel sickened and delighted at the same time, for this film is INSANE
and cruel, yet it is shown entirely from the view of the main
characters, watching it their twisted minds became clear and
understandable, all their actions can be justified, yet underneath
this, horror slowly rises in the viewer (in me) at how far one is
willing to go just to prove something to himself.Definitely worth seeing!And the best/worst part is that the whole film is true. That really
boggles the mind.
