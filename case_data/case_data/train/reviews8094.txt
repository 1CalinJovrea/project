Where was the tension?

I think the film was good, but didn't really live up to expectations. I
didn't find it that scary. Admittedly, one of the jump scares worked on
me but otherwise I never felt any dread looming in the pit of my
stomach. The film is gorier than the mini series. That's for sure. And
I liked that updated aspect, but nothing particularly shocked me. There
was quite a bit of special effects that just were not very good. And I
think that's a big reason why I just wasn't very scared.The other dumb thing I want to mention is that sometimes the characters
fell into predictable horror movie tropes. Its just kind of silly when
they've already been scared by Pennywise many times. Knows this all
"isn't real" and yet will wander off by one of the missing kids going
"Come here". I mean, really? You're going to fall for that? I think
what does save this film are the performances. Bill does a good job
with Pennywise. However, he does lack the charm that Tim Curry had. But
those were always going to be big shoes to fill. (Clown pun not
intended). The kids though were amazing. In particular Jaeden Lieberher
(who played Bill) and Sophia Lillis (who played Bev) were the
standouts. I also want to give a shoutout to Nicholas Hamilton (who
played Henry) for managing to make me feel empathy for a bully. Finn
Wolfhard (from Stranger Things) plays Richie who is meant to be the
jokester of the group. And Finn does well with that character. I just
wish the writers had laid off from the jokes some of the times. You're
supposed to be building tension and it kind of gets ruined when he
opens his mouth to make a joke about period blood or whatever.I see the potential in this film. And I think it could have been really
good. I just think they spent too much focus on "shock value" rather
than building on an atmosphere.
