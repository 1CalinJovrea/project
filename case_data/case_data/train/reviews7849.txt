Silence Of The Lambs

Agnus Dei that is, Lambs of God. What an extraordinary film.Martin
Scorsese confirms his seriousness of intent and his enormous respect
for his audience.He rates us so highly that he confides in us, telling
us something that clearly comes straight out of his heart. Dry, severe,
an intellectual's sensibility that becomes clear and accessible to all
as we realize that Scorsese is not trying to sell us something but just
to tell us, to share with us something that obsesses him. I was
enthralled and moved throughout. The performances in a Scorsese film
are always superb but in Silence, Andrews Garfield goes a step beyond
superb. He managed to make his priest someone I knew personally even if
his reality is far, far away from us in time and space. A masterpiece.
