Artificial movie for an idiotic generation...

8.5 on IMDb?!??! Seriously?!?!?!You can rate this movie SO high... if you wanna be stimulated
emotionally in a gratuitous manner + if your IQ level is REALLY low +
if you like actors who can't act and look absolutely artificial on the
screen (what the heck happened to Laura Dern? she used to be a slightly
better actor... now she looks like she's joined the ranks of the
completely artificialized Americans... fake smiles, fake emotions;
those kids act completely unrealistic also... this is NOT how people
who will die from cancer would behave...). Have someone on the BIG
screen cry for a few minutes... the audience will cry too, of course.
It's like the yawning that's contagious... But why was it that I didn't
care at all for ANY of the characters, by the end of the movie?... The
only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news
about his death... But even that wasn't connected emotionally to
anything else in the movie... I can list a hundred movies that are WAY
more emotional than this pile of artificial cr*p... And what the f**k
is with that pack of cigarettes on the boy's coffin? I know cigarettes
eventually PUT you in the coffin, but his was not the case... I wonder
what message they wanted to convey to the viewers...
