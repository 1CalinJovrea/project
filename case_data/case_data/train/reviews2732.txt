Amazing movie in every way!

Decided to ignore the lackluster critic reviews and saw Valerian and
the City of a Thousand Planets tonight at the movie theater. Bottom
line......this movie is downright brilliant! It has a great, fast-paced
plot, stunning visuals, and the acting is great! I can't even fathom
why anyone would give this movie a bad review. Go see it...this is Sci-
Fi at its best people!!!!
