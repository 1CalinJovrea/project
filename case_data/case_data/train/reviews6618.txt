A must-watch!

I was really excited about this movie when the trailer came out, I
could not wait to see it. But after reading multiple bad comments about
the film, I got worried.But I must say, nothing to worry about. The movie is kinda weird maybe,
but if you watch the trailer you know what you're settling in for, I
suppose. The story develops itself kinda slow, but that didn't bother me cause I
was intrigued by the story. The movie has good actors, a great setting
and atmosphere. It kinda reminded me of Shutter Island, I think because of the whole
"mystery island with a weird cure-institution"-thing.
