Missed as a comedy.

If you don't want your sex video to get out don't make one. If you
don't want to be embarrassed by the release of a bad movie don't make
it as it will get out. Cameron Diaz is capable of better as she has
proved it. Jason Segal does his best work with Muppets. Even Rob Lowe
and Jack Black are given nothing to do.The movie is a long 94 minutes. It fails the number one requirement of
a comedy. It just isn't funny. There are about three laughs in ninety
plus minutes. There are some dog humor that doesn't feel fresh until
the Siri joke. There a couple of anti-Semitic jokes that fall flat. If
that isn't bad enough they try for an epilepsy joke.The dialogue is peppered with "F" bombs. There's a we've seen it before
drug use scene that serves to cut to the familiar dog joke material.The trailers and the title give away the high concept idea. The script
feels like it's been around since tapes were replaced by digital
videos. Many set ups didn't deliver a punch line and when they do the
timing is off. The Ipad product placement works best.Don't waist your time or money to see this on the big screen. It will
have a good run on a platform coming to you soon until word of mouth
gets out.
