It sure ain't Locke, but with Frank Grillo giving his best work, it needn't be...

The mostly positive reviews about Wheelman are pretty much spot-on. One
reviewer put it nicely - a (mostly) A-grade thriller wrapped around a
B-grade Netflix budget. Well done to everyone involved.Original plot? No, but then again, in our
seen-everything-done-everything world, few things truly are. What you
get with Wheelman is small, taut, lean and an extremely focused
80minutes of tension.Frank Grillo is no Tom Hardy - and, as much as I like Jon Bernthal, I
will always think Grillo is the more perfect choice for Marvel's
Punisher. Here in Wheelman, even more so than in The Purge films,
Grillo's character is that flawed everyman trying to put a criminal
past behind him yet suddenly finds himself in the middle of an
impossible situation. He's terrific here - like Locke, the vast
majority of the film takes place inside a car with Grillo being the
only one on screen and like Locke, Grillo carries it off nicely.Yes, lots of cursing and F-bombs, but in the urban NYC sprawl that I
grew up in, the dialog in Wheelman rang largely true. Quite a few
interesting interior vehicle shots as well and of course we do get a
couple of chase scenes befitting a film called "Wheelman".Yes, where are the cops, blah blah blah...Suspension of disbelief folks
as it's fiction.Grillo is but one of the myriad hard-working, talented actors out there
who truly deserves his big break and hopefully he will get it soon.
This one won't win any awards but Frank Grillo, actor and first time
producer here can feel proud of what he's accomplished...a very
polished, no-nonsense, focused, gritty and easily digestible thriller.A very solid 7 indeed.
