Rated on pure entertainment factor

This movie is so fun and so campy. Is it winning any awards?...no. But
the acting is good. It's got a great cast and they do a really good
job. I was very pleasantly surprised with Pride and Prejudice and
Zombies.It's a romance. It's horror. It's comedy.Go for the fun of it and don't take it seriously. This is not a classic
Victorian novel and this is not a true tale of zombies like most die
hard zombie fans think of them (ie. The Walking Dead or the more
classic Night of the Living Dead). I am a true zombie lover. I loved
"28 Days Later", "The Walking Dead", "Zombieland", etc. This is not one
of those, so if you don't expect to see that when you go to this movie,
I think you will enjoy it.
