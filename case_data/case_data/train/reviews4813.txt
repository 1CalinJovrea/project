This is a disgrace of a film

First, let me say that Eastwood's direction, Cooper's acting and the
screenplay are all competent. Were this film a wholly fictional account
of a warrior with special skills put in the service of his comrades it
would be quite serviceable, though no more than that.However, here was an opportunity to show the complexities of a man
hailed as an American hero; and by complexities, I mean the thoroughly
odious aspects of Chris Kyle's character. The man enjoyed killing
people, regarding his targets as savages, and he bragged about killing
looters in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - even if he didn't,
because we don't know for certain, what kind of man declares proudly
his murderous inclinations? In short, he was far from a good man.
Dismally, you would never know this from the simple-minded depiction of
him as an all American Hero in Eastwood's film.Likewise, there is not a shred of awareness in the film that the US
involvement in Iraq might have been illegal and was certainly
catastrophic for the Iraqis. The film's approach is to display every
Iraqi man, woman and even child as intent on murdering "good" American
troops and therefore deserving of their fate, both at the end of Kyle's
rifle and under the boot of American troops generally.I don't know what Eastwood was thinking when he made this film. Perhaps
he saw an easy way to make money by appealing to the misplaced
patriotism of some Americans. What I do know is that this is a
disgusting film.
