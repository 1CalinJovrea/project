A Remake That Will Divide The Audience

If the original version of "Oldboy" has a perfect 10 out 10, this one
has a mixed 6 out 10.At first, I just came back from the theater and I found this movie a
very poor remake if I compare it with the excellence, the complexity
and power of the Asian film. That film was purely brilliance. So this
new version was really promising but had the bar raising too high.From Spike Lee we could expect a truly mesmerizing movie or a very weak
one. And in this case I say that this one is not so bad as it looks
like here. It's obvious that some people is apparently going too far.
It's a disappointing movie, but not a bad movie. It focuses too much in
blood and gory instead of the script and the complexity of the
characters and situations. The ending can be a bit upsetting for some
viewers.Josh Brolin is one of the better things of this version. His
performance is as good as he always do his roles. The rest of the cast
is between average or good. Nothing remarkable under my watch.So, this "Oldboy" is not a brilliant movie or a powerful remake but
it's an entertaining one. It's weird and bloody. Be prepared for that.
