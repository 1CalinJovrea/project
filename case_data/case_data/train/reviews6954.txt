A lot of content, not a lot of substance

First of, Gold is better than its IMDb rating and meta-score. I feel
this movie is a victim of the studio going wild with a pair of
scissors, trying to make it short(er) (even at 2 hours) to please the
mainstream audience, but while doing that, this movie loses a lot of
substance. Character development is lacking, apart from our
protagonist, so it doesn't really feel like we get to know them. One
moment we have a new (seemingly an important) character, and then he or
she will either disappear or roam in the background. I guess that
happens when you start cutting. I suspect there's a great version of
this movie out there, and I'd rather watch a 3 hour version with
everything included, than this. The movie also takes place in the late
80's(?) or early 90's, but I don't feel like time was important here,
which makes things a little confusing. I have no idea if they've been
at something for a week, a month, or five years. The whole movie also feels a little rushed in the sense that it tries
to get to the end as quickly as possible. It lacks the details; Slow
down a little, speak to us, breathe. I want to know more, I want to see
more, but it ends up being a National Geographic article instead of a
book. It's far from bad though, and it's an enjoyable watch. Just don't go in
expecting a masterpiece.
