The Serial-Killer

"The Limehouse Golem" is a dark thriller with beautiful art direction
and costumes in the Nineteenth Century in London and great
performances, highlighting Douglas Booth and Olivia Cooke.
Unfortunately the screenplay is pretentious, turning the story of a
serial-killer into a complete and deceptive mess. The conclusion, when
the elder Scotland Yard Inspector John Kildare finds the true identity
of the notorious serial- killer Golem and hides from everybody, is
awful. He lets an innocent man be blamed so that the real killer does
not become famous. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available
