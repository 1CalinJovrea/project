When we won't feel a thing for a great loss...

I am observing closely Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career and he's giving
the best performances in all his films. He's one of top 5 best actor of
our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the
recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and
performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it
was, but not that great.What he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and
fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically
become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted
script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with
the wonderful director.It was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way
of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able
feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search
for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was
good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts,
but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not
have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.I think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a
weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a
patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title
was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for
that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for
Gyllenhaal alone. I can't say it should have been better, because
there's nothing to get better, everything was at its best.7/10
