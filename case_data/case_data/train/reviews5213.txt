Argo- The dictionary should have this movie name next to the word boring.

Watching this movie was a test of patience for myself. Boring, bad
script, falsified facts and the acting was mediocre. Only brainwashed
patriots might believe the storyline presented here and find it
entertaining.The portrayal of Iran in this movie is biased and seems geared towards
propaganda for war. America solves the problem(s) they caused by doing
something dramatic that makes no sense; right, nothing new here.**Spoiler**: This film can be summarized as 6 Americans (whom I didn't
connect with or care about at all) get captured and America saves the
day by making making a fake movie to ensure their escape. I normally don't bother rating movies. This one was so bad that I
joined IMDb so I could give this garbage movie the rating it justly
deserves.
