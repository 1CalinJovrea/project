About that special place in hell...

Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they torture
Hitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based a
movie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember the
horror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades of
gray.While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather a
rape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; that
would be an extra nail in the movie's coffin.But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; and
the average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might still
enjoy it.
