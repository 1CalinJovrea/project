Beyond My Imagination

This movie is most appreciated. My favorite in the movie is the Count
Dracula. There were so many creative things put in this. I honestly did
not personally like the little boy myself, whereas the Count saw so
much in him being his grandson, impressive. It was cute to see the girl
with her dad. I don't recall seeing the 1st installment. The father was
pretty cool but a little annoying. I guess no little pets in this one
save for the hundreds or whatever of the little wolf creatures. I guess
the little boy was cute in some ways, save for things like the bulbous
red curly hair. He was a little mushy for even if he is a little boy.
Anyway, most of what makes this movie what it is is the collective work
of all the artists, especially also with the storyboard sequence humor,
and the voice of Dracula.
