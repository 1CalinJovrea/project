Pleasantly surprised based on my own Rom-Com(ish) Experiences...

The long term benefits of sunscreen have been scientifically proved
....Well where do I start. I'm not a huge rom-com fan, I just sort of end
up watching them whenever I have a spare bit of time; such as some idle
Sunday morning (as that's when I watched it) , but based on the
previous rom-comes which I have seen I felt that this one is one of the
better ones.You will be pleased to know that after a lot of thought I have in fact
found a place to start my review. One area of the film which I
particularly liked is the relationship between the characters, it
looked natural to me as a viewer. This is evident from the first
meeting of the two protagonists (or in filmy terms 'the meet-cute) to
the final scene, it just seemed to flow to me. However one slight
critique here is that the timeframe which these two get to know each
other in is slightly unrealistic as it is set over one weekend; giving
it a slight inter textual feel of the Shakespeare Tragedy Romeo and
Juliet. The acting by all protagonists I feel is excellent; couldn't have chose
a better cast even though I hadn't really seen any of them before;
apart from the lead male protagonist (who I love from the internship)
and his British friend (which I believe to be from Tracy beaker?,
that's right I'm cool). However don't base your judgement of this film on my own meandering
review; watch it yourself and see just how good it is. Trust me on the sunscreen. ( just thought I'd quote some Baz Luhrmann -
everybody's free to wear sunscreen throughout my review)
