Absolute garbage and typical Hollywood adaptation

First time ever writing a review here. Had to do it now because I don't
want people like me who enjoyed the original anime/manga to waste their
time on this movie. Firstly i didn't know this was a movie until it was released on
Netflix. I'm not going into detail, but there is a reason its a long
manga/anime and not a movie.Anyway, the protagonist isn't interesting, L is not interesting and the
plot is garbage. They took all the good thing from the original and
butchered it and made another bad American adaptation.Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed.Save yourself the misery and never watch this.
