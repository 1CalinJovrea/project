Love, this film

This is my first review here so bear with me. As I'm sure most of you
know, this movie is based on a novel Where rainbows end by Cecilia
Ahern. It is just loosely based on it, because the story differs
somewhat. I won't reveal anything else, to avoid spoilers. All I'll say
is that it works because it captures the essence of the book. The
chemistry between the two main actors is unbelievably good and the
supporting cast is good as well. I warmly recommend this film to
everybody. How probable the plot, that is up to a viewer to decide. It
was for me. If you're a hopeless romantic, you're gonna enjoy this one.
If you're a realist, you're probably gonna find certain situations a
bit too much and out there. Nonetheless I left the theater with a smile
on my face. The movie makes you believe that anything is possible and
that one should never give up on hope.
