even if you like chick flicks, don't watch this.

the director and writer have tried their level best to try and make the
lives of the two poor souls( the 2 lead actors) extremely complicated,
what they didn't realize is that they are making the two look really
stupid.The intellectuals behind the movie go way out of there way to make
Alex's partners look extremely bad, is it because the his partners are
that bad that he realizes that he loves Rosie or he loves Rosie because
of Rosie. I am really surprised that this movie has a rating of more
than 3 on IMDb.under-acted by 2 non-actors, if movies are only for looks, you are
better off hiring models.This movie might be worth the watch if you are cooking some food and
you want some noise in the background. otherwise, please don't waste
your time at all on this.
