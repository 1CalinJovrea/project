This movie is just barely watchable. Basically it consists of
irritatingly cutsie baby-faced actors poorly imitating intelligent
scientists engaged in deep philosophical conversation. The way the
actors interact with each other and their environment barely resembles
reality. The romance is shallow and cringe-worthy, like something a preteen
would think up: Anonymous hook-ups and stalking somehow portrayed as an
appealing, convincing backdrop to a life-changing romance.The main character is a scientist who has exactly two coworkers, and
zero managers or bosses or advisors, throughout his entire career, and
can fly around the world at a moments notice on a whim.Usually I'm not one to criticize the "science" in a movie like this,
but they didn't even try! In the end it comes down to a guy randomly
finding a little girl on the street, (of course she's the right girl,
of course she speaks English!) and dragging her into a hotel, and no
one raises an eyebrow at this. Then he gives her a multiple choice test
in the most biased and error-prone way imaginable. Then even though the
questions were all 1:3/33% chance, for some reason its unimpressive
that she got 44% correct. Statistically, that would impressive if there
wasn't someone emotionally attached to the outcome and who knows all
the right answers, staring at the test-taker in the face while they
make their choices.Then the ending is open-ended in a way that is intended to be
though-provoking and deep, but actually is anti-climactic.Okay, so now that my ranting is out of the way, actually the movie
isn't that bad. It has some touching moments occasionally, its worth
watching if you're bored. But the ending leaves much to be desired, it
feels unfinished, and overall the movie just seems like its geared to
appeal to preteens whose brains are not fully formed and don't really
have a fleshed-out concept of how the adult-world works.
