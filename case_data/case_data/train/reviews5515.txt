A morbid psychosexual thriller that flirts with both silliness and cinematic greatness.

After skimming through some of these reviews, I'm not sure what people
were expecting from Knock Knock. It plays out like a cross between No
Good Deed and The Loved Ones. The story isn't original of course but
this is Eli Roth's take on a home invasion thriller and it's
refreshingly sadistic. Two strangers knock on Keanu Reeves' door, he
invites them in, their sociopathic tendencies start to peek through,
and things escalate from there. The acting is largely impressive. Keanu
comes across as silly at times but, for the most part, he fits the part
of the innocent dad and he bounces off the chemistry of the two female
leads very well.Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas really make this movie what it is. They
have palpable charisma, and they provide Reeves excellent scenarios to
react to. The dialogue could sound outlandish and childish if read in a
different context, but Izzo and de Armas pull it all off with a
straight face and their character's intentions progress to the
downright sinister. It's actually interesting subject matter, and Roth
does have something to say with this film, and I believe he
accomplishes it elegantly with as little blood as possible.Knock Knock is not perfect - it goes on for a few minutes too long and
sometimes Reeves reads lines as if he'd just shot up heroin, but it's
intriguing and truly captivating once it gets going and becomes a
psychological horror house in its finest moments. Callously covering up
a dead body with papier-mâché? That's chilling. Being buried alive?
Macabre. It's nice to see Roth hasn't lost his touch, and the humor is
definitely there intentional or not. I highly recommend this movie to
fans of home invasion thrillers. Just don't go in expecting a polished
masterpiece; Knock Knock is depraved, raw and filthy in the best ways
possible.
