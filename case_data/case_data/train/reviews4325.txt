worst movie

It's so ridiculous and boring. After the first 15 min, the scenes are
all fighting and repetitive. It's not even exciting because you know
the hero will not die or injured, although there is thousands of
bullets from the enemies. It doesn't have sensible story line. Killing
all that people in the start for his car. So what? It's just like that
some action scenes and fighting and car crashes and etc. are attached
and created the movie. because there isn't any strong story at all. You
can easily predict what's going to happen. When I finished watching
this, I was like why I waste my time on this movie!
