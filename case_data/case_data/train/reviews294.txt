A Good Movie for laughs

This will be my first review in IMDb, because this was the first movie
that made me laugh so hard.First of all, you might think this movie sucks or it's worthless, but
this movie didn't bore me at all and it made me laugh, I don't usually
laugh a lot in movies, but this one got me.The story starts with Jay Baruchel reuniting with Seth Rogen, Seth,
then invites Jay to come with him to James Franco's new house. After
that, all things get screwed up and they discover that it is the
Apocalypse. They decide to stay in James Franco's house until the
Apocalypse ends.I love the way that they play as their selves and create a story all
through out the movie. If you think this movie has no potential, that
is where you are wrong. This movie will make your day and (IMO) and
make you smile.
