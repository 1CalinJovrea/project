A Beautiful Nightmare.

The latest directorial effort from fashion designer Tom Ford, Nocturnal
Animals is an assault on the senses. I say this as a complement though.
From the gaudy and gratuitous opening credits to it's varied palette of
moody colours, it screams excess and expense. But unlike many movies
that feature visuals like these, the movie doesn't paint them
positively. Instead, our main character is trapped in a terrifying
limbo of what she admits is her own creation. One day, she receives a
manuscript from her ex-husband, played by Jake Gyllenhal. Due to their
rough split almost two decades prior, she reads into every word. The manuscript weaves a story that resonates with her broken state of
living. She wonders. Is it a threat? Just a harmless attempt to
reconnect? Or something else entirely? Cue top class acting and a story
that is as dark as they come. This is a short review and there is a
reason why. Nocturnal Animals is a movie best experienced with as
little prior knowledge of the plot as possible. So, get out there. In
the jungle of mostly underwhelming movies that is 2016, this is a movie
you can't miss out on.
