horror forgotten?

this script must have been written with a mouse button keyboard.a thin
bleak story with no horror and bundles of scenes spinning out
nowhere.why-what-where and when,we are all untold. the film has no
answer to no questions, and ends with an end,a dead end by the way.the
directors should take a look back to the 80's and learn the genre.so i
am sorry,i will give 0 stars to this movie
