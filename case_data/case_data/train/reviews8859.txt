It has been years since I have seen a movie that I had such low expectations for...

That I loved so much. I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening
awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter
go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was
terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the
heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and
loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just
skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.I am pretty confident that it is going to be the surprise box office
hit of the fall and it is so much better than the films that it is
bound to be compared to like Mean Girls, Bring it On, and even
Bridesmaids. Speaking of Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson almost steals the show with every
scene that she is involved with being hilarious, and in a lesser movie
her scenes most certainly would be worth paying the price of admission
alone, but there are so many other talents involved. Elizabeth Banks
has never been funnier. Skylar Astin as the love interest is also
terrific though he needs to change his name, because for me the name
Skylar brings only one thing to mind and she is married to Walter
White.This is no Oscar Winner, I am certain that I will see a dozen or so
better movies this year, but none will having me laughing and smiling
as much.
