A movie for cinema lovers

You either love it or hate it I guess. Definitely in that first
category.More and more I tend to dislike the usual chewed up/spat out run of the
mill Hollywood fare that comes by in dozens. I mainly concentrate on
European and Asian cinema. But every now and then America still shows
signs of movie-greatness with beauty's like "Killing them softly", "The
Counsellor" and now this crime drama that I think can most definitely
be compared with those films. Old fashioned character- and story driven movie-making that hits you in
the gut instead of computer driven video game making that only makes
your gut grow from falling asleep on the couch.And characters it brings. Enough has been said about the beautifully
understated role by Tom Hardy, and James Gandolfini, whom I've always
enjoyed watching perform, certainly leaves a big void with this being
his last performance, man, will he be missed. Noomi Rapace is also
noteworthy, but the scene-stealer for me is, again, Matthias
Schoenaerts. A menacing, explosive and powerful presence and a very
worthy, and deserved, international debut.And it may be purely coincidental (don't think so) but this great
director, Belgian Michael Roskam, known for "Bullhead"(check it out,
please) is a European. As is Ridley Scott and Andrew Dominik, while not
European, sure as hell ain't from the states either. People making
great American movies/stories with new flair and originality. Okay, so I might be overreacting a little, but I sure loved it and hope
to see many more like it.Moviegoers will hate this, Cinemalovers will love this 8/10
