Couldn't have asked for a better reunion!

I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning
to end. Now, of course this is a bias opinion coming from an immense
fan of the series. Although I just couldn't help but be impressed with
how well the reunion turned out and here is exactly why I think this:It was a very great move to have professional writers that were already
passionate fans of the series get on board for the reunion. It
perfectly depicts the concept of growing up and the realization of
where their lives have become at the age of 30. There are a lot of
sequels these days that end up just trying to rehash what the original
possessed but offering nothing further. Thus I was very pleased that
American Reunion presented as a tremendous movie in it's own right
whilst having everything that made the first 2 movies lovable and
providing a lot of interesting story lines that make plenty of room for
great jokes and heart felt moments.All in all I highly recommend anyone watch the movie. I understand that
some people have different opinions and have certain boundaries when it
comes to gross-out humor but I definitely think the heart felt moments
certainly outweigh the rest while still being wildly hilarious and
clever. It is a brilliant nostalgic throwback that provides everything
that you would have wanted as a fan of the franchise.
