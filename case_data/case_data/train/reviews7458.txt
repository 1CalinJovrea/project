Biopic of the end of empire

I enjoyed the movie - it was a bit paint by numbers but it covered a
huge area of his life and his motivations, it was also a story of
decline, the derring-do of the British empire and particular type of
hero. I think that he has been overlooked because he 'failed' but the
film shows how he respected the cultures he found, in contrast to the
other members of RGS. The class-based snobbery of the period is also
well represented. Highly watchable and recommended.
