Formulaic

So I enjoyed watching James Marsden as I always do. But...I agree with
the other reviews in that the young and old Dawson did not look
ANYTHING alike. This was really distracting. There is a line in the
movie where the Amanda comments that Dawson had gotten better looking.
I thought this was humorous. Also, Nicholas Sparks is so predictable.
There is always rain, water, a letter of some sort, cancer, Daddy
disapproves of the boyfriend, etc etc. I could see the ending coming
like a very very slow train. I found myself saying "NO!" out loud to
the TV screen! Actors did a great job, but the plot was clich√©. Perhaps
if the screenwriters could have somehow fixed the story a bit...this
would have been a better movie.
