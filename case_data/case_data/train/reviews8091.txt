Not the next "Mean Girls" by any means but funny and entertaining enough

Take a look around and survey your group of friends, are they all good
looking? Then you might be the designated ugly fat friend, or the DUFF.Bianca's life becomes undone when someone reveals to her that she is
the DUFF to her prettier and more popular high school friends.
Frustrated, she retaliates by instigating the status quo and social
hierarchy at her school.This comedy finds its laughs as Bianca, played by Mae Whitman,
desperately tries to reinvent herself and overcome DUFF status. A
chronic DUFF, she can't do it alone, and makes a deal with her neighbor
Wesley (Robbie Amell) to undo the damage.A fan of Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell is the clear star of this film.
Playing an endearing jock without being a cliché is quite a feat and
his performance is scene stealing without being a parody.From that plot alone there is not much to the story within the high
school film The Duff. The film injects an archetype antagonist, played
by Bella Thorne, the most classic mean girl ever invented. This
character's existence is solely responsible for the plot feasibly being
stretched to feature film length  otherwise the DUFF would be
relegated to a solitary episode plot line on a WB television series.Though briefly marketed as the Mean Girls of the 2010's, it really is
in an inferior class in comparison to the phenom that was (and is) Mean
Girls. The writing, plot and direction are all ho-hum: funny enough for
a one time watch with your girlfriends with popcorn, but that's about
it.Please check out our website for FULL reviews of all the recent
