Don't waste your money or time

Well what can I say, I was forced to see this by my daughter, we wanted
to see the new Dracula untold, I thought the idea sounded OK until the
movie started that is, it was quite boring to say the least. No one
entered the maze until a fare chunk of the movie had already passed,
the title should of been called "field talker" because that's what they
did for the most part. I can't fault the acting or camera work but I
can fault the script, seems like its just another teenage book made
into a movie to cash in on the craze of making movies from books, (it's
long been suggested that Hollywood has no original ideas left and copy
books and movie ideas from foreign movie makers) To add to my
disappointment the movie didn't end but pretty much says to be
continued, what? I sat through this crap for them to tell me that I'm
up for another $8.50 to see what happens next, The guy from "meet the
millers" who's also in another great new (English) movie called
"plastic" should be ashamed of being involved in this commercial
drivel. Average rating of 7.4 what!
