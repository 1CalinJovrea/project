could have been so much better

A coming-of-age story needs a good dramatic contrast of before/after.
Unfortunately, there's not nearly enough in this film. For all the
beautiful detail (wonderful locations, costumes, interiors, etc.), the
film feels flat. This Vera Brittain is angry and miserable at the
beginning, angry and miserable in the middle, and angry and miserable
at the end. It would have helped a lot if there had been more warmth, idealism, and
happiness in the "before" sections. The male characters manage this,
but Vikander fell flat, for me. For viewers to care about Vera, she
needs to be somewhat likable and sympathetic. Instead she seems to have
a chip on her shoulder throughout. I would have been more engaged in
the story if there had been some range in her acting.
