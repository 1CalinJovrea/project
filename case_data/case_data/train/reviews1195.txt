Something to offend everyone

This movie is so disgustingly crude that it's a wonder it managed an R
(vs. NC-17) rating. I guess that there is no explicit sex in it, but I
don't really know as I couldn't make it past the scene where Bryan
Cranston needs help from Keegan-Michael Key in the bathroom after a
bowel movement. In other words, it's worse than juvenile, it's
intentionally offensive (at least in every scene that I saw).If you saw the trailer I did, you probably expected a little more
over-the-top version of Meet the Parents ... but don't be fooled.
What's more than over-the-top ... outrageous? But it's worse than that
- those involved in making this picture are relentlessly Hell- bent on
shocking the audience at every point. There is even obscene artwork in
virtually every scene.James Franco, playing a classless Silicon Valley billionaire, wants to
marry Michiganians Cranston and (Tina Fey-lookalike) Megan Mullally's
daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch). But when the parents come out to meet
Franco, he actually discusses the possibility of "doing" (avoiding
using the F-word; Franco's only vocabulary) Stephanie's mother WITH
STEPHANIE! This is after he'd encouraged her 15 year old brother to
share his favorite cuss words, then high- fiving him.I have no idea who the audience for this is supposed to be ...
actually, it'd be really tragic if there is one.
