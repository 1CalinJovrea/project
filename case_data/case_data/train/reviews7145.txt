Watch to induce epileptic seizures...without prior history

Seeing the previous films, I wasn't going in with any expectations at
all. Just wanted to have some mind numbing fun. But this movie doesn't
even let you do that. Because of the constant shaking, nerve damaging
ways of switching cameras and nausea inducing editing, you can hardly
keep up (with whatever that this movie has to keep up with.)There is no sense in the movie, even for a Sci-Fi one where you shut
off critical parts of the brain. The acting was bad, the characters
were ridiculous and plot holes so big that the entire Raccoon city
could fit in it with the underground hive.Have you or anyone in your family doubts that you might be prone to
epileptic seizures? Take them to this movie. If this doesn't trigger it, you can safely
walk the earth knowing nothing else will.
