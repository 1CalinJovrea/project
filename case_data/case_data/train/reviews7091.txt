Homage to Blanche

Best Woody's made in years, a tour de force by Cate Blanchett and great
support from Sally Hawkins and all the cast. For anyone who loves
'Streetcar' this is a sly and skillful homage, updating some threads
for 21st century life while lifting other scenes almost directly from
Elia Kazan's 1950s classic. Happily the wife-beating is in the past,
but Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) is nevertheless Jasmine's nemesis, a
brooding presence and harbinger of doom for the NY socialite whose life
is unraveling before us. I don't usual wince audibly in the theatre but
some scenes are so raw and toe-curling I couldn't help it, you're
constantly oscillating between laughter and tears.
