When cast members write their own reviews....

Mind blowing realism , tense , powerful, amazing performances , just
brilliant ...............................it is not. This must have been observed by his
blind guide dog, he must be deaf too. This movie is simply rubbish.Switched it off twenty odd minutes in. Reminds me of Essex boys, but
Essex boys was worse, √ç'll have to give them that. Extremely poor
acting and an extremely poor story-line.Those these actors, I commend your bravery and hope you made a bundle.
However please be advised that actors generally need charisma, talent
and preferable be pleasing to watch. Making a gangster-movie seems to
be the favorite thing to do for untalented, slightly chubby, not so
good looking and uncharismatic actors.
