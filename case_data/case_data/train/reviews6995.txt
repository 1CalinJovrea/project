Tulip Flu

'Tulip Fever' transforms a promising idea into Dutch farce as its
script heaps unnecessary complications onto a tale of marital
infidelity in 17th century Amsterdam. The film opens with beautiful
penniless Sophia being married off to a wealthy middle-aged merchant
who desires a male heir. After three years have passed and no child has
appeared, the merchant commissions a double portrait of himself and his
young wife for posterity.When Sophia unwisely falls for the debt-laden artist, everything seems
nicely set up for some intense domestic double-dealing, but director
Chadwick drowns the narrative in a torrent of subplots. While Sophia
cavorts with the artist in his garret, her maid has been dallying with
a fishmonger in the scullery. Before too long, the lovers of both
mistress and servant are speculating in Holland's tulip-mania bubble to
improve their fortunes and romantic prospects. Meanwhile, the two women
hatch an implausible plan to deal with their own problems. As the
scheming becomes increasingly absurd, the story falls apart and the
actors lose faith in their characters. Long before the end, most of the
audience will have joined them, as the resolution to all the financial
intrigues and amorous chicanery turns the final act into slapstick
melodrama.
