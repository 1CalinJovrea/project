Surprisingly Good Sci-fi Movie.

If you have seen Cube(1997) and its subsequent sequels, then you will
really enjoy this film. The film is based on an original idea and
screenplay. Travis Milloy writes and directs this film with a very
professional touch. I am sure he will become a top director after some
years. But the person I am most impressed with is Jacob Yoffee who directs the
music. The background music enhances this film with a true sci-fi feel,
reminiscent of Tangerine Dream the German music group that had a lot of
success during the eighties. The cinematography is also superbly
handled by Jason Nolte. Plot of the film: Frank Lerner awakes to find himself trapped in an
automated prison cell with an artificial intelligence monitoring him in
order to keep him alive. Later on, Frank starts to get flashbacks of
his last movements before he was captured. He forms a bond with the
artificial intelligence, which is a rotating camera attached to the
ceiling of his cell. Sooner or later Frank realizes that a lot of
people have met their end in his cell and he must rely on his wits in
order to escape.Verdict: Superb sci-fi 7/10. Christopher Soren Kelly who plays the lead
reminds me of the excellent actor Sam Rockwell who played Wild Bill
Wharton in The Green Mile 1999.More Sci-fi movies: Escape from New York(1981), The Running Man(1987),
Fortress(1992).
