deserving an 8/10, well worth your time and money

OK, I'll admit, I went into this film with not very high expectations,
I left on the other hand pleasantly surprised and genuinely creeped
out. Daniel Radcliffe, while not the best actor, also exceeded my
expectations. The movie theater was packed and people really seemed to
be enjoying themselves. People screamed when they were meant to and
shivered accordingly. At the end the theater broke out in applause, and
it was the most packed theater I've seen since the midnight premiere of
Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Walking out into the lobby
people were still blown away, and I myself could not believe what just
happened. So what I'm saying is, if you're looking for a fun night to
be creeped out in an old fashioned horror film sort of way, go see the
Woman In Black, you will not be disappointed.
