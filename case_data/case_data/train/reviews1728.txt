Best Fast ever made.

This was certainly best movie in Fast And The Furious series. Best in
all 6 movies. Like always movie goes on series of events, whose
solution could only be fast cars and action. Laws of physics do not
apply to Fast Movies, because following laws of physics is something
Hollywood has given responsibility to Christopher Nolan. So trailers
made me to go watch this movie on first day and it was certainly the
best idea. It was more fun that any of fast movie. Great mix of comedy,
action, romance too. An extraordinary villain was present here, who was
undoubtedly best among all the villains we have seen before in this
series. Making money and steeling was not the focus, but something else
was at the stake. So watching criminals work with the police, this was
just amazing. Dwayne Johnson, The Rock again rocks the action scenes
with his never ending style. Best Fast movie ever Made.
