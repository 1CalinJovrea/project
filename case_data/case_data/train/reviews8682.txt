Visually gorgeous, but a lazy screenplay holds it back from greatness.

Gore Verbinski has created a visually splendid thriller/horror film,
which creates a wonderfully foreboding atmosphere. However, what could
have been a great film is marred by a convoluted screenplay that falls
to pieces in its final act, and is riddled with plot holes. I waited
patiently for all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place (and with
the running time approaching 2 and a half hours, it's quite a wait),
yet ultimately I was left somewhat confused and underwhelmed by how it
all played out. I still recommend it for the wonderful cinematography and chilling
atmosphere. But with some liberal editing and a tighter screenplay we
could have had a real classic on our hands. Shame.
