Much Ado about nothing.....

February is a supposedly suspenseful horror, that's not long on
suspense and well, um, that's about it.There's lots of spooky, grating music, that's so overdone you quickly
become numb to its effect. The consistently overly austere setting and
what can only be described as "gray" characterizations only exacerbates
and further fosters a sense of emotional dislocation on the part of the
viewer. Or put another, the tone and atmosphere established in this film is so
overly creepy it actually stops being creepy and gradually becomes
farcical. Any sense of suspense evaporates as the whole thing simply
ceases to be all that believable. A fact that's not helped at all by an
evil spirit that looks a lot like the shadow of a guy in a rabbit suit
with big comical "rabbity" ears. Worse still, this film never really goes anywhere terribly interesting
or all that frightening. There's nothing clever on offer either, that
might have redeemed this flick. The acting is sound and at times, even quite good. The camera work and
cinematography is refined too. Sadly there's little anyone can do, to
lift a film that, in my opinion, has so little to say. Four out of ten from me.
