Finally no Hollywood crap

This is what I call a good movie. But it is not for everyone. After
seeing the trailer, lots of people thought they get a horror spectacle.
I'll never understand why, because the trailer itself is very slow,
just like the whole movie.The movies has a slow pace but its still intense. And it will only feel
intense if you give in and not wait for action and speed. This movie is
no Hollywood spectacle.The movie feels like a depiction of real life. No stupid jokes and
exaggerated action scenes. Slow and calm dialogues. I liked the way the
witch was enacted too. I am happy to see that she is not shown as a
crazy woman jumping around eating toads.On the other side, I wished there would have been a deeper insight into
the witches thoughts.So... go and see if you want more than silly Hollywood witches.
