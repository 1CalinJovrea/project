I thought the Spanish movie "La cara oculta - The Hidden Face" was the
best mystery/thriller I had seen ever. But here comes - El cuerpo - The
Body. Mystery and Thrill - from start to finish. Not much to comment on
the plot. A body from the morgue goes missing and a detective is onto
it . That is the story. Plenty of undetectable twists .The mother of
all twists is the last scene. That hits one after another and on the
face. Enjoyed this thoroughly. Very good background music score. Very
good photography and cinematography. Very good screen play. A buffet of
treat.Thanks to you guys "Oriol Paulo and Lara Sendim" - Muchas gracias
! My rating is 9/10.
