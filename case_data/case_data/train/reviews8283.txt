Total garbage

How on Earth is this film rated so highly? There's no true wit or
intelligence within the script, it's just stupid, lame jokes & a lot of
unnecessary swearing which the movie seems to think is funny. I'm not
saying swearing doesn't have a place in film, but overusing them to
this extent is extremely noticeable & came across as childish.The story is about as boring and formulaic as they come. First act;
they enter college, second act; their relationship is tested, third
act; everything works out, happy ending. It's like they didn't even try
to be different or original.Every single character is a one-dimensional stereotype. They never
exhibit traits that show any form of depth; they were all so formulaic
it felt like all their actions were generated from a computer.Overall, absolute piece of garbage. If you're American and enjoy
flat-out idiotic humor devoid of any wit or intelligence, I recommend
it, but otherwise stay away.
