Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal, dispiriting & ultimately pointless.

In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly & left for dead, but
managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic
handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac
McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music & gray-scale tones
throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever
shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a
test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal,
dispiriting & ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men
actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass,
after exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies
himself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters?
Ptui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.
