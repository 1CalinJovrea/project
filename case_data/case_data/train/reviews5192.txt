Charming, but uneven, entertaining yet unsatisfying, "Big Eyes"
definitely does not come into the category of great or important true
story movies. It is clearly a change of style for Tim Burton (if is
very relieving not to see Johhny Depp acting all weird), but even
though the time at the theater doesn't in any way feel wasted or
boring, instead quite pleasant, the movie is too chaotic and quirky for
it to be taken seriously in any way.A premise that has lots of potential is partially wasted in aimless
scenes or in repetitiveness. The film doesn't really make a point about
anything and has way too much flashy stuff to feel grounded in any way.
There would be nothing wrong there, but the fact that in it's uneven
tone there seems to emerge a will to give an accurate and worthy
recounting of these events makes so much of the drama feel out of
nowhere. Storytelling isn't exactly where the movie succeeds. The
courtroom scenes are definitely the weakest of all and made me mad
multiple times because of their absolute preposterousness.Anyways, the film is built around a strong enough cast, photography,
premise, writing and design that it would be hard to get bored in
anyway. The pace is fluent enough and the duration of the film is just
about right for the content it presents. I wanted to like this more and
see the story be given a better portrayal, but in no way I could say
"Big Eyes" was a failure.
