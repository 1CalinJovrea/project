Go Go Technodrome.

Mindless, superhero, brain candy, zoom. Bad jokes, great effects,
explosions go boom.My neck muscles are tighter than piano wires and I've sweated enough
this week to fill a swimming pool. At the end of a long week of mad
work, sometimes you just want to sit down and switch off your brain.So, thank you, turtles. I like it when you hit stuff.Is this a dumb movie? The obvious answer is yes, of course it's dumb,
it's more superhero schlock: kiddie-fare enjoyed by 30-somethings.But I don't know. Any fight scene with martial arts is a bit like a
magician's sleight of hand. It's too fast to follow completely, but if
done well we can see sophistication in the movement, and a fight is a
bit of a story in itself. There's the setup, escalation of conflict,
then boom, resolution. The best parts of this movie are not of the
turtles talking but when things go all smashy-smash-smash. Smash.Smash.Where the film drags is with its human characters, who have way too
much screen time. Casey Jones is a 30-something who talks like a
12-year-old ("Someday, I'm going to be a detective!") and Shredder,
regrettably, is mostly without his mask and doesn't throw a single pie.
Megan Fox is wearing less makeup this time around, but in "acting,"
less is more. Baxter Stockman is likable, but doesn't turn into a giant
fly.But it's inoffensive, fun to look at, and a nice thing to shut your
brain off to while recovering from a long week of sweaty haste.
