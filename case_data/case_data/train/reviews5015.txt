didn't work for me

I should have been on high alert when the studio changed the trailer.
the second one was better. the story is two guys looking for a missing
girl. Russell is a tough guy and Ryan is a detective. I know what the
screen writer was going for-laughs-unfortunately these two aren't
comedians and can't deliver funny lines. they have absolutely no
chemistry together. Ryan has a young daughter who is thrown into the
mix, and in many instances the atmosphere is inappropriate for her age
group. I guess that is supposed to be funny. I enjoy these guys very
much as actors, so I was disappointed. I realize movies are subjective
and I notice the 8+ rating. I also noticed that if this is a success
there will be a sequel.
