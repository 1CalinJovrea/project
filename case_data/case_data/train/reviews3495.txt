A beautifully understated take on the saturated Vampire subgenre

From the moment I heard that Jim Jarmusch was working on a vampire film
I was intrigued and was desperate to see what the result would be. It
did not disappoint for a second. Enchantingly atmospheric, it centres around Adam and Eve, two age-old
vampires whose marriage has endured centuries of humanity's slap-dash
efforts at building worthwhile civilisations.It strikes a very unusual tone for a film in this genre, although fans
of Jarmusch will be used to a certain amount of genre-straddling and
refusal to make easily pigeon-holed films. Don't come into this
expecting a plot driven film, or especially not a CGI gore-fest akin to
a lot of the lazily produced horror/fantasy material that seems so
abundant at the moment. The focus is much more on creating an authentic
feel and intriguing characters. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are
virtually infallible in convincingly playing world-weary characters who
have lived through plagues, inquisitions and the development of a
flawed modern society. Mia Wasikowska's arrival as Eve's volatile sister Ava is foreseen with
a palpable sense of foreboding, providing an uneasy counterpart to Adam
and Eve's relative level-headedness, and steps up the stakes for the
final act.John Hurt also deserves a mention for his typically assured and
accomplished performance, albeit in a relatively small part.Overall, an extremely adept piece of filmmaking, which has revitalised
a genre which I, for one, was about ready to call time on.
