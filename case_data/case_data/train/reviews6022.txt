Doubters vs. innovators

The wrong slant has been put on this fascinating and provocative film.
It is not the usual clich√© about the dangers of technology going too
far, but rather it is about the dangers of fear and suspicion that can
destroy miraculously innovative ideas.We at first are led to appreciate the wonder of being able to make the
world a better place through the latest research on AI. We see how
powerful it can be for good -- healing the sick and restoring the
planet and even preserving consciousness. The "victors" in this film are a group who from the beginning are
advocating that people throw away their computers and who early in the
film actually blow up research labs across the nation. But then,
surprisingly, we are led by several trusted main characters to become
fearful. It's more than we can trust to transfer an entire human brain
(even one with benevolent intentions) to a computer and let it continue
to create.The interesting part is that by the very end, we realize that the real
tragedy of the film is the victory of the fear-mongering destroyers.
Computers are used only as door-stops.There is an intriguing ray of hope about a protected garden that may
not have been destroyed.... Whatever your ideas about technology, this intelligent film will
stimulate a great discussion with friends!
