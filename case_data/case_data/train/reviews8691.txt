I don't understand the hate for this film

Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work
since "Unbreakable", but I have to admit that this movie made me
believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so
many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an
excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny
at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to
haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out
for yourself and make your own decision.
