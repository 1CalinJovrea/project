All I see is a mediocre film

Marc Forster has delivered some decent big budget films in the past,
like "World War Z" and "Quantum of Solace," but "All I See is You" is
smaller and a less epic offering. The story is an interesting one, a
woman who has been blind for a long time has a procedure to get her
eyesight back. The recovery period is long but ultimately successful in
helping her gain her eyesight back, but she slowly starts realizing her
life is not at all what it seems. I thought the cast did a fine job, Blake Lively played a blind woman
quite well and Jason Clarke played her supportive yet angry husband.The problem with this movie is that nothing really happens, it tried to
hit the viewer with a couple twists but those ultimately fell flat.
Another problem was that it tried to use sex to further the narrative
but that really just got in the way and felt forced. Maybe Marc was
trying to distract the viewer with sex so they don't realize his movie
is boring. A sort of plus was the handful of cool visuals that were
scattered throughout the film, I won't tell you what they are because I
don't really know how to explain them and if you choose to see it, I
don't want to give anything away.My Suggestion: See it if you like Blake Lively or Jason Clarke enough
to sit through a boring movie starring them.Seen at TIFF 2016.
