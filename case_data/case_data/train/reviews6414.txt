Vengeance seeking Statham propels this swell slice of pulp fiction

PARKER (2013) *** Jason Statham, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Chiklis, Nick
Nolte, Wendell Pierce, Clifton Collins, Jr., Bobby Cannavale, Patti
LuPone, Carlos Carrasco, Michah Hauptman, Emma Booth. Statham serves
well as a revenge seeking crook with a code who is out for vengeance -
and his slice of the pie - after a heist of double crosses leaves him
for dead. High octane actioner with a swell ensemble and Lopez' best on
screen role since "Out Of Sight" as the fly-in- the-ointment real
estate agent that comes into Statham's plan-of-action-by default.
Directed with gumption by vet Taylor Hackford and John C. McLaughlin's
crackerjack adaptation of the late, great pulp fiction scribe Donald E.
Weslake's novel "Flashfire" (under the Richard Stark pseudonym).
