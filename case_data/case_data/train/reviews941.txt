Don't waste your time

The worst piece of dirt this year so far. No logic, no plot, no story,
but with Anthony Hopkins. Why did Anthony participated in this dirt
ball mind crap, I don't know but it is not enough. This movie is empty,
it is a 2 hours long advertisement of various car manufacturers and
American military. Worst Transformers ever, please let this garbage
just die and don't bother us with actors who just can not save this
movie. It was just awful to watch, I couldn't believe the low quality
dialogues and just the waste of money for junk CGI no one really cares
about. But why did Mr. Hopkins lower himself to participate in this
charade of a movie is beyond me.WORST MOVIE 2017
