Everyone will enjoy this flick except history buffs

If your looking for a good action flick with a decent plot this is the
movie for you. With a 90min runtime I was expecting this movie to feel
"rushed", it felt far from that. The action was great, it did not
disappoint with all the cool vampire abilities you see in the trailer,
especially transforming into a group of bats. Being a Dracula movie
there are things you have to expect, yes he receives his power by
drinking blood, having all the vulnerabilities as every vampire (which
they do very good in this movie) but the way this movie makes you root
for Vlad(Dracula) you actually find yourself engulfed in the movie
wanting him to overcome the darkness and win. However if you are a
history buff and it irks you when movies take real life people and
change their history for a movie, you will not enjoy this because it is
loosely based off Vlad the Impaler. My Review 8/10 Excellent
