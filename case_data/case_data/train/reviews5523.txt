Worst movie I have ever seen!

I can't believe I paid to see it, and that I sat through the whole
thing. I was bored out of my mind, depressed, and sickened. It was not
funny, it was not fun, it was miserable and I couldn't be paid to see
it again. The only funny parts were the parts in the previews.
Otherwise everything was awkward, gory, dumb, and depressing. There was
nothing good about this movie!!! The plot would all over the place as
was the dialog, the parts that were supposed to be funny were awkward
and thrown in carelessly. The use of gore was over-done, uncomfortable,
and sickening. It was a horrible depressing story, with a depressing
ending nobody wants to see. Just because you put a bunch of good actors
in doesn't mean it's gonna be good. Nice try!
