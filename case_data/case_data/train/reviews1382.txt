So bad.

This film is absolutely terrible. The main plot point makes very little
sense, as the basis for the film is precipitated by a completely
unnecessary risk taken by the elite DEA task force.The characters are abysmally written. Each one has fully embraced their
"gutter trash" personas so that they can be the "best undercover agents
in the DEA". The result of this is that every member of the team is
completely unlikeable, a trait which extends even to Schwarzenegger's
John 'Breacher' Wharton, and I found myself not caring in the least
when a character was killed off.The female characters in the film were unattractive, in every respect.Please keep in mind, Schwarzenegger is my favorite action star. End of
Watch is one of my favorite films. I greatly enjoyed Harsh Times.Did it seem like the filmmakers made an effort to incorporate realistic
room-clearing tactics into the film? Yes, and it should always be
appreciated when consultants with actual experience in a field are
hired to contribute to a film's authenticity. But it doesn't compete
with the nonsensical storyline or the forced, unbelievable interactions
between the static, uninteresting characters.This film is absolutely terrible.
