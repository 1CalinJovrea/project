A Jack Reacher-Like Movie

I really like this movie, but Jack Reacher was better. It was good
enough for me to satisfy myself after watching it, Really recommend it.
Every time I watch a good movie "goosebumps" always comes in and can
already tell if it is a good movie. This one, it had but not that
quite. I really like the story line, it was predictable plot since I
watched Jack Reacher many times. Realistic fight scenes, Rarely find
this in Movies, Of course I wont forget John Wick. But this one, Its
like you've been through enough fight scenes that you are already tired
in just a few actions fighting them but it was really like real. Im not
good enough at reviewing a movie but I always review a movie that is
good in my eyes. It was worth watching. I like the ending, She was like Kate Beckinsfield for minutes, I really
thought it was her. Other than that, You should watch it. One of the
underrated or low-watched movies.
