Great movie, well acted and true story!

As a career military man, I usually go into these with skepticism. I
expect to be underwhelmed by the broad generalities and poorly-fit
uniforms. This movie was a pleasant surprise. My wife picked it because
it is a "dog movie." I really enjoyed it. The scenes of battle are very
realistic: lots of moving parts, fog and friction of war, hot and dirty
and unsure who is running towards you; enemy or friend. I wish they'd
gotten someone besides Common to play the guy in charge of the guard
dogs. This guy is so racist it is hard to watch him act. Remember how
he had a moment of silence for Trayvon at the awards show AFTER the
trial showed he was high, trespassing, and told his girlfriend he was
about to kill a guy? Wow. If we did that for every criminal we'd never
get anything done. Anyway, hopefully he can keep from making this movie
about him and BLM when it wins awards, and it should! The bond between
the dog and handler was obvious. The movie was entertaining from start
to finish. Well done! And ... the uniforms fit!
