This movie is supposed to be entertaining, and because it succeeded in
that regard as far as I am concerned, it's a very good movie. This is the kind of movie you should watch with a glass of beer in your
hand. Enjoy the story for what it is and drink your beer. If you
approach this movie with an analytic mind, you're probably not going to
enjoy it. The plot's got more holes in it than a Swiss cheese and it
shouldn't be treated as a deep, psychological study of the human mind.Who the heck has the patience for that? Just enjoy it on a basic, emotional level and I'm sure you'll have a
good time.Enjoy!
