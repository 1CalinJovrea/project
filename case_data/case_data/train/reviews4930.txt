Engaging, but only in parts!

Based on the novel The Prone Gunman, by Jean-Patrick Manchette, 'The
Gunman' is a decent action-thriller, that's engaging, but only in
parts. While the action has sharpness to it, the thriller aspect
doesn't entirely work.'The Gunman' Synopsis: A sniper on a mercenary assassination team,
kills the minister of mines of the Congo. Terrier's successful kill
shot forces him into hiding. Returning to the Congo years later, he
becomes the target of a hit squad himself.'The Gunman' begins with force, but loses momentum mid-way. I wasn't
rooting for the hero on the run, after a point. Also, the identity of
the culprit, lacks the bite & offers no shock value. Its predictable to
the core. But, the action-sequences work! Not only are they sharply
choreographed & executed, they also lend toughness to the narrative. Don Macpherson, Pete Travis & Sean Penn's Screenplay is okay. Though it
isn't without merit, it still isn't powerful enough. Pierre Morel's
Direction is stylish. Cinematography is impressive. Editing is
ordinary. Marco Beltrami's Score is fine.Performance-Wise: Sean Penn delivers a committed performance, yet
again! He enacts the protagonist with complete honesty & his striking
physique stands out. He looks terrific here! Jasmine Trinca is nicely
restrained. Javier Bardem looks jaded & least interested in the
goings-on. Ray Winstone is, as always, competent. Mark Rylance is fair.
Idris Elba is wasted. On the whole, 'The Gunman' is a so-so fare.
