IndiMovie at its best

Location: the best of nature Characters: credible Actors: high class;
extraordinary, sensitive, convincingly, touching, outstanding. They
gave all what they can. Directors: they took a very important theme of
these days and made a very sensitive story. Music: There is no one
better who fits to the movie.I recommend that this film should be shown everywhere - from big cities
to small villages because it is a very important theme for young people
and their relationship to there parents. Fathers and sons go and watch
it! 10 points out of 10.
