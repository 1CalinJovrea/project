god awful

don't go see this movie....EVER!!!!! if you like movies that waste your
money and you possibly want to ruin your first date with scenes that
will make you and your "companion" uncomfortable, then please watch
this movie. I can only assume this movie was made for people who enjoy
poo, balls, and cats jerking off to pictures of their owners. now it
may seem funny at first but believe me when i say this movie sucked.
Now with that said i laughed harder walking out making fun of the movie
then i did for the entire one hour and thirty minutes of painfully
awkward moments. other then that though it did had a really good cast,
even though it seemed like this might of been a movie for them to just
let off some steam and not be so serious. DON'T GO SEE THIS
MOVIE.....PLEASE.
