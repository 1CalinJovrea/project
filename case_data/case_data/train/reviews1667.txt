edge of your seat relentless action!

I went in to this movie not expecting much. having read some reviews
online prior i had my hopes set a little higher as many people said the
intensity of the movie was high. the reviews did not do that justice.
this might be one of the most relentless in your face movies i have
ever seen. once things start to go wrong and believe me it does not
take long at all, it rarely ever gives you a chance to breathe. This is Owen Wilson in top form. I have seen him take on a serious role
before in behind enemy lines so i knew he had it in him but he really
takes it to a whole new level here. the children are adorable and
really strong actresses for their age. the family dynamic is authentic
and you genuinely care about what happens to them. the concept behind this movie is not too far fetched and felt very
plausible. John Erick Dowdle does a great job putting his audience
right in the middle of the chaos. Many instances throughout the movie i
found myself thinking about how i would react in these situations. Some
excellent camera-work is used here too, especially on the roof scene. Of course this movie is not perfect. there were a couple of Hollywood
moments where someone saves the day at the last possible second and the
ending felt kind of abrupt but it was still pretty emotional and shows
what this family has gone through. overall i give this movie a 9.5/10 Do not sleep on this movie. you will be in for one wild ride.
