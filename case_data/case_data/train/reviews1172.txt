Scotty beam me out of this movie

Egotistical Penn all he does during the movie is show off......how he
beats up a whole group of African mercenaries that wanted to kill him
(a yeah right....important subject) .......and that is what the movie
is about.....he beats up everybody that crosses his path.....is a
"Rocky/Rambo" wannabe......to late to jump in that van wagon.....he
shows off his steroids like built arms.....he even shows himself
surfing (lame).....at the end he even gets the girl (that he couldn't
in real life)....it seems like a corny commercial to sell a worn
product (himself)....very sad!.....he is almost sixty.....and think he
is going to fool anybody......big mistake....worst movie.....and insult
to the movie aficionado.....even a regular "Joe", can't be that
gullible.....
