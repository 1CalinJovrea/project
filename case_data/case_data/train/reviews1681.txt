A Very Funny, Hyper-Violent Piece Of Entertainment

Samuel L. Jackson plays the hit-man and Ryan Reynolds plays the
bodyguard in the action/comedy "The Hit-man's Bodyguard." Why would the
most feared hit-man need a bodyguard? Because a dictator is on trial
for war crimes, and the only one who could incriminate him is Jackson.
Taking Jackson from prison to the courtroom will be a hell of an
ordeal, because the dictator has his goons out in force to stop Jackson
from testifying. And that's where Reynolds comes inÂ…unofficially hired
by Interpol to protect and escort Jackson to the trial. Unfortunately,
both men are sworn enemies, and they may kill each other before the bad
guys get to them.My most memorable, movie moment of "The Hit-man's Bodyguard" is the
flashback scene when Jackson meets his future wife (outrageously played
by Salma Hayek) for the first time. It was funny and sexy with an
overdose of hyper violence."The Hit-man's Bodyguard" is loaded with shenanigans; but this is a
movie that isn't meant to be analyzed for story logic. This is a fun
and very funny, graphically violent movie that shines every time
Reynolds and Jackson are on screen together. Kudos to director Patrick
Hughes for adding energy to the story with his slick direction that
really complements the script and lead actors.Mannysmemorablemoviemoment
