Friendships Are Forever

I rented this movie over the weekend; and it did not disappoint. It has
an all-star cast of De Niro, Freeman, Douglas, and Kline. The film
starts out in the 50's about 10 minutes of it, going back to their
childhood; then 58 years later the laughs begin. I watched it with my
mom and she loved it. A story of 4 childhood friends that get together
to throw their friend a bachelor party in Vegas. This is one of the
best comedies I have seen in years. It's a movie that everyone will
enjoy, young, middle age, and old. What is so great about this movie
besides the laughs, is the lesson they all learn before going home. I
look at this film and say to myself you are never too old to have a
great time.Kris L. CocKayne
