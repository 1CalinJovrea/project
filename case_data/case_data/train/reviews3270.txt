I had to walk out in spite of really wanting to like this..

The humor was sophomoric.. I can't believe some of the lines being
delivered by the actors. I guess if you're getting paid millions you'll
concede to saying anything. Could have been done so much better. Lazy writing. Lazy plot.. but I
guess some audiences will fall for this. They will serve a certain
demographic.. unfortunately it's not mine.
