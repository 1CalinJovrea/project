Not bad at all

okay look, I'm one of Sandler's biggest fans. No jokes. I spent over a
year learning a Bobby Busche impression, just for the amusement of
myself. You guys are too hard on him. How can a guy not make a few
flops??? This film wasn't even bad. Other than the over use of crude
jokes, it was good. If you edited about 10 or 15 minutes of the crude
and sexual jokes out of this, it would've been Sandler gold. The
character he played was really original, not one of those family guy
characters he just keeps on playing over and over. It was like his mid
90 characters like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, the ones that made
us love him. Of course, it wasn't as good as a character. Overall, a
pretty fair film that could've been great with the edits. I really
don't know how you can say you walked out of the theater?!!! Same with
Jack and Jill, it was bad, but it didn't deserve the horrible reviews.
The guys made about 20 massive hits, how's he not gonna make one or two
flops??? Anyways Sandler, make the edits and re-put it in theaters and
I think it'll do way better.
