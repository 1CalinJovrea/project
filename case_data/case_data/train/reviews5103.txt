Don't just don't watch this

I rarely write reviews, but when I do, they are either for a very good
movie or for a horrific one. This is for the later. Oh my god, this
movie is so awful that Twilight might be considered a better movie and
this is still generous. But if for some very strange reason you like
Twilight (REAAAAALLY strange reason, for such a bad movie) then lower
you bar even more. The plot is ridiculous and simple. The
acting...looks more like a high school tryhards. All in all, consider
yourself lucky if you haven't seen it yet, if you do - I pity you. And
for the love of god, why is the IMDb rating so high !!! It totally
screwed with me to watch it
