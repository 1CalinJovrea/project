9
"He retained the illusion with remarkable grace."

A former lobby boy, Zero Moustafaw tells a story to a writer, who tells
this tale of a hotel, it's guests and the outstanding concierge
Monsieur Gustav H to us. It's about (blind) loyalty, duty beyond the
required, greed, stupidity, love for women in any age ... and the power
of influence when treating persons with the grace of that person's
beauty. It's (black) comedy at its best. The ridiculous becomes brilliant
through cleverly constructed dialog, impeccable executed timing and
timbre change. Many camera shots are little art pieces like in Moonrise
Kingdom, beautifully constructed with cuts that ad to the timing,
visually. The production design takes you from the shabby to
over-the-top kitsch to breath taking wooden interiors and mountains.
The CGI reminds me of Monty Python, deliberately unrealistic which is
part of the humor yet makes it at the same time oddly believable.Never thought of Ralph Fiennes as a comedic actor. He convinced me
here. Tony Revolori as young Zero Saoirse Ronan as Agatha are
remarkable. And then there were: F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law, Tilda
Swinton, Adrien Brody, Willem Defoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, LÃ©a
Seydoux, Harvey Keitel, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, (I
think I saw George Cloony for 2 sec)... Just to be able to get all
these heavy weights to sign up for minor roles, demands respect. To get
them all set their mark in a few minutes, is awesome."He retained the illusion with remarkable grace." is one of the last
lines in the movie. It describes both the main character and also the
heart of the movie. This is a real 9 - beauty combined with dirt, great
cinematography with dry jokes and art with silliness. If you like to be
amazed, see something out of the ordinary, are able to go with a flow,
you will LOVE this movie.
