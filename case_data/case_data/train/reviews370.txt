A slightly above average thriller

If you've seen the trailer, you can already tell that Contraband really
doesn't have anything new to offer as a film. It has a typical
heist/revenge thriller plot with some thrills and good action
sequences. However, Contraband manages to be a slightly better than
your typical thriller.Mark Wahlberg gives a really good performance and Giovanni Ribisi did a
really great job as the films over-the-top villain. The film does a
great job of getting down the gritty tone and gives the film a
realistic feel to it. I also enjoyed how instead of being a straight
out action flick, the film actually took time to develop what they had
with the plot and show the whole set up of the heist.For most of it's nearly 2 hour runtime, Contraband kept me entertained
for the most part. It still suffers from it's expected flaws. The plot
isn't exactly strong and is pretty convoluted and very predictable. I
also didn't care for the way the film wrapped up.Overall, there really isn't a whole lot about to say about Contraband,
but I would highly recommend it to someone who is looking for a good
rental. If you like Marky Mark, than it's worth a shot.
