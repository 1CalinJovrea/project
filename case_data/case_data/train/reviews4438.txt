Classic Suspense Storytelling

Creative storytelling in the sense that it's not the usual simplistic
retread that writers put out just to make a quick buck; well written
and really well acted given the limitations of space/location.
Directing was spot on especially the slowly building tension created by
the sets, audio, soundtrack and lighting.It takes great acting skill to pull off suspense when the sets consists
of a couple of rooms and a street or two. Also some kudos again for the
soundtrack and other suspenseful audio.On the negative side was stereotyping of Eastern Europeans as bad guys.
At least it's a first using Chechen mobsters.
