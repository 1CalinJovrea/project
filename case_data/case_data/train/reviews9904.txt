Simple & charming movie

"What if" is a very well written movie. It is a story about Wallace and
Chantry, two young people who crossed each other's path, one night.
Wallace who is coming out of his shell after being recently
heart-broken becomes friends with Chantry who is actually with her
long-time boyfriend Ben. As predictable as this might sound, Wallace
and Chantry start liking each other & eventually develop feelings for
each other. Sounds like a clich√©, I know but trust me, you should
totally give it a chance! It is such a charming and heart warming film
packed with laughs and romance. Being stuck in a love triangle is
portrayed from a mature point of view, while still keeping the romantic
side of the movie. The cast of the movie was well chosen because
everyone played their role so well. Kudos to Daniel Radcliffe for being
so natural in his role. Watching this movie will make you realize how
versatile of an actor Radcliffe can be. He truly has evolved and
matured in his roles. This is not some famous character (Harry Potter)
that he plays here. In this movie, we see him as some everyday-life
normal guy who is having a bad time. Radcliffe is a great actor. Loved
him in this movie! Hats off!
