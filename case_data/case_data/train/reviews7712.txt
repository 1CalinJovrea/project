For the Joy of Human Love

This movie restored my faith in Hollywood's understanding of the joy of
human love and the importance of investing one's whole soul into the
care and keeping of those we hold dear. If you enjoy films that feature
creative sensitivity to everyday feelings that are the stuff life is
made of, then this is your kind of film. The cinematography is
stunning, featuring French and Japanese filmmaking sensibilities with
an American flavor. It was quietly majestic and I loved it. Thank you
to the creators of this beautifully written, acted, directed, filmed,
produced, scored and edited film. It left me better than it found me,
and I am grateful. More, please...
