Much more than meets the eye....

It amazes me how many negative reviews this movie has gotten when its
core, its message, is so giant.I love this movie. Then again, I'm thinking of it in conjunction with
The Secret, the book Conversations With God, and my own crazy
experiences.God = a giant being who was, is, and ever shall be, trying to become
conscious of Himself.Humans = each tiny piece God broke off of Himself to create our
individual selves.Lucy = one piece of God (think = SOUL) that happened to have an
opportunity to become conscious of itself.The end is Lucy breaking apart into billions of pieces because the
physical no longer mattered. It was her essence... which is why she was
able to be everywhere, like God.I can't believe no one gets this. Look into quantum physics, even just
watch The Secret. All we are is energy. If we take this concept to the
extreme and to fiction, Lucy is what we get!I LOVE this movie. BTW.Then again I think deeply and on a big picture basis, so hopefully all
these negative reviewers read this and feel like morons... because they
are.It's not meant to "just" be a movie. You really think Morgan Freeman
would've signed up for this if it didn't have some deeper meaning? Look
at his track record!!! Come on, people, use that gray mass between your
ears!!!Just saying. I love this movie. From a non-science, non-pop culture
perspective. I love this movie from a transcendent perspective. The
kind of POV that allows you to believe that nothing is a coincidence.=)
