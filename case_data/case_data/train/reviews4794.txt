Two tough and demanding roles for Armie and a newcomer Timothée

Timothée, btw, starred in three films I saw this year at 2017 Tiff.He is in demand and taking on difficult roles is the way to get larger
ones.It has an interesting premise, I imagine that all of the rave reviews
about this film are in regards to its homosexual content, which quite
frankly doesn't really excite me, that being said, certain elements
were particularly well done.Specifically the acceptance of this by the characters parents in the
story.Particularly noteworthy are the words of fatherly advice given to
Timothée's character at the end of the film.While pushing towards universal acceptance the director did include
some content that could 'gross people out' it also had some problems
with pace.This is based on a novel written by Andre Aciman and the words I
mentioned before come directly from his book and looks at Americans
from a European point of view.Thanks to the leads and filmmakers who came to the Q&As.
