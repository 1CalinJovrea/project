Excellent Parody of U.S. Politics

The Campaign is one of the best comedies that I have ever seen. You
definitely have to watch this movie in context, and see past the
obvious, crass, junior-high-school humor. Most of the real humor is
buried deep within this film. A few subtle points, just to get you
started:1) Labrador Retrievers (dogs) did NOT originate in the USA. Pugs are
from China, but were bred long before China was under Communist rule.2) The car that Cam Brady drives is made in Canada.3) Cam Brady parts his hair to the Left... Marty Huggins parts his hair
to the Right.
