Steve Jobs At Different Times Of His Life

After watching the lackluster Ashton Kutcher film "Jobs" two years
ago,my earnest hope was that there is will be a better film released
sometime in the future.With director David Boyle,screenwriter Aaron
Sorkin and a cast led by Michael Fassbender working together on a film
based on the Walter Isaacson's authorized biography on the late Apple
CEO,will "Steve Jobs" be answer?The film consists of something similar to a three-act play wherein we
get to see the life of Steve Jobs during the unveiling of a new product
at three different times of his life.The first act consists of having
Jobs working for Apple as a member of an Macintosh R and D group and
whose company is about to release the new computer called Macintosh in
1984.The second act consists of having Jobs,who was fired from Apple,
now working in his new company called NeXT Computers,which is about to
unveil the new computer called "Cube" in 1988.The final act consists of
Jobs now again back at Apple working as the CEO and whose company is to
release a new computer called iMac in 1998.In these three parts of the film,we get to witness Jobs in three
different times of his life from being an company founder of the
flourishing Apple Computer Company during the release of the Macintosh
in 1984;a fired Apple employee who just started a new lackluster NeXT
company during the release of the Cube in 1988; and finally a leader of
a resurging Apple company during the release of the iMac in 1998.At the
center of these events is Jobs and how he has found success early in
his life;get humbled after getting fired from his company by the board
and start a new company that had limited success; and get hired back to
his company and help it get back from state of being close to
bankruptcy into becoming the most successful company in the world.At
the center of it all is his relationship with his daughter Lisa whom he
first refused to acknowledge when he had early success in life;later
reconnected with her during the humbling moments of his life; and
finally formed a father-and-daughter relationship when he found a
renewed success when he got back to his former company.As for fans and haters alike of the late Apple CEO,Fassbender provides
us a marvelous portrayal of a Steve Jobs being both an innovator and a
monster alike.We get to witness him as someone that is extremely
difficult to get along with due to being an extremely arrogant
egomaniac but at the same time whose thinking and ideas for innovation
and marketing has led the computer industry into greater
heights.Apparently,Steve Wozniak,who acted as consultant to the
film,will definitely be more satisfied as it presents a horrible Steve
Jobs and it provides appreciation to the engineers and technicians who
worked behind the scenes for the release of the successful products of
Apple.The film consists of lots of dialogues between characters that is why
listening essential to fully appreciate it.In fact,I would not be
surprised if "Steve Jobs" will become a theatrical play
someday.Finally,going back to my question: Was this a better biopic
compared to the one released two years ago? Absolutely!!!!!
