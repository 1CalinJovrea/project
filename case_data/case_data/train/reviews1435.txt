Peachfuzz, you say? Been nice knowing you pal (**backs away slowly to the door**).

Cash-strapped videographer Aaron (played by the film's director Patrick
Brice) is offered $1000 for a day of filming, discretion appreciated.
Travelling to a remote property in the mountains, Aaron meets his
client Josef, who explains his requirements: as a cancer sufferer,
Josef would like to create a video diary for his unborn son (who he has
already named Buddy), and would like Aaron to document his every move
during the day.Things start off strangely, Josef immediately stripping off to share a
bath with an imaginary Buddy, but his behaviour becomes even more
erratic and suspicious as the day goes on, with some particularly
strange stuff involving a wolf mask. Having already accepted payment
for the day, Aaron takes things in his stride, but alarm bells really
start ringing when the time comes for him to go home and he cannot find
his car keysI'm not the biggest fan of found footage horror, but was surprised to
find myself drawn in by the unusual nature of Creep's antagonist Josef,
who is, without a doubt, a very disturbing (and disturbed) individual.
Although it's obvious from the outset that he's full of crap, blatantly
lying about his illness, his bizarre behaviour and the mystery
surrounding his real motives kept me watching.What a shame, then, that the film fails to live up to its early
promise, any hope for a truly demented denouement dashed as Josef is
revealed to be nothing more than your average common or garden
obsessive homicidal nut-job.Aaron's actions throughout the film also undermine its effectiveness: I
could get past the dubious notion that he would accept a job without
any prior details, but his decision making skills thereafter prove
increasingly questionable, the character failing to react in a logical
fashion (only one call to the police, even with all that evidencegimme
a break!). There are also numerous scenes that will have the viewer
questioning why Aaron would continue filming given the situation (a
common complaint about found footage films).An over reliance on very silly jump scares (one of Josef's strange
traits is to hide from Aaron and then jump out on him) soon gets
tiresome, and a daft ending where Aaron makes one last really, really,
really bad decision is the final nail in the coffin.
