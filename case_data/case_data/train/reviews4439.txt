They managed to make a worse film than the first.... Bravo!!!!

While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront
the anger and envy of the women who came before her. There was at least
a 5% inside my brain that hoped to find something good in this whole
mess or at least for this movie to be a bit decent, unfortunately this
is one of the worst films of 2017 at least so far with some of the most
boring sex scenes i have ever seen, awful dialogue and really weird
sense of humor and the 2 main stars had an on/off kind of chemistry
plus that helicopter sequence looked a bit decent in the trailer so i
won't lie on that but in the actual movie it was painful to sit threw.
This movie uses lines such as "Kinky F*ckery" and thinks that it's
funny or smart but it's not it's funny in a very different kind of way.
Overall at the end of the day this 'Fifty Shades of Grey' sequel was
even worse than the original with horrible acting, plot and characters
that are abusive and creepy as hell and i'm still wondering how Kim
Basinger went from Batman and L.A Confidential to 'Fifty Shades Darker'
but hey look at the good side of things this Franchise is so bad that
we can make fun of it every day but if you did liked the first film you
will probably like this one as well but for everyone else? STAY AWAY!!!
