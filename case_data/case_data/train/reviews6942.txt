Great Movie to escape from reality.

I have not read the book, so I only had a vague synopsis of the story
from a movie trailer. After watching the movie, I want to read the book
to discover more details that a 2 hour movie cannot possibly accomplish
for such a lenghty novel. I found the movie intriguing and well written. It captures the distinct
personalities of both Melanie and Wanda, which could have been a
disaster. It was sci-fi movie that explored many emotions and was a
great escape for 2 hours. The cinematography was awesome from the
desert scenes to the futuristic.It is different from the "Twilight Series" and I wish people would not
compare the two. Hopefully, there will be a sequel!
