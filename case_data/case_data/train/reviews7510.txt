TIFF 2015 -- Hardcore: Just plain fun

'Hardcore' is the riveting story of a newly-made cyborg who must save
his wife from evil tyrants and...wait a minute. Who cares?? The whole
movie is a blast!!Ilya Naishuller is a young director who had a very cool idea to shoot
an action film from a first-person perspective using a GoPro Hero3
Black Edition camera. The proof of concept was released as "Biting
Elbows: Bad Motherf***er". It was pitched publicly and helped to
successfully crowd-fund the feature, 'Hardcore'.It's better to keep this short and sweet: the film is extraordinarily
violent; not for the squeamish. It has plenty of action, free-running,
stunts, and plenty of room for comedic elements. Even the opening
titles give you a taste of what's to come!Sharlto Copley (District 9, and other Neill Blomkamp projects) plays
the main POV's assistant throughout the film. Copley definitely gives a
range of character performances and is quality. Wearing many hats, he
guides you along as if you were needing assistance in a video game,
which, by the way, this film makes several references to. In
particular, the Chernobyl level in Call of Duty 4 with Capt.
MacMillian. Even the opening scenes are reminiscent of Half-Life, and a
lot of the free-running scenes are inspired by Mirror's Edge.For those who are wondering, no. You likely won't get dizzy watching a
90-minute action film from an FP perspective. Well, maybe you shouldn't
sit in the front row. Otherwise, you will have a blast.'Hardcore' is an all-around fun time. Just be okay with the violence.
It's only 90 minutes of your time that you'll likely want to experience
over and over again. Or, you'll just want to plug in a play a few
games. Either way, it's bloody fun!
