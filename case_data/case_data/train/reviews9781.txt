An Stunning Hollywood Fraud

Exodus: Gods and Kings is a stunning biblical epic with beautiful
A-list stars. The grand shots with seamless CGI are the best visual
recreation to date of the sheer magnitude of the exodus. Scott artfully
brings to life an ancient world that is beautiful to watch.
Unfortunately good looks, great actors and a big budget don't equate to
a great movie in this case. Christian Bale and the entire cast's
excellent performances were overshadowed by the poor casting choices to
hire them. The all-white lead cast and betrayal of the biblical tale
can be brushed off as Hollywood child-play. However, the unbelievable
characters, flimsy dialog and exhausting monotonous tension plagued
Exodus. The film is visually beautiful; but unfortunately not much
else.
