The Secret Scripture (2016)

I didn't really know about this film but of course I'll watch anything
with Rooney Mara in it no matter what. I absolutely love her, think
she's still underrated and think she's absolutely gorgeous. You do have
to be cautious about directors whose work hasn't really resonated well
in the past so I wasn't expecting something truly great from Jim
Sheridan. The minimum of my requirements was to enjoy Rooney Mara and
solely in that aspect it met my expectations. The Secret Scripture is based on the novel of the same name and is
about a girl named Rose (played by Rooney Mara) and her young life in
which she has a few suitable men interested in her. The film chronicles
her love life and the turmoil that follows with it. It also details her
mental health problems and her hospitalization which changes her life
in unimaginable ways. The film follows an older Rose (Vanessa Redgrave)
and is told through her written diary entries. This film isn't very good. I did read that book readers were extremely
disappointed by this film either through its adaptation or through
changing key points of the plot. The film drudges along and never looks
to fully realize its purpose. I think the lead actors's chemistry was
off and the script really let the actors down (possibly from not being
good enough).  Maybe I am biased because I love Mara but I think she
did really well in the film and gave a full effort. You could sense the
bewilderment in her character when she got locked into the mental
institution.Overall, no harm done with this one. I didn't really know about it or
have any hopes. Bare minimum was that I wanted to see Rooney Mara do
well and she does. The film just isn't interesting has a lot of
questions and is structured in a careless manner. Nothing to really see
here. I'll just look forward to seeing Mara as Mary Magdeline later
this year instead.6/10
