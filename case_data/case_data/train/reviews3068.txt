Shallow as a reflection

Everything felt very forced. The movie lacks a story. To me it feels
like the cherry picked the awesome scenes of the movie/series and made
a movie out of it.Unfortunately, they butchered everything and missed the entire point of
the Ghost in the Shell series and turned it into a lame action movie
with zero substance. What happened to all the thought provoking ideas
from the movie/series? I can't wait till someone does a comparison of
the original scenes vs these remade ones, what a joke. 5/10
