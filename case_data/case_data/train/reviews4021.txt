Extremely well done, but lacks some of the power of the real tapes

A bit of an enigma. The cast is terrific, it's directed and edited
artfully and intelligently, and it never falls into what would have
been easy exploitation or exaggeration of a true event. Indeed, whole
sections of the screenplay were taken from the actual transcripts. Yet
somehow this reenactment of psychologist Dr. Philip Zimbardo's famous
1971 experiment - where students played prisoners and guards, and
quickly the roles started taking over until things got out of hand - is
less chilling and powerful than what I expected.Having seen an educational documentary that included excerpts from the
tapes of the actual experiment, I found the film just couldn't match
the power of the real thing, in spite of tons of talent and good
intentions. I was always aware these were actors and I was watching a
movie.That said, there is a lot that's worthwhile here. The always wonderful
Billy Crudup finds all the darkness in the ego-driven Zimbardo, but
never lets us forget he's also a human being who believed he was doing
something important, even if he has momentarily lost the forest for the
trees in a big way. All the supporting players bring complexity to
roles that could have felt very sketchy. And certainly a film about an
experiment that showed just how easy it is for a sense of power over
others to distort the personality of almost anyone is timely and
important.I just hope that now someone can get a hold of and re-release ether the
very little seen documentary of the same name, or create a new one with
the actual footage. That would be an even more powerful addition to the
study of the dark sides of all of our natures.
