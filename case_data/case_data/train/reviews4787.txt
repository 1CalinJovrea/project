Chris Evans cool?

Rom-Coms are not the easiest to make. If you try to make a real good
one that is. But even the "bad" ones make their money back mostly. And
I wouldn't categorize this as a bad one. Does it have some misplaced
dialog and some clich√©s in it? Yes, though it's not the first one to do
so and its lead actors are charming enough for you to not care too much
about that.While the inevitable outcome is predictable, there may be a few
obstacles along the way that are kind of refreshing to see. And while
our main protagonist could easily slip into unlikeable territory, Chris
Evans is there to save him from that fate. No pun intended, for a
decent effort. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less either
