Written by a 5 year old?

What a disappointment. Two hours of movie time passed like 10. The
script is terrible. It's kind of like when a 5 year old tries to tell a
story. "And then the science lady goes to a different planet and she
finds an alien head but it's not really an alien head and she puts it
in a bag and then she takes it back to the spaceship and the lady and
another science lady bring it back to life and the robot guy gets some
alien blood and gives it to the science lady's boyfriend and then they
go to sleep together and the next day she has a baby inside of her so
she goes into the surgery machine and has the baby taken out but it's
not really a baby it's an alien and then she goes to save her friends
but then she goes back and finds out that the baby alien didn't die and
kills the bald man" And on and on. Zero suspense. A Golden Razzies
level performance by Charlize Theron. Save your $$ on this one. It's a
stinker.
