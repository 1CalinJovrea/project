pointless, inept

Saw this and had the constant feeling of awkwardness on behalf of the
people producing it. The timing for jokes is sometimes way off. The
storyline doesn't make sense in itself (I know speaking toys don't
exist - I mean they are inconsistent with the make-believe stuff they
tell you).I expected clever jokes from McFarlane, political/social satire (great
time for it, isn't it). Unfortunately he managed a script that only
pointlessly rumbles on from here to there trying to develop something
with love story and talking bear... something... something. I laughed a
handful of times, but that isn't enough for 100 minutes.You are just constantly pushed out of it by inept movie-craftsmanship.
The casting is ridiculous. A former superhero and another former man in
black have a small side role as a 'funny' gay couple. - Problem is a 12
year old makes better gay jokes. The stuff feels really outdated for
me. Maybe in the early 1990s such a thing as a man who is gay but can't
figure it out was funny. Plus one can see no one gave them useful
direction to portray the characters, as they are SO VISIBLE as the
actors who did that other movie all the time. If you do this and these
kind/level of jokes now you look like a film-school freshman who
couldn't afford a professional script-reviewer.
