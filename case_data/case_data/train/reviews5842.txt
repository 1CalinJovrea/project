Nauseating stop motion product placement

You know when some older guy starts using the language of a younger
generation? Saying stuff like 'sick', 'whack', etc. It makes me cringe,
especially when the purpose of adopting the language is to influence.
Imagine if you will a board room of middle aged Google executives,
discussing how best to reach out to the huge pool of cheap, talented
labor which is exuded each year from our academic institutions. This
film shows what these executives believe the minds of a younger
generation look like. Simple, intricate but simple. It shows what they
believe their ideal working environment would look like, some sort high
tech never-never land. It's unbelievably patronising that they think
this is believable. I find this overt attempt to influence me and
advertise to me nauseating. I will not be working for the big G unless
there is serious money involved.
