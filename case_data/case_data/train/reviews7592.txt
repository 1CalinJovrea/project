Decent but no prize for originality

As I'm currently living in Paris and actually visited the Catacombes a
few days earlier, I had high hopes for this film. The setup of the
movie is promising as well, because the Catacombes can be quite scary.
Therefore, a lot of ingredients for a good scary movie.Alas, it turned out to be nothing of the sort. A very far-fetched plot,
predictable scares, and the overly shaky hand-cam which is past its
prime were the culprits of my disappointment. Add to that some flimsy
romantic love story, and you got a mediocre film at best.However, I do not want to give the impression that this movie was all
bad. There were some pretty decent scares despite their lack of
originality. I'm sure that if this movie would have come out ten years
ago, it could have been a major hit. But after Blair Witch Project,
Rec, and Paranormal Activity, it is difficult to insert a new angle
into the whole hand-cam-genre.So if you just want a decent scary movie for 90 minutes while keeping
your expectations limited, Catacombes would be a decent choice.
