This movie, like many others, wasted my time

I was not going to write a review for this movie, but after seeing the
overall score and how most of the people raved about it, I just had to
say something.This movie barely kept my interest for the first hour. I saw my share
of found footage films, and by no means is this one of the best. The
camera work is too shaky, the dialog is boring - people talked so much
about that camera that frankly it became the main character (I am not
kidding - they had entire conversations about that damn camera, and
kept reminding the audience someone is filming) and the characters are
people I couldn't care less about. I mean, if, by the end of the movie,
there is no interesting story, no characters I sympathize with and no
scares, what is there left for me to like?I did like the premise, but the trailer was misleading as I thought the
storyline of the origin of their powers and their effect on others will
be at least investigated if not explained. Nothing happened, except the
mental deterioration of the main character, which was to be expected (I
mean, common, abused kid with self confidence issues, who did not see
that coming?). The "climax" of the movie, if you want to call it that,
lasted about 10 minutes.As usual, potential does not translate directly in success - there is
more to an entertaining movie than the good idea it is based on.
