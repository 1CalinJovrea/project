I am speechless.

So the movie is named "Your name?" and its a perfect title, it doesn't
reveal anything about the content and yet it caught my interest. I tend
to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the
same time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will
be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about
how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible.
Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view
of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they
dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice
actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till
end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and
everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going.
Regarding the character development its spot on, no more information
was needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same time
free to make our own thought.I wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or worked
with this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, it
is an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!
