Another case of false advertising

Hercules and chums are mercenaries, pressed into service for Lord Cotys
to put down a rebel uprising which looks likely to overthrow the
throne.The trailer teases this movie as being a myths and monsters movie: it
isn't. It's a fairly routine swords and sandals actioner, and the
mythical critters teased in the trailer all come before the opening
title, and are either tall tales depicted, or things seen unclearly
from a distance. What is left is a rather dark film with a lot of
battle action, pitched uneasily at a level which is too graphic for
family viewing and not graphic enough for those who like blood and
dismemberment.There is a single F word - unnecessary and out of place.Dwayne Johnson does this stuff well - he looks good, has great physical
presence and, even when the part is somewhat darker than usual, he
remains very likable. The supporting cast are all quite good - it was
interesting to see Rufus Sewell playing a goodie for once (kind of like
a young Ian McShane even though McShane was also in the film, with all
the best moments of humour), and John Hurt gets to play both ends of
the spectrum, meek and scenery-chewing.I quite liked this - it is certainly a lot better than this year's
previous Hercules offering - but felt that it was a missed opportunity:
they promised me monsters and then didn't deliver them!
