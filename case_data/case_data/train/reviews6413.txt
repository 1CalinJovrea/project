Geriatric Action Flick

Why can't thugged out gangster rappers just stick to rappin'? When I
saw the rapper who goes by the moniker half dollar or 50 pennies was a
part of this film I knew there was no way it would be saved. I am so
relieved that I did not watch this mess in the theater. Stallone should
really retire. It seems that his head keeps getting bigger with age. It
looks down right swollen. The skin on his face looks like silicone. I
kept wondering if the make-up people on the set couldn't do something
more to make him look more human. His acting also seems to be getting
worse with age.Stallone as usual was unconvincing and uninteresting. It seems like
he's half asleep throughout the entire movie. He is just way too old to
play the characters that he no doubt writes for himself. The movie was
just about 2 old farts acting brawny and throwing punches. We all loved
them in the 80's and 90's but they're just way too old to play the part
of an action hero. I must say, it was a pleasant surprise to hear Arnie
speaking in his native tongue. All in all the movie was unbearable. I
literally skipped many parts just to get to the end.
