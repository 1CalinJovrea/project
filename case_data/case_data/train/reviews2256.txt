Wonderful drama about the importance of investigative journalism

Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the performances, the way
the true events are handled, the cinematography. In this day of digital
news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in
the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media.The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is
remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough
about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create
side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the
archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face
and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article.The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome.
