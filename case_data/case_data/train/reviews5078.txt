Freakin Great!

The first American Pie was Jason Biggs' and Chris Klein's movie, the
2nd one was all 4 of theirs with Scott as Stifler starting to take
command, the 3rd one was Stifler's movie, and this 4th one started
looking like it was going to be Stifler's movie again but then it
became all 4 of the characters movie once again, and that was a
pleasant surprise. You start caring for all the characters and have
great laughs with all the characters which made for a much funnier
movie.American Wedding is still my favorite but this American Reunion is a
close 2nd. Plus this one includes Eugene Levy into the thick of things
even more which makes it even more hilarious. That ending is laugh out
loud to die for. So funny.Overall, the situations the character's are in is what makes them
funny. The only three that really ever have a character that you really
like and care for are Stifler, Eugene Levy, and Chris Klein in some
ways. They're the only ones that really have developed some great
characterization to where you like who they are.Biggs' character Jim is funny because of the situations he always gets
himself into. But as a person, Jim is kind of boring really. And so are
the rest of them. But nonetheless, American Reunion will give you a
much needed laugh, and it's even funnier if you watch it with someone
who likes the same kind of movies you do. A must see!
