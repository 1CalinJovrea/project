An unfocused mess

The first Thor was probably one of Marvel's more trickier movies since
it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the
"real" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who
doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a
green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of
Asgard, Gods & Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between
the fantastic and "real" (that's a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore,
Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still
provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and
favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the
pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss
Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather
misplaced.Bottom line: It's a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script
and a director who tries too many things at the same time.
