When the world needed a hero, they called a villain.

I went to the cinema preview with my friend for this movie, and its
even better than the first film! I only saw the first film recently,
and I really liked it. I wasn't sure I wanted to go and see the film at
first, but my mate wanted me to go and see the preview yesterday with
him, and reluctantly, I said yes. Usually, the second films aren't
better than the first, but boy was I wrong! I was laughing through out
the whole film, and so was everyone in the audience, it was full to!
Steve Carrell's character, Gru, was hilarious. I think everyone could
agree though, the minions were the best characters in the film. My
friend told me the directors made up a little language and did the
voices, and I was very impressed, for you could hear a hint of English
in every word they said. So, if you have seen the first film and liked it, don't hesitate to go
and see it when it officially come out on the 28th June. And if you
haven't seen the first film, why not?
