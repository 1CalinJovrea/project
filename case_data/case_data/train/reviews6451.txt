Clumsy and Overblown Fodder for Aspiring Futurists

Rarely have I felt myself the "one-eyed man in the land of the blind"
as when I was reading the plethora of positive reviews for this film.What so many critics praised as "minimalist", I found shallow: A
one-dimensional, clearly ego-maniacal villain creates a flawlessly
sympathetic A.I., with whom our equally-flawless protagonist cements an
attachment. That, plus a fairly pedestrian game of cat-and-mouse
between our 'tagonists, followed by an unsatisfying ending, defines the
bulk of this film.What so many critics praised as "thought-provoking", I found
nonsensical. The chance to parlay the dichotomy between evolved vs.
designed intelligence through Ava's character was squandered by the
decision to render her ultimate motives entirely inscrutable: a
contrivance that may have been---but should not have been---the point.
There were times when this film showed real promise, the potential to
give real weight to the blurred line between human and synthetic
self-awareness that will doubtless challenge us in years to come...
but, alas, in service to its Pollock-painting motifs, it chose easy
ambiguity over genuine insight.Superficially, this film is meaningful: It certainly tackles the
questions of intelligence, of person-hood, of agency and of sentience
in a world where all of the above can be designed by a psychopath.Unfortunately, those questions are damn important ones to tackle...
and, in the end, "Ex Machina" in no way does them justice.
