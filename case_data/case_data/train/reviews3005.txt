Very Funny!!!

This movie was absolutely dirty, offensive, hilarious, racist, and
crazy over-the-top moments. It's about the same style as Sacha Baron
Cohen's previous movies, but it's done much better. Cohen plays a silly
ruthless dictator named Admiral General Aladeen. He is very
anti-semitic and plans on creating nuclear weapons. He hates the very
idea of democracy. While on his way to the United Nations, he's
betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by
Zoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen
make it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or
will Zoey change his heart? I would definitely recommend THE
DICTATOR!!!
