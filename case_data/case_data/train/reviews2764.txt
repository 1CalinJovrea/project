Definitely not as bad as many critics said it to be (In fact, I don't consider it as 'bad' at all).

Expectations is everything with these movies. While the previous
Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) movie feels more like a spin-off than a
direct sequel to the original trilogy, "Dead Men Tell No
Tales/Salazar's Revenge" continues the lore of the first 3 movies.
While continuity errors are somewhat blatant, you can't say this movie
is the worst of the 5 PotC movies. The actions are more grounded than
the previous movies, and they managed to salvage themselves after the
less-than-mediocre "On Stranger Tides". The humor's there, and just
enough. The amount of screen time of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley
probably means that there'll be more of these movies in the future.
There's also a familiar feels to the first movie in this one. Perhaps
this familiarity is what makes critics hate it. But seriously, if you
despised "On Stranger Tides", this one you'll probably like. I'd say
this is the best PotC movie since the first one back in early 2000's.Oh, and Javier Bardem, as always, is menacing as the latest baddie
"Capitan Salazar".
