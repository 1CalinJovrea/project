Surpassed My Expectations !

After watching the trailer of this film i was just expecting another
lazy cheesy horror film, and i knew it was a movie i'd skip. But after
seeing some good reviews here and there about it, i thought i'd give it
a try and watch it with an open mind.Turns out to be one of the best horror films to come out this year
(Along with Lights Out, Under The Shadow and Don't Breathe)Just consider that this movie is not for the faint heart at all as it
contains very graphic scenes that aren't suitable for everyone, but the
title says it anyway it's an Autopsy.What I liked the most about this film is that it has everything horror
fans would like to see in a movie, it has very disturbing scenes, top-
notch suspense , good scares , an atmosphere that will suck you in and
a creepy enough story that'll probably keep you up at night thinking
about dead bodiesThe film starts slow with the horror but it never keeps you bored, it's
always interesting and you always wanna know how things will go, and as
you watch you'll notice it's getting weirder and weirder and then
you'll feel so uncomfortable watching it until you reach the top speed
of the horror and then it will come to an end.The ending could've been better (thought its a bit cheesy) but it
hasn't ruined the experience for me, it's still a good watch for fans
of the genre.Conclusion: If you're a true horror fan you can't miss this one, pretty
sure it has many in it that will give you some good scares.
