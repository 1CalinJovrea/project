feels like a kids film

Nerve is about an unadventurous girl who decides to take part in an
online game that involves completing challenges and dares to increase
her popularity and add to her bank balance but as you would expect not
everything goes to plan. Before I start to criticise this film too much
it's true to say that I'm not the kind of person this is aimed at. What
I mean is i'm probably 25 years too old to really enjoy something like
this. It's incredibly dumb. The story is so far fetched and unrealistic
that you just don't buy into what you are watching. It seams to be set
in a neon lit world where everyone is 20 years old and where no
internet connection is lost , nothing buffers and camera phones are
conveniently aimed on every scene but the biggest problem with this is
that it's not gritty enough. I wanted see a game like Jigsaw would play
in the Saw film but instead we see a tepid watered down version and
that just bored me. Unless you 18 years old give this a miss. The best
thing about Nerve is the soundtrack .
