When Captain America throws his mighty Shield !!!!!!!

This movie Rocks!!!!!! At first, I wasn't very confident about watching
a captain America movie because he looked kind of old-school. But when
I watched this movie - BOOM !!!!!!! This movie blew my mind.... It is
really AWESOME!!! There are many sequences that will make you jump up
in your seats. And though I have not included any spoilers, I would
like to recommend you to stay after the credits for two amazing scenes,
now this is hardly a spoiler as everyone knows marvel always treats the
audience with surprising after credits scenes. I shall say no more
here. Marvel has done an excellent job on this movie.Chris Evans has done some excellent work as Captain America. But
Scarlett Johansson as Black widow steals the movie. Her character is
evergreen as usual.Others to look forward to are Sebastian Stan as the
winter soldier and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon.I highly recommend this movie. Guys, this movie is really worth your
bucks. Moreover, the movie runs for over 136 mins, but never at a
single moment during the movie you feel bored. And the ending of the
movie leaves you craving for more and more.The climax is terrific. I haven't seen such an awesome climax of a
movie since the Avengers. So guys, go for this movie.... take your kids
with you. They'll love it. It is a perfect start of summer blockbuster
and one of the best movies of the year without doubt..
