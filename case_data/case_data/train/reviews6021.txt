This movie was a pile of ðŸ’©

The Emoji Movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my hopefully
short life. The funniest thing about this "jam packed comedy" was the
fact that I was that nobody in the whole audience was laughing. The
plot was predictable I felt no emotion towards a single character. The
puns were ðŸ’© quite literally. I had to apologise to my distraught family
after taking them to see this film. I knew it would be bad but I didn't
think it would be quite this bad. I am still in trouble from my wife
for forcing her to put up with all 90 minutes of this predictably
boring film.
