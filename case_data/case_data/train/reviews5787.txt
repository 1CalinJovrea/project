A good concept that was done right

This is a true sequel: it expands on a previous story and makes it
better. American Pie was never a great film and the many reincarnations
of the same story did not do it good, but American Reunion almost fixes
everything, giving it a true human dimension. In my opinion, it is this
film that makes American Pie a classic. I just hope they don't turn it
into another franchise. Let it rest, people! You got it right, don't
mess with it.Other than that, the same crazy antics, part felony, part madness and
the same awkward situations, but with a more adult touch. Everybody is
married, with children, but at heart, they are still kids. That is what
this film is all about.
