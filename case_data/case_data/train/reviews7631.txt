I was greatly disappointed.

When I heard that a second Grown Ups movie was coming out I was
immediately excited. Being a a huge fan of the first one; my
expectations were very high for the second. Obviously too high. This
film had basically no point or plot at all. It was incredibly
disappointing. I barely laughed at all. All of the jokes and humor was
unbelievably crass and perverted. The movie was just plan dirty. The
first one had its moments but this one felt like a big "one of those
moments." The dialog was disappointingly gross in the end. Giving this
a 3 out of 10 still seems a little to high and mighty even for this. I
wasted my money. Don't waste yours and don't see this lame excuse for a
sequel.
