Just an awful movie

There are just a few movies I actually stopped watching in the middle.
Contraband is one of them. I actually decided to make an account on
IMDb just to give it a review. The story doesn't make any sense and has too many holes in it. Its way
too long for no reason. Contraband would be much more enjoyable were it the least plausible and
make a little sense.As it is it really is a joke and the writers must either think we are
IQ-free or they snorted way too much coke while writing the scenario.I won't go into details to avoid spoilers but I'm sure those who want
to check will find everything in other critics and forum entries.
