Well...

Went to hate it, left loving it. Great funny "real" movie. Starts and
ends like everyone movie, you know it from the beginning, but the
laughs and the experiences this gang faces is well don. Not over the
top , just laughs and a somewhat sentimental story. Not sure why all
the bad reviews, went in with an opened mind and walked Out laughing
and talking with friends about how much we enjoyed it. I encourage
anyone in the edge to go catch this film. Good for Jen and good for
Jason, more daughter and this would be great. Kenny almost stole the
show... Man has no heart finds family and gains one. Worth watching Do
it!
