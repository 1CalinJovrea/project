Great laughs, modern lighthearted fun. Obviously not to be taken too seriously!

That awkward moment is a normal title which could describe dating in
general and all the things that come with it and for a romantic comedy
to be emotional and funny then Tom Gormican got his debut right.I had all the scepticism of every romantic comedy I have watched but
this film surpassed them all and it could even be a modern pretty
woman. Each actor had a fulfilling parts and equally intellectual and
funny to go with it. I connected with all the actors / actresses and
for that I respect the director and producer in this production. Zach
Efron has really shown that he is a consistent actor and co-director
and IMHO he is getting it right every time. Miles Teller is proving to
be a deep thoughtful romantic in these roles as in the spectacular now
and Imogen Poots also fits this role. There is a definite beginning
where the old college pals promise to stay single and enjoy all the NYC
girls, middle, where each think they can control natural emotions and
admit to themselves they can't and ending where they all become happy
in love (romantic comedy format )but each part had substance, comedy,
emotion and intellect. There is a part in the middle of the film where
Zach shows up dressed up in the wrong dress code for the wrong dress up
Party which has been seen many times but never better than in this
film. If you are in a mood for a romantic comedy, pick this one now and
you might enjoy it like I did.?
