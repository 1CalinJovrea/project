Most people are going to want to see this film based on the trailer
alone. It looks like a funny and adventurous heist movie of some sort.
While it's not a comedy in the truest sense, it's just light enough to
keep the audience involved.The film follows two twenty-somethings, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as
they venture to the top of the international arms dealer industry.
Amidst the war in Iraq, they use unorthodox techniques to fulfill US
military contracts.War Dogs gets a little wordy when it's setting things up. Also,
Teller's voice-over goes on a little bit too long at times. But while
verbose when explaining things, it covers a lot of ground answering
most of our questions in a Big Short type of way. Thus, a potentially
byzantine premise never becomes convoluted.Teller plays David Packouz, the antiwar protagonist who is contributing
to the war effort out of financial necessity. He's good, but Hill
arguably carries the film, playing the real-life Efraim Diveroli. He's
basically a selfish scumbag who could double as a mob boss at any given
moment. Hill broadens his range as an actor with this role, proving he
can play sinister along with his goofy trademark. He's so deceptively
creepy that we become literally afraid of him.Genre-wise, it might seem to be stuck in limbo, but it's not. The
comedy is evenly written and is balanced consistently into the drama.
The exposition is fast-paced and doesn't require us to look back
scratching our heads.War Dogs doesn't necessarily explore any new territory as far as the
life of a criminal goes, but it's educational and entertaining every
step of the way.Twizard Rating: 89
