"Call Me By Your Name" perfectly adapted to film.

If you've read the book, you will not be disappointed. If you've not
read the book, you must. They fit together as a beautiful work
together. Companions in art. One without the other, and you just aren't
as fulfilled. I cannot wait to reread the book.Timothée's performance is one for the history books. The Adele
Excharpolous à la Blue is the Warmest Color of the year. His eyes are
so expressive and every emotion and action is so deeply felt by this
poor tortured soul that by the ending you cannot help but weep and feel
at the absolute lowest you've ever been.Armie is portrayed to perfection, as well. His "later" and other
phrases stand out so sharply in a world of prompt and prim dialect that
it makes us feel engaged in a way that I've never felt by a movie. He
was such an outsider and yet we were assimilating to his was as opposed
to the way it should be. He, a guest, in Italy, for 6 weeks, leaves
just as American as the day he arrived.Luca's obsession with men dancing and swimming pools and beautifully
choreographed sex, is perfect for this story. I cannot think of a
better match. Luca said in the Q&A afterward that he decided to change
a few things from the book because not everything written in prose
works on screen in a cinematic way, and if you've read the book, you
will agree. He also said the author, who makes a small cameo in the
film, thinks Luca's changes are better than the original form. So,
that's affirming.Peach scene? Devastating. Sufjan's new songs? Devastating.This was a very sad movie but I loved every second. Let's hope Suspiria
is even better. Luca G. might be the most exciting director working
today. It was a privilege to watch this with him and the amazing cast
and crew INCLUDING Sufjan. I hope Sony Pictures Classics doesn't mess
up the distribution/awards campaign. This deserves praise.Also, 10/10 opening credits/font. Luca can do no wrong.
