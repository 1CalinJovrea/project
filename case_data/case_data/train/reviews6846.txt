Over hyped and mediocre film!!

I didn't think it was all that good, its one of those films that gets
over hyped and in the end turns out quite mediocre and boring, yes its
funny in parts but you won't be rushing to see it again! Personally, I
thought the acting was incredible and I loved the character
development. What I didn't like was the portrayal of multiple
personality disorder. It went from a very interesting story to a
mediocre silly ending where he turns into a monster and starts killing
people and starts doing supernatural things. That ruined it for me
personally. M Night shyamlans direction was horrible towards the end.
So far his best film will only be the sixth sense.
