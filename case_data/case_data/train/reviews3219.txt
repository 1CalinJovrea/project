Inspiring and f-ing awesome.

I don't care what people say about action films, I love them and if it
has Arny, Sly, Willis, or JCVD count me in.I thought this movie was going to be a disappointment like "The Last
Stand", and it proved me wrong with a vengeance. This wasn't a movie slapped together for two "has beens." It was an
interesting (and yes a little out there) story that would hold up
without the two. Casting Sly and Arny was the icing on the cake. I
think the script was decent, the directing great (it actually made me
feel involved), and the acting was choice. It was done well. No old timer jokes, no spoofing, just another movie I
want to own. The ending was almost as pleasing as "Inglorious Bastards'" conclusion. Nothing like seeing someone get what's coming to them.I also thought Arnold was just going to be in it for a minute, nope.
I'd say he was in about 75 percent of the film and every moment he was
on screen I felt like a kid again. The two are personal heroes of mine and this movie reminded me why.
