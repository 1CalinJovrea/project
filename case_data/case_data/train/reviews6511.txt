Fun...But weird.

Jeepers Creepers 3 is a weird movie going experience. I loved the first
one, and really liked the second one. I went into three wanting to love
it. I didn't. But here is the weird part. The movie felt like it was
never fully finished. Almost like a very rough first draft was the
finished product. It almost looked as if they ran out of money before
it was completed. It was very strange. If you are a fan of the first
two, you will like to see the characters you love. If this is your
first experience with the characters, you will be like what the hell
did I just watch!
