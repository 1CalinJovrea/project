awful

The 'Wrong Turn' franchise has basically been sliding down hill since
the first one but this film is so utterly awful I question how it was
even released. There is absolutely no story line at all, pointless
nudity & pointless gore. This film is just an excuse to throw sex and
gore together with no story. The cast are all un known actors which you
can tell by their appalling acting. The whole film is just this mash up
off terrible acting and pointlessness. If you're willing to waste
nearly two hours of your life watching this then go ahead. IMDb have
rated this 4/10 stars this is completely wrong it literally scrapes a 1
literally scrapes it I don't even know how I a managed to sit through
the film? Really if you value your brain cells do not waste your time.
