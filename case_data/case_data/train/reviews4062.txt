A strong and touching Movie

Well written, stunning cinematography and convincing acting! The main
story takes you on a hunting trip that starts slow, but then goes
downhill in an instant. From there on out, all that matters is
survival. All together a very well made movie that was worth the time
and money! Give it a try and take part in a journey into a part of the
culture and nature of rural America.
