Skip it and watch the original instead

As a fan of the original Death Note anime I am very disappointed in
this film. It was poorly acted, horribly paced, and the drama felt more
edgy than composed. The characters personalities were completely
changed to the point where I didn't see why they even bothered
maintaining the original names and The events of the story were changed
so drastically I forgot that I was watching Death Note. In the original
anime both L and Light were very calm and rational in how they made
each decision, creating a suspenseful psychological drama, but in the
film both of them do things that were very out of character and
essentially made no sense. Overall this felt very rushed and poorly
directed, I wouldn't be surprised if the director had never even heard
of the original anime before doing this film.
