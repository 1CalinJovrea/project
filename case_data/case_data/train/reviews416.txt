another "lost weekend" remake but without the bite, ultimately "a lost opportunity"

I really wanted to like this movie but something besides the crash went
terribly wrong. Of course Denzel is great, acting wasn't the problem,
for the most part. To put it bluntly, the main disaster here was the
director pulling punches, playing it safe. Remarkably, the supposed
center piece of the movie, the crash, was actually completely
irrelevant to the plot. Think about the setup, the pilot was not
responsible for the crash and he saved the plane, for the most part,
with very few deaths. The movie took great pains to make it clear how
extraordinary this was, "everyone crashed the plane in simulations"
etc. Well, did the pilot's alcoholism help this or hurt this
performance? Simple question but this apparently had nothing to do with
the moral point of the movie, so somehow his miracle flying and his
alcoholism were never considered as related. There could have been many
different solutions. E.G. perhaps the pilot missed something obvious in
his walk around, so he both "caused" the crash and saved the plane,
would have preserved the main arc of the story, kept the crash at the
center of the movie but legitimately brought in the alcoholism. And the
ending simply sucked, in prison, now wiser and honest........sigh,
boring, as was the reconciliation with his son, feel good American
tripe ending, double sigh.
