Wow.

This movie is absolutely terrible.Imagine melting a 4kg ball of Edam, a 12kg slab of cheddar and 47 cases
of mozzarella, it still wouldn't be anywhere near as cheesy as this
piece of drivel.I was dragged along to see it and for the entire time I sat there
wondering if this was some kind of sick joke I wasn't in on.The effects were decent but lets be honest, which movie doesn't have
decent effects nowadays? The acting is absolutely horrific, the rock
has the acting ability of a disabled fox and I wanted the two English
toff kids to die every time they appeared on the screen.The girl in it, although very attractive, has the personality of a
sprout.Bah! if anyone offers to watch this movie in your presence please punch
them in the face.The ending where the rock says something like "now we rebuild" and the
American flag unfurls in the wind made me want to spew my popcorn all
over the cinema floor.Avoid at all costs.
