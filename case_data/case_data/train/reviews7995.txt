A Bombardment of Pure Joy and Happiness

I don't know what's wrong with those people who gave this movie a
rating below 7, but they definitely need professional help. Cause if
you don't feel that this movie is great, then there must be something
really broken inside you! This movie gave us nothing but beautiful
music, great adventures, hilarious comedy, with a little hint of fairy
tale inserted (Hello, Cinderella!). It also gave us a strong moral
lesson, which is to never give up hope in any kind of bad situation. It
also tell us to be brave, kind, and always try to see the bright side
in everything. How can it be called anything except amazing? I'm a guy,
but I'm deeply touched when I saw Poppy's sadness killing her
happiness, turning her whole body grey but then Branch started healing
her and reviving her colors back. I have to admit I cried when I
witnessed that heartwarming event. The songs which were picked for this
movie is spot on! Each and every one of them brushed this movie with
joy, thrill, and spirit. This animation movie is nearly perfect in
every aspect. If you want to feel happy, then you definitely need to
watch this movie.
