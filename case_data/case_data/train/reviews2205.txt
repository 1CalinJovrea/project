I'll take it from here.....

Tobin Frost is a CIA agent who's turned rogue. When he is pursued by
men who want to kill him, he goes to the American Consulate where he
knows he will be arrested.When the CIA learns of this, it's decided to bring him to a safe house
in Capetown. Shortly after they arrive, the men who chased Frost storm
the safe house and kill everyone there.Matt Weston, the agent who's tasked with looking after the safe house,
is the only one left, so he takes Frost and they go on the run. While
on the run, Frost tells Weston that the only way those men found the
safe house was that someone on the inside told them about it.Eventually Frost escapes and Weston is told to report to Langley but
just as he's about to, he recalls something that Frost did that helps
him figure out where he could be going.But just as he arrives, the men who are after Frost show up but Weston
saves him and they head off. But Weston knows that Frost is holding
something back....Denzel Washington is one of those actors that can open a movie
regardless of the content. And here is another example. It's your usual
story of corruption in the government, and Washington holds the answer.It's another great performance from the actor, but Frost is a different
kind of character to the ones we are used to seeing.If you mix Harris from Training day and Creasey from Man on Fire, you
comes up with the closest answer to Frost. The character on paper is
despicable, but once the film gets going, he's not all bad after all,
but still carries an evil streak with him.Reynolds has never been better than his performance here, and proves he
has acting chops as well as the looks. The narrative is good, and the
action is very loud and up close, but not as irritating as some are
saying.So all in all, it's nothing special, you can pretty much work out who
the bad guy is in the first five minute, but thanks to Washington and
Reynolds, an average thriller, becomes thrilling.
