It could be worse, the acting wasn't bad, not interesting, but not bad.

You know that thing where you see a lot of great reviews and very few
mediocre and no bad reviews so you expect the movie to at least be
decent but it ends up being completely boring with nothing new or
interesting at all in any way even the camera work or direction or
acting or setting, and totally clich√©d in every scene and very
predictable, but you keep watching because you can't believe the
reviews would be as wrong as they very obviously are? And you know that other thing where you wonder if the world of
reviewers and movie watchers that leave reviews were all on drugs or
drunk or distracted or didn't watch the movie but gave a review for
some reason or another while thinking "hey, people say it is good" and
"hey, why don't I compliment it in the same way others have" and then
they write their pretentious dribble about what is basically a
second-rate after school special from back in the day in America when
networks would make those corny "life lessons for teens" melodramas
which had nothing of any value in them but showcased young pretty
people in the hopes of getting ratings from teens and tween girls who
just got home from school and didn't want to watch talk shows or game
shows and were bored wit nothing to do? And you know that thing were a studio or producer or writers has a
checklist of "moments" that they start off in the hopes of getting a
hit and then write a script based on that even though every single
scene is hackneyed and literally has nothing to offer except some
pretty actors speaking like a writer, a bad writer at that instead of
anything even remotely fresh, interesting, fun, etc, etc, etc?
