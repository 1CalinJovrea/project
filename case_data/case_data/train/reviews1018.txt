Best Spider-man film to date

i love this film. it does the character of spider-man justice. Andrew
Garfield was chosen perfectly as peter parker. After spider-man 3 we
needed a change and this is a great fresh take on the character. It is
more comic accurate than the Raimi films such as the web shooters and
Gwen Stacy as the love interest instead of Mary Jane. I liked the new
suit because it looked like a teen could make it. The villain the
lizard was a great first foe for spider man. Uncle Bens death scene
made me want to cry and Garfields reaction was sad. I love how Gwen
comforted him and Flash didn't bully him out of sorrow. i love how
peter went from being a vigilante hunting his uncles killer to a hero
fighting all crime.
