Great Adventure

The criminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from the
LunaMax, a moon-based maximum security prison. He comes to Earth
seeking revenge from Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) that has blown his arm
up and arrested him forty years ago and protected Earth from a
Boglodyte invasion. Boris is defeated again and he travels back in time
to 1969 to kill Agent K.When Agent J (Will Smith) notes that the time line has changed in the
present days and Agent O (Emma Thompson) tells him that K died in 1969,
he decides to travel to 15 July 1969 to save K on the next day. Agent J
has difficulties to convince the Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) with lies,
but when he decides to tell the truth, K believes in his words and they
seek out Boris together. They are helped by the amicable alien Griiffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) that
has precognitive powers and gives the ArcNet to K to protect Earth from
the Boglodyte invasion. Further, J learns a secret about K and himself."Men in Black 3" is a great adventure of this franchise, with a
wonderful story and magnificent special effects. I had low expectations
with movie, but I was favorably surprised with an adorable film. My
vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "MIB³ - Homens de Preto 3" ("MIB³ - Men in Black 3")
