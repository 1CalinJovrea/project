Great concept, mediocre execution

Wow, I really anticipated on this movie, suspense, action, the unknown,
it all sounds very exciting. Now I must say that I have seen some very
good movies and series round this theme that may influence my judgment,
for example The Cube (1 - 3), Persons Unknown, Saw, etc. all have a
person or group of persons who don't know how they get there or how to
get away. How is it possible that those movies, some dating from 1997,
are so much better then a 2014 movie? And being almost 2 hours long,
how come so little happens in those 2 hours? Some reviewers already
mentioned the contradictory and illogical elements in this movie, and
yes, this does this movie, with such much potential, not much good,
it's just annoying to see them not try what is so logic. The movie is
entertaining, but leaves you very unsatisfied.
