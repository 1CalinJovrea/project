Snow White and The Huntsman is no poison apple

Mirror Mirror on the wall how was Snow White and the Huntsman after
all? This is definitely a must see for the summer if you love fantasy
type movies in the vain of Lord of the Rings and Legend. Great scenes
incorporating stunning action sequences, comedy and what you know of
the story from your youth but without running over that same old ground
until it is mud. Many new fresh takes on the classic tale are here for
sure to keep you entertained for it's 2 hour duration while allowing
you to escape into it's magical world. Charlize Theron is amazing as
the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth does a bang up job as the Huntsman.
The CG effects throughout the movie are very well done and add that
little bit you need to a film like this. The PG 13 rating is also
appropriate since the film has a very Dark overshadow and may not be
the best for small children to view. With the 2012 Summer movie season
already well on the way with blockbusters such as the Avengers and MIB
III, Snow White and the Huntsman will fit in just fine and hold it's
own for sure.
