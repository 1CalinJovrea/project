Brolin is amazing. The film is not.

Let's just get this out of the way: Josh Brolin's portrayal of a young
Tommy Lee Jones is freakishly good. It's one of the most amusing
performances of 2012 so far. It's disappointing then that the film
around him  which appears to have felt the effects of its well known
production issues  is hit and miss at best, cringe-worthy at worst.
The CGI is often horrible, Jemaine Clement's villain is underwhelming
and Hollywood stalwarts Jones and Emma Thomson are criminally
underused. However, there's still enough here to recommend for Dad's
and sons looking for some female-free time. Will Smith is clearly
relishing the opportunity to play Agent J for the third time and he
slots back into ultra-cool, jive-talking mode like a second skin. A
handful of the gags work too, most of them stemming from the
fish-out-of-water premise having Agent J return to the sixties. Oh, and
did I mention that Brolin is amazing? He's almost worth the price of
admission alone. Almost.
