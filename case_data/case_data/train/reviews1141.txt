Just terrible

This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Sure it has crazy
creatures battling it out in the oceans which is just fine with me but
so many elements just let the movie down. It could have been so much
more.Why did the drivers of the Jaegers need to actually be in the Jaeger at
all? and why are the controls linked to massive mechanical devices,
surely this would be electronic. And the head is fired onto the Jaeger
via some massively complicated lift type procedure? Yet they can
clearly just get out the head when needed?It took 8 days of tanks and planes to take down a Kaiji but one shot
into the eye from an auzi clearly causes it some distress? ONE SHOT? The oceans are about 4 stories deep, which seems to change or the size
of the Jaegers adjusts during the movie.What's with every bit of steel needing to be rusty except for Ron
Perlman's shoes? and massive bulkhead doors being used for the living
compartments.The acting, sooooo bad.Let's send the helicopters to go and pick-up the two survivors, but
lets send 20 helicopters, that makes much more sense, especially since
this is a military program that has been shut down so ready access to
dozens of helicopters becomes easier.They can build Jaegers with some sort of amazing sword device that
comes out of nowhere but forget to tell the drivers? Charlie and the professor, just random cast choices there!It's set in the future, some things are hi-tech others are retro rusty
junk, it doesn't make any sense.There's just so much more. How this movie gets a 7.8 is beyond me.
Don't waste you life and avoid at all costs.
