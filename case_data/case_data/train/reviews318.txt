Watch a porn instead!

This movie was pointless. The beginning has no link with the movie. you
might try to co-relate it to the movie the whole time and at the end
you realize how much time of yours was wasted. the movie shows kids
making stupid decisions which were again very pointless, leave the
viewers trying to figure out the significance behind each action of
theirs. you might expect a satisfactory suspense but no the movie ends
abruptly leaving you wonder why on earth did you waste your time on it.
I'd suggest you to watch a porn instead, would save you your time and
of course relief from unwanted drama. I love horror movies but neither
this movie gave me those jump scares nor this movie had a logical plot.
Such a boring piece of work.
