Two elite CIA agents, Franklin and Tuck, operating out of Los Angeles
are suspended for fouling up an assassination operation in HK. Since
they have nothing else to do, they start looking for women. As fate
would have it, they fall for the same woman, Lauren.So in brotherly comradarie they agree to compete for her. For the
unfortunate woman she goes suddenly from having no male attention (not
really believable but there you have it) to have two virile,
interesting and attractive men pursuing her.This is where the high comedy should begin: but it is very ham-fisted
and relies heavily on over the top action and sexual innuendo. The
banter is forced, and the jokes are too predictable.We, the viewers, see that of the two men, Tuck (the less attractive
one) is upfront and genuine, and Franklin (the more attractive one) is
rather deceitful and willing to lie to impress the girl. However, the
deceitful one actually falls for the girl and scorns all the other
women is currently sleeping with to be with Lauren. The script gave no
plausibility for this change, and even within the genre it is a bit too
much.We know which one she chooses - the more attractive one of course!!!
And somehow she manages to maintain the relationship when she realises
that Franklin know absolutely nothing about Klimt, and really does not
help out at the animal shelter, and is impossibly egocentric.But since this is a romantic comedy, Tuck couldn't be left out in the
cold - no, there is another woman brought in to save him from
loneliness.
