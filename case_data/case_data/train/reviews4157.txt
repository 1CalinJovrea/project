nothing comes at night

nothing of significance happens during the whole movie. its slow, not
scary, and a waste of time. no answers to any of the questions the film
poses. just a bunch of people in the wood who don't trust each other
and some fatal disease that just kills everyone. in all truth...Nothing
comes at night throughout the whole film. i wouldn't even pirate this
movie.
