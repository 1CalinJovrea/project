Winks a bit too hard . . .

Had I seen this when it was a new release, I'd have thought it was a
small patch on a very tired genre: the Hollywood buddy cops comedy. The
plot's nothing new--undercover cop starts to sympathize with the dapper
gangster/drug dealer he's trying to nab--but the homoerotic elements,
an arguable subtext in even the most serious films in this genre, are
writ so large and loud here that they threaten to squirt you in the eye
(ahem). The filmmakers probably though it would be funny to make
explicit what other films only suggest, but the joke wears thin right
around the moment that one of the leads feeds the other a
live-squid-on-a-stick (a uniquely Korean treat) held at crotch level,
and minions outside see the seemingly fellatial event in silhouette
against the window blinds. Hmmm. There IS an explosive diarrhea gag
that made me laugh, but then I felt really guilty afterwards. Good
looking film, but total garbage.
