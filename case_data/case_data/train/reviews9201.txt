Very realistic and true! If only Douglas repeated what he did in reality!

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I wish there were more scenes of the
characters as children. I am not in the age bracket of the actors, but
could compare my own friendships with theirs. I love when movies show
and even promote realistic relationships.I hate how Paddy didn't get the girl and was even told that his wife
only stuck with him because his first choice said no. It left a bad
taste in the mouth. There should have been at least 2 older ladies in
the film. one for each of them! I loved Morgan in this film also. Very
funny. You will find there are some great one liners in this film.Age is just a number... for everything EXCEPT true love. You can start
something new everyday. A new business venture, going back to study,
travelling, you name it! But there is something very endearing about
couples who choose to grow old together or with someone of their own
generation. I think Billy and men like Billy (was), ARE fearful of
growing old. And then some are just straight up jerks! All in all, a
great film to watch with friends.
