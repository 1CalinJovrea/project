Predictable and trite

I was completely disappointed with this film - everything I thought
might happen, did happen - it was the most predictable movie I've seen
of late. Blythe Danner did a really good job, as did the little boy,
but the other actors were one dimensional, shallow and unbelievable.
Even the story line was unbelievable. Yes, I would be mad if he had not
told me the truth but it certainly wasn't a "you did something so
horrible that I want you out of my life now" kind of bad. In addition
to not buying into the whole storyline, this film moved incredibly
slow. Long views of Zac walking or looking at her or of her thinking.
Maybe if the acting had been better it might have been OK but Zac Efron
had one look on his face the entire show. And it was a kind of "deer in
the headlights" look - really just another Hollywood pretty face with
no talent. In my opinion, the sex scenes weren't even steamy because
the passion wasn't believable. Other than Blythe and the little boy,
there was nothing redeeming about this film.
