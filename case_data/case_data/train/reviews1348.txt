Juvenile Kung-Fu

The film had potential with a decent storyline and all-star cast, but
fails to pull in the viewer to care about the characters or outcome of
the story.The movie far too often goes for cheap,juvenile sexual
exploitation.The target audience for the movie seems geared towards
males 16-24 and no one else.I've also noticed that the more people see
the film the ratings here on IMDb decline.RZA also has very little
acting skills and it was a major reason why the movie falls flat.
Russell Crowe and Lucy Lui did a fair performance,but even they
couldn't salvage the movie.I'm being very critical with my review b/c
it's unfortunate to see a movie that had the potential,but didn't live
up to it.
