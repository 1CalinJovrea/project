This was a definite wrong turn.

Let's get this out of the way I really enjoy this franchise I have
since I saw the first movie and now own them all on Bluray except
(thankfully) not this one.However that being said there is absolutely nothing redeemable
whatsoever with this entry into the franchise .The storyline is all over the place and has no general direction ,the
acting is absolutely horrible ,and none of the characters are
interesting much less likable .The BAD GUYS are also laughable and Pathetic,the inbreds looked really
cheap looking in this entry,and even the deaths were more hilarious
then gruesome like some others were in this movie franchise.The ending of this film was also nonsensical and literally just cuts
off before you even know what the hell is even going on .Which makes perfect sense since no part of this film made sense and the
horribly bad acting only made that much more obvious.This movie was also B O R I N G with a capital B all it was was talk
talk talk kill kill kill over and over again through the entire film.I managed to get to the halfway point of this film and fast forwarded
it in the hopes that it would get better but nope it only got worse and
more nonsensical and boring.Essentially this movie was an embarrassment and a disaster all rolled
into one so glad I watched it instead of bought it .Don't rent and don't buy stay clear of this entry it's not worth the
time nor the money period.
