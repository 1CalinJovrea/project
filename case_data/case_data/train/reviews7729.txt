Ignore the low ratings

I just saw this movie and I am very happy I ignored the reviewers. I
have watched every Mummy movie in history (even the black and whites)
and this was a great story! There was humour, great special affects,
the story was strong, the acting was great, I didn't lose interest for
3 minutes during the entire movie!If you couldn't follow the story - you are an imbecile.I hope they realize that there are a lot of us who LOVED the movie!
Ignore the whiners! I will go see it AGAIN!
