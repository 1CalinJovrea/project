Engaging biography - not a story, though

Beth (Rebecca Hall), having drifted into private dancing (home visits
leading to small scale prostitution) decides to leave small-town
Florida and head for Las Vegas, where a more fulfilling life as a
cocktail waitress beckons. Alas, cocktail waitressing in Vegas is a
difficult nut to crack, and beth ends up working for Dink (Bruce Wilis)
who makes his living from his sports gambling company. What follows is
the story of Beth's progress, and her involvement with Dink, his wife
Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones), journalist Jeremy (Joshua Jackson),
bookmaker Rosie (Vince Vaughan) and gambler Dave (John Carroll Lynch).The need to classify films is sometimes a problem, and this is the case
here. The closing titles tell us that Beth married Jeremy, took a
degree and became a writer: the film is based on her personal memoir
and, like real life, is episodic and unstructured. So, while it is
often amusing, it is not a comedy, while it is sometimes dramatic it is
not a drama and, in fact, it isn't really a story at all, it is simply
a recollection of a period in her life.My main criticism is that as someone who is not a sports fan and
doesn't bet, big chunks of this movie were as opaque to me as a movie
with big chunks set on the floor of a stock exchange would have been. I
understand that this is inevitable, but it was something of a problem.And this is a shame, because the film otherwise kept me occupied in a
very agreeable manner. Rebecca Hall is a delight. Having played serious
characters previously, with a tendency towards the plain, Beth is a
sunny, engaging, leggy, sexy pleasure, but all the characters are quite
nice people (which, frankly, I find unlikely, but that didn't matter: I
enjoyed the film anyway. And it was a pleasure to see Vince Vaughan
playing a different character.
