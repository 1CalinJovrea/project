Summary:

This is a story set in the early colonial period of New England. It has
the authenticity of a well-researched historical drama, up to and
including dialogue delivered in a period accent and vocabulary
(softened a bit so that it's easy to understand). Instead of drawing on
historical events, though, it draws on historical folklore -- it's the
story of witchcraft afflicting a family, such as might have been told
at the time.The characters are a very believable, ordinary family, with the sorts
of tensions and problems you'd expect from people living a hard and
substantially isolated life after being exiled from the local colonial
town. They also have period Calvinist attitudes, and the storytelling
doesn't present an outsider's view of this or offer a modern
commentary, but instead it just displays these attitudes and tells a
story from the characters' standpoint.Their reliance on period folklore means that it doesn't strictly follow
modern horror movie tropes, either. It has the slow build of a modern
psychological horror/thriller as well as the standard formula where
tragedies start from tragic flaws, but the traditions it's drawing on
depend on a Calvinist's conception of flaws, and treat witchcraft as a
horrible, well-understood occurrence rather than a shocking
supernatural surprise. This story applies these perspectives.It's very well done in terms of writing, acting, and other aspects of
execution, so it might have cross-over appeal to fans of horror,
folklore, or straight period drama from colonial America.
