I Cried in the Parking Lot

As a huge fan of the musical, I have religiously followed this film
through its production from behind-the-scenes to trailers to
sneak-peaks. And let me tell you, Les Mis did not disappoint! From the
very beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music, I was
hooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie, I was riveted.Singing: Everybody was great! Russell Crowe was not PHENOMENAL, but was
excellent in "Stars" and "Javert's Soliloquy". Hugh Jackman, too, had
his weak moments...but really wowed during "Who am I?" and "Bring Him
Home". Anne Hathaway gave the best vocal performance, followed closely
by Samantha Barks.Acting: A fantastic performance from the whole ensemble. Again, Anne
Hathaway blew everybody else out of the water. Samantha Barks, Eddie
Redmayne, Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were also excellent in terms
of emotional delivery. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen
were the much needed (and absolutely hilarious) comedic relief. Production: One of the best period films I've seen. The costuming,
makeup, hair and set design were impeccable. I really liked how people
weren't made to be "pretty" as Hollywood often does; thankfully, the
actors' teeth were not left movie-star white.Overall, one of the best movies I've seen. I cried at least 10 times
through the whole film, and the finale completely RUINED me. I was
sobbing a full 15 minutes after the movie ended, walking through the
theatre and out to the car.Highly recommended for everyone!
