Overrated and tedious

This movie contains eye-candy (Zac Efron) and stunning scenery. It's
almost like the director is counting on that to rescue a very weak
script. This movie spent over and hour and a half trying to make us
"feel" the angst of the main characters but instead I kept wanting to
slap them into having some sense. I kept thinking that the actors
needed more lines and less music to tell the story. It was melodramatic
and entirely predictable. I do not recommend this movie in the theaters
unless you have money and time to throw away. I must add that I was impressed with Zac Efron's acting and also the
boy in the movie. I was surprised that Blythe Danner lent her talent to
such a weak vehicle but I'm sure there aren't many options for older
actresses in this day.
