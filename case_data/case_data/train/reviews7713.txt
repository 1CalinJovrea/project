Extremely disappointing

I was attracted to this film because of the director's prestige and
because it was an adaptation of a well-received book. It has also
received many positive reviews. I don't know why. The film is too long (much too long), too repetitive
and too superficial in its treatment of the central issue of religious
faith. The acting is uninspired. None of the characters awoke my
sympathy. Japanese men speaking good English to Portuguese priests was
just weird. Scorcese combines all this with gruesome torture scenes and
monsoon weather to reach his full numbing effect. The only redeeming
feature was the music: there wasn't any.
