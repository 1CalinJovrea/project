Battle of the Sexes is an entertaining movie about the legendary tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs

This was a fascinating docudrama about the match between Bobby
Riggs-the middle-aged admitted male chauvinist-and Billie Jean King-the
phenomenal female tennis champ. We see each of their lives before the
match and marvel at the period of the times and how certain social
situations were handled at the time and what changes were happening
during it. Emma Stone and Steve Carell embody their roles to the hilt.
Also fascinating hearing Howard Cosell's commentary throughout the
actual action when he originally did it on ABC during that time. I saw
this with my movie theatre-working friend and we both highly recommend
it!
