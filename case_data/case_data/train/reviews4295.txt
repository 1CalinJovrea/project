Check out the other reviews

After witnessing what can only be described as a 'car crash' of a
movie, I was surprised to find so many glowing reviews?! However,
clicking onto the majority of these profiles reveals they are new
members whose accounts were coincidentally created around the time of
the films release, or appear to be used to push specific movie titles
with a political agenda. Why? This is a Movie Database not a platform
for terrible politics.One of them even goes so far as to mention her son by name (and
highlights this) in every review, regardless of whether or not he saw
the film.Anyway, The movie is terrible, technically it is average looking and it
would be hard to fault the quality of the medium, given that most
people have HD built into their smartphone now.Each scene was as desperate as it was cringe-worthy, using every
common, overplayed clich√© and trope from last year. People getting
covered in urine is not comedy, And I think it's fair to say the
ignorantly confident and 'sassy' girl power thing has been done to
death. The story failed to convey any moral or real emotional weight.
Uncomfortably, the cast was almost entirely and purposely 'Blackwashed'
with the exception of some 90's Spike Lee style reverse tokens if you
look hard enough. Just why? Shameful.
