Good, even if it didn't follow the book

Other than the names of the central characters, this movie bears only
passing resemblance to the book. That being said, it works, most of the
time. Mitch Rapp is totally believable. Michael Keaton is in darn good
shape for a man his age, and his character is believable.It's too bad that the producers bowed to the cancer of political
correctness and made Irene Kennedy black. That was so out of keeping
with the Mitch Rapp books. Shame on Hollywood for bowing to pressure.All in all, the movie was worth the price of the ticket, and I only
hope it does well enough at the box office to ensure that the series
continues.
