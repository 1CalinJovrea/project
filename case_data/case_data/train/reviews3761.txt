No substance to grab you with

While this movie's characters and plot have potential to hold the
viewer's suspense throughout, this movie BORES the audience with the
drawn-out, very predictable layout. As stated in any description of the
movie you'll see that the main character slips into a coma and sees her
situation from an out-of-body experience. She is torn between the
decision to return to her life or transition to the afterlife but,
she's only reviewing portions of her life already lived. These scenes
have already been depicted and/or forecasted during the movie's
introduction to the character in the first thirty minutes of the movie
and are painfully redundant. Like I stated above, the movie has
potential to hold the viewer's attention but it displays a typical
low-budget "indie" feel with a lack of originality. The movie's only
saving grace would be a "twist" ending but, if you find yourself still
watching after an hour and five minutes, despite your own better
judgment, you will be begging for the time you've wasted back. Trust
me, you will be fast-forwarding through much of the movie and you will
have not missed any essential details at all. You will find that the
ending will only disappoint you. Save yourself, don't wast your time.
