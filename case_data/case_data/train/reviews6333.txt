A great (true) story on hitting bottom

This is not a big Hollywood budget film. But there are many stories out
there that don't need special effects etc. to tell a great story. I
could relate to Eric's story; his childhood, his young adult life. His
addiction. It was only in 'never quitting' that he continued to fight
each day to live.In those 7 days, he truly hit bottom, took stock of his life and found
what mattered most. In the end he faced his inner demons and was
finally at peace.This is a great story of survival in the literal and ethereal sense.
Inspirational and compelling. I was rooting for Eric, not just for his
survival but for his redemption.
