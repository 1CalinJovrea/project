Delivers on its promise

"Minions" doesn't really have anything new to offer, aside from crassly
commercializing the yellow side players in the "Despicable Me" movies.
You sort of accept that going in. Personally, I've always been fond of
the little pill-shaped bastards, which is why I enjoyed this movie.
It's 90 minutes of exactly what you'd expect from them and it turns out
that's enough to sustain a whole movie. The cast is great, despite the
miscast Sandra Bullock (not a slight, I like her) and the humor is just
right for a light-as-it-gets Summer movie. The '60s setting also worked
surprisingly well.Honestly, as toy commercials go, you could do a whole lot worse. 7/10
