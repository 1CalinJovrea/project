amazing

I've never reviewed a film before but it needs to be done for this one
because it needs more popularity for a sequelreal rating 9/10 but it needs more credit because it is a really top of
the line film and needs more popularity for a sequel (which would be
amazing) my favourite hero was batman but now it's dredd and it reminds
me of the video game of the xbox a bit too, which was a great game.the film is full of action and an interesting story which isn't
anything really new but it is most certainly not clich√© or boring and
the actors did a great job. I only wish they created more :(WATCH IT
