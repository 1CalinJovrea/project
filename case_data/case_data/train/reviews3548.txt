It will trigger Annabellactic shock

Maybe not the most disturbing horror/demonic movie, but it's up there.
I thought the story was substantial enough. The dots are connected as
to how Annabelle became a conduit for a demon and how the person(s) who
conjured up the demon were destroyed as a consequence of the actions
that malevolent spirit drove them to. The corollary of the
Manson/Tate/LaBianca murders were a nice touch and fit nicely into the
chronology of the franchise. Effective use of imagery, movement, sound,
and scoring to put viewers on the edge of their seat. I glanced over to
my 19 year-old daughter who loves scary movies and found her sitting in
a fetal position with hands poised to cover her eyes. My Christian
peers would think I'm a horrible father for condoning such a movie by
taking my daughter to see it...but theologically I found the content to
be biblically accurate and that there certainly IS evil in the world.
And I believe that evil was set loose in our world when humankind chose
to mistrust God, and summon the power or purview of God's enemies.
