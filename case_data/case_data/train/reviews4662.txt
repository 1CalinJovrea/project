He doesn't have a basement....

There is a moment in this masterpiece when you know that that is the
part that is going to spiral someone's life out of control. And in this
movie, it's the split second scene where Klaras brother shows her an
indecent picture on the IPad.It's not served to you on a plate, but its little subtle things like
this, that make this movie the harrowing piece it is.Mikkelsen is wonderful as Lucas, a lonely teacher who is just trying to
get his life back on track. His son is about to move in with him, and
he has met a potential partner, but when Klara, his best friends
daughter makes him a gift, and he refuses it because he feels its
inappropriate, she tells the teacher a lie, that will shake the whole
community.As the viewer, you feel so much empathy for Lucas, because you know
that his career is over, and that his life will never be the same, but
at the same time, you feel anger toward the rest of the community,
because they banish him, without letting him speak.Its a taboo subject, because any sane person would take the youngsters
side, but it's the fact that when she says to her mother she made it
up, the mother just brushes it off, and it gets worse and worse for
Lucas.It really is a hard hitting film, the cast are wonderful, and having it
set around Christ,as, gives the mood an even more lonely feel for
Lucas.It's not for all tastes, it will leave you exhausted, especially the
final scene, which leaves you knowing that Lucas will always be guilty
to some, even though it's been proved otherwise.Essential viewing.
