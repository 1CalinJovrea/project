What on earth was that!

I'm sorry but this film is utter garbage! How on earth this film has
this high of a rating is madness.I watch a lot of horror films, even your low budget films and I can
honestly say this is an awful film. So much so that I felt I had to
write a review because i felt I had to warn people so they do not waste
there film. There's certainly some part of my life that I can't get
back! I can't even explain how over-rated it is from most of the reviews it
most certainly is not 100.To narrow it down I've had more scares from day time television and
will definitely not be keeping an eye out for a sequel ha-ha!Oh and the goat does it!
