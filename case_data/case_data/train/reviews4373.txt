Unbelievable  And Not In A Good Way

This film is undeniably visually dazzling, arguably to the point of
being exhausting. But what I'm taking from this dubious new genre, if
you could call it that, is that filmmakers shamelessly exploit and yet
devalue the nature of real-life illusionism (i.e. "magic"), in which
the magician actually has to make something work that looks impossible
or highly unlikely (it's a trick), by making use of the nearly endless
possibilities of film, in which things that would be impossible in real
life can actually be accomplished on screen. So we get things like
Lizzy Caplan apparently vanishing into thin air in Atlas's apartment,
and since magicians, of course, don't divulge how they accomplish their
tricks, the film takes advantage of this by doing things that in all
likelihood really are impossible  no explanations or credibility
necessary. Since we all know that you can do all these things in the movies
anyway, what's the point of making them into magicians, when you can
watch a Harry Potter movie and you don't really have to wonder how
people in paintings can move?
