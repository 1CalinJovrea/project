We have a king in an old as humanity dilemma of getting into the devil's kitchen or not, with a very Shakespearean feeling to it.

Watched without checking the trailer so I didn't know what to expect.
The legend and the concept itself has been done and overdone countless
times so I actually appreciated a more 'hero journey' type of view into
the story line. The last fight was however lacking and somehow
decreased the pace the action had reached.I appreciated that the story didn't have a deux ex machina type of
solution to political issues so I was pleasantly surprised that
Arthur's problems actually started when he got the power.Loved Jude Law's acting more than the protagonist's. Totally disliked
the Mage's acting, it felt like I was watching a model trying to look
fierce.I would give 10/10 for the AMAZING soundtrack and background music,
great pieces, masterfully used.
