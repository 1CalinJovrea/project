Not so much stupid as boring with an occasional giggle

The truth is that Ted 1 exhausted itself right in the trailer and the
rest of film was kind of superfluous, but it was cute to see a dumb
summer movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and is occasionally
funny. TED 2 on the other hand takes itself much too seriously in
trying to deal with the humanity of Ted. Seriously, what can a potheads
and fart jokes movie tell us about being human? Lots of recycled jokes
from Ted 1 and Ted as the main comic attraction in the movie just
doesn't work anymore. There are a few good jokes and visual gags as
befitting a summer comedy, but the rest are only marginally funny with
a boring movie plot that connects them. You can see it if you happen to
be home and stoned with nothing better to do :)
