Sorry, but anyone who doesn't enjoy this flick doesn't understand action thrillers

Well acted, well written and well directed. There's a lot of blood
spilled in this film, and there's enough nudity and foul language to
send the kids off to bed before you start it. But once you do start it, you'll be thoroughly entertained and
intrigued by a unique storyline and arguably one of Arnold's best
performances. There are no good guys in Sabotage. There's only
Caroline, the cute little homicide detective with a dogged
determination to solve the case.I really enjoyed this film. There is enough action, enough drama,
enough violence and enough mystery to engage any fan who enjoys a
fast-paced story with well-played characters and lots of gunfire.Go buy the DVD. You won't be sorry.8/10
