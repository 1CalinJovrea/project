Rock?! of Ages....

Well...first of. This is Glee gone glam-rock/AOR. Apart from a
G'N'R-flirt, the closest thing to hardrock you will hear is 1
Whitesnake and 1 Scorpions song. This will give you an idea of what too
expect!This is supposed to represent the music scene in LA, with focus on
Sunset Strip around 1987. Really?! Are you kidding me?! Several of
these bands had nothing do do with the "scene" there and so many that
SHOULD have been represented are not! Performing wise then? Well some of the performances are that bad, but
most really aren't that good. Meaning; a real singer can role outta bed
3 in the morning hung over and having smoked 2 packs of cigarettes and
still sing better, but the actors do OK. The huge problems is no
feeling....90% of it have absolutely no feeling at all. When it comes
to that it sounds cold and clinical with zero attachment to the song
they're singing. Maybe I'm biased here since I'm a musician myself, but
I really expected a bit more than this! Make me belief that you BELIEVE
in what your singing about. Gimme some emotion here......alas...none!
Honestly I couldn't even see the whole thing without hitting fast
forward to get past to most embarrassing parts. If you are a Tom Cruise
fanatic you might enjoy this. If you love musicals, sure...why not. If
you grew up with 80's rock, hardrock, heavy metal....well no.If you want a rockmovie that beats this by lightyears both acting and
performing wise...see Rockstar with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. Rock of Ages?! Yeah....right!
