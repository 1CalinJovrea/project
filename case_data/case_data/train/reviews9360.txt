An amazing story, but some questions about the telling

Amazing effects and stunts, along with and solid performances balance
out some artistic lapses and ethical questions in this true story of
one family's experiences of the horrendous Tsunami that killed 300,000. The downsides; there's something a little off-putting about choosing a
white, privileged family as a focus, while at the same time showing
almost exclusively other white people as suffering and afraid in a
disaster that killed far more local people than tourists. The Thai's
are certainly shown in a good light, kindly helping all these suffering
whites, but even in the hospital, almost every face we see in a bed is
a white one. That hint of odd racial insensitivity is also underlined
by replacing the original family, who were Spanish and dark, and making
them into a gorgeous blond English family, a telling choice in a 'true'
story. On a more general level, the film can feel manipulative, from the tear
jerking score, to the multiple carefully framed "will they spot each
other?" shots that feel like a horror film's self-conscious suspense
fames, but that cinematic technique feels distractingly artificial in
this more naturalistic setting. There's no question it's exciting and at times quite moving, but I
couldn't help thinking I might have felt even more deeply if it wasn't
pushing so hard to control my emotions.
