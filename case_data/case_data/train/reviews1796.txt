Terrible Hollywood Trash

I saw this had a 7.5 rating on IMDb so I thought it would be worth a
shot. How wrong I was!First of all, the casting is awful. The lead by Mark Wahlberg is so
off-base from the person he is based on, not to mention Kate Hudson
does represent who she is supposed to, I mean it is just all off in
every way. The acting could have been better, but with such a terribly
generic script, who could tell.Next the story is overly simplistic. I was hoping that the movie would
have more substance than it did. There is no thematic depth and they
took a complex story that lasted months and had incredible political
and commercial repercussions and boiled it down to a good-guy-bad-guy
movie.Wayyyy too many special effects. Compared to the actual footage, it
looks completely unreal. I also despise when movies have explosions
going off constantly to make boring scenes exciting.There is more depth in a Bond movie, better effects in Jaws, and just
about any movie is better than this. Really disappointing. At least I
saw it in "4D," where the chair movements, vibrations, smells, and air
blowing in my face distracted me from what I was watching.
