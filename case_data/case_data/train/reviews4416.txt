Oh, no!

It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the
majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was
unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most
of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is
that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with
me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I
had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters,
even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless
endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases,
very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that
Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as
their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel.I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but
laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for
me.Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my
life back!
