Utter tripe where all the crew are morons and lifeform defies physics

The plot has so many holes it may as well be made of Swiss cheese. The
whole story is just littered with so many gaping chasms of logic that
it got boring spotting them...A speeding multi-ton satellite can be caught with a flimsy armature as
momentum doesn't exist in the universe the story is based in?A mission where the architects thought to put in a multi-level
quarantine regime, but didn't think to put in mechanisms for destroying
any threat within it?Quarantine that can be broken simply by the crew mechanic opening the
door when he got a bit excited?Crew stop and take the time to have a good cry when members get killed
or have heart to heart chats in the middle of an emergency?A planet residing, carbon based lifeform that can exist in the vacuum
and low temperature of space for extended periods?An initially single cellular lifeform, that has been trained in and
given schematics on how to sabotage radio communications.A crew who aren't fully aware of the concept and practicality of
quarantine and so only find out about it in the middle of an emergency?A space station costing billions that doesn't have backups for
essential systems such as communications or computers?After switching sides and hoping to see the lifeform dissolve a few of
the crew, I got frustrated with the awful script and left. Basically a
low-brow sci-fi that happens to have a few good actors I was surprised
to see in such a poorly scripted, turd of a movie.
