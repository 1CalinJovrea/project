Mediocre.

I really wanted to like this movie - I went into with an open mind not
really knowing what to expect from it as I had not read any of the
reviews.For me it lacked atmosphere, reminiscent of a made-for-TV or direct to
DVD movie.The idea of a family moving into the actual Defeo house 40 years on was
an intriguing premise, but what I could not get past was the fact that
the eldest daughter had no idea about the house and it's history until
her new-found friends informed her, along with it's grisly back- story.
Had she been living under a rock? At first I thought - OK, the movies
don't exist in this universe but then they actually mention the movies,
sequels and remake and even venture to watch the 1979 original.Still, it was watchable and although there were the usual clich√©d
horror tropes it did hold my interest until the end.
