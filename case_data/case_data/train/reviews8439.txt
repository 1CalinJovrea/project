More Pride and Prejudice than Zombies

This movie could have been great - its a escape movie so I did not take
it too seriously. I liked the casting and the costumes in the movie as
well, very dapper Old English style.I liked the Pride and Prejudice elements - the setting in my opinion
was a bit rushed I did not really understand who was living where and
where the boundaries were - rest of England, the in between and London.
There was a moat built but I was confused as the zombies seemed to be
everywhere anyway? People moved here, there and everywhere so I just
gave up trying to understand where they were meant to be based.So the word play between characters is fantastic - very P&P however the
zombies did not seem to play a part at all - only brief moments of
zombie action. I would have been great to see move, more of the
struggle. Overall an entertain movie and hope for some more zombies in the
future.
