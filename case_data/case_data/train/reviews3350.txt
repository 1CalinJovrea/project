Not all that great!

An interesting storyline that went from elegant to trashy to sickening
to tasteful to distasteful. What kind of people think that exploding
heads is a comedy act? Or for that matter, a mother trying to kill her
little girl!? Finally, ends with the "requisite" piece of ass that
serves absolutely no purpose in the story line and is done in such a
trashy way. Very crass and off-putting. Vaughn and Goldman seem to have
social issues with sick humor. The storyline is fun, clever, whimsical, unexpected, and very 'James
Bond' as intended. It was a delightful--except for the "comic touches"
that ruin it and are distasteful. The actors were very appealing -- and
elegant. It was not Oscar/BAFTA-worthy, but was fun. Except for the
parts that kick you in the gut. And if my review makes you feel like a
yo-yo going upper, downer, upper, downer...that is the way the movie
feels.
