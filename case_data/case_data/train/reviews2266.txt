Abracadabra, you've just lost 115 minutes of your life

Where do I begin. Oh yeah, that I had big hopes for this movie. I'am a
big fan of The Prestige, and somewhat hoped that this would feature the
same depth and substance. But oh boy was I wrong. The magic is lazy. The story is so action driven that you think you're
watching Die hard. As such the cliché riddled plot is actually not
there at all. Aside from the clichés of course. And if that wasn't bad
enough, the twist is just pathetic. After watching this movie I guess you feel the same way as when a magic
trick has been reviled. Disappointed, ashamed, repulsed and the feeling of blatantly being
deceived. Can I get my money back please?
