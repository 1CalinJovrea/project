A visually opulent triumph of film-making!

Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner'
novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the
late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a
life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from
the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity
in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters
and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a
tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human
struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what
separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a
beast'? But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines
, instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you
are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of
pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on
weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience
something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular
thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of
human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing
your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as
adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of
the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with
difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However
there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio
and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is
perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes,
richly textured orange Â–white striped skin and every hair on its fur
look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous
roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can
get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too.
The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the
crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts
the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might
have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter
that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these
might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical
undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large
PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only
for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have
just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human
nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!
