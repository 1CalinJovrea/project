Crazy

There is no other way that I could describe this film. It is filled
with some of the most crazy and strange scenes that I have seen in
film. There was weird sex, masturbating, murder, drugs. Pretty much
everything offensive that you could think of is in this film. It made me laugh, cringe and frown at some of the ridiculous stuff that
happened in it.Deep in the storyline though, was an utterly captivating, yet tragic
story of a man loosing his mind to drugs, mental illness and grief. In
many ways it was this that made the film all the more shocking, but
brilliant at the same time. I came out of the theatre speechless, I had no idea what to make of it
or think. Now I have thought about it, I can see how good it really
was. James McAvoy gave a perfect performance in the lead role. Everything
about the character that he portrayed was realistic, and I could feel
the emotion coming out of him throughout his descent into madness.This film is not for the faint of heart or easily disturbed, but if you
can deal with the weird and wacky, then you are going to love it.
