Robots will take over the world

This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science
fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to
progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we
have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do
we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once
that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We
will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life
partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be
futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All
actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed
at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a
second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.
