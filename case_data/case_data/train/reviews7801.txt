THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEMgolem217.jpgBARELY RIPPEDWhile many will revel in the gloriously lush presentation, "The
Limehouse Golem" plays too much as a clever theatre piece, rather than
a peek behind your hands thriller. This would-be serial killer horror
film, suffers from endless self-inflicted stylish blows: it is
costumed, staged and acted to death. But what a beautiful demise it is.Leave it to Juan Carlos Medina (directing) and the Brits (acting) to
bring forth such a grandiose, poetic, cinematic feast. Channeling his
best Hammer era Peter Cushing, Bill Nighy as the anxious yet calmly
methodical Scotland Yard inspector is exceptional, and almost elevates
the film to a level it so deserves. There just isn't enough grit and shock for the series of heinous crimes
to get any juice flowing; even the gory corpses are presented as
carefully arranged, colourful still lifes. Dialogues are poetic and
unspontaneous, simple scenes are meticulously choreographed, sets are
lavished, wardrobe is wildly bombastic. It is a wonderfully lush, over
the top feast for the senses, that lacks proper plot delivery to create
a deserving fog of mystery.There's a nice, rewarding, twisty tale under all that distracting
sheen, though it requires much work from the viewer.
