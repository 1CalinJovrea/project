Realistic, but a bit boring and depressing

Acting, conversation between characters, their stories and events seem
genuine, but the storyline isn't quite good. The main character,
Nadine, seems to be struggling as a child and during adolescence. The story of Nadine and her best friend was presented pretty well.
However, Nadine's brother character, who is very important, doesn't
seem really genuine, it's confusing and not deeply enough explained. On
the other hand, the context of some important events of this movie is
not clear enough. (Don't want to mention which ones, to avoid adding
spoilers.)The film portrays very well the downsides of being a teenager.
Friendships, family, relationships' problems... Dissatisfaction with
misgivings of life. At the end, I must say that the movie was quite boring because most of
the time nothing happens. My general opinion is that "Seventeen" could
have given much stronger message, and that the plot could've been more
interesting with more realistic twists, and the main issue of the film
better resolved.
