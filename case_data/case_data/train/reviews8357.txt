Good Movie To Watch...While Folding Laundry

Riding on the coattails of "The Conjuring" and cashing in on that
horror movie, "Annabelle" succeeds when it comes to making money, but
falls on its face as a horror movie. But I'm getting ahead of
myselflet's start with the story. A man buys a super creepy doll for
his pregnant wife  she collects dolls, even ugly, creepy ones that
would give Charles Manson nightmares  and then they get attacked by
cultists. A female cultist named Annabelle is killed by the police, and
her body is found cradling the creepy doll. Does the couple move out?
Nope. Do they get rid of the doll that was cradled by the serial killer
woman during her final moments? Nope. Do creepy, evil things start to
happen soon after that? Yup! The clueless couple eventually accept that they are being haunted, and
after befriending a woman (played by Alfre Woodard) who has some
experience with the supernatural, they figure out what is haunting
them, and why. How to stop the powerful, malevolent forcewell, that's
not so easy.My most memorable, movie moment of "Annabelle" is the scene when
Annabelle levitates, and the evil force that is making her rise is
shown."Annabelle" is told with a leisurely pace  many would call it boring
and slow, but I didn't mind it too much because it revealed much of the
mindset of the female half of the couple, and that mindset is crucial
to the finale. What I did have a problem with is that the scares were
too few and far between; and the Woodard character did something at the
end which I found to be out of character. Although there was a scene in
the second act that was supposed to set up what Woodard did at the end,
it still made no sense after I analyzed Woodard's words and actions. It
just completely took me out of the movie and my mind was screaming
"Shenanigans!" Mannysmemorablemoviemoments
