Highly Recommended:  Wild Tales

Wild Tales is the best film I have seen in a long time. The script is
so clever and unique that is a must see for movies lovers. What is the
border between tolerance and barbarism? We can all loose control in
just one second even in the most ordinary situations. Action lovers
will enjoy the ride more than romantic audiences since revenge is at
the center of this master piece. In my opinion, this is the best
Argentine Film in decades and a box office record in Latin America and
Spain. Even Almodovar brothers are the producers the film has a unique
style that is not crazy but real. Get ready for a different kind of
movie that will take you out of your seat and even we shouldn't laugh
about it ...well I can guarantee that you will. Clever mixed of comedy
and drama that will make you think again and again and even change
behaviors after you give it a thought. If Wild Tales doesn't get the
Oscar for Best Foreign Film I might wonder who will.
