Super overrated lame movie with a plot you have probably seen a hundred other versions

First of, the whole hype about the "doll" has nothing to do with the
whole plot of the haunted house the family just moved in. Which just
imply the hype about stories based on somewhat real events are just
mere marketing purposes; which work out really well considering the
high rating this movie gets. Hearing all the reviews saying scares that makes them jump off their
seats are just laughable and pathetic at the same time. I was forcing
myself to go through the whole slow and uninteresting plot till the end
hoping to have just a slight goosebumps, only to get cheesy wuss
"finale".There are easily hundreds of other demonic possessions, haunted house
and witchcraft been done before; most of them easily are more
convincing than this piece of crap.My advice is, PASS this crap. It definitely do not worth your 2 hours
of your time, go for other classic or Asian horror instead. The only
jump you get from watching this movie is like jumping off your seat to
head for the exit.
