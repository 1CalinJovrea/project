Hilarious!!...if you're twelve.

How could anyone over 12 possibly find any of this funny? The movie is
planted with way too much sex jokes, drugs and curse words. Believe me,
I'm not against these sort of things when it comes to comedy, but this
movie overdoes it way too much. You know those 11 year olds on Call of
Duty cursing and making adult jokes like crazy in a cringy attempt to
seem older? That's this movie. Instead of actually using real humor,
the writers thought that adults would crack up every time someone
dropped the f-bomb (which, btw, is every sentence). Way too much effort
in making this adult theme, not enough effort in producing good
content. The plot had potential, but it was executed awfully. I don't
normally rate things so low, but this movie is godawful.
