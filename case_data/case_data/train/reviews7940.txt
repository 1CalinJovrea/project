A fresh, original blend of genres that results in a new cult classic!

This film is a great example of what Hollywood is sorely lacking these
days: Originality! Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is slow
burning western/horror flick that keeps building the suspense until the
finale. It's not an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is loaded with
action, but it has enough to keep your interest. It has more of a
typical western feel to it in terms of character development. The
dialogue is spot on for this genre. The acting is superb and plot is
genuine. I think that it speaks volumes about the script given the fact
that the actors signed on for minimum pay (that means they WANTED to be
in this film for the script and plot). The gore is definitely there for
the horror fans, although I would say that if you are seeking a lot of
gore, you may be disappointed. It does have some that is pretty
graphic. I definitely would not let children or even some teenagers
watch this, its an adult movie. If you are a fan of westerns, I think
you'll like it a lot. If you are a Kurt Russell fan, you will not be
disappointed (this was his first western since Tombstone). Patrick
Wilson and Matthew Fox make an excellent supporting cast and
demonstrate their acting skills well. This is a new cult classic!
