Life as it is

Realistic performance of Reese Witherspoon. An history about the life
as it is. A movie to watch and review in your mind later. I like drama
movies that you suffer as you are watching but give you things to think
later, this is this type of movie. Wild is a one-character movie but
the little pieces of the secondary characters are so well introduced
that allows to introduce drama, fear, suspense and romanticism to the
history. If I need to say something wrong about the movie is that in
some passages there is lack of continuity and feels as if the movie was
longer at the beginning and the director need to cut it to do it
shorter.
