"Francis Ha" Is Nothing To Laugh About

Baumbach is the Bed, Bath, and Beyond of indie, his newest film
resembling the tacky ten dollar pre-framed black and white photos of
vague French "bohemian" cityscapes that you buy and hang in a dirty
insurance office's bathroom to distract you from the smell and the
crack in the wall. Films whose "bitter, angry characters" are
stick-figure caricatures embodied by actors neither complex or talented
enough to make their character's bitterness or anger anything deeper
than a mere external affectation, directed by a clever hipster con
artist hiding the heart of his arch conservatism.Anyone who would hire Ben Stiller ("Greenberg") to play an embittered
intellectual railing against the corporate mediocrity of modern life
should be, at the very least, highly suspect. Gerwig now stands as the
latest media-manufactured "it" girl, an unthreatening and perfectly
insipid creature made-to-order for a dead and non-existent
counterculture.Still, Baumbach and his muse are very necessary these days to convince
an already euthanized and brainwashed Generation ZZZ that their
spiritual, moral, and political malaise is a livable, "charming" and
tolerable one, so that they can really, really forgive themselves for
not roaring back like a million untamed lions against the
state-sponsored execution of their hearts, minds, and souls as previous
generations once did, for better or worse. In that sense, Baumbach may
become the most cherished of contemporary cinematic frauds, a
directorial eunuch as safe and as impotent as the audiences who flock
to the flattery of his films rather than by those individuals
perceptive enough to be thoroughly repulsed by them.And put aside those desperate comparisons to the French New Wave, or
70's Woody Allen. What you're seeing on screen is the rotting carcass
of a nation's exhausted cinema .... pointless, empty triviality
posturing as wry social observation, spewed from the wealthy pockets of
a talentless hack with too many inside connections and Taschen art
books piled up onto his conspicuously displayed Eames chair.
