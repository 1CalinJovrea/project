Fantastic animated love story.

Produced by Guillermo del Toro and directed by Jorge R. Gutierrez, THE
BOOK OF LIFE is a flashy animated tale that blends a Romeo-and-Juliet
style story, but actually a romance triangle using Mexican customs
surrounding the Day of the Dead as a backdrop. The color is splashy and
the story line is simple and serves as a charming homage to Mexican
culture.The story involves three childhood friends; Manolo(Diego Luna),
Maria(Zoe Saldana) and Joaquin(Channing Tatum); whose romantic twisted
triangle becomes the subject of a wager between two Mexican
deities...La Muerte(Kate del Castillo), the overseer of the Land of the
Remembered and Xibalba(Ron Perlman), the lord of the Land of the
Forgotten. Manolo comes from a heritage of bullfighters and is
disappointing his father by wanting to be a singer, and declines to
ever slay a bull in the ring. Joaquin is a pompous protector of the
town trying to live in the shadow of his father, a fallen military
hero. Maria is a beautiful young woman that desires a husband, but is
sent off to a convent for grooming.The Book of Life is narrated by a lovely tour guide(Christina
Applegate)as she relates the story to a bus load of students visiting a
museum. The color is visually stunning and the characters are actually
handcrafted wooden-like. There is a nice mix of peppy and romantic
music holding the action together. The better of the songs are sung by
the Manolo character voiced by Luna: "The Creep", "I Love You Too
Much", "The Apology Song" and the Elvis classic, "I Can't Help Falling
In Love".Other voices in this family feature: Cheech Marin, Ice Cube, Hector
Elizonda, Danny Trejo, Placido Domingo, Eugenio Derbez and Dan Navarro.
