vacation to hell (for the viewer)

If I can give you any advice today dear reader it's please PLEASE don't
even bother wasting your money on this actual poop garbage. I would
rather stick knitting needles in my eyes than sit through it again.
Granted, I will admit, that Charlie Day made me laugh- but that can be
chalked up to how much I love that man. The rest of the movie? No. Dear
God, just No. I still wake up in a cold sweat, plagued by nightmares of
this movie. Ed Helms and his weird kind of gaunt face, he won't stop
singing kiss from a rose. It never ends. But hey, if you're a fan of
trans-phobia, heteronormativityx9000, lines which have no comedic value
other than F*CK being yelled at the end of them, sex jokes that don't
even make sense (seriously the movie seems like it was written by a
bunch of 12 year old boys),just generally awful scripting hidden behind
big actors, or you have less than 3 braincells, then this sure is the
movie for you, friend!In summary I could eat a notebook and crap out a better script. Don't
fund a sequel.
