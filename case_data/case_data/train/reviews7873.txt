Statham, the only reason

Trailer looked exciting. I like Mccarthy but I like Statham more. He
made the movie worth watching. There are instances where you can loose
your instances but McCarthy and Statham's comedy chops will keep you
going, just bear with some of the clich√©s. There are ups and downs. The
"twist" I'm sure people saw it coming but was funny none the less
