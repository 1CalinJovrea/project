People, please stop saying it's a Marvel movie! It's NOT

Just because it's based on Marvel comics doesn't mean it's made by
Marvel Studios. It's made by FOX, which licensed the rights to the FF
characters from Marvel years ago. Thus, any comparisons to other MCU
films such as the recent Ant-Man are totally meaningless. And that is
why it's such a mess. Marvel had no control over what FOX did with
their source material.For those not aware, this film was plagued by problems from the start.
The director was all but banned from the set and editing room in the
final stage of production, after which a good deal of the footage was
dumped and re-shot. In the end, it was slapped together by one of the
producers and a temporary director, and the results show: there is a
disconnect between the first two acts and the third. It's almost like
there are two separate movies trying to co-exist, and it doesn't work.
