Enjoy it for what it is!

If you have discerning tastes, don't see this movie. If you need
escapism from the daily grind and are not in the mood to over-think
anything, this is a good movie for you. It's true; it is crude, much
cruder than the original. Most comedies today are just that. The people responsible for this movie were not thinking lets win an
Oscar, they were thinking lets make people laugh. According to the
theater I was in, it worked. We were all laughing. I wish it had been
longer with more situations, but I enjoyed what I saw. I recommend not taking your teen to see it. Let them wait till they're
17, not because they are too young, but as a mom it was really awkward. I will say this about Chevy Chase, he will always be Clark, but keep in
mind people age and put on weight. I say so what! The man is funny as
hell! This movie will not hold up to the original, don't see it without
seeing the original; you won't get the jokes.
