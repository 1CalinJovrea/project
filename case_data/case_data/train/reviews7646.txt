The 80's Heroes Epic Escape

Bring the good old days back! Everyone agrees that Stallone and
Schwarzenegger are the top kick-ass icon during 80's. They may age and
become slower than their younger selves but they still kick-ass.Well, I missed the first minutes of the movie. Yeah, I was
embarrassingly late :( I came in the cinema when the title "Escape
Plan" came up on the screen. So what is it? Five minutes late, maybe?
But with the flashback, I know what happened in the part I missed.
Stallone's character, Ray Breslin is a Houdini, but in this case, he is
talented in finding his way out of prison. No, he is not a criminal.
Just to test the prison's quality in the security aspect.Then the plot moved to a lawyer from CIA (Yeah, Langley..) who asked
Breslin to test a prison prototype's security. He agreed and nothing is
wrong until Breslin realized that his evacuation code did not make any
sense. Like he is being put into prison for real. Then as usual, prison
fight, a stranger, Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) suddenly became a
best friend, then planning to escape from that prison. And, of course,
they finally escaped from that prison.The theme is not new. We all know there are lots of movies and TV
series like this, like Prison Break and Escape from Alcatraz. But this
movie is executed perfectly and I really enjoy this movie. A bit boring
the first twenty minutes but the rest of the movie did entertain me.Action is a must. Blood, fight, guns, and most;y anything available in
nearest location. And some gags, humors, everything hilarious add more
excitement to this movie. The detail of the prison is amazing. This
movie is like a "Escaping Prison 101". Using available stuff and human
resources to escape from a prison.This movie is highly recommended. Stallone and Schwarzenegger still
kick-ass and also can be funny at the same time. I am sure you will not
be disappointed.
