Absolutely awful

Well there's an hour or two Ill never get back...What is there to like in this film ?Plot ? Ridiculous "romantic" comedy, with a really weak bad guy subplot
only added to give the film a way of ending.Characters are all unlikeable and spent most of the film thinking
Reese's character was a complete slapper and they should be fighting to
get away from her, not be with her.I really don't see the purpose of the film, it wasn't a feel good rom
com, wasn't a thriller or exciting enough for an action film, wasn't
funny in anyway. Avoid...
