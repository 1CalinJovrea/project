Wow......

How often do I get to say "wow" when I see a movie? Let me tell you,
rarely......What Happened to Monday is really quite brilliant. It takes the serious
real world issue of overpopulation and pits it against the intrinsic
human imperative to protect its offspring. The inevitable collision that takes place when the need to see the
species thrive at the expense of the individual, is the starting point
of this film. What happens in between is a cleverly crafted mix of sci fi, masterful
storytelling, well executed action with a emotional component that's
genuinely touching. Noomi Rapace of "Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" fame hands in yet another
show stopping performance, nimbly and ably playing multiple characters,
seemingly with ease. That's not to dismiss the performance of other
cast members. This is a collectively polished affair. This is, for me, a "must see" and possibly even "see again" sci fi. Ten
out of ten from me.
