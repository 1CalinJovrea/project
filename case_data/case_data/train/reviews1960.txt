entertaining ?

Although Hathaway and Sudeikis both did a tremendous job on their
characters. None of their characters were likable. Some disturbed
people shouting and hitting and getting back to each other, all being
some kind of addict. Not likable at all. İ watched this film for high
critics it got. But really surprised how boring this was. This is not a monster movie Not a comedy Nothing remarkable happens at all, and has BİG unexplained gaps, i
thought the writer was not sober when typing.if you are a fan of Sudeikis and Hathaway, their mimics and talking
voices, u may wanna check it out, other then don't bother to watch and
definitely wait for the Bluray don't go to a big screen want a monster movie ? watch Skull İsland instead
