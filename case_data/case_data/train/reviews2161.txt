Much better in many ways!

6 of my colleagues and I watched this together and we all have the same
conclusion that the movie is much better than those bad critics out
there.That conclusion was easy despite we purposely watched both anime movies
and I personally looked at the manga.In terms of technology context, this movie is able to present the
futuristic image of living in the hologram world. The details like the
road, lighting, billboards, buildings, cars are well done. Yes, the
boiling kettle and apartment setting are out of time but it's kind of
proof that there are real humans alive.I like the part where the movie tells us how Datou got that weird pair
of eye. I like the part where Dr. Ouelet sacrifices herself to free
Mira to redeem her mistakes and ultimately lead to her possible mother.
I like the fact that the enemy here is Kuze instead of The Puppet
Master in the anime), and they did not end up merging together.Most of all, I like the way Scarlet portray Mira in a more humanistic
way. Having watched her in Lucy or as Black Widow, I couldn't think of
another bad ass woman to play this role!
