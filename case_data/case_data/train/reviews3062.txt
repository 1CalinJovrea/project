Step up Dad

This is actually pretty funny. It's not the most sophisticated comedy,
but you should know that even before watching this. Mark Wahlberg
showing off his perks ... I mean comedic talents again. Also his
muscles yes (for those who care). There are quite a few jokes that go
below the belt (even literally), but it's all kept pretty light, if you
don't mind that direction in general.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have lots of fun, playing off each other
and being "enemies". The ending kind of could be seen as a "things to
come" kind of thing, which might ring true, with Part 2 already
announced (though the movie as I know did not make that much business
in Germany at least). Still you get what the box/cover promises after
all, so why complain?
