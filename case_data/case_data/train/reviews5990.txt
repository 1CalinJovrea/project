Wonderful comedy that summarizes the nature of the human life

*Possible Spoilers!*This movie will be emotionally rejected by highly
religious people without a thought. Although the language can be quite
shocking, the movie reveals the real nature of humanity and survival
instincts. I like this movie because it was a different and brave show
of cultural references like Freudian psychology, racism, antisemitism,
the new look at modern science, and has connections to Stephen Hawking,
and even critiques the distant spirituality in our consumerist society.
The movie gives us a twisted view of the question "What if you can be
consumed". With small pop culture influences and a great finale in
reference to the world-recognized book by German author Patrick
SÃ¼skind, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, this movie turns out to be a
great message to people who are real literates. The higher rating users
give to this movie, the larger and more diverse is their library.
