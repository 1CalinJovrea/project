Being a huge fan of Hardy's, I enjoyed the film immensely!

'LEGEND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tom Hardy plays dual roles, in this British crime thriller, as the Kray
twins. Hardy plays Reggie and Ronald Kray; British gangster twins, that
terrorized London in the 1960s. The film was written and directed by
Brian Helgeland (who also performed both duties on movies like
'PAYBACK', '42' and 'A KNIGHT'S TALE'); it's based on the 1972 novel
'The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins', by
John Pearson. The movie also costars Emily Browning, David Thewlis,
Christopher Eccleston and Chazz Palminteri. Being a huge fan of
Hardy's, I enjoyed the film immensely!The story begins in late 1950s London. It's told from the point of view
of Frances Shea (Browning); who was the girlfriend, and later wife, of
mobster Reggie Kray (Hardy). The film details Reggie and Ronald's
brutally violent rise to criminal fame; as Reggie constantly tried to
keep his mentally ill brother in line. It also focuses on the romantic
relationship between Reggie and Frances. Tom Hardy is my favorite (current) actor, and he definitely doesn't
disappoint here. If you're a fan of his, seeing him play such
distinctly different (and very memorable) characters, is wildly
entertaining. The movie, as a whole, is a pretty well made gangster
flick as well; I've liked Helgeland's other films (especially
'PAYBACK'), and I think he does a more than adequate job helming this
one. The movie is definitely worth seeing!watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
