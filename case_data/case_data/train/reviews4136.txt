who are those 300000 people that liked this HORRIBLE movie? what is your problem??

I've never seen so bad movie since "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of
the Crystal Skull".... HOW?HOW can this movie has a rating above 8??
From the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess!
Childish plot, childish characters and awful, AWFUL humor ALL the times
!! Even in the "serious" and "important" scenes there's always a stupid
joke to ruin the moment(which is already ruined but anyway..).
countless clich√©s and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain
cells! The CGI where just OK and the fight scenes were at best
indifferent..there were also some slo-mo scenes with nothing really to
offer,i mean it's like a guy jumping in slow motion...seriously!nothing
cool about it nothing new!Nothing about this movie is new or original!
I have nothing else to say for this "movie"..stay away!
