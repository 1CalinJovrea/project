Nice

I saw this at the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival, more
or less by chance. I went to the theater to attend a reading of George
R.R. Martin (which was great), and this movie started just shortly
afterward. I was surprised and pleased to see that the leading actress
was one of the actresses of Game of Thrones, where she played Ygritte
the wildling. In Honeymoon she could show a more mellow side.I am not quite sure why I liked this film so much. It is rather slow,
normally I get bored easily. One point was probably the realism of the
thing (before the horror starts I mean). This thanks to the excellent
acting and good dialogue. And also the good use of the surroundings.
Another point is that the story line is more or less original and does
not follow one of the numerous stereotypes in horror film making.Its horror is more psychological, gorehounds will probably be bored.The negative: Making a good ending for a movie is one of the hardest
things. And I must say, that I did not find it all too satisfying in
this case.But apart from that I would really recommend this movie.
