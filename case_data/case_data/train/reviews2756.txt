Daniel DL + Spielberg = reach perfection !

This is my first review of a film. I had to do this, because of the
effect it had on me. I went to see a screening of "Lincoln" last week,
and i was wondering if Spielberg could have done it again, like he did
years ago with "Schindler's List", for example. And he did it, that's
for sure. That's not "Schindler's List" or "Saving Private Ryan", not
even close, but this film captures wonderfully the way the director
looks at that piece of history, and though it's probably not the more
realistic film ever made about Lincoln (and i don't know if there will
ever be one really realistic..), the movie offers tremendous
performances (DDL will certainly be honored), a tremendous production
design and, not less important,a great score by John Williams, once
again! So,basically, i was, still, very surprised by the way Spielberg
did it, because it shows a very intimate portrait of Lincoln's
personality. And i warn you, this is film is for grown ups, not for
teenagers looking for some kind of action war movie about leadership
and honor in civil war. That's Spielberg in a kind of different but
always faith full way, and i hope it earns lot of nominations in the
Oscars this year, and i will not be surprised if Lincoln wins Best
Picture in January.A 10/10, without any doubt ! :)
