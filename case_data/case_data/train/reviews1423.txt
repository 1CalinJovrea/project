I feel betrayed... And for the first time in my life i want my money back...

Soooo. As many others said the ending...SPOILERS: Half through the movie i said to my girlfriend that this
probably is the best out of the three movies. I really liked it for a
long time. Now i hope word to mouth will result in bad viewer numbers.The best part in the book was the controversial ending. It was thought
provoking and refreshingly not the typical happy end. For the whole
time of the book zobrist is the bad guy and then in the end you are not
so sure because he didn't kill but found an extreme solution. It was a
beautiful ending. And they just threw it out the window and changed it
to a boring, stereotypical Hollywood endig. WTF??? I was never so
disappointed in a movie theater before. They took an easy, safe and
horrible path just so people aren't offended...Don't watch it! Don't pay for it! Don' support decisions like this! Pay
them a lesson in reviews and with not paying money for this.I feel betrayed and i will write a letter to sony and co.
