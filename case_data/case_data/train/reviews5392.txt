Hope God Forgives Director,Cast & Writers

There are only 2 reasons I watched this film until the end. To see if
the ending was as bad as the rest of the movie (it's worse, if
possible) and to review the whole movie fairly.Wooden acting, lousy script writing. Predictable and tired plot. No
suspense.Ryan Gosling runs a fight club which is really a front for drug
operation. Possible spoilers: His brother gets killed, Ryan does not
avenge the death and mommy flies in from the states to set things
right. Only she doesn't. It gets worse and worse and finally it ends.Nothing redeeming about this one.
