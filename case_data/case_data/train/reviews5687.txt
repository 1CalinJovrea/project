Let's Not Get Carried Away Here..

Okay, so I am very confused here as to how this film is so highly
rated.The animation itself and the sound design and music etc, is very well
done. But considering its predecessors ('Illumination Entertainment')
are Despicable Me & Minions, we have come to expect this high level of
professionalism.The film as a whole was underwhelming and felt very flat. Twenty
minutes into the film and the story was already very much underway and
much of the 'laughs' - sorry, ALL of the 'laughs' - I had already
witnessed from the countless trailers and adverts I have been subjected
too since they were released about five months ago. Hence, by the time
the film was finally released (Jan. 27th - UK & Ireland) the jokes were
neither funny nor interesting and I was very bored.Moreover, the cinema packed with children and their tired parents let
out VERY few laughs for the jokes and throughout the film, it was
relatively silent from the audience. I could almost hear the children
shuffling in their seats, eight rows behind me.The characters offered nothing new and it was a happy ending for all.
Which confused me even more seeing as the obnoxious mouse got away
Scott-free with his slutty mouse friend in his snazzy red sports car,
paid for by the money he stole from the bears by cheating at poker.WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT FOR CHILDREN?!I have no idea. I have NO idea.Bottom line, the film suffered from being over-hyped, bringing us
nothing new and a theme that was very confusing. The songs used were
performed well and I appreciated the concept of the animated-take on
today's singing competitions. But let's not get carried away here, the film is just about average.
