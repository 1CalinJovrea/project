For the music lovers.

3 1/2 out of 4 stars.John Carney is back with a new musical. His 2006 film "Once" is one of
my favorite films of all time and I was interested to see where Carney
would go next. Watching the trailers for "Begin Again" didn't give me
much hope for it, but just enough for me to go out and see it. I
enjoyed it much more than I expected though."Begin Again" is very similar to "Once," except Carney has a bigger
budget and famous movie stars. It deals with Dan and Greta (Mark
Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, respectively) who after being cheated on
by their former boyfriend/girlfriend meet up and record some songs
together. Ruffalo is great as the down on his luck, charming, but often
drunk, music producer Dan. Knightley also has a solid performance. Adam
Levine does a good job of being a jerk and James Corden is hilarious as
Greta's busking friend Steve. The films has themes of love, fatherhood,
and the way we use music in our lives."Begin Again" is for all the music lovers out there who enjoy creating
music. The movie is filled with characters whose religion is music.
Look at Dan's car and how he has a music cable hung up on the mirror
next to a cross. There's a great moment when Dan listens to Greta
perform for the first time. What is just a voice and guitar slowly
grows into something much bigger and beautiful. The soundtrack is more
poppy compared to the folk songs in "Once," but they are nice to listen
to.This film is the movie you kind of have to be in the mood for to really
enjoy. It can be predictable and sappy at times, but it does it well.
If you accept it for what it is, you'll enjoy it. "Begin Again" is a
musical treat this summer that will leave you wanting to listen to more
music and maybe even creating some of your own.
