Boring, Plot-free Movie Romanticizes Pedophilia

Going in, I thought this would be a revenge movie or something. I kept
waiting for the twist, for the "something", but it never came. The
dialogue is maudlin yet tedious, the characters act nothing like real
people would behave in that situation. Character development or plot
arcs nowhere in sight.Instead the movie plods along, slowly and nauseatingly recounting the
sordid yet mundane history of the relationship of the main characters.
Nostalgic, sentimentalized shots of pedo and little girl at the park as
the wind blows through the grass, pedo and the little girl at the
amusement park on the ferris wheel, pedo and little girl in the
bedroom, a wistful shot of their fingers intertwined. Nothing graphic,
but still, it's totally absurd. How did this movie even get greenlit?
