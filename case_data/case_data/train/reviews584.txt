Great SciFi Movie

First of all, this movie is visually stunning, even though most of the
scenes are CGI, its still look realistic, its gorgeousand then the design, from the buildings to the spaceships, to the
wardrobe and makeup, it all looks wonderful and colorfullfor me, as a non-reader of the book/comics this movie is like a
combination of Star Wars and Avatar the storytelling for me was a bit
uneven but the storyline was goodfor me Cara Delevingne as Laureline was better and perfectly cast than
Dane Dehaan as The Valerianthats all i could say, i don't know too much about this movie, but what
i know and all i could say is this movie is amazing, its visually
stunning movie, the story was good, the characters were amazingDefinitely recommended for Scifi lovers
