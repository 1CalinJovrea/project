A Job Partially Well Done

Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsThough it'll undoubtedly have a more profound effect on those with a
deeper knowledge of Apple's history or who share a fervent relationship
with every product the company launches, "Steve Jobs" is nonetheless an
affecting piece of cinema that boldly chooses a stark portrayal of the
tech giant's late CEO without ever veering into the degradation or
canonization of its eponymous subject. Set backstage at three iconic
product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac,
"Steve Jobs" takes us behind the scenes of Apple's digital revolution
to paint an intimate portrait of its cofounder.Aaron Sorkin's screenplay and Danny Boyle's Direction offers a Steve
Jobs profile that doesn't idolize or criticize him, providing us
valuable insight to the man's life and other important individuals who
impacted it. But that insight feels incomplete and unrefined at various
points in the film, because Sorkin's (usually impeccable) writing keeps
treading into theatrical, garrulous, and, dare I say, even
self-indulgent territory to metamorphose into a truly involving
experience.Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet create all the drama, intensity,
conflict, and dynamism required to propel Aaron Sorkin's minimalist
screenplay into grander terrain, but the film is simultaneously
inspiring and frustrating, much like the individual it's based on. In
particular, Fassbender's performance is a striking accomplishment of
restraint merged seamlessly with command, as he portrays Jobs as a
charming, amiable, and engrossing person in one scene, and a
conflicted, revolting, contemptuous monster in the next. With due
respect to all the other Oscar nominees this year, Fassbender deserves
adulation for getting through stanzas of intricate, chatty dialogue
alone. And, though, the movie never matches the caliber of its leading
man's sublime performance, it's nevertheless, as mentioned earlier,
inspiring and frustrating at the same time. Perhaps, more inspiring
than it is frustrating, and that's still a pretty good thing.
