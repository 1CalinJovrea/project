Wow, and not in a good way...

Never again will I trust the Metascore. Big fan of David Fincher, but
let me tell you this movie was spectacularly bad. The score was ham
handed and clashed with the film itself and I was embarrassed for the
actors at some points that they had to say the ridiculous lines in the
terrible script. I felt every single minute of this 149 minute movie.
At one point my husband turned to me and whispered "this is really bad"
and we started laughing. Then we started rewriting the story and
recasting. For example, Ben Affleck could have played his own twin
sister and it wouldn't have made the movie any more ridiculous. You
might love it. I really, really did not.
