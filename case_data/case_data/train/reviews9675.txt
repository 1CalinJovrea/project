Thoroughly enjoyable movie

This movie was a lot of fun to watch. It is a twist on the zombie genre
unlike anything you have ever seen. There is nothing too offensive or
gory in this - the creators kept it clean and not too scary for a
full-on zombie flick. There are your typical shot to the head to kill
the zombies but those quick scenes are nothing compared to watching 10
minutes of The Walking Dead or the like. I am always concerned because
I have seen so many movies over the years where the creators did not
know how to properly end the story. So many movies are great the first
hour and then end poorly. I thought this had one of the best endings I
have ever seen. Enjoy!
