Great move - A Must see!

Lately, the horror/thriller movies that are currently being released
just lost it's suspenseful touch. Movies like "Shark night" is just an
embarrassment. When I saw the trailer for "Gone" I thought it would
have been the same thing. When I came out of the theater, my mind was
blown away on how well the plot was and how Amanda Seyfried portrayed
her role very well. There were a few poor scenes, and scenes that
weren't really necessary, however the main plot was so intriguing I
completely forgot about the negative parts of the scene. It's not one
of those movies where it takes hours to get good. The plot runs by
quickly, but long enough to keep you wanting more at the edge of your
seat. I would definitely recommend this movie!!!
