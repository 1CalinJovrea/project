Decent Entertainer thanks to Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe & Sexy Sofia Boutella

The Mummy provides good entertainment, at least most of the time. The
effects are expectedly very impressive and the performances are first
rate as well. My favorite performances were from the Mummy actor Sofia
Boutella as the evil Ahmanet and Russell Crowe as Dr. Henry Jekyll.
Sofia is sexy and has very expressive eyes. Russell Crowe brings in the
needed humor to this serious flick. Tom Cruise as the adventurous Nick
impresses in drama, action and fun moments and the pretty Annabelle
Wallis as archaeologist Jenny whom he loves also delivers very well
although her role is comparitively overshadowed by that of Cruise and
Sofia. I like the action scenes and also the humor in this otherwise
dark movie yet the end falters. Cruise's character undergoes a
transformation in the climax which I felt weakened an otherwise good
horror entertainment. One usually connects with the lead character from
start to end of a movie but here, the climax spoilt it for me, not
because of what happens to him but how that was executed. Anyway, this
movie is still watchable despite the flaws but I'd not root for a
sequel unless Sofia Boutella is back to haunt me again :)
