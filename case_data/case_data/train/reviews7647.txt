"Enemy" - Remarkable, Mysterious, Provocative

A previous review by Andrew Ellington has thoughts about "Enemy" that
echo my own. Ellington's incisive observations about "...the struggle
for self-identity..." are, I believe, the key to the power of the film.
I am reminded of "Fight Club," another film which has that same issue
at its center. And, of course, the parallels to Hitchcock's "Vertigo"
resonate as well. There is exceptionally fine work by Jake Gyllenhaal (always an
extraordinary actor in both drama and comedy), Sarah Gadon (her
intensity is remarkable), and director Denis Villeneuve.But the most compelling aspects of the film for me were threefold: the
extraordinary music by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, a spare,
evocative score that deepens the mystery of the narrative; the
hauntingly somber grayish-yellow cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc; and
the exquisitely paced editing by Matthew Hannam. For those viewers who urgently ask for an 'explanation' of the last
scene, I suggest that they are asking the wrong question. A more
appropriate question is "how does the final scene magnify the emotional
and dramatic values we've been experiencing throughout the film?" The
question can only be answered by each individual viewer, or not at all.But for me, the impact of the last scene is not about WHAT Adam/Anthony
sees in the bedroom, but the final shot itself: his REACTION to what he
sees. He doesn't look terrified. Rather, he looks bewildered, baffled,
and puzzled, with even a trace of disappointment and sadness in his
expression. It's a stunning piece of non-verbal communication from
Gyllenhaal.John David Earnest
