It clutched my heart the entire way

This was absolutely amazing... the trailer made it seem like a
stereotypical "boy meets girl, etc." story... but from the beginning to
the end, the movie rotated from a past and present time-line, only
proving in the end that time itself was twisted the entire movie -
giving us viewers an extremely well written and original plot. The
chemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing,
animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautiful
way. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not because
it's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its own
caliber. Studio Ghibli films were a lot more fictional, fantasy, and
imaginative - free formed and had its own flow. Kimi no Na Wa was
cleverly planned out from the first minute to the last, logical,
balanced, yet just as if not more breathtaking.
