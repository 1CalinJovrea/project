A Movie to Make You Hate Movies

Horrible script, flat performances, directionless direction. I sat
through this entire travesty because, well, sometimes you want to know
what all the fuss with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" was about. This movie
has everything: Actors standing in place reciting meaningless, unfunny
dialogue. A camera that occasionally and for no reason repeatedly
encircles the three leads. Every "shock" clich√© that's been in far
better efforts of the last 20 years. In fact, it's not that this is a
movie that will make you hate movies, it very likely will make you hate
life. Highly recommended (to my enemies). Everyone else, skip this one;
you'll be happier on your death bed.
