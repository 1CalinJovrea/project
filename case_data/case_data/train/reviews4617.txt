Ignore the bad reviews, Your will love it !!

I do not usually write reviews but these hating reviews got me into
that :D I don't get all the people complaining about how predictable
this movie was. God damn it if you want some unpredictable ending go
watch "shutter island" or "mulholland drive" or something that SAYS
that it is a freaking THRILLER!!. This movie is a "Romantic Comedy" and
it is just like "Pretty Woman", "10 Things I hate about you" or "say
anything" - The movies we loved, even if they were predictable. The
point is, its not about the ending, its about living in between the
movie; desperately wanting for them to recognize love and chanting for
there friendship and adoring their silly fights and commitments. For all those who just want to enjoy there weekend by watching a
beautiful romantic movie and smile I recommend them to do watch this
and ignore all the hate and bad reviews. Have fun :)
