Only The  Brave is the Movie to be Seen

Opening night, 1055 p.m I went to see the only movie I wanted to see,
Only The Brave, To all who sacrifice their lives, to do what they need
to do, you have greatest gratitude, and thanks, Only the Brave gave
that to me and possible all of us, It's a must see film to all who feel
that kind of thoughts. An Academy performance by all.
