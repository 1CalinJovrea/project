Not all that terrible

Brad Peyton clearly went through a list of disaster clich√©s trying to
do the opposite (car doors locked, all the boat heading to the giant
wave instead of only the main character making the right choice). He
was trying to do something different within the confines of a summer
blockbuster but he still fell into some of the tropes and sometimes
even rips off other disaster films like 2012 and Volcano. The scene
where Carla Gugino flees to the top of a crumbling building is amazing.Despite being 29 years old, Alexandra Daddario pulls off the teenage
girl heading to college pretty well. Plus, we get to see her in a tank
top. Paul Giamatti also sells as Dr Lawrence Hayes and Dwayne Johnson
shows us he's become a pretty decent actor with a great sense of comic
timing. Ioan Gruffodd's character just suddenly changes halfway through a
scene. The Taylor brothers both had annoying voices. The older one
sounded like Hugh Grant. It was also unrealistic for the laser pointer
to reach far enough to attract the Rock's attention.The special effects in this film are spectacular and the cast is
excellent but the storyline is not so great but its one tension packed
scene after another.
