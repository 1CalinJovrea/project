Really bad

The storyline, script and acting in this film are all so terrible.
Allow me to give you an example at one point Rose Byrne's character
exclaims "I can't relax! There's ghosts everywhere..it's like we're
already dead!" her husband responds "No, it's not! This is nothing like
being dead...I know...I have seen it"I feel like this really summarizes just how bad the film is - even
worse than the first one. I do not understand how these films have such
a high rating on here. I love horror films but ended up turning this
off out of boredom and frustration from having to continually turn the
volume up and down when I was deafened by really loud bangs. I feel
like there is going to be a third one and I am almost looking forward
to it just to see how bad it will get.
