Warcraft fans, LOTR fans, Fantasy fans and even non fans, GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! You will love every second of it !

Hello. First of all i have to tell you, i am a Warcraft fan and i had no
expectations from this movie at all. I am NOT a Blizzard fan boy and i
know when they do something poor and when they do something good.If you like the cinematics that they make and if you like LOTR like me
and fantasy, you will absolutely love this movie. I was really scared about this movie being another video game movie
chaos. Not by a landslide.Warcraft is astonishing. The visuals are ground breaking, the acting is
very strong and the emotional involvement between the viewer and the
movie is breath taking. The familiar zones from Warcraft universe are
all and are built exactly how they are suppose to be built, every
Warcraft fan will feel like home and on the brink of shedding tears. I
will watch this movie again in 10 June and gather all my friends that
were not lucky enough to see it yet and go again, maybe twice. I need
more, there has to be more Warcraft movies. Dunca Jones working
alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the
movie. Almost 2 hours of pure awesomeness. 10/10 from me. GO SEE THIS
MOVIE, you will not regret it !
