Gag movie of the year

Oh how I wish I'd seen a trailer that showed the absurd zombie
incarnations. Gag me with a spoon.Now I'm supposed to issue a SPOILER ALERT... although to give away this
plot is laughable it is so formulaic and predictable. The entire
premise of the movie is absurd. Fast paced to nowhere with lots of
movement, little action, noisy and pointless. Gee, the obtuse teenager tries to save his buddies from having their
blood sucked out of them by the mean scientists and from being bitten
by the zombie creatures. And the soldier group -- the right wing so to
speak -- are so rag tag as to be an impossible group to put up any kind
of struggle against the crack troops of WCKD... wicked. (wasn't that
clever!) When searching for the rag tag group, they get stuck in a canyon behind
cars left to barricade their hiding place. Then they get attacked --
are you ready -- with the ubiquitous helicopters that everyone in the
known universe knows WCKD has... except the right appendage (I don't
want to give away their clever name).Just wish this group had gotten lost in the maze.
