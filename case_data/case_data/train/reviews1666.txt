Cringeworthy Childish Humour

For the first time I actually walked out of a film before the end. The humour is infantile, so stupid I was embarrassed for the actors. This film is just beautiful bodies wandering about hoping it makes an
entertaining film. Clear proof you can't make a silk purse, no matter how many beautiful
people you use, out of a rotting, festering, maggot ridden pigs ear
written by talentless chimps. Complete waste of time and money 0.5/10Suspicious of the many 10/10 ratings, given by first time reviewers/new
reviewers. Confirms suspicions Studios try to promote their films with
bogus reviews.
