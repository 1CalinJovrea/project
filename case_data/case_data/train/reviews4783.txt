This is one of the greatest. Bad critics affected by the monitor?

This is a great movie. As a show, as piece of art, as a good story,
good action, and even good plot. I think it is misunderstood(perhaps
too intellectual for most US people?).This world is full of scares such as global warming, pop. explosion,
energy crisis, terrorist attacks, nuclear explosion, etc. It is like
some global endemic and if you do not agree with those scares and no
sympathetic to those gloomy future of us , you are not or not a good
person even. This story has a great value. It is not a corny some fairy tale. It has
all the cinematic components as a good movie, too. Good actors.
