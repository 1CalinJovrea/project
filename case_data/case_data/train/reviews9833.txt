Finding words to explain this piece of crap

I have never written any review but today after watching this movie I
couldn't resist. I like to watch all kind of movies so I'm open minded
when it comes to movies but this one was unbearable. Also, I have never
seen any Twilight movie before. I went to watch this film because I was
forced to. I started to watch and fell asleep after 20 minutes (I was
literally sleeping). I don't understand why people (I mean girls) were
laughing in between as if dialogs were really "humorous"!!! When I
heard the dialogs I felt like anyone without any professional
experience can write such piece of crap. Worst visual effects ever
seen. Worst acting. Really, this movie could have been finished in
15-20 minutes max. Waste of time! I would rather prefer to work 2 hours
extra in the office on Friday evening than watching such crap.
