Why me?

Just back from a near-deserted screen whose tiny number of patrons held
an uncomfortable silence throughout.This is the sort of film that could get cinema banned, it was just
appalling. Unfunny script, 'gross-out' gags that the writers of
American Pie would have turned their noses up at, phoned-in
performances (Cranston apart), wafer-thin plot.All forgivable, I guess, if it were funny, at least in part, but it
certainly didn't work for me.Please spend your hard-earned on seeing something other than this
cinematic excrement - you'll know what I mean when this appears on
Pirate Bay in two months tops.A truly awful film. I didn't have to pay to get in, but still wanted my
money back.
