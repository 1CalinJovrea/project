The Founder!

The story of the "founder" of Mc Donald's and how he made it from a
single shop to the largest leading firm in food industry.Ray Kroc is a desperate salesman trying to sell his product, a
milkshake maker that no one needs. To his surprise, he gets an order
for 6 machines. He cannot believe it and calls them back if it was true
and to add to his surprise, the quantity was raised to 8. He himself
goes to the restaurant to see the elegant and professionalism
maintained by the brothers called Mac & Dick. Their restaurant is
called Mc Donald's. Ray was eager to know their story and the brothers
explains all their trade secrets. Ray couldn't sleep that night and
goes back to the brothers with a new proposal. Here begins the story of
the business tycoon Mc Donald's.The movie is amazing in all the ways. The director was successful in
making the movie very involving and entertaining. Beautiful camera
visuals, color tone and production design add to this retro tone of the
movie. Performance of the actors are highlight of the movie. Rapid
editing makes it a very fast movie with very less or no lagging. This
movie is going to shine at the Oscars for sure.After watching the movie, at-least half of the audience will quit McD
for a few days. The market value of McD will be interesting after the
world wide release of the film.A must watch and highly recommended.#KiduMovie
