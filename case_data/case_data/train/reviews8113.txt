Don't waste your time

If you are a Star Trek fan you may not like it. I loved Star Trek for
the peaceful exploration theme. This film is an action film and if you
want special effects and a never ending battle with a plot so thin that
it is pointless then enjoy. As in it's predecessor the character's
basic personalities are there but thinner somehow. There is no clear
reason for where they end up nor is there any clear direction to how
they get there. The villain's motive is vaguely explained at the end
but I was still confused. There were lots of loose ends. If you are
looking for a traditional Star Trek movie I suggest you pass. Most of
it made very little sense. The federation when finally encountered
appeared helpless and disorganized and of course only Jim Kirk and his
crew could do anything. Big disappointment for me.
