Wanted to like it but didn't. An interesting inconsistent misfire

This review comes from someone who likes Famnily Guy and really enjoyed
TED... but this new one... was... ouch... I went in expecting a few
laughs but there were fewer than even my low expectations predicted.
Other than the script everything is top notch. Actors are great.
Charlize and Liam and Sarah Silverman etc are terrific. It's too bad
they didn't have something better to work with. Liam in fact seems like he's in a different movie. He's 100 percent
serious. That might be Seth's point in making a guy (himself) who is
caught in the middle of a serious horrible deadly world that the west
really was.It looks very good visually. Great score. But very inconsistent. Not
hit and miss. More like hit and miss miss miss groan miss semi-hit
miss. And the joke style kept changing. Silly to sweet to over the top
and serious at times. and some of the jokes were so disgusting I don't
know what they were thinking. (and i like disgusting) Plus the anachronistic style gets tired fast. And Seth as predicted should not have made himself the lead. He's not
awful but would have benefited greatly with a pro. His persona is not
fit for leading man status. And his voice and style is so in step with
Brian's on family guy its a bit distracting. Basically the tone of this film keeps changing. The joke styles keep
changing. it doesn't know what it is. Is is a sweet western romcom? Is
it a satire? Is it a serious comedy? With all the success from Ted I'm guessing Seth had carte blanche with
this one and probably needed someone to question him more. Might be more fun if your stoned. Really really stoned. And/or maybe
just see Blazing Saddles instead.
