7
Pretty solid!

For a scary shark flick I found it totally worked. Of course the intro,
party scene & boys are what you'd expect for this genre, and had me
wondering if I'd make it to the end due to all the clich√©.But it did take off from there nicely, had some genuine holy f*ck
moments, a good pacing and had me wondering all the way if the girls
would make it to the end...The camera work was great and the sharks well done (a bit too
aggressive for total realism, but hey). The ending was also original,
for once!Compared to The Shallows, I'd say it's equally solid in terms of
entertainment value and getting the viewer hooked until the end.Overall a solid 7 in my book.
