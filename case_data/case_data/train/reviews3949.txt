Absolutely god awful

I made it through twenty minutes. It has possibly the worst video
editing that I've ever seen in a film in my life. I didn't even know
what I was watching sometimes during those twenty minutes. They cut
from one meaningless thing to another like it was vital to a story
element when, in fact, it was just a supposedly cool "Suicide Squad"
style sequence. It also had two video montages during those twenty
minutes, which was intolerable, partly because they were done in the
same frantic and headache-inducing manner that the regular cuts were
shot in.There was a battle in which the evil mages that were seizing power were
apparently casting spells from the tops of gigantic elephants, but we
never saw them actually wielding magic. We just saw people being blown
back by explosions. In the meantime, they just showed the mages'
glowing eyes. So when Eric Bana's character beheaded the main mage
(which ALSO wasn't even shown) it makes it all the more meaningless.At one point, in one of the worst examples of foreshadowing (if it can
even be called such) that I've ever seen in a film, someone reminds a
group that Jude Law's character studied with the evil mages. His
response: "What are you implying?" Smash cut to Jude performing an evil
ritual whereby he became the new king. Aaaaaaand someone please kill
me.When it finally got around to Charlie Humman taking over the main rebel
role, I couldn't have cared less. As other people have noted, he is
dead-faced and expressionless. I couldn't have cared less if he
regained his family's power.I'm going to go with two stars just because the tentacled demon
creature with three women that Jude worships was one creepy positive in
this dumpster fire.
