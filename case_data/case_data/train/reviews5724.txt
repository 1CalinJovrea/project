Nothing really new but a good choice of actors, effects and locations

If you have seen conspiracy flicks like "Enemy Of The State", "The
Bourne Identity", "XIII", "Unknown" and so on and so forth, you really
won't be surprised by this movie. The story presents nothing new and is
about the usual stereotypes: the good one turn out to be the bad ones,
the bad ones turn out to be the good ones, the weak ones turn out to be
the strong ones and so one. I think you get what I mean. The movie has
no big surprises after all.But if this kind of movie is well done, it can still merit a rating of
eight points. I only give six point five and for this site seven points
because of the mediocre camera work that was shaking and irritating at
some points of the movie.The rest of the film is quite decent. The locations are interesting and
the movie takes place in Cape Town in South Africa and not in Europe or
North America. The fighting and action scenes are very well done and
with the visual and sound effects in cinema, it's a pleasant
entertainment to watch this movie for sure. It's a good flick to change
your mind, to relax and to take a break from your everyday life for
sure. The acting is also rather good with two strong lead actors that
are a very cool Denzel Washington and a sympathetic and determined Ryan
Reynolds.The only little flaw is that I would have liked to know more about both
characters, especially about their past and what really led them to do
what they actually do in the movie.The movie simply has not the greatest script to stand out among many
other similar flicks but it's still a good film. I would suggest you to
rather watch the movies I talked about in my introduction or classics
like "I As In Icarus" but if you have seen and liked them all, you will
surely appreciate this work, too.
