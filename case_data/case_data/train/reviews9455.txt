A boring way to spend your evening

This is not worth your time. At all. This is bad acting and a terrible
story all in one. If there's a story there at all that is. We spent the
whole movie waiting for something to happen, and PLOT TWIST; NOTHING
DID! This movie is nothing new, it's nothing fresh, and if you honestly
liked this and thought that it was worth a rate of 2 or higher, you
must be a newbie to the horror genre. I know the genre originally is
meant to scare you based on the 'something and nothing' you cant see or
know, but this is just stupid. Not once was I surprised, not once was I
scared and not once was I thrilled by this film. It's a loose story
with no beginnings or ends. Please, find something else to watch.
