remarkably stupid - wasted potential.

It's a shame that this movie was so dumb. Had the script been written
by an adult, this could've been a blockbuster.The aliens are so dumb that it's implausible. How can any species
achieve space travel yet lose to inferior human adversaries.Decent cast, excellent effects, serviceable directing, and a big budget
all squandered on a horrifically bad script. It's so bad it hurts my
head.I'm extremely surprised any executive would green light such
inexcusably poor writing. Hmm...maybe it was the executive's child who
wrote it. That would explain many Hollywood films actually.
