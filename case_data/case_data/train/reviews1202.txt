Body Language

I am a student and admirer of the works Antoine Artaud and am very
pleased to see a movie breathing the spirit of my second favorite
insane Frenchman. This movie is aimed at the idiots who think they have
to bear children. The body fluids and bleeding assholes are metaphors
for what happens in the minds of children of infantile parents. I'm not
big on symbolism in movies, but this thing a Bosch puzzle, it just goes
on an on.. Four guys jerking off in a pizza, I think it's brilliant,
think about it, what do these parents feed their kids spiritually? Crap
topped with crap. It is no wonder says she has had herself sterilized
because she doesn't want any kids. The sad and also - in a perverted
way - beauty of the end is that, life repeats itself. The asshole
represents the circle of life. This is what Fassbinder would make if he
would be alive. Have you paid attention to the face lines of this
woman? It's very similar to Fassbinder's heroins. Life is good in
Germany, you can tell by movies like this. No freedom for an honest
movie here in the US.
