I just don't have the patience for bad movies anymore

I gave this Star Trek movie a 1 because I just don't have the patience
for this kind of bad storytelling anymore, especially because I liked
the first movie so much. I would rather watch any episode of Star Trek
series than this, any day. Damn, I don't even know where to start. There's no moral to this story.
The reason why Star Trek is different from XXX movie is that it always
has a deeper moral to explore, I didn't find any in this movie.The characters are messed up. The thing that bothers me the most is
Spock. I had no problem with Spock shedding a tear in the last sequel,
but in this movie he's really off the rails, he's sobbing,
laughing...emoting all over the place. If they really wanted to pay
homage to Leonard Nemoy's performance maybe they should've payed more
attention to his acting not mentioning his name all over the place.
Kirk was really bad in this movie, I understand that he's depressed but
he was just boringly bland. Sulu being gay is obviously another
positive discrimination Hollywood rule. All the CGI and stupid and illogical plot lines and scenes made me cry.
The scene where Kirk and Lt. Chekov slide down from the saucer can only
be surpassed in stupidity by the scene from Prometheus where they run
straight from the doughnut ship instead of turning left/right. The
number of those little bee ships grows exponentially in the final
scene?! Playing rock music is a total rip off from Guardians of Galaxy.
Why did the ships start exploding when they played the music??? I
thought they were just suppose to collide with one another?! Anyway
bullshit after bullshit with no effect.The only bright thing was the humor, that really made me watch the
whole thing.
