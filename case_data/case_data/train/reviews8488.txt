Clown

Despite being the source of many childhood fears, there's a surprising
dearth of solid killer-clown movies (I can think of "It" and
"Clownhouse," and that's about it). I was curious to see what a modern
horror movie would do with the concept and came away satisfied with
this little shocker, which uses the clown concept sparingly throughout
and thankfully keeps clown-related humor to a minimum. Instead it
concentrates on developing its central characters more than is usually
expected in these films, as well as exploring the origin of clowning
and how it pertains back to the film's story. There's a lot of
exposition needed to further the plot but the filmmakers never lose
track that the audience would rather be shown something instead of
being told, so the film manages to establish and sustain a sense of
dread and inevitability throughout. A surprisingly solid slasher that
could easily become a franchise.
