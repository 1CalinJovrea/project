Very Enjoyable

We watched so many spy and assassin movies and Hit-man Agent 47 is one
of our top hit movies. The opening scene is more amazing than Spectre
and more gripping. Although there were a few moments where you wish
there was more substance or emotions, the continuity and the style
seems to make it worthwhile ignoring. The choice of scenery is
impressive and so are the action scenes. The Singapore scenes are truly
unique as it have not been seen before by many living in the USA or
Europe. Car chases are incredible. Hannah Ware and Rupert Friend seems
to be a good pair. But I can't say the same about Zach Quinto. Overall,
it does reminds me of Blade Runner with a more gripping tension. The
music is excellent too with some never heard beats before. For this
movie budget, Hit-man Agent 47 is amazingly up there with Spectre whose
budget is nearly 4 times more!
