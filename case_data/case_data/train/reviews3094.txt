Disappointed hugely ..movie has no connection no feeling to previous films.. Awful

Spoilers alert ... Take away the absurd car scenes and amateur hacking,
all you're left with is dull and as i said before amateur acting. No
one seems to be involved in their character. Subplots which have no
intersection with the main plot exists for a lot of the time..The story
is senseless as in different plots don't come together. The guy playing
CIA director sucked. No energy, old, dull as hell. The Technology, the
Op center and support guys who looked so cool in ultimatum is
amateurish, like out of a toy shop. There are some really stupid scenes
Bourne walks through the airport with a ordinary passport with his
actual name and is not flagged. Nicky is a nervous mess. The CIA which
was so central to the previous movies, is like a cartoonish agency with
people running it delivering bland lines. Where is the intrigue, the
frenzy, the tightness of the CIA from Ultimatum ?? The asset is again a
disappointment. 100% of the story is predictable from the start. This
is a crushing of fans expectations, not a Jason bourne movie more like
a watered down transporter movie. Hell legacy was a 100 times better
than this. Sorely disappointed.
