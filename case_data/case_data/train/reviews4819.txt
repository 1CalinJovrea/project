It went too fast, way fast. Probably wont be a sequel

I'm a hardcore fan of this book, and when I watch the movie I was like
seriously?, all those scenes were too fast. and honestly, Mark Waters
is my favorite director, I love Mean Girls, and freaky Friday, and
stuff. But this isn't even in the same level with mean girls. And the
jokes were awful, this isn't even a comedy, this isn't even an action,
and this isn't even a romance. they just failed it. If they keep making
VA like this, the sequel will be just as plain as this one. I'm sorry
saying this, I know our perspectives are different, but this is
definitely one of the bad movies of the year, if you don't see that,
then you don't watch enough movies in your whole life. I'm 110% a fan
of the book, but the movie... is just disappointing. But like the
ending cause it's the only thing that they made it right.
