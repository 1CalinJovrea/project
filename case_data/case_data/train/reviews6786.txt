one of the worst ever

there is no way to describe how bad this movie is. when we arrived, we
were the ONLY 2 people in the theater! eventually 2 more people came
in. I've read some of the positive reviews, and I can only surmise that
we saw different films. there are no words to describe how horribly bad
this film is. I cannot fathom how anyone associated with making it,
especially the leading characters, would allow their names and careers
to be associated with such a disgusting film. how many times can a 9
year old say "fuck" or vagina or some other body part out of context.
swimming in feces is supposed to be funny? the humor is less than
juvenile. I don't think I have ever seen my wife walk out of a movie,
no matter how bad. she really wanted to see this but was ready to leave
after 20 minutes. I would give this move a minus "-" rating if possible
but a 1 is the only option.
