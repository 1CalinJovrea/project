Generic, repetitive and forgettable

Don't believe the hype. John Wick: Chapter 2 is not as nearly as good
as almost everyone is portraying it to be. It's a generic movie with a
dumb story line. Action is very repetitive - I got full-fed with it
after seeing first two action scenes. Best this movie has to offer is close combat, toe-to-toe fight. John
employs a lot of jujitsu. Of course he can handle fifty heavy armed
marksman with only a pistol. Imagine living in a world without police
and emotional guilt of any kind. That's a John Wick's world; a
dream-world of any teenager. Nobody in John Wick 2 displays any other
emotion other than desire to kill. This makes acting non-impressive,
characters forgettable and generic.And why does almost every location look like a pagan temple? Why does
every character look like a brainwashed pagan high-priest? Soundtrack
doesn't help it neither; it makes everything feel more unnatural. This
is an R rated movie made for 10 year old's.If you've already seen the original, you won't see anything you haven't
seen before. If you haven't seen it, ignore the second part and see the
original.
