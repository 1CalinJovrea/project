1
Predictable, slow, boring, poor acting, etc

The first movie was fresh and entertaining. I've been dragged by my
partner to watch the second one which I actually enjoyed until the end
when I realized it was not finished yet. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay
Part 1 is simply a jock. I've never been so much bored from a movie and
at some point I really considered leaving the theater. The pace is
slow, the acting terribly poor and every single scene predictable.
Jennifer Lawrence's character has been stretched to the maximum. All
she does is crying and pretending all movie long.I will not watch the
part 2 in theater nor on TV as we all already know what will happen.
This movie is perfect if you want to feel frustrated, disappointed and
tricked.
