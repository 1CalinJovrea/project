Great songs and great characters

I knew I was in for a good music movie when the first song gave me
chills.I went into this movie expecting lots of songs and gags, and they are
there, but I didn't expect to start caring about the characters and
their stories. SING brings together a talented cast and writers for a
movie that transcends some of the animated movies out there. The whole
family loved it so feel free to bring anyone from 5 on up. Even the
younger ones may enjoy it when it's available at home.Every voice actor delivers and the animators nailed it. The pacing and
directing are also very well done. In fact, I could have done with even
more of the "auditions" at the beginning.
