Manages to be worse than the first one

The movie is almost the exact same as the first one. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have no chemistry. Feels like they
didn't even attempt to try and do better than the first one. There are about four or five plot holes that had potential but if
written well, they would have made it work on screen.Cheesy, terrible and cringe-worthy dialogue. The sex scenes are not sexy, and what makes them even less sexy is the
music during the scenes. The MAJOR problem I had with the film is how Anastasia is written. This
is yet another weak female character on screen who likes to be bossed
around and controlled by Jamie Dornan's character, Christian. If you are fans of the book, I think you might enjoy it but they should
have just left them as books. The dialogue and characters are written
badly on paper but the author manages to make it work somehow.
