Wow! (small spoiler, outlined with **

This movie is absolutely amazing! Loved it so so so so much! Watched it
tonight at the movies. As well as it being a chick flick, **it tells
the story of three girls coming together because of one stupid guy.** I
think it had an interesting plot and left me on the edge of my seat the
entire time. My favorite part would have definitely been ** the humor
Kate had. it left me and everyone in the almost full cinema laughing
our heads off**. Definitely worth watching and is age appropriate for
people 13 year old (I have heard some people saying it is
inappropriate), apart from a few scenes. If you haven't seen it yet,
you need to!
