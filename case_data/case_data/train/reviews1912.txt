Carol is a dull affair!

I'm at a loss with this movie. I went to the late showing last night,
which was a mistake because this drama about two lovers persecuted by
ignorance and misogyny will exploit any fatigue you have and try
desperately to put you to sleep. I struggle through nearly two hours of
this movie and eventually gave up and left figuring that not much else
would happen as nothing did happen throughout the entire first three
quarters. I went and read some spoiler discussion on it on a clickbait
website to find that I didn't miss much.Don't get me wrong, these actresses are at the top of their game with
strong performances by both lead Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. It's
the script that seems dull to me. The drama and romance appear so
distant and tension so boring that it was nearly impossible to get
close to these characters and care. Check out more of this review and
