Weirdest movie that warms your heart.

Before I stat, my English teacher suggested me to write every thing
that goes into my mind when I want to write something, in order to get
over my trouble in expressing my self correctly.Two days before watching this movie I happen to have watched "The perks
of being a wallflower", and I can safely say that both movies are
equally amazing in delivering such a wonderful experience to anyone who
watches them.Amazingly enough, they both describe punch of situations
during the movie that happened/will happen in everyone's high school
life, which is magnificent to be quiet frank, but enough talking about
two movies at the same time.Me and Earl and a Dying Girl succeeded in representing one's emotions
on the big screen, something that many other movies fails to do, and
the reason behind this is simplicity in taking actions, the movie is
shot in places that are familiar to any one, the script is close to the
modern life, and the whole setting just feels solid.The experience in the movie made me -no lies here- smile during the
whole thing, until the climax (which if you read the book:you will
understand what I'm talking about), and while I'm trying hard not to
write this whole I'm filled with emotions, I just feel that this movies
deserves to be called one of the best experiences out there.It seems like having three 'amazingly good at acting teenagers' in a
movie is the perfect recipe for success, and here it perfectly shown
why. I can't stress how amazing it is to see a true relationship
between friends in a movie, and how it will draw a bigger smile on the
viewers faces.Ultimately, this is a very underrated movie, and it is a must watch for
every one.
