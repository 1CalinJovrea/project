Wake me when the story begins

I don't even know where to begin. You'll see the ending coming within
the first 10 minutes. Not the kind of "film" you want to invest and
entire afternoon watching. Don't torture yourself following an
unsympathetic character around for a couple hours as she fails and
fails and then fails at failing at her lifeless, miserable, daily
existence. You'll want to kill yourself before she does. Did I want to?
Yes. Did I? Of course not. I had to spare my life to warn others. The
exploration of darkness and tragedy in the life of a character is
admirable, but not if you leave us there in the darkness with nothing
left worthy of redemption. Regroup. Rewrite.
