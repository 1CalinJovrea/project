A very shallow movie

I watched Argo last night and was very disappointed. It is just a
typical Hollywood commercial movie. It is probably entertaining, but
definitely not thought-provoking. The directing is just so so. That
explains why Ben Affleck did not get nominated for best director. It
should not be given the best picture, either. Among the 9 movies
nominated, I have watched Lincoln, Les Miserables, Django Unchained,
and Life of Pi besides Argo. I must say Argo is the worst one. After 10
years people won't remember it as a must-see in life. I watched the Italian movie The Unknown Woman on TV before going to the
theater for Argo yesterday. Obviously the Unknown Women is far more
superior to movies like Argo.
