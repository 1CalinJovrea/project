Mystery thriller par excellence

This is how you have to do a movie like this. It's a ride from
beginning to end and it will keep you guessing throughout. Maybe you'll
get things right and see the signs, maybe you're just enjoying things
unraveling as the movie flows by. Whatever the case, you can be more
than entertained with this little gem.The acting is top notch and the script is really clever (I try to use
this term as lightly as possible) and there is a touch of coolness to
the characters, that is not forced upon them. The story might seem
bigger at the beginning that it finally turns out to be, and there
might be people disappointed with the ending. Take a chance though ...
or wait for the inevitable US remake ...
