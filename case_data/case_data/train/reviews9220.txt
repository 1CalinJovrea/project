Why the bad reviews?

I'll start off by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. At times it
made me laugh, at times it gave me frights, there were many times when
it set my pulse racing. It's an action movie, its supposed to. Not once
did it make me think of how flawed western civilization really is, or
put tears in my eyes, or make me appreciate living in a 21st century,
western country, with plenty to eat, drink etc. Its an action movie,
it's NOT supposed to. And thats where I find some of these reviews annoying. If you go to the
cinema to see a movie called GI Joe: Retaliation, which is an action
movie, you should only rate it accordingly. This movie easily fulfills
all the criteria for a good action film, so if you want to go see an
action movie, then yes, go see this. The acting isn't bad, the plot is
fairly good and the visuals are incredible. But if you want to see a
realistic film, one that will make you smile, sob, or think about life,
do not go see this film. What this film is, is 2 hours entertainment.
It will have you glued to the screen for that 2 hours (especially if
you see it in 3D). I would recommend GI Joe: Retaliation to anyone from
about the age of ten up, as long as you walk into the cinema or press
play expecting to see a good action movie. If you do this, you will be
thoroughly entertained for 2 hours. Enjoy!
