7
Worth Watching if you liked the First One

Sin City movies remind me of Kill Bill 1 and 2. If it wasn't for short
dialogues of this movie and a little faster pace I wouldn't have been
surprised it I saw "Tarantino" in front of "director". But where
Tarantino loves long dialogues and slower story telling, this one packs
lots of action and story inside story for the whole length of the
movie. Sin City 2.0 will entertain you just like the first one. If you
watched the last one to the end then I thin actually you will like this
one a little better.A note on the actors though. I think Joseph Gordon choice was poor. He
is too small for this movie. I would have liked to see Keanu Reeves
instead. I gave this move a 7 rating, but I feel a little guilty because I feel
like our expectations are getting lower when it comes to movies. Talk
about acting. Compare the masked and clich√© and animated performances
in this movie to the likes of No Country for Old men, or 21 grams, or
Blue Valentine.
