Very disappointing

I had great expectations for this movie and as an outdoors person was
looking forward to adventure and action scenes that would excite and
entertain. This movie however was long , drawn out and did not contain
anything of interest even though it kept you hoping throughout that
something exciting would occur. I think I have seen more action and
adventure in a comic book. Acting was good, but nothing in this film
will surprise you or get your adrenaline going.. 2 hours 20 minutes
wasted,, I gave it one star for the acting,, otherwise it was a
terribly disappointing film.
