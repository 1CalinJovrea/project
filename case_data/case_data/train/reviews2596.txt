This was a passably interesting take on the high school movie. The
characters felt real and had at least some depth, other than Dave's
friends who felt shoehorned in for non-existent comedy. I thought the
'token black guy' was the thing of the past, but here he is again in a
mostly silent, vaguely racist role as the friend and straight talking
foil of the sensitive dreamy white kid. The 'English' friend was very
awkward too, the accent was way off and the actor wooden.Other than that, there wasn't anything offensive about the film. The
dialogue was fairly smart and snappy, the acting was passable, the
storyline was at least somewhat different.I can't see anyone being passionate about the film, though, and that is
the problem. Everything is just average, from the cinematography to the
pacing to the plot. The attempts at being 'deep' and 'meaningful' such
as the car wreck and the pretentious conversation felt shoehorned in.
Essentially it is just a concise teen film that doesn't insult your
intelligence but doesn't enthrall you either. There really isn't much
to say about it.
