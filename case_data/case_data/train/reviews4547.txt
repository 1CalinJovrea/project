one of the worst war movies that I've ever seen

I wonder what veterans of the battle had to say after watching this
movie. There are many moments in this movie that make it look like
Marvel's story. Unbelievable. Was there really only ONE rope ladder to
climb for ALL American troops? Was there some kind of treaty with
Japanese not to touch the ladder and let Americans climb till they
reach the top and prepare for an attack? Everyone was just waiting for
our hero to finish, ALONE,saving his wounded comrades? I used to
respect Mel Gibson's work. Not anymore.
