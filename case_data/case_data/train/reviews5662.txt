I'm left wanting more and wondering if I watched the same movie as other reviewers.

i completely disagree that this movie should be categorized as a
thriller or mystery. The story has a predictable outcome that I could
see coming from the beginning. The writer did nothing to try and even
lead us in a different direction. In the first ten minutes the vicitims
family leads us to a boyfriend no ones ever met. Obviously they're
going to try and find him, once they do we're hand delivered the entire
story. There was no work for the audience to do and zero surprise. I
kind of like being lead down a few different paths that can be
misleading before letting us know what really happened and who the
killer is. I found the characters to be predictable from The
tracker/hunter male that's good at everything And always figures it out
before the young female law enforcement character that's in over her
head. Throw in the local cop that's a bit slow and blas√© about his job.
It's been done a 100 + times and I think it's been done better. I'm
actually starting to wonder whose reviewing movies. I'm sorry but 8/10
on IMDb when there's many many more movies that score 6/10 that have
better story, writing and acting. Was this movie awful? No. It's not a
terrible movie but it's definitely just average.
