What did I do to deserve this horrible movie?

I'm a big fan of the movie "Once" but "Begin Again" was so bad that I
think I have to go back and watch "Once" just to make sure it wasn't
also a horrible movie. Wow! John Carney really crapped the bed on this
one. Mark Ruffalo, who I have always liked in the past, phones in a
terrible and clichéd performance. While I can't claim to have been a
Keira Knightley fan, I never really hated her but I will probably never
sit through another one of her movies after this one. I can't imagine
what all of the people who liked this movie saw in it. Really. I can't.
It actually makes me wonder if the positive reviews were all written by
a paid PR team. This movie was THAT bad. Some highlights: horrible
music, clichéd dialogue, repulsive acting, that guy from Maroon 5
sporting a beard, Keira taking a hipster bike ride through NYC, the end
of Ruffalo's previously stellar career, directed like an NYU film
school project, horrible music, spouting off about "bad" and
"commercial" music but every song in the movie was commercial garbage,
the cliché line "you can learn a lot about someone from their
play-list," ... I can't keep going ... I just can't. My recommendation,
stay far away from this movie. My rating, two thumbs up the
writer/director's dark cleft.
