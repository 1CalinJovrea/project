Pointless and Joyless

In 1983 I had one of the best movie going experiences of my life, when
I saw The Evil Dead in a packed house. The audience "participated" in
the screening: people talking to the screen, imitating the demons
(perfectly), and turning the movie into a party. The original had humor
and was actually scary in parts. This remake commits the unpardonable
sin of removing all of the humor. This is an Evil Dead movie: the
friggin' humor MUST be there. Someone made the idea to make this film
straight and actually inject dramatic elements to the story, like one
of the characters kicking heroin. So no humor and depressing drama plus
nauseating gore (that I did expect) equals crappy movie experience. I
can imagine only a perverted sicko would enjoy this horrible movie. The
gore just keeps coming and coming...and they keep throwing the
depressing stuff at you at the same time. Then the ending...ah the
wonderful surprise ending. I was told to stay with it until the end of
the credits for a surprise. The surprise is Bruce
Campbell...saying,"Groovy!" Talk about adding insult to injury. What an
out of place thing to do. So a big F U to him and his buddies for
co-producing this crap. They've made millions already. I hope they're
happy with it: I'll never watch anything by them again.
