Laughed My Ass Off!

If you're looking for a scare, you won't get that from this movie. What
you will get is anticipation and emotion of fear with the wonder of how
will this end. The movie is an hour and a half - and once the inciting
incident happens and the plot gets going - the tension and pace does
not let up. This is definitely a movie that you can watch more than
once and still be entertained.
