Great effects - horrible runtime

I don't understand what all the hype is about this movie, I went
expecting great things!! I'm big fan of the sci-fi genre and and avid
space enthusiast so its usually something I would of though i'd like.To start, the visuals and effects are pretty amazing. It executes the
realism of space well. Thats where it stops, you get used to the shots
over earth after a few minutes, then it just goes from one ridiculous
disaster scenario to another for good aul sandra who seems to know
Chinese and Russian by the way!! George Clooneys character is very
annoying, never shuts up, must get in lots of pub fights if he was
real.From a movie that tries to use the present space tech, BTW CSS does not
exist, its a joke how they use it....the crash landing at the end
laughable!!All in all, very average movie, I know its not really in same category
as sci-fi i.e. no aliens, crazy future tech but I could list ten better
movies that have lower score on IMDb, i'd even rate disneys blackhole
better than this, hahaenjoy;)
