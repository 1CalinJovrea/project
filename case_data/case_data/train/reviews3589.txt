And the award for "Best Cinematography" goes to...

When I was a child, I used to walk out of movies all the time with
chills and a sense of awe and wonder, thinking that was the best movie
I had ever seen. However, that's because I WAS a child and at the time,
any movie was automatically on that list.It has been a LONG time since I had that feeling. Usually, I now walk
out of the theater saying "Yeah, that was a great movie, but it's not
one of the best I have ever seen.""RUSH" was different. When I walked out of that movie, I had those
chills and that sense of awe and wonder again. Not only did that movie
have me at the edge of my seat at every turn like a good racing movie
should, but I can safely say that that movie had the best
cinematography that I have ever seen in any film. More often than not,
I was sitting there thinking "Holy s**t, how did they get a shot like
that??" To this day, when I think about that movie, I still ask myself
that question. I would not be surprised in the least if this movie wins
the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.
