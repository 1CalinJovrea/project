In Bruges meets Adaptation

An off-the-wall, quirky, postmodern film in which a screenwriter
struggling to write a screenplay suddenly finds said screenplay playing
out in front of him through his oddball associates and the comedic ways
in which their lives interact. It's not as funny as In Bruges, and it's
not as clever as Adaptation and the second half feels almost like its
from a very different, boring, film - but if you don't mind graphic
violence and wet t shirts between your laughs then this film could be
for you. The ensemble cast do well to lift the lesser-written scenes
(Chris Walken and Woody Harrelson are on fine form in particular) and
it doesn't take itself seriously; neither should you: just sit back and
laugh at the ride.
