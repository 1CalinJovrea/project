Not too shabby!

There's something about this film that I can't seem to wrap my finger
around. It's not your typical animation movie, then again it's not that
different either.This movie revolves around three friends: two young boys and a girl.
Maybe it's a bit clich√©; two boys falling in love with their third best
friend, a girl.Both boys have different talents, one's a great guitarist (Manolo), a
composer of romantic songs, and the other, a macho-save-the-world hero
type (Joaquin).But an unfortunate day befalls the three; Maria is sent to a convent
school in Europe.As life goes on, these three grow up to be young adults. Manolo is
forced to become, as part of his family tradition, a bull-fighter, and
while he certainly has the talent, can't bring himself to kill a bull.
Joaquin on the other hand, goes on to become the town's saviour and
hero, following in his father's footsteps.They both await the day that Maria returns. But who will win her
eternal love? So, you get the basic idea. The story's not too shabby,
but isn't a new concept.One thing I certainly enjoyed in the film was the humour. But that's
not all the film has to offer; a moderate story and humour, no there's
more.The story teaches that although a person may possess great potential,
he may not expose of it freely due to his fear of bringing shame to his
family lineage and his fear of being an outcast.One other thing I admired about the two friends Manolo and Joanquin was
that they never lost sight of their own friendship, even whilst
fighting for the woman of their dreams. In the end, they were both
ready to give their life for the other, knowing fully well that the
other friend might eventually get their dream girl.So then, this movie has a lot of potential. It might not be the
greatest animation of 2014, but it's definitely worth watching.
