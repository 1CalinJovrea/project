Overall great movie

I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival 4 or 5 months ago. It was
honestly a very good movie. Christian Bale and Isaac did a good job
acting in this movie. As a fellow Armenian, I am also disappointed in
all the bad reviews that this movie has received. This movie is right
now a 4.1 / 10 when it should really be closer to an 8 or 9 or at least
a 7. This movie was rated before it even came out and it is not fair
that it doesn't receive a fair rating. Overall this was a good movie.
The music was well done by the singer of System of a Down and the
director did a good job as well putting everything together. I would
recommend seeing this movie for anyone who is out there.
