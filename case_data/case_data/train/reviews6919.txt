Yes,they managed to do it.Worse than part 1.

OK,it's not that part 1 was good,you actually knew it would suck,but
the 2nd really grinds my gears. You have in your hands a civil war,the final battle into the heart of
the capital,and you spent 2 hours of your life watching your main
character taking a walk in a war zone. And with all that time strolling,you have no character development,for
none of them,just a few moments that the movie is like "Ok,from now
on,that's how things are". I watched this for closure,i wish i hadn't.I didn't expected it to be a great movie,just a good action one,and it
failed.Miserably. For goodness sake,London has fallen had more
character development than a book based quadralogy,LOTR had less
walking..good riddance to the series.
