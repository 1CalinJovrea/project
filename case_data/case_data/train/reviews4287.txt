Waste of Time

I keep trying these "found footage" movies only to be utterly
disappointed almost every time. In fact, Paranormal Activity is the
ONLY good one out there. This movie was based on improv conversations
and it shows. It is slow and doesn't build up. It is predictable and
boring. It offers nothing to keep you scared (there are a few jump
scares which I view as cheating anyway) My advice to the makers of this
movie: write a good story instead of improv. You have to trick the
audience. In this movie we knew who the "creep" was the entire time.
There are a a couple small little twists, but they don't really make a
difference in the story. The "Peachfuzz" mask is the scariest thing in
this movie.
