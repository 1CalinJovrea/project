How poor is love that counts ...

Watching 'Valerian and the City of Thousand Planets' I was reminded
what makes Science Fiction so enjoyable. It's not the space fights, the
cool alien life forms, the futuristic metropolis. It's that all these
things remind us how infinite this space is, how tiny our existence,
and how precious.You probably have no idea what I am talking about. Just go watch this
fantastic movie and you will understand. To make it short: This movie
was perfect. It is a breathtaking, overwhelming vision of the
celebrated comics, brought to life with heartblood by Luc Besson.The less you know about the story the better. The film naming hero
Valerian is connected through his dreams to a distant planet. It
involves war between races, military intrigue, love & death, but more
then any other SciFi movie, this one is about the journey not the
destination. The countless side stories, and side characters are what
makes this a breathing version of an unforgettable universe. This is
the best Sci Fiction film I've seen since 'The Matrix'.
