Slow at times, but picks it right back up with intense action.

13 Hours is a fun and intense watching adventure. While starting slow,
the sometimes unexpected action keeps you engrossed into the movie,
allowing there to be breathing time between action scenes, so you're
not completely bombarded by action 'till the very end.There are definitely emotional and gripping moments, with the six main
protagonists going up against hordes of enemies that are attacking at
their assigned base in Benghazi. The movie feels realistic, and is a
great representation of the book and of what happened in real life, as
this movie is based off of a true story. Some people have bias against
certain directors, especially Michael Bay, which is fine. Some still
need to give credit where credit is due, as this movie grips onto you
and keeps you along for the ride.While the action sections are very impressive and a blast to watch,
there is no real emotional bond that can be seen between the
protagonists. Sure, they're forced to be there for several weeks,
working alongside each other, but the only real connection they ever
share is by some occasional banter. Plenty of characters are introduced
that don't play an impact into the movie, making some scenes feel
contrived and unnecessary. A majority of those aren't even named or
introduced, which is fine, as not every single person can be
significant to the story. Although, having some more details about some
of those people would keep the audience attached some more.All around, the movie definitely has its slip-ups, but it does well
when it comes to keeping the audience invested. Some scenes will
definitely keep you on your toes, leaning towards the screen as you
anticipate what may happen next. 13 Hours is definitely recommended,
and the ending wraps it up well.
