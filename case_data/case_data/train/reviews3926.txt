Funniest film iv watched

Film has to be the funniest film iv ever watched. I don't know how
anyone can give it less than a 10. Obviously don't have a good sense of
humour. So what if there was nudity in it simple don't watch it then.
It's all about having fun and having a laugh and not afraid to just do
anything in a film. Every person in the cinema couldn't stop laughing
from start to finish.
