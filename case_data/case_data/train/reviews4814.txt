Boring Boring Boring

Zac Efron, Miles Teller, Michael Jordan, and everybody else just come
across as complete amateurs in their 'acting' attempts in this flop of
a movie. Honestly it was a challenge not to walk away from this
nonsense story!Three friends decide to stay single due to their failed love lives then
got right out to get hooked up with girlfriends again. So what's the
point of the story? It makes no sense.The director Tom Gormican maybe thought the body function jokes were
funny but I doubt anyone else thought the jokes were a laugh. The
target audience must have been 7 or 8 year old males because that's the
only ones who would laugh and this is NOT a movie for that age group.Approach with caution .... it's an awkward movie!
