Interesting scenario, underrated movie, surprising performance from Ryan

I didn't know about this movie until my mom told me about it. Yeah, I
have a really cool mom :P :DSo, I said let's watch the trailer and see what it's all about. Liked
the trailer, so I decided to watch the movie.The idea itself makes you think about the decisions one takes in life
and how they affect you later on, how regrets overwhelm you and how it
is that immortality seems such a divine option that we all dream of and
how that can be a total disaster if not managed correctly.Damian is a business man who finds himself in the last phase of cancer,
with 6 months to live. He decides to go to this secret clinic to make a
transfer of consciousness into somebody else's body. He is being lied
to from the very beginning by being told the bodies are grown in the
lab. He wakes up in this younger body and he tries to move n with life.
Suddenly he has all these dreams with a Hispanic woman, a child and he
suspects the lies he was told. He goes to find the location he had in
his dreams and finds out that the woman and the child actually exist,
together with the young man's body he now is. Here is where all his
problems start and the action is really intriguing. I'd say this movie worth 2 hours of your time, it is not exceptional,
but it's good. And Ryan Reynolds delivers quite a good performance.
