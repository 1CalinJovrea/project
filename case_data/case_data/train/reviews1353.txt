I have NO Idea why this movie is getting such hype....

So, the acting in this film is excellent and that's why the one star.
Other than that, this is a hot mess of a movie in terms of any sense of
reality, common sense, and human behavior.It makes is appear that bipolar is pretty much curable if a person
meets the right hot girl and takes meds for a short time. And don't
worry if the other crazy guy from the mental institution comes to visit
as he's not really all that crazy, and the audience never figures out
why he's there or what happens to him in the end.Apparently anyone can enter a professional dance competition,
regardless of ability or training, and book making is a viable job
option for the unemployed. When a person gets out of the institution,
he or she is apparently assigned their own personal police officer who
just happens to show up day or night, kind of like a personal on-call
bodyguard. Oh, and having a cra-cra dad who obviously passed his mental
issues on to his son but isn't called on it at all is just part of the
insanity that makes up this ridiculous movie. But, hey, if a person
dances long enough their mental issues go away and all is well.I'll be shaking my head for a long time as I cannot believe how this
movie is getting the press and reviews I've seen. Excellent actors in a
beyond stupid screenplay. Complete waste of time and money.
