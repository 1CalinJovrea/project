Superb all round

Having seen the trailers and TV set-up (BBC as a Grand Prix insert) I
was thinking OK so I've probably seen the best of this and it's going
to be 'clunky' in parts or too far up it's own a$$.But hey we can all be wrong, Ron Howard has added depth to a story I
knew well, the presentation has a feel for the era the colour's are
sometimes harsh and edgy.The set pieces are well researched, the owners of some of the classic
F1 hardware must have had an enjoyable time (not quite so sure about
the Insurance Underwriters).Where the story hits the spot for me is the acting of the main
protagonists, they have life and depth. Hemsworths presentation of
James Hunt is uncanny it's like a documentary he's almost as good as
Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.If your not a F1 fan or from the 70's it may not be more than a blokes
film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as
Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best
car racing movie ever
