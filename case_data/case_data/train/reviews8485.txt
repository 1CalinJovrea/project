Horrible

Honestly, I didn't finish watching the movie. I had to walk out. I was
disgusted and uncomfortable. Usually I do not walk out of movies but it
was pretty annoying. There were many explicit scenes. Which made not
only me but a couple of people walked out. I honestly regret seeing
actually even buying tickets for this film. Reeves is a very good
actor. But in this one, he just seemed so awkward. And i felt like at a
point he was lost or something. It was just too twisted and sick.
Please think twice of watching this movie. Like I was expecting for
more of a horror film. Knowing Keeves acting, I was expecting like a
huge whoa. Its not worth watching.
