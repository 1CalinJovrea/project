Tinkerbell with Pixar Animation

I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their
acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it
appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is
just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with
better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave
within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the
horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the
audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies
always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots,
excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out
was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about
the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no
surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise,
it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to
get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending.
It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing
episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend
thought the movie and short were "babyish". I'm waiting until they make
a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye,
bye Pixar. I'll miss you.
