A wonderful film

This a lovely film focusing on the relationship between A.A Milne and
his son, Christopher Robin and how together they became sucked into the
world of Winnie the Pooh.With good performances from all this is a wonderful film, all about
lost innocence and the importance of family. We are left with the
question about whether Milne really did his son too many favours by
placing him in a children's book after all.Special mention must go to Will Tilston, who plays the young
Christopher Robin so beautifully.I hope this film goes onto wider acclaim, because I thought it was
marvellous.
