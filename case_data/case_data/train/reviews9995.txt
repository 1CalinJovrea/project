Wow this is so excellent!.

Raised by a family of wolves since birth, Mowgli (Neel Sethi) must
leave the only home he's ever known when the fearsome tiger Shere Khan
(Idris Elba) unleashes his mighty roar. Guided by a no-nonsense panther
(Ben Kingsley) and a free-spirited bear (Bill Murray), the young boy
meets an array of jungle animals, including a slithery python and a
smooth-talking ape. Along the way, Mowgli learns valuable life lessons
as his epic journey of self-discovery leads to fun and adventure.Disney Picture is the best company in making top and number 1 family
movies.Everything is excellent about this movie.I guarantee you this top movie will win too many Oscars.
