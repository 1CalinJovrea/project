Pirate this, it's not worth the money.

Let me first start by saying that I am staunchly anti-piracy. I
wouldn't want you to watch this on Netflix, by virtue of the fact that
you spend roughly $8 a month on Netflix, and would subsequently be
paying to watch this movie.Huge fans of the first '300', my fianc√©e and I went to see 'Rise of an
Empire' with another couple on a whim this past Friday. Thirty or so
minutes into the film, I had to lean over and ask my friend if this
movie was a parody, as it was impossible to take seriously. It could
have been the fact that Xerxes now has a heavy Portugese accent amongst
poorly executed English accents, used by characters attempting to
portray Greeks/Persians. Maybe the cartoonish, video game fight scenes
(85% of the film) with a disgusting overuse of the slow motion effect
that landed a heavy punch in the first film. Could it be the fact that,
without any real firepower, it's almost impossible to make a naval
battle truly interesting? How about the lazy use of stock footage from
the original film? Maybe the sex scene, which obviously uses
slow/fast-mo fighting graphics, and features some Persian chrome-face
guards glancing at each other comically whilst they hear the lovemaking
from outside the room, a-la Scary Movie. I honestly don't think a
parody would do this movie justice.On the other hand, I greatly enjoyed the $5 Espresso Chocolate
milkshake I got from the Alamo Drafthouse. I rate that an 8/10, coming
in at a close second to the Strawberry Balsamic shake, which gets a
perfect 10/10 every time. I would strongly recommend either of these
shakes from Drafthouse, to be enjoyed while watching something other
than '300, Rise of an Empire'.
