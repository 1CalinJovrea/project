IMDb should introduce a new genre for worst movies and place it on top

One of the most disgusting movies i've ever seen in my life these are the things which are "not" present in this movie -horror (no
it's way off it's even insulting to include this in a horror category)
-thriller -story -actionit's a total waste of time , a complete senseless crap only little kids can like this movie who have never seen any good
horror movie in their entire life and they'll feel happy on blood
shedding and watching zombies coming out of the ground this movie is also a consecutive proof that IMDb rating mechanism is
very poor and you can't depend on it, IMDb rated it 7.5 ,it don't even
deserve 1/10to conclude don't watch it!
