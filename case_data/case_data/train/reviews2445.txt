Be a Boss

A continuation of the Horrible Bosses series, this second in the series
hits a bit more about the complexity of striking out on your own. The
three amigos in Nick Hendricks, Kurt Buckman, and Dale Arbus take a
risk in establishing their brand of shower heads and seek a stake in
the business world. What they discover is that is much more of doggie
dog world than they expected. Has a large well known cast from Kevin
Spacey, Jaimie Foxx, and Christoph Waltz. Jennifer Aniston is the
nastiest I have seen in this film and does push the cougar sex craze
angel to the limits. As the trio strike out on their own, they soon
discover they need plan b if they want to be able to compete in the
world of business. This plan B is not perfect but helps them find a
path to being their own bosses.
