Emperor's New Backpack

Loaded with potential, 22 JUMP STREET is the sequel to the comedic
buddy teamup (based on the 1980's Johnny Depp TV show) where
Christopher Tatum and Jonah Hill posed as high schoolers to bust a drug
dealer Not only did it score at the box office, 21 JUMP STREET was
actually really funny and involving, and the duo made a fantastic polar
opposite team.The first of many inside-jokes is when Ice Cube's grouchy Captain of
the 22 Jump Street's new abandoned church location comments on how no
one thought the first "reboot" (referring to the church within the
movie, but not really) would actually work like it did... And now
they're piling more money into this new one (again quasi-referring to
the church) Something sequels actually have to do to win over
audiences, a second time.The intentionally mirrored storyline of Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's
Jenko in college lacks the suspenseful undercover element of keeping
their identities secret: Not only do they constantly shrug off the
mission at hand finding the drug dealer that sold to a girl who
fatally overdosed but the students they're involved with are equally
pointless and unmotivated.Jenko bonds with a fellow football jock while Schmidt scores (much too
easily) with a girl way out of his league. The twist on who that girl's
related to provides some laughter but the joke gets old after a while.
As do the bromantic metrosexual comparisons about the bickering
cop-partners being in and out of a close relationship... You're
straight but seem otherwise: We get it already! The best scenes take place after the weary college story peters out
Not like it had any real juice in the first place Hell, even their
current psychedelic overdose is lame and contrived. So when the boys
infiltrate Spring Break/Mexico there's a neat burst of overboard
sequel-action to make us forget two things: 22 isn't as good as the
first venture, and the first 3/4ths of this movie isn't very good at
all.
