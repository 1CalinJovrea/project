A Definite Decline In The Series' Quality

As with most sequels, the quality of the Ice Age movies is definitely
regressing. I've enjoyed the others in the series (well, actually, I
haven't seen The Meltdown, but I've seen the original and Dawn of the
Dinosaurs) but I found Continental Drift to be disappointing in
comparison. The animation is good as always, but there's too much in
this that's too similar to what we've seen before (and, frankly, Scrat
the sabre-toothed squirrel is getting tired and boring; same sub-plot
every single time.)In Continental Drift the original content came across to me as silly
and overdone. As the land begins to drift apart (quite suddenly) Manny,
Sid and Diego are trapped on a floating block of ice, desperately
trying to get back to their "herd." Then they spend basically the
entire movie fighting a gang of pirates led by a primate named Captain
Gutt. This battle goes on and on and on. It makes for a movie that's a
little bit (well, a lot) more violent than the other Ice Age movies and
while there are some humorous moments (largely revolving around Sid's
grandma) it didn't seem to me to have the fun of the other movies in
the series that I've seen.In fairness, my daughter's 8. She says she liked it. I can't disagree
with that, so if the target audience is kids, then this is OK. It's
just that the previous Ice Age movies seemed to have something for
people of all ages to enjoy. This one was lacking that. (4/10)
