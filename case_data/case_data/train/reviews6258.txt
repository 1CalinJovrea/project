One of the most emotionally intense, powerful movies of the year

I saw this film on the last night it was playing at my local theater
and I jumped on the opportunity. Once it was over I realized how smart
of a decision it was. I read a review of the film that said something
along the lines of, "the trouble with this film being 3 hours is that
you want to watch it for several more." I couldn't agree more with that
statement. The story, along with its characters, moves the film along
to the point where it didn't feel like 3 hours. This film was probably the most emotionally intense and powerful movie
I've seen in a very long time. You believed everything you were seeing
and it forced you to feel it along with the characters. As much that
has been written about this film, the acting can not be overstated.
These two actresses are a revelation in this movie. It seems that whenever the topic of homosexuality is covered by a film
it usually contains some sort of hate crime or bias against
homosexuality somewhere in the story that the film's characters have to
face and overcome. What's refreshing about this film is that there is a
dash of that but its in the beginning of the film and never becomes the
focus of the conflict with the characters. The film acknowledges that
bias is there but brushes it aside to say that there is something
bigger and more important at play with the characters. Really nice to
see that in a film.This movie ranks as one of the best films I've seen this year and am so
happy I had a chance to see it.
