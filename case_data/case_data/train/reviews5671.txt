Great Pixels!!

I recently watched Pixels and was absolutely enjoyed this movie. It is
a fiction action-comedy film and if you used to be part of the video
gamer in the 80's and 90's, I'm sure you will like this movie and It
will surely bring back your memories from your childhood. Adam Sandler
was really amazing in this movie. He is somehow like a superhero. The
movie is really entertaining with such great effects. There are some
silly parts but it is pretty hilarious to me like a human falls in love
with the video games' character. It keeps pushing me towards the end of
the movie without disappointing me. The end of the movie was really
what I expected. It was really cool but before that my heart was
pounding like an alarm clock. Finally, I love how this film made my
heart goes crazy about it. Overall, this is such a great movie to watch
with a big piece of childhood memories mix with laughs and a love
story.
