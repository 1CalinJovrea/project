Dumbing down the Tower

The Dark Tower by Stephen King is an expansive story that spans 7
books, telling Roland the Gunslinger's journey to the Tower; involving
different genres, many characters, many worlds - a big lore. At a certain point whether you have read the series or not is probably
irrelevant. If you haven't read the books, I would imagine the movie
just will feel flat and lifeless, with only a few scenes from
McConaughey standing out. There's very little plot and character
development, which comes across as a lump of clich√©s. If you have read
the books, you'll likely find the movie a spectacular failure,
wondering how the writers managed to dumb down such promising material
to a 95 minute generic action movie, and making an actor like Idris
Elba overact in a character that should have endless potential. The
final result is so hollow and narrow, if you have watched the trailer,
you may just count yourself as having seen the whole thing. If you are intrigued by the story, skip this movie, and give the first
book of the series a go.
