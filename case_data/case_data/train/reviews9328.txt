Worst production of Netflix

This is hands down the worst production of Netflix so far. They took
the concept from the source material but turned it everything opposite
and awful acting, script. characterization were final nail in the
coffin. This show had nothing to offer. Boring as soon as it started
and got worse with the course of time. This movie's existence is a
mystery that's all
