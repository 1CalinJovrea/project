By far the funniest Adam Sandler movie

I want to start off by saying I have never been so confused by movie
reviews in my entire life. Did people watch the same movie I saw?
That's My Boy is the funniest Adam Sandler movie and in my opinion the
funniest movie I've ever seen. I did not go longer than 5 minutes
without hysterically laughing at the scenes in this movie. As a fan of
movies such as Wedding Crashers, Old School, Step Brothers, 21 Jump
Street, Superbad, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall just to name a few,
this has to be the funniest movie out of the bunch. If you're looking
for more than just laughs, than maybe the movie might not be right for
you. And do not go into an R rated comedy expecting no dirty jokes.
This is Adam Sandler at his raunchiest and funniest.
