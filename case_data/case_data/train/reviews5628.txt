Hardy delivers a magnificent performance

Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke, a successful construction manager who makes
a major decision on his journey home which will impact on every aspect
of his life.This a low budget drama from writer and director Steven Knight with
Hardy the sole screen presence. As he takes to the road he is seemingly
a man in control of his destiny, determined to do the right thing only
for everything to slowly unravel. Through conversations on the phone he
tries to negotiate an emerging crisis at work with his boss and an
evolving domestic situation with a concerned wife and sons desperate to
have their dad home to watch the football.With a premise of just one actor in a confined location it is testament
to Hardy's acting nous that he can pull off such a taught, powerful
performance solely based on reactions to the increasingly dramatic
phone calls. Locke is unrelenting in his belief of doing the right
thing and we see why when he has imagined conversations with his
father, an apparently neglectful and emotionally absent figure in his
life. These scenes in particular are beautifully shot with the use of
Locke looking into the car mirrors for the man who isn't there.It wastes very little of its short running time and overall is a
captivating and rewarding film with a terrific central performance.
