Absolutely blown away

When I first walk into theater, I was not expecting much of this. Yeah,
the first moments were so clich√© I thought this would just be a
mediocre movie at best. But after the movie, everything changed, and
this became one of the best movies I've seen in years The director use
beautifully rendered CGI to deliver the emotions of a struggling young
boy coping with reality. It was already a hard concept that few movie
successfully delivered, and yet he make so many people I know broke
down in tears. Moreover, he also make use of the visual to express the
incredibly complicated yet meaningful plot of the movie, constantly
changing between fantasy and reality, truth and lies, acceptance and
the growing of a boy into adulthood. The main actor while only a young
man has already show signs of greatness, you can only wonder if he had
already gone through all of this. He also actually took the time to
developed each character, making the audiences attach to each and
everyone of them. Which is why the ending was even more dramatic and
sad for many of us And the soundtrack, oh man, the soundtrack just hit
me where it really feels, this is probably the best part of this movie.
Whether it's total silence for contemplation of characters or full- on
orchestral work for the climax or the sad violin, man, they totally
nailed it.
