This movie is creepier than all the SAW flicks put together . . .

. . . and not in any good way. It's as if Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby,
and O.J. Simpson have gotten together to remake THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE.
Writer\Director\Boom Operator Tyler Perry peppers BOO 2 with the N-Word
as he mocks Transgendered Folks, Christians, Wiccans, and Family
Values. Maybe his "Simmons Family" and their three generations of
prostitutes is enough of a lame joke to carry ONE film, but certainly
not 43. A typical sample gag from BOO 2 is Pops Brian Simmons
encouraging his slutty daughter Tiffany--who's dressed so she'd fit
right in on the cover of about half of Mr. Perry's 1980s VHS tape Porno
Collection--to "dance" the "Peeing Dog at a Fire Hydrant," "The
Sprinkler," and "The Toilet Seat." Mr. Perry needs to realize that for
every Human Action, Nature requires an Equal and Opposite Reaction. The
Blue-Man Pict and Green Leprechaun Races offered THEIR versions of BOO
2 just before Humanity was compelled to eradicate them. (When's the
last time that a Blue Dude or a Green Witch plopped down next to YOU at
the theater? Think about it.) BOO 2 very well could become the
provocation that brings a similar Fate Down Upon Perry's People!
