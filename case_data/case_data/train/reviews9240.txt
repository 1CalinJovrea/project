Chappy Watched: How To Train Your Dragon 2

I LOVE the first movie. My favourite animated film, outside of Disney,
of all time and I was worried that this might not hold up to the
original.I was wrong.I'm still in two minds if it is better than the original though.One thing that astounds me is the detail. The effects are absolutely
mind-blowing and very thorough. There are some shots of Toothless where
you can see the detail in his scales, including sometimes dirt and
scars.The original voice cast is back and still awesome, the story is
amazing, the effects are jaw dropping and the score fits with the film
perfectly.This movie has everything in just over 100 minutes; action, adventure,
laughs, tears for every one of all ages.I just have one complaint I DON'T WANNA WAIT JUST OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE NEXT FILM!!!
