Mission ACCOMPOLISHED!

Me and a friend again had the opportunity to see an early screening of
the movie 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation'. One word. Excellent.
Everything about that movie was just perfect! It had the right amount
of every element that would make a movie simply brilliant! This sequel
for me, was definitely the best Mission movie yet. And at the same time
it recalls so many details from the first mission impossible movie. And
most of all the action. WOW. Every action scene in this movie was
breath taking and there will be moments when you would just want to get
up and start clapping. They did a good amount of the stunts without CGI
and that will make you appreciate the action even more. Oh and if you
thought that plane scene in the trailer was crazy, then you are in for
a treat! When it comes to acting, Tom Cruise easily convinces us that
he is a top notch agent of IMF(Impossible Mission Force). This time
every member of the team has something to give in comparison to Ghost
Protocol. Kudos to Simon Pegg for his impeccable timing for humor. And
the villain was perfect! They made the villain perfect for the IMF and
the ending of this movie is so satisfying. One of the few movies where
the ending just pleases you so much. On the whole, Don't miss this
movie!! Seriously.. Don't! It is a movie mean't to be watched by
everyone!
