Keep these two away from each other

The film can't decide whether it's a fish-out-of-water comedy or a
Gothic thriller/romance. Instead, we get treated to a bipolar movie
that is, at times, really funny, but mostly full of unnecessary
exposition. I think Burton wanted to honor the TV show by adding in so
many details, but frankly, it was boring at times as they moved from
one plot point to another. Some of the "wrap up" surprises at the end
came off as forced. Though I'm glad they didn't rely on as much CGI to
create the set pieces, one major scene involving a concert looked like
it was stolen from the Austin Powers films.Johnny Depp did some great physical comedy as well as Helena Bonham
Carter and Jackie Earle Haley, but Dark Shadows should go back to the
grave.
