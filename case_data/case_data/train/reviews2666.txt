I will keep this short

This movie is derivative of several other gross-out movies about
bachelor party shenanigans, full of dopey people doing gross, stupid
things. Penis jokes, male strippers, guzzling booze, doing drugs, all a
a feverish 'isn't this funny?? Isn't it? Isn't it??' by people really
too OLD to be acting so stupid.....Hey, spring break is for the stupid
YOUNGER crowd. It's all wearying and tiresome, been done to death, and
frankly it's just embarrassing. (anyone remember the 'WOOOO! Girls' in
the bar, in the TV show 'How I Met Your Mother'? WOOOOO!) Good lord,
Grow UP!I thought Scarlet Johansson fancied herself a 'serious' actress. It
seems she will take on any random role if she thinks it will make
money. Did she really read the script and think, oh this is box office
GOLD, it will really advance my career!.. Just being associated with
this foolish movie is a really huge step back.
