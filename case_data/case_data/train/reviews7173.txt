Cut and paste story, competent players

This would be a very good straight-to-DVD movie.It's a moderate movie for the big screen.The biggest problem, for me anyway, was that it was packed full of bits
and pieces (tropes or clichés) from other similar movies and that
distracted from the story-telling.The characters aren't well developed but the actors do an OK job with
what they are handed.For some reason a story that starts off with suspense degenerates in to
a bloody shootout (with lost of those tropes an d clichés) and then
leads to an ending which is a bit of a let down as nothing clever
happens - at least not anything that hasn't been done time and time
again.I also wondered why it kept snowing but then was clear and shiny when a
body was to be inspected or staged action needed to take place.
