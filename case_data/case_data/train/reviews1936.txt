Among the worst films I've ever seen.

Caught this movie on TV and I can't remember a movie I enjoyed less.It's so bad, it defies placement in any genre. It's hard to call it a
horror movie when it lacks any suspense or call it torture porn when it
lacks gore. Other things lacking from this film include plot, character
development, and competent acting and scriptwriting.The reviews calling this a character study are way off the mark. Caring
about a character's moral choices requires characters with moral agency
and an audience that's invested in the story enough to care about the
choices made by the characters. These characters are nothing more than
objects to be used in a sadistic fantasy.If you're thinking about watching this movie, don't. There's a long
list of things you'd rather do.
