Wonderful Movie. Laughed the whole way through. Way better than TheHang
over. A Must See. Take your wife or friend they'll Love it. Kline,
Douglas ,Morgan Freeman,and De Niro -- What a crew. The 2000's Rat
Pack. We are all still the quoting the movie lines. Not just for the
older audiences. I saw many young college students laughing there butts
off. Smooth story with frequent laughs. If a critic rated this Bad, I
will not give heed to another of his or her reviews. By the way: Mary
Steenburgen is beautiful. Last Vegas is an entertaining movie with a
lot of truthfulness, and it gives all of its actors - all legends and
Oscar winners - real moments to dig in and play something amazing .
