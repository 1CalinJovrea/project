Is IMDb an instrument to promote bad movies?

The IMDb rating of this terrible movie is still 6/7. How is this
possible? It looks to me that some PR-agencies undermining the
credibility of IMDb. I cannot take the IMDb rating serious any longer.
This is a bad way to promote movies and IMDb should not be part of
this.The plot is rather stupid. It reminded me of some cheap Indian gangster
movies where a beautiful lady is kidnapped by some wild looking
culprits and when it looks that the desperate lady will be raped and
murdered, suddenly a hero jumps out behind a bush that weren't even
there a minute before. I love well written sf-movies. This b-movie
isn't one of it. One of the worst movies this year. I regret the time I
wasted watching it. The IMDb rating for this movie should be 4/6
!!!!!!!!!!
