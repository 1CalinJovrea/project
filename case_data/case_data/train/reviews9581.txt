Money for Old Rope

As a fan of Marvel movies I was excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy.
However, this movie failed on several levels.It is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny. I genuinely
laughed once. Furthermore, one 'joke' was weirdly inappropriate.The story is completely generic. It seems like they just needed some
story, any story, as a vehicle for the characters to get together and
try to be funny.I wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big set-piece
ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out.
This was done in the Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness. To me, it's
like directors have to have this '9/11' shot in every movie (big thing
crashes into buildings) and it has to stop. It's boring now.The only positive about this movie was the special effects and space
backgrounds.It seems that Marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for
any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent
soundtrack. I will approach the next Marvel with extreme caution, and I
will not see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
