A far cry from the first 300

I can't understand why Zack Snyder didn't direct this sequel, and how
someone who has never directed an action sequence before and just one
feature film can be entrusted with a production of this magnitude. That
would already be a recipe for disaster, even though in reality Snyder
was supervising.In an attempt to live up to it's predecessor, 300: Rise of An Empire is
action-packed, presents impressive visuals and is very bloody. In fact
there is more action, more blood, and more nudity than in the original
300. As for the plot, there really isn't much to chew on. A naval
commander, Themistocles is supposedly trying to reunite Greece. Since
the story takes place before, during and after King Leonidas leads his
men to fight the Persians, it can be hard to follow at times. Most of the acting was mediocre and couldn't quite compensate for the
weaknesses in the story. The Australian actor cast as Themistocles in
my opinion was a very bad choice, and comes nowhere close to what
Gerard Butler did as King Leonidas in 300. He just doesn't bring that
rugged heroic presence on screen as is expected. Interestingly I read
somewhere that director Noam Murro insisted it would be Sullivan
Stapleton who played this character, claiming he was 'the one'. Eva
Green on the other hand is plays an excellent villain as Artemisia.
