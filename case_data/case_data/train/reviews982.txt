Sad

Tolkien's works mean a great deal to me. I spent my childhood reading
and rereading The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and whatever else I
could get my hands on published posthumously. The Hobbit is a gentle
story. Bilbo, with some help from Gandalf and the Dwarfs, is able to
accomplish amazing things, despite his small size, because of his luck,
wits, and strength of character. The other characteristic of the book
is the vastness, diversity, and beauty of the world, filling one with
curiosity for what is just around the corner, but also taking just
enough time to linger a while in every place.These Hobbit movies don't linger, characters and scenes are abridged in
all the wrong places in order to make time for pervasive and repetitive
chase scenes. Even where there isn't a chase scene, they are added.
Jackson seems to have taken every scene in the book and asked the
question "how can I make this into a battle/chase scene?" Bilbo's power
and strengths, are greatly usurped in this film by the intervention of
Legolas saving the day each time. Beorn is truncated. The magic and
mystery of Mirkwood is particularly lacking. The gentle escape from the
elves in the barrels is turned into a farce obviously designed to tie
in with a future theme park ride.Don't see the films nor allow children to see them before reading the
books. You should exercise your brains and imagination, creating the
images yourself, rather than letting someone else imagine for you,
causing you to be stuck with the images from these mediocre films.Jackson seems to know nothing of the poetry of the book, of
mythological archetypes, language and history, nor the unique, gentle
fantastic quality of Tolkien's work. Its very sad.
