Some great atmosphere, but story of clueless, narcissistic folk singer, really isn't worth telling

The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their
movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full.
'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual
excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat
recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for
your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing
above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what
they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark
side of Americana; applaud us.' The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one
dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional
Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van
Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so
narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so
that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic,
like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life.
But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be
immortalized in film? I hardly think so. The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn
Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is
devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's
internal demonÂ— which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and
narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so
that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead,
we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable
mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in
the folk music world of the early 60s. Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen
brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy
is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of
Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel
precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide;
he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to
carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of
their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the
abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous
girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the
way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his
latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial
potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten
up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately,
sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of
atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one
involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who
is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked
the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in
Greenwich Village.Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional'
critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful
reviews in the review section of IMDb. There, at least, is a sense that
Llewyn Davis is not a believable character and if by chance, such
misanthropes truly exist in real life, their journeys are certainly not
worth being looked at, given the lack of change or growth. If you like
a straw man, Llewyn Davis is for you. The Coen brothers are experts at
shooting straw men down--but such a maneuver should never bring praise
and accolades; that's reserved only for the gullible!
