An amazing visual experience lacking good plot and storytelling

Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a movie adaptation of
Ransom Riggs' bestselling novel by the same name.The movie follows
Jake's adventure as he unfolds the mystery behind his grandpa's stories
and learns his own peculiarity.It was directed by Tim Burton-the master of creating stunning visual
films and kind of grotesque yet likable plots and characters.Just the
first seconds of this film show that it was directed by Burton;it's
beautiful and sort of airy,with a vibe of a dark fairy tale.Even trough the visuals were stunning,everything else,well,was
average.The plot,storytelling,characters,ending-everything.What i
really liked about Ransom Riggs' novel was the details that make the
characters:their past,their adventure in finding themselves and
accepting their peculiarities,their relationship and views of the world
etc.In the movie adaptation the characters are plain and lifeless,they
don't have a backstory of any sort and they are reduced to only their
peculiarities.The biggest thing that buged me about the characters is
that they are drastically changed and not anything alike those from the
book;we're talking about changed ages,looks,names and
peculiarities.So,if you really liked the book and it's characters,you
will probably be disappointed with these ones.There are huge plot holes and errors in story telling.It feels rushed
and underdeveloped,expesily the ending,which was the biggest
disappointment for me.The actors did a good job at portraying the characters,all except Asa
Butterfield who portrayed the main character,Jake Portman.It felt
forced and i didn't feel he did his best in portraying his character.So,in conclusion:if you just want to feast your eyes on something
pretty and couldn't care less about anything else,watch this movie.
