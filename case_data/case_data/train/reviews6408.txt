Man! That was strange.

So strange it's hard to say weather it's good or bad, it's just weird. 

Then again, it's a really good weird because you know, Giant monsters 

are in it. You can never go wrong with the Kaiju as they are known in 

Japan and not Korea where the Giant monsters end up in Colossal.



Anne Hathaway plays a woman who comes back home after being kicked in 

the face not wrongly by life and reconnects with her old friend, played 

by Jason Sudeikis, and while home she discovers the oddest thing. At 

8:05am every day if she's standing in the park next to her old 

elementary school a Giant monster will appear in Seoul Korea that she 

is somehow linked to.



It's like being John Malkovich meets Godzilla or something.



Once again Jason Sudeikis is the money maker for me, proving that he's 

got some real star power. It was a brilliant turn as a man whose life 

got stuck and watching someone else like Anne Hathaway's character live 

her's despite failing badly at it, leaves him with a bitterness that he 

cannot hide for long. As Oscar, Sudeikis was just a very unique 

character to watch on the screen.



Despite the plot about Giant Monsters hitting the far East, which 

really put this movie out there, Colossal has going for it a very 

grounded story about being away for something for so long that you 

forgotten why you tried so hard to avoid it, then realizing exactly why 

you did. It's a lesson on getting over the things that cause self abuse 

and hold you down. A very loud and clear lesson done in the strangest 

way possible.
