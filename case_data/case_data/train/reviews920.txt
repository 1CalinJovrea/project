Quick and to the pointless..

Just a quick example to summarise my impressions of this awful
nonsense.Any film where you find yourself inadvertently shouting "die" at the
screen, right at the point when the whole cinema goes silent as you
wait to see which of the irritating guys the painful Witherspoon will
run to to dodge the flying car, hasn't really captured you in its
magic.Predictable, irritating, poorly acted and unbelievable. I actually only
laughed at the peripheral actors - the CIA guys working around the
edges seemed to remember it was okay to actually be funny in a romcom.
