Why was this movie made?

I'm sitting in the nearly vacant theater on premiere night and thinking
somewhere there must be a struggling movie maker pondering how
Hollywood could pump millions into this pedestrian cartoon babble and
not into his or her creation? If you feel like you have to see this
movie I have four suggestions: 1) pop in any CD of Back to the Barnyard
and watch 3 episodes, 2) pop in any Penguins of Madagascar CD or its
variants, 3) watch the Croods, but with the sound off, or 4) bang your
head against the wall with medium impact for 1 1/2 hours. The best
thing about this movie was the short running time, even with the
pressure these days to fill and expand movie lengths this was so spare
to begin with that they had no place else to go. One other alternative
is to watch the trailer 100 times. My son just barely made it through,
he gave it a 6 1/2 on the way out. Most of the (unintelligible) lines
are in Minion gibberish, maybe this was a good thing? I mean it when I
say pass 'em by.
