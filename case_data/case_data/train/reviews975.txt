If you were ever bullied as a kid...this movie is for you

Other reviews for this movie (from "professional" reviewers) all point
out how shallow this movie is when it comes to showing the feelings
Paul is having at the various things that happen to him throughout his
life. This may very well be the case. But this movie was not made to be
a Doctoral Thesis on the effects of bullying. Rather, it was made to
show how, once a young man becomes a coward in his youth, it is almost
impossible to overcome later in life. The scene in the alley (when the
chick comes to his rescue with the guitar) shows how, as an adult, Paul
could only get the barest semblance of rage at his life-long tormentor,
even though he had all the reason in the world to go ballistic. After
losing his voice, he was unwilling to take a chance at being ridiculed
by an audience, so he almost didn't even fill-in the form for Britain's
Got Talent. He almost didn't go on stage (several times). There must be a lot of kids getting bullied in England for their love
of opera. Just this year, there was another case -- Lucy Kay -- who
went through the same torture. She finished second, and has been signed
by Simon Cowell personally for one of his labels.Yes, this movie will not win an Oscar -- or even play in any American
theaters -- but you need to see it. If you bullied fellow school mates
when you were young, you might want to go find those now-grown-up kids
and apologize. If you were bullied, this movie will inspire you.
