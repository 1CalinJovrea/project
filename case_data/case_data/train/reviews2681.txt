The best Indian satire movie till date

Till yesterday, the benchmark for the best Hindi movie was 3 Idiots.
But after watching PK, I would say that the benchmark should be
changed. The same team that brought 3 Idiots has brought another
magnificent movie. Everyone in the movie acted exceptionally well. The
manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. If we see
the comedy aspects alone, 3 idiots is better. But if we see the social
issues taken, PK is far better than the other movie. This is Aamir's
best performance till date. Ranbir Kapoor comes in a comical guest
role. Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput and Saurabh Shukla are the
other main characters.Overall rating- 9.5/10
