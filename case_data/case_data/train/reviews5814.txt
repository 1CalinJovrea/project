Its a shame Vin Diesel is so hard up......

I watched the other XXX films and really enjoyed them. Yes you know its
going to be a 'daft' movie and not something to take seriously.. a bit
of fun. Something to turn your brain off to watch.With this movie you would need to remove your brain to watch. Its just
to stupid for words. I have not seen this silly kind of kung-fu action
in ages and its so dated now. Its something you would have watched back
in the 80's and even then it was laughable.We all know these action figures do the impossible and survive but
these people can put super heroes to shame just like in the latest fast
and the furious its gone to far and we now have superheros instead of
just heroes. I think if this trend continues instead of Tom Cruise
dangling from ropes in mission impossible he could just hover there
instead.Also what is with all the scantly dresses women all over the place and
some parts I thought I was watching some soft porn movie rather than an
action movie. I am a red blooded male and love women as much as any man
but come on do we need it rammed down our throats all the time its
cheesy, sleazy and not needed and getting very boring.I could only think Vin Diesel who I enjoy watching in movies such as
the first fast and furious movies (before they got silly) and stuff
live pitch black has got desperate for some money to be in this.
