HATED this movie.Slow, poor acting and writing.

I was stuck for a film to see today so thought I'd go for this as had
seen some good reviews.I was wary as I really don't think Mark Whalberg is a good actor. He's
not had professional training and it shows in my opinion, in all his
films I've seen. He lacks emotional depth and it's almost acting by
numbers. People who just 'turn to' acting do not have the necessary
foundation skills to craft and hone over time as they've not studied it
professionally. I know some people will disagree with my comments.I could not empathise or sympathise with ANY of these characters. The
story is based in the drugs culture with Whalberg's character almost
glamorising drug/money smuggling. Certainly no moral ethics are seen
here. I couldn't have cared less if his wife got buried in concrete in
a plastic bag with her mobile phone to be honest. How can you
sympathise with characters who are so caught up in their needs being
met through a life of crime without even thinking of the impact of
their behaviours and actions on others? Whalberg appears very bored
right the way through. I don't know if anyone saw him on the Graham
Norton show, but he said he was tired and couldn't be bothered on that
too and it showed. Perhaps he needs to retire now? The rest of the cast
were very average. The direction was unremarkable as were the action
scenes.I came out of the cinema just as the credits started to roll and felt
angry that I'd sat through something which ultimately gave the message
that drug crime pays. Try telling that to those of us who have or have
had relatives who are hooked on the stuff and the shear hell it causes
everyone else around them.Hated this film with avengence.
