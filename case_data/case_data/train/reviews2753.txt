Much more than a horror film

While "The Babadook" may display some of the hallmarks of the
traditional horror film, there's a lot more going on here than meets
the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly
satired in "Cabin in the Woods," this film's characters are layered,
its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its
conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those
filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you're a film
lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.Director Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to
grasp: that our biggest fear isn't of crazy killers or monsters or
ghosts, but of ourselvesÂ—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to
live with, the illusory veil of self-control. The plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls
off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one
film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends.
Really, don't even watch the trailer.Just know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis
delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with
total commitment and credibility. Kent's storytelling is utterly
absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what's real and
what's not that you can never be sure of yourself. What you make of "The Babadook" will depend on who you are. You might
take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant
threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an
attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You
might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss.
The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make
sense of it yourself.Personally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both
because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely
mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it's scary. But it's also
touching and heartbreaking. While "The Babadook" belongs alongside
other great psychological horror films, like "The Innocents" and "The
Haunting" (1963), to classify it purely as "horror" really belittles
its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss
issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality.
