Thank You! A Must See!

All I can say is Thank You!!! This is what I want to see when I go to
the movies looking to enjoy a good summer blockbuster!!! Man, talk
about a fun ride. It was humorous, exciting, thrilling, suspenseful,
and well worth the price of admission.Tom Cruise really gets it when it comes to entertaining your average
moviegoer and he doesn't disappoint. But the truth is, no one
disappoints in this summer flick. All parties brought their 'A' game
and played their part perfectly. The female lead (Rebecca Ferguson)
really held her own alongside Ethan Hunt and the crew and hopefully
we'll see her in future installments, if there is more. Based on this
current installment, there should definitely be more.MI:1 is a classic in my eyes and I've watched it countless times, but I
must say, Rogue Nation...well, it's a lot more fun and I do feel it is
a better film overall. I will be watching this one again and again. And
don't wait for it to come to video...this is a movie you must see in
theaters for the full experience.Also, let me just say the stunt sequences are thrilling...thrilling I
say!! Very limited CGI in this film, which made the action scenes even
more exciting and dare I say it again...thrilling! Lots of gasp worthy
moments.I won't give away any spoilers as that would ruin the exciting action
sequences and fun twists. This is enjoyable from beginning to end. So
just go see it!!!
