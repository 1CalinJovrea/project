Where do I go to get back my 140 minutes and $10.50?

If there is a more clich√©-ridden film of the last 20 years, I'm not
sure I know what it is. This was predictable crap from beginning to
end. You know what it really is? It's a stealth chick flick, and a
horrible one at that... just like Cianfranco's last "masterpiece,"
"Blue Valentine." That vapid piece of banality stretched my patience to
the breaking point. "Pines" found that breaking point and chopped it up
into tiny pieces. How dare he waste my time like that!!!Oh sure, Cianfranco is commenting on the "sins of the fathers" motif,
right down to showing the heart throb/cycling daredevil/bank robber's"
baby being baptized. But the sin never washed off... of either son. The
cop-lawyer ends up with Vinny Barbarino for a kid, and the biker ends
up with Kurt Cobain. Of course, you knew they would meet up and the
sparks would fly. And they did as expected. Actually, I half expected
to see Ray Liotta's kid waiting for both Kurt and the cop/attorney in
that forest, so he could take revenge on both idiots. I was hoping Kurt
would kill Vinny, kill his father, burn down the house, blow up the
neighborhood, and deliver the coup d' grace to himself. Then, you would
have had a film ending worthy of Sergio Leone. But, no such luck.I will remember who Cianfranco is now and avoid his work like it was
nuclear waste.
