An Exceptional Surprise

I'm not a huge fan of mockumentaries. They've been so overdone. Ditto
vampire films. I've also not really into "Flight of the Conchords" so
when this went on, I was only half paying it any attention.I'm telling you all this so you'll understand when I say I loved this.
I wasn't expecting to, but I found myself recommending it to everyone
who would listen. Now it's your turn.If you enjoy Eddie Izzard monologues, then imagine one come to life. In
this film you'll get to see how vampires do the vacuuming, how vampires
eat chips and why vampires put newspaper down when entertaining a
guest.All the cast look like they are having great fun, and I loved Rhys
Darby as a very responsible werewolf, making sure all the members of
his pack are wearing stretchy pants on the night of the full moon.Deducting one point for lack of originality, but other than that I
can't fault this. Terrific fun.
