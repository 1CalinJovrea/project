Patriots Day (@cmp_moviereviews)

Special skill and genuine care is required when dramatizing a tragic,
yet iconic event in our nations history. "Patriots Day" rises to the
challenge and exceeds in nearly every way. Director, Peter Berg, and
the rest of his crew manage to recreate these events by remembering the
fallen, and honoring those who came together during this act of
violence and terror. Effective storytelling, solid casting, heart
racing tension, and survivor interviews make this film stand out above
many others released this year. #patriotsday
