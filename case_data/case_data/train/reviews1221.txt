Basic jump-scare flick, nothing more

Lights Out doesn't break any new ground, nor does it really attempt to.
81 minutes of PG-13 jump scares and basic horror tropes in the vein of
The Grudge. Not bad for a summer fright fest, but don't expect more as
you won't find it here. Technically it looked and sounded great, with a
notable crazy-mom performance from Maria Bello. If you've seen the director's original short you've basically seen this
movie already, however if you're looking for a quick scare without a
lot of substance this should do the trick. For a good storyline with
stylish direction look elsewhere, as the missed opportunities pile up
rather quickly with this one.
