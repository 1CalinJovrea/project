Del Toro did it again

Just for the record, i'm not a fan of horror movies. The only reason i
watched Crimson Peak was the director: Guillermo Del Toro. His previous
movies showed that he is a genius whose mind is filled with creativity,
moreover he is able to turn his visions into reality. He has a great
sense to create unique worlds and his ability to balance CGI and
practical effects makes these worlds more existing.I was terrified and amazed at the same time. Visually this movie is
unexceptional, i wanted to carefully examine every piece of it, but the
scary theme didn't "allow" me to immerse deep in this visual beauty for
too long. The tension was built up well and constant fear of the
unknown was in the air all the time. Music was a very good "wingman" of
the thrill and well-timed sound effects added even more to the overall
experience.Many famous trademarks of Del Toro were smuggled into the events
successfully. The sets, make ups, costumes looked amazing, but (for me)
the most impressing was the creative use of colours. The external and
internal design of the house ensured a perfect environment for the
creepy atmosphere. This atmosphere was the major element that
captivated me from the beginning till the end. That thrill that carried
me through the movie is hard to describe. I was under the influence of
fear and anxiety, so all elements were in the right place to make your
heart beat faster.Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska were great, but Jessica Chastain was
clearly the one who almost stole the whole show. Her character was
cold, seductive, mysterious and scary at the same time. I couldn't even
decide whether to love or hate her.All in all, Crimson Peak is another masterpiece of Del Toro. I
recommend this movie even for those who don't like horror movies,
because this is one of the few that offers much more than jump scares
and unimaginative stories.
