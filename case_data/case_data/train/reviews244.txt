The definition of Awful

I know it is too late to warn you not to go see this movie. But still,
I am writing this review to express my disappointment, and to say I
have no idea why this movie can be rate 7+ here. There must be
something wrong.I am a big fan of Keanu. And I do not mind action movie with simple
plot, as long as it looks cool. Nevertheless, I was brought down big
time. The plot is unbelievably ridiculous. It will leave you amazed,
wondering if whether someone pro-read the script before they made it a
movie. No twist, no surprise, no character development, nothing
thrilling or exciting whatsoever. It is utter boredom. I felt
intelligently insulted, to be honest. And the action does not look cool either. Seriously, if you expect
something like, let's say, Taken, you will be massively disappointed.
John Wick does not really fight. He shots randomly, move randomly, and
grunts, and moans. Nothing else. Everything cool about him is what you
heard the others say before the fighting starts.I hope this review can actually reach someone, and help to stop them
from wasting their time watching this movie. I genuinely do.
