When did Tim Burton decide to abandon story telling?

It's official. For a number of years now it's been suspected that Tim
Burton had lost his love for story telling and this film just confirms
it. There exists no story whatsoever in this film, which is an
achievement considering it is based on a best selling novel with a
coherent story. For me this film was made just so Burton could live out
his fantasy of recreating Ray Harryhousen's famous stop motion
skeletons. Which he does badly, and to an odd ambient trance soundtrack
so out of place it made the Mad Hatter disco dance in his awful Alice
film look like art. The acting is awful considering the talent at his
disposal, the exposition is so clunky and the dialogue so stilted I
feel sorry for the actors. You can really tell Burton just didn't give
a rats ass about giving any direction to them. Which would have made
sense had the visuals been fantastic, but no, they were clich√©d, old
and tired. Tim, please, retire with whatever dignity you have left. I
felt like I needed a shower after this film.
