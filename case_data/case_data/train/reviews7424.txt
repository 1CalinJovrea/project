The real title should be "Tom Hanks is a hero, once more"

If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be
sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen
name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance)
who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the
East-Germans.A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and
arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants.
His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly
unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his
one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script).The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little
man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was
supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats "Would it help
if I worry?" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather
dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student,
getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at
home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine.The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better
off minding their own business. However, this sound unrealistic, so the
moral is that American heroes (especially Tom Hanks) always save the
day. Mind the overbearing soundtrack that seems to come straight out
"Saving private Ryan"
