An unconventional comedy . . .

EVERYONE in this movie has is repressing their 'dressed roles' and
desires an alternate life. Little Hours is more than the antics of foul
mouthed nun trio. It is a modern comedy set in 13th century. And what a
refreshing modern comedy it is.The charm of the humour in the movie is that the situations everyone
find themselves in. The comedy is less about what is actually being
said but the extreme hypocrisy of what we preach against our true
desires. Events mostly take place at a convent but religion is never
the central message. Little Hours rather exposes crudity of humanity
under the neat veils & robes.None of the acting is really Oscar worthy; they appear almost
amateur-like and that is part of the charm. Music in simple and
un-intrusive. Story is straight forward but contains pleasant
surprises.Little Hours is not, and probably not intended to be, for general
audience. If you like Lost in Translation, Life Aquatic, Nacho Libre,
etc., you will love this movie. If you are offended by the religious
contents (or lack thereof) in this movie, I recommend watching
'Spotlight' first.
