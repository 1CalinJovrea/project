I'm entertained

I already watch Zach Galifianakis's films before like Hangover, Due
Date and I laughed out loud. Compared to those films, Keeping Up with
the Joneses doesn't make me that laughed out loud like the other films
did. But I really like the act from Zach Galifianakis. He has a comedy
sense that get me. Also Gal Gadot plays made me cant take off my eyes
of her. She is just amazing and good at being spy and good at shooting.
The plot is very good, the comedy is not very hard funny but still
entertaining to watch at your home. summary I'm entertained of this
film.
