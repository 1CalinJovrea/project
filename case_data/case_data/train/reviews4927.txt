An amazing comedy drama!!

For all Jennifer Aniston fans out there, here is an amazing comedy
drama movie with a great storyline. The direction is amazing as it
character development is at a proper pace. A drug dealer makes a fake
family to transfer drugs from Mexico all the way to his hometown. It is
one of those movies which make you feel delighted. For people who loved
FRIENDS, there is a surprise at the end of movie. But do watch the
whole movie before jumping to the end. It is amazing to see that
Jennifer Aniston despite being over 45 is still amazingly gorgeous. It
is one of her most popular movies and is one of those movies where she
plays a leading role unlike Horrible Bosses.
