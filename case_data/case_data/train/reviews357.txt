Masterful In Craft & Rich In Experience, But Dreary In Nature

To this day, Martin Scorsese remains my all-time favourite director, a
man whose approach to cinema completely differs to others in Hollywood,
his appreciation towards cinema as an art form is his finest quality in
what makes him arguably the greatest film director around. With
'Silence' promoted as Scorsese's 20-year passion project, it was a film
I couldn't resist seeing, the legend back behind the camera focusing on
a subject not fully studied in cinema, a subject that's mostly
misunderstood.I want to start with my conclusion and go from there. 'Silence' won't
be everybody's film, the same way other ambitious films like 'The
Revenant' or 'The Tree of Life' weren't, however despite my respect to
Scorsese's mastery and level of detail, in my own honest opinion I
believe this film fell short due to the lack of insight into it's main
theme and thus instead transformed into a slow and somewhat dreary tale
that arguably didn't need it's near 3-hour running time to tell its
tale.Now don't get me wrong, in regards to the film's craft it is a
masterpiece, the cinematography is raw and epic, the direction from
Scorsese is phenomenal and the set design is gorgeous. Accompanying
this are a series of fine performances, most notably from Andrew
Garfield who should receive monumental praise for his role, I haven't
seen such a visceral performance in years, the raw emotion is uncanny.
But unfortunately the technicalities and craft can't cover up the flaws
that lie in the running time and the tediously slow plot that didn't
want to end.If there's anything I can leave you with from this review to help you
decide as to whether it's a worthy watch or not, let me just say this:
'Silence' isn't a piece of entertainment, it's instead an experience;
and whilst a technically masterful one at that, many audience members
may find themselves slowly drifting off to sleep - as my neighbour in
the cinema did. It isn't really a case of liking it or disliking it,
it's more a case of the adventure, and despite my partial
disappointment with it, the adventure was more than worthy enough for
the viewing. Scorsese is still an exquisite auteur, flaws or not.
