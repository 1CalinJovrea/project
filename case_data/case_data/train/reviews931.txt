Ignorance is bliss?

I shouldn't be really judging this movie as I've only seen the trailer.
And yes I can buy the usual aggressive shark thing. Or even the
impossible way the iron cable snaps UNDERWATER. But come on, at least
keep a minimum of diving reality into check when making the movie. Not
talking about nitrogen narcosis that the two girls would have for
sure...but they are diving with 10-12L recreational tanks and they are
beginners. At 47 meters of depth, with the fear from the situation, the
air in those tanks would last less than 10 minutes, not one hour...
