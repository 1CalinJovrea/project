It's awful...

I cannot believe that this tripe has 8.5. I was unfortunate enough to
to see it!!The acting is terrible, probably the worst I've ever seen.The film is
silly and frankly ridiculous.The worst thing in the entire movie was in the scene inside the Anne
Franks home when they kissed for the first time after a long, tough
climb for who never seemed to end. Not only was it really predictable
that they would kiss but...oh my god... then the tourists started to
clap...why? Because they kissed inside Anne Franks home? They didn't
know that they had cancer... Don't get me wrong..I wanted to leave the
cinema after ten minutes so unfortunately it's not the only scene that
is bad. If this doesn't get you to skip this film I don't know what will...
