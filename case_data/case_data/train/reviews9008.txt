Emotional zombie movie

This has to be one of the finest zombie and horror films in general I
have ever seen. Extremely thrilling and captivating from start to
finish. Everything in this film has done with passion and care. From
the characters and heartbreaking moments they go through, visceral
zombie attacks, acting and camera work down to dialogue. Everything
works great. This is what World War Z should and could have been. Sure
the plot of the film is not original, because yet again we are shown
the struggle and survival of people during zombie pandemic, but the way
the story is approached and executed is beyond most of the average
mainstream horror movies we get these days. If you are a fan of zombie
films you will definitely enjoy this horror gem.
