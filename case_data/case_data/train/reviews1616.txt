Entertaining but forgettable popcorn movie....horrendous Star Wars movie

Under Disney ownership and with hacks such as JJ Abrams (with creative
input from Simon Pegg...God help us) at the helm now, unfortunately
Star Wars has been reduced to yet another Transformers/Marvel mindless
action, zero plot franchise designed purely to reach the widest
possible audience. The legacy of the iconic characters of the OT
(particularly Luke) have been reduced to the point of them being almost
unrecognizable losers. The previous six film story arc has been
completely undermined to say the least and the mystique and nature of
the Force simplified, dumbed down and instant.The endless coincidences, JJs nonsensical, deus ex machina story,
riddled with plot holes, absurd pacing and editing (which explains John
Williams difficulty to nail the score), lack of character
development/backstory, so on and so on. The bastardization of SW
universe laws and the basic fact that this was supposed to be Episode
VII in a seamless saga, but instead we were coned and sold a
forgettable reboot was utterly unforgivable. But alas it's a huge
commercial hit and the mob sing its praises. But without Lucas, it's
just spaceships and lasers.
