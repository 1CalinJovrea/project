9
Best combo ActionThrillerCrimeDrama I have seen all year

Believe all the reviews this movie is best of the year action hands
down! I am going to see Bone Tomahawk after this. And if you liked A
History of Violence you would love this! I wont be surprised the 7.5
rating as at the time of my review by the 40+ reviewers ahead of me
shoots up to 8 or even 9 by the time a hundred reviews and more stream
in. Vince Vaughan deserves an award for his role here. Only reason I
gave 9 out of 10 to the movie was the way it ended. It wasn't bad, just
I wished for an alternative ending(personal opinion) Wish there were
more movies of this kind somewhere I could find and watch.
