So, There's Yet Another Eastwood Heartthrob!

And I don't think it's going to take any time at all for this hunk to
be completely and absolutely known only for his own looks, talent, and
fame rather than having the fact that he's Clint Eastwood's son being
tacked on. Scott is good! Britt Robertson was nicely cast as Sophia,
except I have to admit here that I kept seeing a young Renee Zellweger
in the partÂ– before the silly plastic surgery turned her into a total
stranger. Or just strange. Whatever. Jack Huston was excellent as a
young Ira and I think portraying the elderly Ira is one of Alan Alda's
best roles. I was just expecting the usual chick flick - but not so.
Rugged enough action with the bull riding to interest any guy, as well
as a decent plot and all around good acting. To sum it up, this is a
nicely done film and one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
