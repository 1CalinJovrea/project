I want a refund!

By far the worst movie I've seen in the theater in years. After about 5
to 10 minutes into the movie, I started thinking, oh, this is real bad.
Alright, I'll give it a little time. Then the scene comes where his
wife gets shot, and I'm checking my watch thinking, can I just get out
of here. Later on when he has a gun in front of him on the table,
implying he's suicidal, I was thinking, please just shoot yourself in
the head and end this movie. The script sucked, the directing sucked
and all the acting sucked with the exception of Forest Whitaker, but
even he couldn't save this movie. I hated the lead character. Rocky
would have kicked this guy's ass! I left before it ended, I was just so
sick of the crap. I want a refund. I wanted to throw rotten tomatoes at
the screen. OK, I'm done venting. LOL
