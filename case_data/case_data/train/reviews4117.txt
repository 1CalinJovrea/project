Typical characters with an average and predicable story

I'm a big fan of Romantic movies and the odd cringey film but i found
this so typical and predictable. For the first time ever even i managed
to predict the end which wasn't worth the build up created by the rest
of the film. During scenes that were supposed to be emotional and sad i
found myself laughing at how unrealistic they were.The cast is slightly confusing. Maybe i can believe that the younger
Amanda grows up to be Michelle Monaghan but i don't understand the
thinking behind Young Dawson and James Marsden. Not only do they look
nothing alike but Young Dawson doesn't even look young enough to be
with Young Amanda.I found myself much preferring the scenes with the young Dawson and
Amanda in comparison with the older cast because i just found them so
annoying. Michelle Monaghan's character seemed far to perfect with the
typical problems with her perfect life.Being the only two people in the cinema at the time, myself and my
friend should have taken this as a hint. This is definitely no Notebook
or Walk to remember.
