Pure awesome for fans of the show..others?  Well we'll see about that

It was pretty much what I expected; a longer version of one of the TV
episodes, which is fine with me since that's really all it's meant to
be. The songs were all very good, but the one done by Tempest really
stood out to me. The new animation used in the film was absolutely
beautiful. A true step up from the flash animation. All of the
characters had their moments, from Pinkie Pie's party canon to
Fluttershy telling one of the big baddies "You seem tense. Do you want
to talk about it?" Rarity is absolutely adorable with her meltdown
proclaiming "The bad guys have won!" Rainbow Dash's sonic rainboom
looks awesome with the new animation. The storm king seemed more like
an afterthought than a real villain with Tempest playing the biggest
role on the bad guys side. Extremely well done animation and voice
acting. Fans of the show will love it, but it will not get many new
fans. I would say a rock solid movie effort well worth another one in
the future.
