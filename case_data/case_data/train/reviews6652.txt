The real event more interesting than the movie

The problem with the movie "Sully" is that it's about 208 seconds of
action, and we all know in advance that he successfully landed the
plane with no loss of life. The movie starts off by telling the
audience that. So the only 'tension' in the movie is whether Capt.
Sully is going to go from hero to villain if it's decided by the
accident investigators that his decision to go for the Hudson rather
than one of the nearby airports was the safer decision or not.Unfortunately, because the movie is based on Sully's own version of
events, it looks at the everything from his point of view alone. If
there was some background provided for some of the passengers, the
audience might be a little more invested in the survival of everyone
onboard. The movie's just over 90 minutes long, basically because there wasn't
enough to pad it out any further. It's well acted, but that's the only
thing going for it. The real event was much more thrilling.
