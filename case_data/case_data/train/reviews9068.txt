The most sci-fi enjoyment I have had for a long time.

Oblivion  The most sci-fi enjoyment I have had for a long time.
Elegant, internally consistent with an incredible of attention to
detail. The story was compelling and very well thought out. The masses
may not like this movie much . but there are quite a few aspects of
movie artistry brought together in one package. The blending of cgi and
live was superb. The acting fit close to perfectly. The cinematography
was excellent.It would have been interesting if the "villain" side of the story could
have been developed more.The twists are fairly obvious, but they are developed in such a
compelling way that it doesn't really matter.
