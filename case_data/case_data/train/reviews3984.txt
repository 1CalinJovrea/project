It was different

Well this movie is like a game. Watching this movie is like watching a
kid playing one level of video game. But you're watching this during
1.5 hours.During first 15 minutes of the movie I had only one thought in my mind:
"what a hell is this?"There is no plot, no catchy story like in previous parts. Here you have
several blocks and a lot of stupid shooting and fighting without a hint
to be a bit realistic. The final fight is like a raping of your mind -
too much FX's, too less reality and common sense, it's against
everything good in the world.Actors are great. After a deadly injury a character doesn't show any
sight of the pain except in his words.Dialogs in the movie are fantastic If you'll write down all the lines
of all characters, you'll hardly fill 1.5 pages A4 size.Watching this movie a felt like I'm fooled - creators didn't want to
work to make it interesting, they used CGI+FX+fighting+shooting without
everything else that makes movie worthwhile, and sold it to me using a
bright wrap.People were leaving the movie theatre in the middle of this picture.Hope next movie will be much better.
