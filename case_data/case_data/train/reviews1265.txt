This is One Great Godzilla Movie!

Being a fan who used to go to the movie theater in the 1960's to watch
all those great (and cheesy) Godzilla movies. This new Godzilla movie
is the Godzilla movie I have been waiting my whole life for. Not that
1998 SonyZilla that was so disappointing. But this movie, I know that
all the long time fan's like myself will watch it over on over again. I
will go back to the movies next week to see it again. Can't wait for
the Blu- ray. I honestly do not see what all the haters of this movie
are thinking. It's a Monster movie. Plain and simple. For 2 hours I was
entertained. I went today to the IMAX with two good friends and their
son's and we all liked the movie. No spoilers here so I will not
discuss what happens in the movie but I was surprised by a few things.
But that is what Gareth Edwards wanted. Why disagree. This movie kept
me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. When GODZILLA shows up I
just have one word. AWESOME! This is the Godzilla, all of us long time
fans have been waiting for. And the MUTO's are really cool too. It must
me sad to go to the movies and come out mad all the time. GO SEE THIS
MOVIE. Any REAL FAN of GODZILLA will enjoy this movie and THE EFFORT IT
TOOK TO MAKE IT. I cannot wait to see it again. LONG LIVE GODZILLA,
KING OF THE MONSTERS!
