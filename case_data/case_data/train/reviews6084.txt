Horrible Remake

There was so much cut from this movie that it just seems poorly edited
and mismatched. Chloe is no Carrie, for one she is too beautiful to be
Carrie. I couldn't believe that they would have cast someone that
beautiful for the role of Carrie. Carrie was always odd looking or had
an odd look about her, Chloe was miscast. The characters were boring
and flat. I felt that Chris, was supposed to always be a vindictive
mean cold hearted girl, but in this movie, she seemed nicer and not
much cold hearted at all. I couldn't believe how they could say this
was better than the original, when it wasn't even as scary or creepy as
the original. This faded so far from the book and original story line
that it all just made no sense. They even cut the shower scene, a scene
that I always thought was a key point on why Carrie was so mad at
everyone to begin with. The actors didn't even pronounce the gym
teachers name right. Seriously? The co-stars couldn't act their way out
of a wet paper bag. This has got to be one of the worse remakes I have
seen in a long time. If I was Chloe, I would be embarrassed!
