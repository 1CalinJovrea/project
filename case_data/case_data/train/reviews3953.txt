Quadruple Threat Fails Again

Ben Affleck proves once again that he cannot write, direct, produce and
star in a movie. He has failed to create an interesting picture despite
the fascinating material he has at hand. First, the novel by Dennis
Lehane; second, the territory of gangland Boston and Florida during
Prohibition; third and finally, a cast of great actors in the
supporting roles from Brendan Gleeson to Elle Fanning, Chris Messina
and Chris Cooper. Why isn't this a good movie? It should be, but
Affleck once again does not seem to be able to take the helm wearing
all those hats and produce a great movie. The stereotypes abound, the
women are cardboard cutouts and the Godfather it ain't. I read this
movie was originally going to run to three hours, before Warner Bros
forced Affleck to cut it. As it is, at a few minutes over 2 hours, I
can't imagine sitting through more of this boring, snail-paced and dull
gangster film. Don't waste your time on Live By Night: watch the
Untouchables, rent the Godfather trilogy or, better yet, go outside and
take a long walk instead.
