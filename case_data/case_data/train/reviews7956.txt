Awful

It seems like the studio is trying to inflate the reviews, and now I
know why. The movie is not funny at all, don't waste your money. The
worst part was when Efron touches a dead man's genitals, disturbing
uncomfortable and unnecessary. The only good thing is the cameo of Pamela Anderson and David
Hasselhoff, but just look for the clips on youtube and you will be
totally fine.
