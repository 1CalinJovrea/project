Movie can't decide it it is a comedy or a drama!

This movie cannot decide if it should be a comedy or a serious drama.
For its entire 110 minutes, the movie goes back and forth between
straight silly comedy to straight serious drama...it was very annoying.
The book that it is "based" upon is a light-hearted upbeat book about
being pregnant...the movie should have just stayed a comedy.The characters in the film were all annoying...The Chase Crawford
character was completely annoying and completely unnecessary. The Chris
Rock character was the worst of the film...he played a street wise
character who enjoyed hanging out with a bunch of yuppie dads...huh???
The Elizabeth Banks character was the only one that came close to being
one that was likable.
