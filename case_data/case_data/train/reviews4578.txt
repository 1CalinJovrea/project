Awkward Handling of an Unlikable Drunk

"Trainwreck" has gotten really good reviews and I did laugh out loud
while watching it but it went downhill fast and in the end I felt like
I needed a shower. "Trainwreck" is about Amy (Amy Schumer), a
narcissistic, abusive, alcoholic and drug addicted slut who meets nice
guy Aaron (Bill Hader) who falls in love with her. They begin a
relationship and Amy's life changes. The drunken slut part of the movie offers some funny scenes, and some
creepy, cringe-worthy scenes. In one unfunny and gross scene, drunken
Amy attempts to have sex with a sixteen year old boy who calls her a
"pathetic, childless MILF." She punches him in the face and his mother
interrupts them. The scene seemed to be about the movie punishing and
humiliating Amy. I didn't much like Amy. She castigates a man for breathing on her after
one encounter. She is unkind to her sister within minutes of her father
being buried. She treats Aaron horribly, taking a phone call during one
of the most important moments of his life. "Trainwreck" is directed by Judd Apatow and written by Amy Schumer.
They are both very funny and prolific talents but the material here is
simply above their artistic maturity level. They know how to make funny
scenes; they don't really know how to deal with a drunk who tries to
get sober, or a malicious narcissist who tries to be nice to other
people. Aaron is a sports doctor and famous athletes are sprinkled throughout
the movie. That just doesn't work. You never really believe that LeBron
James hangs out with this sports doctor and has heart-to-heart talks
with him about his girlfriend trouble. The famous-sports-star scenes
take the viewer out of an already rocky movie and lower the
verisimilitude. It's also unbelievable that a sports doctor at Aaron's
level would be so desperate for a girlfriend that he would put up with
Amy for more than half a date.
