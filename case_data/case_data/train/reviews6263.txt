'The Notebook' meets '8 Seconds'

Enjoyable tearjerker flick paralleling modern love story between bull
rider and college student with that of an older gentleman who is on his
deathbed. I personally thought that the story of the older couple was
more developed and less clich√©. The plot is overall enjoyable. The
cinematography of North Carolina mountains is beautiful. My favorite
scene was the last bull riding scene which is in slow motion and uses
punchy bass (only real use of LFE effects in the movie). On a personal note, I was saddened to read that Rango the Bull passed
away after shooting the movie but before the film was released.
Apparently he was a real life superstar in the rodeo circuit.
