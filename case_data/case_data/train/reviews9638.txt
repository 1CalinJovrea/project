A iconic and really good film.

An extremely good film. You don't have to be someone who is a die hard
comic book fan to like this. I wasn't expecting what I got in this
film. It was spectacular. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Great
and emotional plot, excellent soundtrack ( The Neighborhood song,
"Honest" was epic!), exceptional acting ( Dane DeHaan, one of which to
point out) and awesome directing (Marc Webb *thumbs up*).Way better than the first one. The movie seems more modern than Sam
Raimi's versions. Some points in time, my heart was beating extremely
fast due to the actors' dialogues. The Visual Effects editors, thumbs
up to you all as well. Not much of a fan of 3-D but it was great. The
first movie didn't really get me excited for this one. I went with my
younger brothers to watch it.I don't regret watching it. People of all
ages would enjoy this movie.Jaime Foxx's portrayal of Electro is also one to point out. It made me
feel sad and pitiful towards his character. Andrew Garfield, to me,
seems like he was born for his role. !SPOILER! He acting was top of the
line when he was acting depressed towards Gwen Stacey's death.I would recommend watching this film anytime you want. I would honestly
buy another ticket to watch the movie again. It was that good.I rate this movie 8.4 in my book, because at certain points (very few),
I felt a little bored but other than that, The movie is amazing. I can
see why they call it The AMAZING Spiderman. *Ba dumb tss*
