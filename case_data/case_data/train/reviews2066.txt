Poor plot, chopping writing, good actors, and  great filming.

*****WARNING CONTAINS SPOILER*****Although the trailer seemed compelling to watch, the movie seemed to
have a completely different twist to it. Upon watching the movie the
trailer leaves you thinking that this a "romantic movie" in other
words, something you would watch with your partner, however, it is not.The rebellious Margo which seems to be curious, adventurous, and craves
the thrill of disobedience and mystery, drags along her old
neighborhood friend Quinton to plot her revenge on the people who she
deeply believes have done her wrong. In this thrilling part of the
movie it seems that a romance is starting to build between the two
young characters, however, it is the opposite. A day later, she
disappears.After this long journey across the U.S. to find this mystery girl,
Quinton is quickly disappointed. After he pours his heart out to her
she questions why he is even there. Wondering how he even found her.
After he tells her how he followed her trail of clues, she replied with
saying that her clues were never meant to be followed and in fact where
just used so that he would know that she was okay. So if she never
intended for him to follow her clues, then what is the point of making
them in the first place? Especially if she breaks his heart. It seems
almost as if at the very last scenes there was someone else who wrote
them.Although a poor plot line and some choppy writing, the filming was well
done, the actors were entertaining, and the music suited just fine. The
movie seemed to be going great until the very last few scenes when you
realize that everything was for nothing and that the writers seemed to
have gotten lazy toward the end and attempted to sum everything up
rather quickly.Overall, not the best movie I've seen.
