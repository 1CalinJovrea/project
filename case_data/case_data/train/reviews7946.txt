A comer in every sense of the word!

Hey I can't disagree more with the previous poster (Mark Rogle). Woody
Allen's Manhattan is a classic, but that was another time and another
world.FRANCES HA was SPOT-ON regarding actual life, work, and social issues
that apply to the current age. The comedic timing is flawless, as is
Gerwig's deadpan expression. While shot in Black & White, it added to
the range of locales - making it believable. The same can be said for
the characters (including Gerwig's actual parents). Another New York
"slice of life" story, but truly believable and entertaining!What the movie wasn't, was overly cerebral and full of fantasy
situations (like "Girls"). Also, Hannah in "Girls" is always dressed
like a deranged person, playing up a strangely shaped body that
distracted from the prose of her productions. Gerwig's character had no
such wardrobe overkill - it complemented the actress and the scenes
perfectly.As an actress, Greta Gerwig is funny and poignant, straddling the line
between ordinary-looking and classically beautiful. Everything is
expressed in her eyes. She's a magnificent writer as well. Highly
recommended - by me!
