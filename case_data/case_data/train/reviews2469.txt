it fails in every dimension

This movie is terrible, plain and simple. It starts out as a fun action
movie set in Taiwan. Scarjo is in some really cool scenes and is acting
amazingly. This is cut with shots of Morgan Freeman having a stroke and
blabbering one-liners about life that wouldn't impress Jaden Smith.Morgan Freeman was completely useless in this movie. Lucy knows
everything anyway and his explanation to the viewer will hurt your
soul. It doesn't matter that the whole premise is impossible but STOP
RUBBING IT IN MY FACE. The fact that hes presenting his ideas to a room
full of students and professors only ads insult to injury. No one asks
a simple why. Why does he think humans get psychic powers at 30%.
Telekinesis? Why is he even doing "research" on some weird
hypothetical. This movie is literally better if you cut out every
Morgan scene. This movie is way too pretentious for the few good action scenes it
has. If you insist on watching just watch the first 40 minutes or
something. Its not worth it.
