Seizures for all

An old truck was found by the hero. Shortly after that, shaking
cameras, flashing lights, and fast moving shiny things attempted to
induce seizures in the audience for about 2 hours. When I came too, I
remembered there was this large robot with a glowing blade riding on
the back of an even larger robot dinosaur recently put threw a
temporary jaw-ectomy. The human hero nodded his head as he observed
this from a distance as if to say, "This makes perfect sense to me."
The human hero then picked up his very tiny gun , and shot parts of bad
guys like they were made of graham crackers. I can only imagine he must
of been using special ammunition, perhaps hollow points filled with
good intentions. Then the hero robot left. The End. ( I don't think you
will like this movie very much.)
