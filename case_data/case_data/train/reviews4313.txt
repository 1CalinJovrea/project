Outstanding action and great acting make up for flawed plot

Atomic Blonde is the female version of the John Wick and Bourne series.
That's all I really need to say for anyone to go watch this film.Charlize Theron performed the best female fight/action scenes I have
ever seen, choreographed to perfection.Acting by all characters were spot on. The directing was perfect.
Cinematography great. The soundtrack probably the best I've heard in a
long time. My only problem with this film is the flawed plot. It's too convoluted
and didn't need to be, or, the length of the film should have been
longer to fit the story and fill in the holes.Other than that, a great and impressive watch! Charlize Theron has
claimed her spot as an action star. And of course the lesbian scene was
fantastic!It's a well deserved 9/10 from me
