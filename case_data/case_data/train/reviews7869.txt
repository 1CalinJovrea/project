Cowboys

- I really thought The Longest Ride was going to be a sappy movie based
on a book by Nicholas Sparks. I was mistaken. Yes, it can be sappy but
turns out to be a good story. A young couple, a city girl and a cowboy
go out on a date only to discover they are too different for it to
work. They drive up to an accident scene and the cowboy saves the
driver while the gal discovers a lot of letters. This sets a path to a
past love story and sets the course for the cowboy and city girl to
have a little faith in finding love even though circumstances may point
elsewhere. I believe this is a good date movie or just a feel good
story. Long live cowboys.
