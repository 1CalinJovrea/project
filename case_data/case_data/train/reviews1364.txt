Loved it

I loved this movie. I don't understand some of the negative ratings
here. This is not a Fellini movie we're reviewing. It's dinosaurs. And
plenty of them. I think this is every bit as good as JPI and way better
than the other two. There's plenty of action. There are strong
characters, big dinosaurs, spectacular special effects. Add a star
because it's scary without being gruesome. The plot is plausible in a
movie that's based on a totally fantastical platform to start with. Go
see it. Definitely one to see on the big screen. It's got a huge box
office for a reason. People spontaneously clapped at the start of the
ending credits. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie where
that happened.
