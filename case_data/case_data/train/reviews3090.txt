Apocalypse...Roman Style.

Italian cinema is alive and well. Saying this is time well spent is an
understatement. If you like dark movies that explore the absolute demon
inside all of us then this is for you. The movie really is a
masterpiece. The movie moves like a 24 hour road race. There is no
bright light at the end of the tunnel. You know that all these
characters are headed to unhappy end since the movie counts you down to
the apocalypse. But the way the movie takes you there is what I love. I
don't remember a movie that was so cold hearted as this is...and thats
what makes it so good. You love and hate these characters at the same
time. Some very strong performances complimented with a great script
add to this movies excellence. This dark film is beautifully textured
visually...lots of scenes in pouring rain to further put you in the
mood that Im sure the director intended. Do not miss this one!
