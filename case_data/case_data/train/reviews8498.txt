A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.

I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe 

indeed.... but I'll go for it...



Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A 

blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that 

could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.



This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled 

blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX 

so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly 

enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography 

for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.



The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to 

myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator 

2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast 

and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity 

preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I 

many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually 

trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really 

matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much 

and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is 

more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a 

grisly and dark world.



I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is 

everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5
