Never drop the con.

Focus is a con movie and it's at its best when it's trying to con you
into believing you know what is going to happen. The plot unfolds at a
steady pace and you are left guessing what is going to follow. There
are many twists and it's hard to keep up, as you would expect. The regular cons work best in the first half, when the movie is trying
to be fun and entertaining. During the second half of the movie the
plot deepens and works around character development. That's when Will
Smith and Margot Robbie come to life, they are at their best when they
are given more to work with and they keep the movie interesting.
However the movie gets caught juggling too many cons which by the end
of the movie may feel just a bit flat; but still make for an unexpected
and enjoyable finale. Definitely worth watching. PS. The directors did a good job showing the
importance of FOCUS in keeping the camera Focused at the right place.
