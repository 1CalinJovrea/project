Slow and ultimately pointless

Although production values were fine, the story was confused, evolved
far too slowly without a sense of progression, and ultimately never
came close to an ending that merited the tedious slog through the
movie.My companion for the evening is a big (and tolerant) sci-fi fan, but
she was fidgeting early on in the movie, and when a character utters
the words, "I'm so sorry about tonight" I could only turn to her and
repeat the line.If you're looking for a thought-provoking sci-fi movie, you can skip
this one, and if you are expecting a romance along the lines of The
Time Traveler's Wife or The Lake House, the story and performances are
just not compelling enough to pull that off.Sorry, but give it a miss.
