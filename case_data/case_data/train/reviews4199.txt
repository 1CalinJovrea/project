A tale about not love at first sight.

A romance comedy that begins with two people meeting in an unusual
circumstance during their college year. Later the story moves forward
to the present where their life status was revealed, particularly
romantic life and relationship issues. This story seems familiar, but
the filmmakers tried narrate it as much as possible from a new angle.
So the majority of us know how it all ends, yet watching how the film
is to reveal to us all those contents is not quite bad.This is a different kind of romance film than I thought. There're more
about sex than being romantic or emotional. But still nice film with
some good performances and length of the film was also good with decent
pace. Both the lead actors were quite interesting. They're not as
popular as those we see regularly in this kind of theme, but their
roles were justified with their fine efforts.The first half was okay type, but the next half, particularly the last
half an hour makes the film at its best. Whatever the opening was, but
it ends well. It is not a greatest love story ever told, still
enjoyable one. You can blame many things and/or scenes of it, but it
entertains on its own way. So I think some people would consider it a
good film, but most won't. For me it is an average, maybe a slightly
above that. The film is not worth suggesting, even though not a waste
of time.6/10
