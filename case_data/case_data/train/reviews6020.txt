totally entertaining!

What can i say, i really enjoyed this movie. There are similarities to
the original but the new twist was very entertaining. It is definitely
a special effects lovers dream come true. I don't really understand why some people gave this movie a bad review
when clearly this is much better than most of the c*ap out there. I
presume that most of the haters are either somehow against the movie to
begin with or just don't acknowledge a good movie when they see one. Overall i give it an 8 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to
everyone. It was just as entertaining as the original albeit with new
theme.
