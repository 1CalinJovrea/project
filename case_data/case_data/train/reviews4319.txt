The entire film plot is about 6 Americans in Tehran during the Iranian Revolution.

It could not be more islamophobic if it tried. I am not saying the
Iranian revolution was something pretty. It really wasn't. Here is a
list of the disturbing in the portrayal of Iran in Affleck's Argo:
-When the Iranian people spoke Farsi in the film there were no English
subtitles. If an American spoke farsi there magically appeared
subtitles. -Every single Iranian in the film was angry. This was the
only emotion they could express. According to Argo all Iranians are
hostile. -Showed no culture, not a single educated Iranian of there own
right. There was one "good" Iranian who was a housekeeper to the
Canadian ambassador. No character development at all, she serves her
purpose and leaves. Apparently fled to Iraqi cause thats going to end
well for her children. -The streets of Iran were made to look like the
streets of hell. The streets are shown with either one of these
characteristics 1. angry Iranian mob protesters who are in favour of
the Khomeini 2. militia terrorizing and murdering it own citizens
3.objectified Iranian dead bodies. Do yourself a favour and rent
Persepolsis (2007) written and directed by Iranian refugee and graphic
artist Marjane Satrapi.
