Why would they change the ending? That was the best part of the book... WHY?

Dan Brown is one of my favorite writers, maybe Inferno was not his best
book but it was still good enough. i've read it in 2 days , i know a
lot of people that loved it. One of the best things about Inferno was
the ending, and they decided to leave it out of the movie script...That was a big mistake, that's why i recommend everybody to give the
book a chance even if u tried the movie...I gave the book 9 stars out of 10. I can only give the movie 4 stars
out of 10. I'm sorry they changed the soul of the movie , they tried to make it
more Hollywood and they made a big mistake...Thanks
