Action-packed fun to watch

Sometimes checking the critics before going to the cinema might be
something to avoid (the practice in general can be questioned).
Especially, in the case of Baywatch:In my opinion, many of our beloved critics evaluated the movie against
wrongly chosen criteria. It is neither supposed to be next Oscar movie,
nor to contain outstanding character development or have a very
sophisticated plot.This movie is just fun - exactly what it is meant to be. Therefore, it
gets 8 out of ten, because it exactly fulfilled that purpose.
