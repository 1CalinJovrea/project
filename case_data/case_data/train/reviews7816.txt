Absolutely awful with too many flaws to count

This movie didn't do anything right.It starts out with pointless boring introductions of characters by
showing them talk about random things; a good movie would have jumped
right into the opening conflict.The protagonist is one of the worst characters in the movie, and
therefore the viewer has no vested interest to see him survive. The
villain and his methods are completely unbelievable, and the existence
of said villain is just to try and add some drama to the movie, but it
actually makes it worse than if the movie tried to be realistic in
dealing with the situation.There's nothing new, interesting, or creative about the movie, because
of the forced chaos by the writers. The movie would have been ten times
more interesting, if the characters were rational, it had a slower
pace, and the movie had focused on the choices people make to determine
the best ethics for who should live or die. They almost had a moment
like that, but then ruined it by having the villain start to randomly
choose people for no reason.The ending was absurd, because apparently trained, armed guards are not
capable of drawing a weapon on someone who tries to lunge free of those
restraining them.
