Fantastic visual effects ensure a gripping and entertaining film

Before seeing this film in theaters it was tough to know what to
expect. It immediately grasped my attention as the storyline was so
different than anything I have seen as of late. Tom Cruise is the
perfect man for the lead role, and does not fail to deliver a good
performance. If you are a relatively simple person with a short
attention span you may become a bit dazed and confused as to why
certain components of the film are occurring, but it adds up in the end
beyond measure. Although 'Oblivion' forces you to work slightly harder
than usual in understanding the plot and each twist that it takes, it
all comes together very well in this thrilling yet slightly confusing
film. No doubt one of Kosinski's best so far.
