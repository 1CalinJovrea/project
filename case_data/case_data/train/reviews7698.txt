Decent

Right off the bat, I will answer one question I know many are dying to
have answered: Did this one follow the book more? The answer: Yes . . .
marginally. I never hated the first movie for all of its deviations from the source
material, but I can understand that some did. If the alterations made
to the first movie annoyed you beyond belief, just know now that this
movie only makes a slightly larger attempt to stick with Rick Riordan's
material and you will probably not enjoy this movie much better than
the first. If loyalty to the source material is not your first
priority, I'd recommend you investigate this movie. You might just find
yourself enjoying it.The plot: Percy and his friends embark on a quest to save their home
from being overrun by monsters. To do this, they must dive into the
heart of the Sea of Monsters and retrieve a mythical object, The Golden
Fleece, that has the power to restore power to the shields that protect
their home.NEGATIVES: -Not enough time spent actually in the Sea of Monsters. -A few corny lines of dialogue -CGI wasn't always top-notch -A few scenes left me wondering "what was the point of that?" -The lack of Chris Beck's wonderful musical score, even though the new
composer was alright.POSITIVES: +Good acting +Lots of laughs +Decent pacing +Good character development +Nathan Fillion +The characters in the movie were all true to their book counterparts,
even if a good piece of the plot wasn't +A welcome amount of heartfelt moments +Alexandra Daddario's beautiful eyesOkay, that last one was just for me. All around, it's a fun movie. The crowd that loves this movie will
consist mostly of those who enjoyed the first movie, but anyone might
as well check it out. There's a good chance you will be pleasantly
surprised. (After all, how many movies are there to see in August?
Really?)Alright, Fox! Bring on "Titan's Curse!"
