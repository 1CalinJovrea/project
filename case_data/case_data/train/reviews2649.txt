Very enjoyable

This new twist in the Dracula/vampire emporium reminds me of the
revamped Star Trek series, which J.J. Abrams took to a new level. A
better one.It is obvious that the movie has nothing to do with the real history of
Vlad The Impaler. It was done the same way "300" and "Abraham Lincoln,
Vampire Hunter" were written - Hollywood style.I've read the bad reviews of the movie before I decided to see it for
myself. Funny, as usual. Then I noticed the $70 million budget. Not too
shabby, so it can't be that bad.The Turk reviewers are up in flames, just as the Iranians (they still
consider themselves Persians) were, when "300" came out.As if Vlad was a real vampire, Xerxes was really 9 foot tall, and
Abraham Lincoln was really killing vampires.Be serious people, look at the movie for its entertainment value. It is
not history, it is not a documentary, it is not REAL. It is a money
maker for Hollywood and it sells.Great effects, awesome new twist in this never ending vampire world.
