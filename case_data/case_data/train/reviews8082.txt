Disappointment

In the realm of sequels or films in a franchise this does not do the
series any justcice. I for one though that Wrong Turn, 2,3,4,5 were
actually much better than this plot and acting sequence. Granted we
take a film for what it means to us viewers and the Wrong Turn series
in general has just become iconic in how bad they really are. Next to
the original there really is no comparison except shoddy plots,
terrible acting, editing is sub par and it just is a fill in film. Im
sure as those who collect films such as myself we will endure. The film
is shot on a low budget and was filmed in Bulgaria. If you have nothing
better to do than waste your time with the 6th installment.
