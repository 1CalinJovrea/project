I wish there was more source material here

Hounds of Love sets itself up as a horror/thriller, but then slows down
to a crawl. I don't mind that specifically, as long as a movie keeps
carrying itself gracefully. Ben Young makes sure the viewer stays
engaged, but only with the help of his directorial genius. I loved the
mood he set for the film and his visual masterclass. But with a story
line so limited, it all fails to develop and make a hard impact.Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike any part of the movie, in
principal. The performances were brilliant, the tension was great, all
scenes were very well built. And I truly wish this group of actors and
this director had more to work with. The source material seemed very
limited, whenever it seemed that this might grow into something better
it tugged on itself and stopped dead in its tracks.Perhaps this is only my assessment, because I'm pitching it against
some good horror dramas I've recently been watching. But for me at
least, Hounds of Love fails at answering the whys and hows and every
other reasoning thrown at it, along with lacking a very basic
ingredient ever needed for good story telling; a story worth telling.
