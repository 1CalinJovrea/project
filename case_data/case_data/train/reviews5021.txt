Simple, clever and plenty of fun

If we contrast this movie with its great grand-pappy, Blair Witch, we
see just how far the found footage genre has come, which is surprising,
considering that around the time of Blair Witch, it didn't really feel
like there was a lot of mileage in that particular sub genre.For me, Creep's greatest strength is the black humor. It's a seriously
funny movie but never loses the tension that simmers under its surface.
We've seen this kind of stalker idea many times before in conventional
cinema of the nineties, such as Hand that Rocks the Cradle, The Fan and
Cable Guy but this one really puts the viewer in the shoes of the one
who is stalked.Mark Duplass puts in a legendary performance as Josef. The first time
we see him on screen, it's kind of hard to imagine him as the Creep he
is meant to be but as the movie draws to its conclusion, he nails it.It practically has "cult classic" stamped all over it.
