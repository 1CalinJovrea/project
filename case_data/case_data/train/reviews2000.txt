Shame to the franchise

Normally I watch the movies from the beginning to the end with
very-very few exceptions. Ice Age: continental drift is one of the
movies I have left after 40 minutes, but I consider this as a heroic
since I wanted to leave even after the first 15 minutes. I just gave
the movie a chance, which was a mistake.The characters are extremely boring and surprisingly annoying at the
same time. The intro of the movie is really funny (1 minute), but then
you should prepare yourself to enter the empire of boredom. The storyline is very predictable as well as the characters, even the
kids remained silent in the first 40 minutes. While I simply LOVED the first part of the franchise and I was OK with
the 2nd and 3rd, I would recommend the Continental Drift to my enemies
only.Stay away, this cow is milked dry already.Not recommended at all.
