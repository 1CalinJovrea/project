Worst movie I've seen in a long time

My son and I left the movie thinking we were angry we wasted our money!
I didn't laugh once in the movie! I think it's the worst movie I've
seen in a VERY long time!! So disappointing! Not a single person in the
theatre laughed once! I'm not in a hurry to see a movie with Will
Ferrell or Amy Poehler anytime soon!!
