A So-So Popcorn Movie

As a fan of the heroes in a half-shell, I guess I'm just gonna have to
accept that this is about as good as this iteration of the Ninja
Turtles will get. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is
better than its 2014 reboot, but only by a teeny bit.Out of the Shadows finds the turtles trying to stop the evil Shredder
from bringing an alien from another dimension to Earth in order to take
over. Along the way, the turtles make a new ally in Casey Jones (played
likably by Stephen Amell), go toe-to-toe with two new mutant minions of
Shredder (the fan favorite characters Bebop and Rocksteady), and may
have run across a mutagen that could potentially turn them into humans.There is a lot going on here and it's actually a miracle that the movie
makes sense for most of its runtime. While there are a few plot holes
here and there, there are none quite as gaping as the multiple ones
that the first movie had. On top of that, there are some genuinely
thrilling action sequences in the movie, with the standout one
involving the turtles in their tricked out garbage truck trying to stop
Shredder from escaping the 18-wheeler that is transporting him to a
different prison.When it's all said and done, once the original Ninja Turtles theme song
plays over the end credits, you realize you actually had fun with Out
of the Shadows. While neither of the two movies in this particular
iteration match up to the first two Ninja Turtles movies from the
Nineties, Out of the Shadows will entertain.I give Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows a 7 out of 10!
