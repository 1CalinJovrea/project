Worth seeing - Not the best but FAR from the worst.

I have to admit I wouldn't have seen this movie if my daughter was not
in the movie. However, I found it a decent watch. Considering that 85
percent of the films that come out are absurd and complete garbage,
this one was decent. It's one of those movies where after you see it
you'll think "that was OK/pretty good...but I'm glad ;I didn't pay $10
to see it in the theater". After you view it, you will feel satisfied
and there should not be a desire to watch it over & over again - say,
like There Will Be Blood. I cant recall any situations in the film that
you could consider ridiculous or unbelievable. The movie was filmed on
location in Portland, Oregon. So when they are in the setting they say
they're in, they're really there. The movie kept me wondering until the
end what was going to happen and it didn't end the way I thought it
would. I don't want to give anything away as to not ruin your viewing
experience. Amanda Seyfried gave a great performance putting in exactly
what was required. No extra, unnecessary funny stuff.I hope this review sets the proper expectation for your viewing
experience. Enjoy!
