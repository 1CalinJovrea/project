A Hollywood fable

"Allied' is the anti 'Casablanca'. Robert Zemekis is no Michael Curtiz.
"Allied' begins in Casablanca in 1942. It is a Casablanca made out of
full cloth. In 1942, Casablanca was a thriving port city, yet we see
camels and nomads dressed as though they're in a Christmas pantomime.
We are told after a man, a European man makes love to his wife, he
repairs to the roof to cool his libido. Utter rot. This is a Casablanca
of a fertile but poetic bent, but hardly factual. Didn't anyone bother
to note that the US liberated French Morocco in 1942? Did anyone bother
to not put Casablanca close to the Sahara desert? Camels, exotic
costume had a more appropriate place in Goulimine,once the prosperous
camel market of Morocco. And the tale goes from fancy to silliness as
it is obvious from the opening scenes that Cotillard is a German agent.
