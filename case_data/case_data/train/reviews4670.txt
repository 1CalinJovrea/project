Nothing new to say about life as a teenager.

I always look for the gem amongst the summer blockbusters that makes
you think. After all the critical hype I was salivating at the prospect
of seeing this film. What a crashing disappointment !!Take away the gimmick of filming it over 12 years and you have a film
that frequently references "American Pie". So many clich√© characters -
single mom coping with bad mating choices and struggling to bring up
two lively children;the characters of the said lively children; the
hippy dad who turns into the antithesis of everything he talks about at
the start of the movie; one alcoholic, abusive husband from the
educational establishment; one alcoholic, abusive husband from the
prison service;a grandparent couple who give bibles and shotguns as
"coming of age" birthday presents; geeky teenager who scores with not
one but two stunning girlfriends - the list goes on. At the end of the
movie the thought that hit me was "Is that it?". I had hoped that
Linklater might be another chronicler of current America as it still is
a puzzle for us in the rest of the world but in this film there is
nothing new being said. For that there is still only John Sayles.
