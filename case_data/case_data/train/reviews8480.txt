I Wish I Could Unsee This Film...

There are few films that I dislike to such an extent where I would
actually pay a considerable price for a crazy scientist to lobotomise
the part of my brain which remembers it. Tusk is one.But in the interest of being 'fair' I'll begin with the positives.
Sorry, positive. The acting, in majority, is OK. (Johnny Depp, I
presume, can only have agreed to partake as a joke or because he
actually doesn't care about his reputation anymore).Right, now the pleasantries are to one side I can continue. So think of
Human Centipede. Gross right? Crass? Tusk is a whole new level of vile.
Don't believe the tempting notion that this is based on a true story,
supposedly Kevin Smith and his mate where discussing a Gumtree add
which advertised free living if the lodger agreed to dress as a
walrus...The thing that irritated me the most about this film, aside from the
insanely non-funny comedic elements and special effects that look as
though the production company allowed the intern free-rein of the art
room, is the ending. I won't ruin it, anyone who sits through the
entirety of the film without throwing up or crying or trying to scratch
their eyes out will need to see it in order to confirm how ridiculous
and awful it really is (honestly).All in all I'm not sure whether I really 'get' what this film is meant
to represent. And by this I simply mean that maybe I'm not weird enough
to appreciate it.
