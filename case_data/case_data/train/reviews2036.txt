I don't really take life too seriously, so....

I don't know, maybe I just have a strange sense of humor, but I thought
this movie was funny. I always find it funny when serious actors do
slapstick roles. I watched it several times and I still find it funny.
I say if you like movies like Airplane or Blazing Saddles, just a hell
of a lot nastier and rude, then this is the movie for you.
