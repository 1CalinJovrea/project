Don't be "Hustled" by the reviews.  "American Hustle" is okay and nothing more

Despite it's stellar cast and great production creds, "American Hustle"
is little more than a sinners-with-a-heart of gold story. YAWN!!! It
plays like a particularly sad Woody Allen movie without the jokes. The
film is definitely not a comedy, though Jennifer Lawrence provides not
only the best character but most of the few laughs the film has. Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner are particularly effective in their
parts. Bradley Cooper does a solid job with the most complex character
in the film. Amy Adams is fine, but not award worthy for a change. Watch "The Grifters" if you want a devilishly clever con-film, because
it is 1,000,000 times better.Honestly, the NY Film Critics Assn. must have gotten a con-sized pay
off for calling this the best film of the year. Is it awful? No. But
neither is it memorable. Fun soundtrack, great costumes, hair/make-up
and photography can't make up for a plot which is dull and characters
who are so uninteresting.
