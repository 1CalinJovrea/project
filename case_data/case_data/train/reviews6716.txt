Give it a chance

The terminator and Rambo in the same movie, in the 80s or even the 90s
this would have been the event of the year...but then Sly didn't look
like his veins where going to explode and Shwarzie had less floppy
skin. But we digress. Sly plays an expert who professionally escapes
prisons to test their security. He gets set-up and end's up in an
experimental shadow prison from which he and Shwarzie have to escape.
The film reminded me a bit of (and borrows elements from) Fortress and
THX-1138. Contrary to The Expendables the film has a descent plot and
is well made. The VFX are good and never look fake, so generally
speaking a fine production. I expected little so I was positively
surprised to see that it could deliver 2 hours of solid entertainment.
It was never going to be as good as T2 or Cliffhanger but it's a pity
it just flopped at the box office. I hope many people give it a second
chance on DVD or BD as it is certainly worth the watch.
