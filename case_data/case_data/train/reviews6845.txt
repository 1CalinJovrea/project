"Violence isn't the worst thing in the world"

"The Book of Henry" is definitely not for people who like taut,
coherent, logical plots devoid of standard clich√©s. As others have
noted, it's really all over the place, and its mix of silly comedy and
tear-jerker tragedy, realism and fantasy, cuteness and horror, and so
forth doesn't exactly pan out in the end. Still, if you enjoy films
that are simply different experiences, emotionally stirring even if
they require you to heavily suspend disbelief, perhaps lay it aside
altogether, this film will probably prove worth seeing, and you may
really love it. It certainly keeps your attention with numerous
surprises and much suspense. Fine acting by Naomi Watts and just about
everyone else, along with some stunning scenery of the upstate NY
setting, also help this film. I am glad to have seen "The Book of
Henry" and would like to give it a higher rating, but with all its
issues, I just can't.
