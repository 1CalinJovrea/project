Horrible

I've never written a review before but after seeing the movie Jackie
and reading some of the so called critic reviews giving it a high
rating, I find myself compelled to. This is simply the worst movie I've
seen in my life. Natalie Portman's acting is absolutely horrible with
the worst part being her attempt at trying to sound like or speak like
Jacqueline Kennedy. The cinematography, horrible, again the worst I've seen as it tries to
incorporate historical film footage into the movie and also attempts to
create black and white film footage or inserted Natalie into historical
film footage, looked amateurish.The soundtrack gave you 1 hour and 40 minutes of depressing boring
music as the producer attempts to make a 1 hour movie at best into an
hour and 40 minutes.The script, horrible, any 10 year could have done a better job. The reporter, that was interviewing Jackie during the movie, tie was
too thick for the time period and his shirt collar too big for that
time period, how could anyone get that wrong. I fell asleep for 40
minutes of the movie, as I was with my wife and one of her girlfriends
or I would have gotten up and left, but woke up and felt as if I hadn't
missed anything. Lastly, how can someone make a movie about this event in America's
history and NOT include one of the most enduring and iconic images of
all time of little John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father's casket as
it passes by. There is really nothing good to say about this movie,
it's horrible.
