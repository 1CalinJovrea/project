Go see this film if you've forgotten how to feel

It's a long time since I've seen a film as affecting as this
(principally because it isn't emotionally manipulative, which I always
resent). Instead it just tells a simple tale of simple folk living in
simple times, between whom love eventually blossoms against the odds.
It's also a sobering reminder of how hard times were in the early 20th
century in rural communities, where gossip and malice were endemic,
people worked their fingers to the bone and there was no room for
sentimentality. That very unsentimental ethos permeates the film,
though of course in many cases it tips over into cruelty, and the
cruelty Maudie suffers is at times unbearable. Yet for those tempted to
walk out, stick with it because her life improves and she evens starts
to smile a bit, once the art therapy kicks in. Take a box of Kleenex,
expect to feel humbled (and never to complain again about your affluent
neuroses). Beyond that, both leads (Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke) are
great, and the photography of Newfoundland & Nova Scotia is beautiful,
capturing the seascapes and landscapes in the brilliant light.
