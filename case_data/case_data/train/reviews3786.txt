An excellent down to Earth thriller!

With out giving much away, I have to really praise this movie. The film
accomplishes creating a down to Earth thriller with the dramatic ups
and downs of a well written story.In today's movie world, most movies create thrill by just using special
effects that show cars being blown away, chases, and gun battles.
Special effects are fine and thrilling, but a movie created by computer
effects is devoid of real creativity.In Parker however, the thrills come from the characters' interactions
and situations. Now, you really need imagination and creativity in
order to accomplish such level of reality.The film presents the two main characters in a very realistic way.
Furthermore, the female lead played by Jennifer Lopez, is played to
perfection.It is very sad to observe that this film did not get proper
distribution here in New York City. Originally, the movie was going to
be shown at several AMC Theaters including the Lincoln Square 13. While
it did play in several AMC Houses, it never played the Lincoln Square
13. The Lincoln Square 13 seems to be the AMC Flagship here in NYC. In my opinion, the fact that this movie did not played in that house
hurt the movie at the box office.All-in-all, I hope there is a sequel to Parker with the same actors
playing the lead roles. I also will like to see the sequel promoted and
distributed more efficiently.
