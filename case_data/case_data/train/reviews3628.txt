It's a chick flick -

- not a dick flick!It's a fun and funny tale of two girls escaping their problems via a
trip to the beach. On the way they both become besotted with the same
man and a road trip brings out the worst in these two best friends.
Easy and fun lighthearted story for an evening of simple non complex
entertainment.The other reviews that ditch this flick are just wrong. Give it a try
because chick flicks can be fun.
