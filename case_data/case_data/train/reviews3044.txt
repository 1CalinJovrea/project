Animation was a lazy way to make this film

The technology of animation has advanced so far that film makers
sometimes seem to take this genre as the easy way to make a film,
especially for children. My grandchildren were bored by this film, and
I regarded it as a wasted opportunity to portray the much-loved Captain
Underpants stories on film. It was hard to believe in the authenticity
of the children, and the adult characters were stereotyped caricatures.
How much better it could have been with real child actors and real
people acting the adult roles. For example, the humour of the Professor
P character, and of the two headmasters, could have been much more
effectively brought to life by real actors. The children too would have
been much more believable as real people. In my view, the film would
have been much more successful, and much more entertaining to watch, if
it had been made as a real film rather than an animation. I think the
commissioners and producers of the film have just taken the easy route
of assigning the task to animation teams instead of going to the
trouble of recruiting and directing real actors. What a pity! The
character of Captain Underpants and his adventures could have made
really great children's cinema, but this effort is feeble and
disappointing.
