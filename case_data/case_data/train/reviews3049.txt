Delusiveness and Reality

The former socialite Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) travels from New York to
San Francisco to stay in the simple house of her stepsister Ginger
(Sally Hawkins) that lives with her two sons. Jasmine was married with
the successful businessman Hal (Alec Baldwyn) that felt in disgrace for
being considered a crook and committed suicide in prison. Jasmine is
completely broken and mentally unstable with recollection from her
previous social life and uses anti-depressive along the day. Jasmine does not approve Ginger's boyfriend Chili (Bobby Cannavale)
that she considers a loser, the same feeling she had with Ginger
ex-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay). Jasmine has no profession to work
and support herself and she accepts the position of receptionist in a
dentist's clinic. When Jasmine is invited to a party, she asks Ginger
to go with her. Ginger meets the sound engineer Al (lluis C.K.) that
she believes is a better catch than Chili. Meanwhile the gold-digger
Jasmine meets the diplomat Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard) and she believes
she will advance in her social position."Blue Jasmine" is a movie by Woody Allen with a story of delusiveness
about a woman that does not want to see and accept the reality and the
consequences of her attitude in a moment of tantrum. Cate Blanchett has
good performance in the role of a fashionable woman from the high-
society that loses everything and need to live in the house of her
working class stepsister. The plot uses flashbacks to show Jasmine's
life and has a plotting point in the end when the fall of Hal is
explained. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Blue Jasmine"
