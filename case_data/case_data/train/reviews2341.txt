Go in Blind - Don't Watch the Trailer or Read the Reviews

This film was a pleasant surprise. The only thing I knew about this
movie was the buzz about it. There has been some talk of it being slow,
but I disagree. I think the pacing is what builds up to....well, you'll
see. And just when you think you know how it ends, you get a punch in
the stomach with the final scene.Anyone who is crapping on this movie just didn't "get it". Logan
Marshall-Green was tremendous in portraying both his grief and his
paranoia. The coyote sequence at the beginning of the film is a
harbinger of things to come, and oh-so-symbolic. A truly wonderful
film. I tip my hat to everyone involved in making this gem of a movie.
