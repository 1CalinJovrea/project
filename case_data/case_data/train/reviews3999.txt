Faith,Fright and Fear Night

IMO this movie is not "Catholic Indoctrination". Just as the left's new
chick flick paranormal flop "Ghost Busters". That was indoctrination.
This movie captures the paranormal and fear. If your story consists of
demons, and demons are old, most stories use the Catholic church as the
opposite of old dark demonic forces. Can't really write the story with
Reverend Billy BOb from the first Baptist church bustling in with the
choir to save the day. The central theme is not lost here. Its one of
paranormal, so allow yourself this escape and focus on that instead of
church-shaming distractions. A good solid B horror movie.
