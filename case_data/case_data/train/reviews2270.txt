Well worth it for a good laugh

I think people have forgotten what movies like this are all aboutIf you want to laugh go see it, laughs are guaranteed ,if you have a
sense of humour you will. If your uptight and pretentious it's not for
you. Go watch something else . If you loved the first 2 you'll like
this one . The first 2 are hard to beat but you'll laugh all the same.
I love the catch phrases. To keep it simple its all about Alan , Chow and the wolf pack. Poor
Doug never gets a start probably because he's boring .Well worth a look
.I loved it , don't be turned off by the Doug's of the world. There are
too many negative people sharing their opinions.Very funny we came out smiling can't beat that
