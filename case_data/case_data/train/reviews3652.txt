Excellent twist on the famous fairy tale

Go see this movie. Frankly I don't get what the nay-sayers are
complaining about. I studied film and literature at the university, and
found this film to be one of the best family movies I've seen. I would
own this in my collection. Stunning visuals complement a story line
that twists along a very modern path in contrast to the old fairy tale.
The story is told well. The acting is not award-winning but it is
believable. Lily Collins (Snow White) is wonderful! And yes -- the
outcome is a bit predictable for anyone who's ever heard of Snow White
-- but wouldn't you expect that? My son (7) and daughter (9) both loved
it, although some parts were scary enough to send my son cuddling up to
me. We all left grateful for the experience. And, as usual, covered in
popcorn. Go see it. And don't miss the dance scene after the end of the
movie and before the credits. It's a trip watching the cast in 18th
century French Royal costumes dancing and singing to a modern Indian
beat, a fitting analogy to the film.
