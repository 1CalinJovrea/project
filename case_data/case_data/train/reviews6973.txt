A story within a story movie. but not a very good one.

Because both of the stories told are lame.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is a writer who sends his ex his latest
book as a form of revenge by being successful by writing her as a
character that dies in the book.This book could not be a bestseller in real life cause the writing is
lazy and to obvious for it's own good. If there is a plot in here
somewhere I really missed it. Besides the stories matched really bad
and it became confusing that you started to wonder if it were
flashbacks from the story or from "actual life".A lot of scenes dragged and scenes that could have made an impact are
very numbed down and to much attention on boring art that had little to
nothing to do with the movie. Dialogue felt really awkward sometimes
and even messed up the characters even more because it made 'm come
across like a bunch of snobs.Also the same dialogue was repetitive and some exposition was first
discussed and later on almost the same thing is discussed again. The
movie is not that difficult that you have to explain yourself 2 to 3
times.I mean what"s the point and why would a director treat his audience
this way. I almost would think that the arrogance of this director is
the reason critics rate this so highly while I view this more as form
over substance thing, which is fine if your talking to an art house
crowd but not for the average moviegoer.Now I watched this to the end waiting for the plot that never came and
Amy Adams getting stood up in a restaurant probably also waiting for
the plot that never came and that sums up to a plot less movie.There are people that like these kind of movies where style is more a
factor than story if you don't mind that to much you might like this.
Combined with a good story I'm all for style but sadly that wasn't the
case here.All there is left to say is...don't feed the (nocturnal) animals.Thank you.
