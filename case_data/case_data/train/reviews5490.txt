Better Than the Original?  Thats a Big NO

Hollywood, you do not take a classic film and do a lackluster job and
make it worst. You try to transcend. It's lazy Hollywood all over
again. The script makes no attempt to develop any of the characters and
what we get is a piece of hollow action flick with no substance to it.
Hollywood thinks we are all sheep and simply throw away our hard earned
money to them. They insult our intelligence over and over again with
remakes of great classics promising to be better than the original.
Once in a blue moon they succeed but not this time! Don't waste your
money. Wait for it to go on DVD or watch it free if you can. Better
yet, watch the classic Magnificent 7 with Yul Brynner and you will see
how much better that one is to the remake. They don't call it a classic
for nothing!
