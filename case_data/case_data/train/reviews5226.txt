Surprisingly fun ride!

This is one of the best films of the year, hands down. It was just
incredible. This film takes a subject matter that could be considered
boring by some, and totally draws you into it. It finds creative ways
to break everything down for the audience, and makes it entertaining. I
love how it's self aware, even at some points straight up going, "This
isn't how it happened, but it's way more interesting this way." I love
how it breaks the 4th wall, with celebrities who make cameos to explain
complicated things to the audience. It's brilliant. I left this movie
angry that this happened, it really gets you thinking. Adam Mckay's script is fantastic. The characters are very well written,
which every one being interesting and well developed. The film
effortlessly blends comedy with drama, one minute making you laugh out
loud, and and then it stops you right in it's tracks. There are some
really heartbreaking moments here. The acting is just phenomenal, and this is Steve Carell's best
performance. It's just incredible. If he's not nominated an Oscar for
this, it's robbery. It's easily better than his Foxcatcher performance.
Christian Bale is great as well, playing the socially awkward Michael
Burry. Brad Pitt with his limited screen time was great as well. Ryan
Gosling is a scene stealer here, he's hilarious. He's really the only character not struggling here, he's making money
off all of it. This movie is extremely stylish, with brilliant editing
that I hope wins it an Oscar. This film does everything it can to make
everything fun, and it does a great job. This is as entertaining as it
is thought provoking. Adam Mckay should tackle drama more often, as he
did an extraordinary job with this. 9.5/10
