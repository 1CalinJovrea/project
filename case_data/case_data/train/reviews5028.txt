Intriguing, unpredictable and tense

"Ex Machina" deals with a familiar theme in a very unique way. It
doesn't bombard you with effects or superficial action (although the
robot effects are exceptional). Rather, its focus and beauty lie in the
subtle and nuanced performances of its tiny cast as the film explores
what it means to be human.Quiet dialogue scenes between two characters are filmed in such an
impactful, making them feel hauntingly austere, sweet and innocent, or
terrible and frightening, through meticulous use of composition, light
and sound. The film really does run the gamut of emotions, surprisingly
funny one minute and gut-wrenchingly tense and weird the next, while
the script twists and turns, constantly unsettling your assumptions
about what will happen. The performances are excellent, most notably Alicia Vikander as the
beguiling Ava, who absolutely passes for being 'almost human'. Her
precise movements -walking, standing or stooping to pull on a pair of
stockings- have just that slight tinge of the uncanny about them to
suggest a mechanical skeleton, yet she is undeniably seductive. You can
really understand Caleb's mental plight as she begins to show signs of
a sexual interest in him!Domhnall Gleeson also delivers a quiet and focused performance as
Caleb, which reflects much of the film's over all style. Like Ava, he
is relatable, yet has this slight autistic aloofness about him, in
complete contrast to the boorish, reckless Nathan (Oscar Isaac). The dialogue feels real and non-clich√©. The pacing for the most part is
measured, although one or two scenes might move a little slower than
they need to.The ending probably will not satisfy everyone, and admittedly left me a
feeling a bit cold, but it certainly didn't follow the route I was
expecting. Overall I found it to be enthralling and disturbing stuff.
