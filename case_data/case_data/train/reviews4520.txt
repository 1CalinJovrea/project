Greatly disappointed

I was actually pretty excited about watching this movie. My cousin
thought it was great and better than Hunger games, so I read the books
before I watched the movie. I liked the books, but there were a few
things I wasn't satisfied about. The relationship between Tris and Four
is confusing and spontaneous, completely out of the blue and random. In
the movie it is worse. They barely know each other, Tris' ear gets cut
from Four, then Tris is making out with Four topless. They didn't
include a lot of the important characters, like Uriah and Peter's crew.
They barely acknowledged the characters they did put into the movie and
there seemed to be no importance in them. Al's suicide was a big thing
in the book and it didn't really make an impact in the movie, there was
no significance, I wouldn't have felt any emotion if I hadn't read the
book. Will, Christina, Tris and Al's friendship is too muted and you
don't really get to know any of the characters well, the character
development was non-existent, . Four of the characters I couldn't
really tell apart from the others, Will, Al, Peter and Drew looked
pretty much identical. Too much is left out and there are too many
changes added to the movie that make no sense. In Tris' fear landscape
it seems that Four is trying to rape her and she has to violently fight
him off. In the book it is playful and she ends up laughing it off.
Edward's knife stabbing in the eye accident is also left out and that
was an incredibly important scene.This movie just really disappointed me, I never really get disappointed
with movies, but this just frustrated me too much.The books and movie both had great potential but were just a little bit
off.
