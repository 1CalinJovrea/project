A bad cashgrab sequel

I thought the first Horrible Bosses was just tedious despite the cast
and the promising premise. However, people loved it and it made enough
money to guarantee an unnecessary sequel which this movie definitely
is. Horrible Bosses 2 is a simple cashgrab that repeats the same
schtick as the original, but with even worse results despite once again
having a good cast.Good: I like the cast involved and especially Chris Pine who is
thankfully showing off his funnier side with his recent movies.Bad: The comedy here was obviously a lot of improvisation between Day,
Sudeikis, and Bateman and it doesn't work. It is just a lot of talking
over each other and being loud. It is grating to watch and the fact
that it continues throughout the movie gets annoying quick. The jokes
all fall flat and more misuse of Kevin Spacey and Christoph Waltz.Overall, it is just an unfunny sequel that goes for more of the same
with ten times the annoyance.
