HEDWIG famously possessed an ANGRY INCH . . .

. . . but MAGIC MIKE XXL's more like a sleepy centimeter. In a sense,
XXL is a spoof of a spoof. This is a dull, pale imitation of cable TV's
Cinemax Channel's porn parodies. Instead of simulating wild sex with
clothes OFF, we have XXL lamely hinting (with clothes mostly ON) at
things that may have seemed a trifle risqu√© in the 1890s. Though it was
somewhat difficult to follow XXL's pointless plot amid the snores of
the Bachelorette Party to my right, the main climax of this flick comes
when Channing Tatum gets Amber Howard to smile (something he probably
could have accomplished in Real Life 110 minutes sooner by simply
dropping his drawers for her in Warner Bros.' family assist lavatory).
This Snooze-Athon builds up to some sort of "competition" with NO
winner, and NO opponents performing. XXL jumps the shark by bogging
down for a seeming hour or two at Jada Pinkett Smith's bordello. Next
it's over to Andie MacDowell's living room for another tedious
eternity. (Smith and MacDowell no doubt are two of XXL's producers, or
their molls.) Finally, Elizabeth Banks reprises her Queen of Snark role
from the HUNGER GAMES and PITCH PERFECT series. Then the EMT's had to
use paddles on one of the walker-bearing septuagenarian matrons seated
to my left during this film to jump-start her awake enough to clear the
theater.
