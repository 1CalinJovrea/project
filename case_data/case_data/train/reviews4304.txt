'SELF/LESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi thriller/action flick starring Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley.
The story revolves around a dying businessman who has his consciousness
transferred into the body of a younger, and much healthier, man. It was
directed by Tarsem Singh (the man also responsible for the popular 2000
horror flick 'THE CELL') and written by David and Ã€lex Pastor. The
movie also stars Matthew Goode, Natalie Martinez, Derek Luke and Victor
Garber. The filmmakers do very little with their interesting ideas; but
they do deliver a fun, and stylistically thrilling, action flick.Kingsley plays Damian, a wealthy, and very successful, businessman;
who's dying from cancer. A secret, groundbreaking, science organization
offers to give him a new body; to extend his life. After going through
with the procedure Damian is thrilled with his newfound youth, and very
physically fit body, but he quickly learns that his happiness came at
the expense of someone else's (the man who's body he took). Damian
feels extremely guilty for taking another man's life from him, and he
wants to set things right. The special organization will stop at
nothing though, to protect their business.The movie starts out as a pretty intriguing science-fiction thriller;
similar movies have been done before but it did seem somewhat fresh and
unique. It doesn't really develop into much though, as it prefers to
entertain it's audience with stylistically cool action scenes; instead
of story and character development. Singh is a very visually satisfying
director to watch though, and I really like the dark style and mood of
this movie. It's hard to give it credit for a lot more than that; but
it is an entertaining, and somewhat thrilling, action flick.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:
