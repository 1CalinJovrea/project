Just totally awful

There is no need to use 1000 words to review this film. One word
suffices; awful. Base, totally lacking in nuance of any sort, this film
not only disappoints on every level (bar the 'punched a baby'
moment)but has been marketed and advertised in a misleading way. I
attended expecting a satiric comedy centred on election campaigns (how
it's advertised) and watched a boring, un-funny and ultimately
repulsive film, until I walked out. The scene where Will Ferrel's
character has sex in the fridge (????) with his opponents wife is gross
and vile, not to mention completely unbelievable; OK it's a comedy but
even in the context of this film this 'storyline' is massively
ridiculous as is everyone's reactions to the event. I did not tick the
spoiler alert button at the top as there is nothing in this film to
spoil. Spend you money elsewhere; this film is just totally horrible.
