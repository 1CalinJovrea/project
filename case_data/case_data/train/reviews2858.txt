10
6.5 kind of film. Good for families

This is my first time watching a Tyler Perry movie. But this is also a
Madea movie so whatever. It is what it is, a somewhat wholesome family
comedy. It is funny. It may just be the funniest movie of the year but
that isn't saying much considering this is one of the worst years on
record when it comes to movies. Anyway, it is worth seeing on the big
screen, if you're looking for a comedy, with a good family message
behind it. Im starting to see why Tyler Perry has such strong
following, he makes films the whole family can enjoy. The current IMDb
score is 4.7 and I can assure you that is definitely not the case so
even though this is more of a 6.5 out of 10 kind of movie, I'm going to
rank it a 10 out of 10 just to help offset the current score.
