Crossed the Threshold

I'm no prude by a long, long, longshot. But when I hear the lead
actress declare that she has to take a "$#IT", I am somewhat taken
back. Was that suppose to be cute? Did I pay money for my wife and I to
see this? In 'Butterflies are Free', an argument is made by the
antagonistic playwright/producer, "Heroin addiction is a reality." The
witty answer to this, "So is diarrhea, but who wants to see it on the
stage?" Who wants to hear it in a movie script?Bad language doesn't bother me, but when it is applied haphazardly,
apparently to evoke a shocking response, I realize the writer isn't too
experienced and/or talented.Other than that, the film was somewhat tedious.
