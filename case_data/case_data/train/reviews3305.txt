Deceptive but Good.

I say deceptive because I hadn't heard of this film and from the really
dodgy CG in the intro story I thought it was perhaps a low budget indie
film. It was unclear if the clumsy graphics were designed to be
stylised imaginings of the story book idea at first and I nearly gave
up on it.Glad I did not as it turned out to be a genuinely good film. I probably
would have given it eight out of ten but honestly the last thirty
seconds of the film earned another two stars. Very good end to the
story and quite creative... even if it does raise a question about
airplanes and satellites.Perhaps this is why the UK never invested heavily in a space program...
