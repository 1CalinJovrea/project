Surprisingly hilarious.....

Loved the movie.the chemistry and the HILARITY of "The other women".
Lmao,Like seriously i couldn't help but keep giggling throughout it.Cameron Diaz,Leslie Mann and Kate Upton Fabulously played their
individual roles and the chemistry between them seriously radiated with
the 'true strength of sisterhood ' XD Review wise their seemed to be only two kinna groups for this movie.
The ones that absolutely loved it....and the ones that didn't.
Well..like you would have guessed i fell into the latter group in this
category.And im glad.To me this movie was silly,comedic and the epic definition of an
Hilarious Rom-Com movie...Its not fair this was seriously underrated...Loved Nikki Minaj's acting as well.I guess i seriously should learn NOT
to underestimate a singer's acting skills either.Cause I enjoyed her
role as well :)
