not bad at all for German cinema

The book was quite the scandal when it came out a few years ago. I
personally found it a bit boring after a while so I didn't finish it.
The movie however is very well done. It manages to be both serious and
funny, which is rather the exception than the rule for German films:
usually they're either very serious or slapsticky "funny". Visually
this could be called a German version of Trainspotting, with some nice
and unusual shots and angles, freaky dream sequences etc. The acting
throughout the whole cast is amazing, not only the Helen, the lead
role, but also her parents, the nurses, the drug dealer etc. I didn't
get the feeling that I so often have when watching (and hearing!)
German actors in films: that they are noticeably acting. So go watch
this, especially if you don't think much of the book. It's a fine
movie!
