good but awkward at times

First let me say that I am not sure if I would have kept watching this
movie after the first 10 minutes if not for the two stars. The premise
was good but the way Jane Fonda's character broached the subject seemed
unbelievable to me given that she barely talked to or knew her
neighbor. There were a few times when the dialogue felt stilted too.
The movie got better but the ending was disappointing. It just kind of
left the audience hanging like the filmmakers are anticipating making a
sequel. It probably would have made a better TV series than a movie,
say 10 episodes on Netflicks. Good to see Fonda an Redford together.
