Shocking Disappointing and Hopeless, Pure Tripe

My family and I had high hopes for this movie. It is, after all, based
upon the incredibly family friendly Mary Poppins Author's (PL Travers)
life. Our hopes were dashed in a very disturbing manner.**************************SPOILER ALERT********************************
It is almost impossible to write a review on just how awful this movie
was without telling the TRUTH (i.e. a spoiler). The advertising and the
trailers for this film were very deceptive. They painted a picture of a
movie that was based upon hope, adventure and redemption. THAT IS NOT
WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT. The story is told, in numerous flashbacks to
PL Travers' childhood, which is as dark, distorted and depressing as it
gets.At one point, Traver's dazed mother (stunned and shocked by her
complete inability to pull her husband back from the brink of severe
alcoholism, the flu and impending death), attempts suicide by almost
drowning herself. PL Travers gets on the family horse and rides to the
rescue, but the rescue is only a fleeting and pitiful flicker of hope
for her tragic family. Travers' dad, who she apparently loved, dies a
slow, painful, agonizing and incredibly undignified death.I kept waiting for a miracle, or SOME SEMBLANCE of redemptive hope to
enter the movie. It never happened. At the end of the movie, PL Travers
has relented to Walt Disney's persuasion and sold the Mary Poppins
movie rights. Travers goes to the premier in Hollywood with all the
stars and she cries during the touching scenes, but when Walt tries to
comfort her she denies the true reason for her profuse tears.So Mary Poppins is finally turned into a movie after much hand
wringing, manipulation and haughty, bitchy behavior from PL Travers.
Everybody wins except PL Travers whose tragic childhood is never
redeemed. She is the classic portrait of hopelessness. She is the
poster child for a child who was hurt severely in her youth,
internalized the pain, became a bitter person, and never recovered.The movie is disturbing and hopeless. Again, I kept waiting for some
Disney or Mary Poppins magic. Isn't that what Disney and Mary Poppins
are all about??? The magic never came. The real people in this movie,
Travers and Disney, made a profit and the masses were blessed with the
character of Mary Poppins on the silver screen. But the heart of Mary
Poppins, PL Travers herself, lived on in isolation because no one could
stand the bitter old lady.The movie does not depict it, but she died at 96 in London, after
having lived a basically awful, lonely life. According to her
grandchildren, "Travers died loving no one and with no one loving her."
SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS MOVIE! This is not a family friendly movie. The
interactions with Travers and her dad are incredibly disturbing and I
kept waiting for him to molest her. Thank God it never got that far.
This is a dark tale and I find the fact that so many people apparently
loved it equally disturbing. This is a story of NON REDEMPTION. I would
have rather watched "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" than to have spent
my family's time on this garbage. I rate this as one star, one of the
most hopeless movies I've seen, ever.
