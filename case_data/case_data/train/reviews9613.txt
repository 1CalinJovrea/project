Saviour Private Doss

Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to
the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard
to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the
others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be
surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now,
few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory
details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple
of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story
line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of
bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand -
nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not
let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of
the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant
classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of
Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.
