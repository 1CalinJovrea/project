Surprised by positive reviews, really

***COULD CONTAIN PLOT SPOILERS***This has been true garbage action shooter. Not that I expected anything
extraordinary, but beyond hiFX plot of this movie was so cheap it would
not work with Cartoon Network. Its a huge mixture of previous movies,
trying to rip anything off and adds nothing on top. I mean seriously,
just few examples:Bad machine with a massive red dot speaking kind voice? (Space Odyssey
& countless others) Check! Absolute annihilation of our planet? (Gosh,
countless other titles)Check! Suicide mission (Independence day) Check!
Clones conquering planet? (Star wars, etc..?) Check! Drone fights &
design? (Seriously, nobody sees any resemblance to a tie-fighter?)
Check!Absolute and utter thrash. I haven't got all night to write about plot
holes, but there is barely anything that holds this movie together.Disappointed viewer.
