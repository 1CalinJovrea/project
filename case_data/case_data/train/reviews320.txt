A popcorn entertainer

This is a movie with a simple story, not the best acting performances
and giant visual effects. So if you're up for some eye-candy and want
to give your thinking brain a rest, go for it; but like I've heard from
others, pick the best and biggest 3-D screen in town. Keep in mind
however that this is no Life of Pi in terms of effects either.The story is the clich√©d young boy-princess-evil others trio, without
much added creativity in terms of dialogues and I wasn't impressed by
Nicholas Holt's acting skills either and there were some gross
sequences involving the Giants, in case you like that stuff but apart
from the effects I do not think it has much to offer.
