Making America Great Again! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

I'll always part with my hard earned $$$ to see a Tom Cruise movie
whether it's good or bloody awful (e.g."The Mummy") such is the power
of his StarüëΩ. But this one was on the money. Thank god! Very clever
writing, great casting & editing plus authentic 80s set designs went
into this movie gem. A bonus is that you even get to hear a genuine
Lestat De Lionheart laugh in there too. That's movie magic for a
die-hard fan.
