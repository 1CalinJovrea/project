This is "Film-placement", forget Product-placement

Saw a pre-screening with a friend this film last night. Very painful
experience. There is "Product Placement" and a new-term I will coin
which is "Film-placement", whereby a film plot is constructed around
the need to show-off every aspect of a Product. Barely a laugh in sight
at the cinema. Cannot believe Google signed this off Â– they have
self-belief in spades! Things that did make a mark on me in this film:
Google provides silly hats for interns (i.e. "Noogles", porting silly
little hats complete with little propellers), coloured bicycles on
campus, relaxation pods, online advertising, online analytics, GPS
location services, oh and not forgetting free food (provided not taken
home, and a barrel of laughs intended to be associated around this
one). Oh, and some of its lecturers have to make do part-time as
strippers (where did that one come from?). I have seen many mediocre
films in my time but this is the first that I have been compelled to
"review".
