I cannot find ONE redeeming quality for this movie

It is true that when you are young, you see movies like the original
"ID4" from a different perspective, most often you judge them better
than what they really are, and this undeniably is a fact of life. It
holds true for most people. Yet, the original movie, even when judged
by my 41 years old brain now, without considering the nostalgia factor,
and even in all its cheesiness ... still manages to be far far superior
from this absolute garbage!This sequel really is a let down of epic proportions, and I felt like I
wasted my money. It manages to be what the first movie totally wasn't
...and that can be summed up in one word: BORING. The bad guys ( the
aliens ) are laughably stupid - even more than the first time ... the
main characters could all be replaced by cardboard cutouts of people
and it wouldn't make any difference. Even the CGI is bad... Avoid it at
all costs.
