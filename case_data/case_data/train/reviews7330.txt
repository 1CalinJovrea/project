Could've been worse I suppose

I ended up enjoying enjoying 'Tales of Halloween' more than I expected
to - sort of at least. I had low expectations going in, then I didn't
enjoy the first segment and was really dreading sitting through nine
more of these things. Then things picked up. Then they went down hill
again, and then back up. It really was a roller coaster ride in terms
of quality. Breaking each of the ten segments down into simply good, average or bad
would go a little something like this:Sweet Tooth: badThe Night Billy Raised Hell: goodTrick: averageThe Weak and the Wicked: goodDing Dong: badGrim Grinning Ghost: averageThis Means War: badFriday the 31st: average (terrible story, but had the most effective
scare of the whole film)The Ransom of Rusty Rex: badBad Seed: badSo half of them were bad, three were average and two were good. If
you'd told me that would be the breakdown going in I probably would've
taken it. Not happily, but it's certainly better than all ten of them
being shocking. My advice would be to give it a miss though. Even in
the terrible world of modern horror there are better things out there
than this.
