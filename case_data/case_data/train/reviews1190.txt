Keeps You Guessing

This surprised me. A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know
all the answers (because we're such expert movie watches), then flips
it. Yes, it's a contrived subplot. And the reasoning behind this
terrorist act is goofy, BUT...it is a lot of fun. It interweaves a
really elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.Also, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion.
Think about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees
without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with
the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't
see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.Julianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role,
but one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane
bathroom.
