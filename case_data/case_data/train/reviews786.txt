Idiotic and boring!

The first 15minutes are rather good and gripping, then the plot becomes
weaker and stupider by the minute, it made me think they made up the
story as they went along filming.You've got one implausible fact and character after another, for one
the detective works alone, fails repeatedly to call for backup. The
many violent scenes seem purely voyeuristic and don't bring much to the
table.Jake Gyllenhaal's acting abilities are terrible (and not only in this
movie), he's got two facial expression either the doleful look or a
kind of smirk. I watched this movie after reading the NY Times review, please someone
fire the journalist who wrote it!
