LEGEND OF TARZAN--A Common Sense Review

It's simple. If what you want is a live-action version of the Disney
cartoon, or a remake of those old "Me Tarzan, you Jane" camp fests,
this isn't the film for you. If you don't like the character to begin
with, this isn't the film for you. The vast majority of critics who
thus far have given the movie unfavorable reviews fall into one or both
of these two categories. It's disheartening, and it's so obvious they
don't really know anything about the character and don't care enough to
learn.If, however, you have yearned for the day in cinema when Edgar Rice
Burroughs' epic hero is treated with the gravitas and respect he
deserves, and if you enjoy epic jungle adventure with a heart, by all
means GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It is phenomenally good! Think of it like you
would a dish of food. Let's say spiced curry. If you don't like spiced
curry, you won't like it no matter how well it is prepared. This movie
is for those who enjoy spiced curry. For those who love it, this is the
most delicious dish you're ever likely to taste.
