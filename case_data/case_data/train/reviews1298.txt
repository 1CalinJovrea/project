GoPro and Red Bull decide to make a film

If you like those 3 or 5 minute GoPro or Red Bull videos of people
doing extreme sports then you will certainly like most of the movie as
a lot of it is exactly that - and to be sure, those moments were pretty
cool to watch and very well done. Unfortunately, in between all of those moments is a pretty boring plot
line with characters that you never really care about.If you like mindless action (nothing wrong with that) then you will
probably like this movie - although most of the "action" is extreme
sports, not really guns.Apparently I have to write at least ten lines of text, but honestly
there isn't much more to say about the movie!
