Not as good as everyone is saying

This film continues a downward trend at Pixar, whose movies have
declined measurably in quality, especially since being purchased by
Disney.For a sequel, Monsters University makes an earnest effort, and is
reasonably watchable. But there's not enough meat in the haphazard plot
to really capture the viewer's imagination. The themes are childish and
familiar.Technically, the film looks good, as expected. The voice acting from
Crystal and Goodman are as good as you would expect.There's just not a lot else I can say about a sequel to a film which I
always thought was a weaker entry in Pixar's catalog.
