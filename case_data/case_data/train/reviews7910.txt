This is the stupidest most vulgar movie I have ever seen

I don't know how and why this movie was made. It's awful, plain awful.
And most of all it's filled with stupid, vulgar jokes and references.
I've seen bad movies before, but this one beats them by far. To make
things worse, a grown up beats a boy and they make it look OK. A teddy
bear is f.u... a girl and they make it look OK. The guy who has made
this movie, Seth something is really deranged to make up a story like
this. Stay away from this movie it's a complete waste of time. They
talk about the superman movie at the end and they say it's not good?
Let me tell you something: How about your movie a..h..o..l..e..s?Repeat to fill more line ------------------------ I don't know how and
