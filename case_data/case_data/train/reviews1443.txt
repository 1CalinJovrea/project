This Movie Is A Joke

Who are these people who think this was a good movie. This is just a
fashion show, plus showing nothing but a ridiculous plot and terrible
clothing choices. The sensitive lollipop kids got this movie so
politically correct, it is a horrible and painful movie to watch. As
for Tarzan, he even looks laughable in those pants swinging from vines.
For over 100 years Tarzan wore a loin cloth. Not this time, the
lollipop kids saw to that. A horrible movie on so many levels.What the
heck are these positive reviews for.Terrible terrible plot as
well.Tarzan is the king of the jungle. Who really cares if he is the
hope and ruler of the people in the jungle. I don't. Those animals
don't look real. They looked unreal.
