Delightful Viewing for the Holidays

Rise of the Guardians is a delightful film for the whole family,
telling the story of how Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy
and the Sandman protect children and they thrive on children's beliefs.
But when an old threat awakens the group needs to find a new guardian
to help them, Jack Frost (Chris Pine).Rise of the Guardians is a wonderfully animated film from first time
director Peter Ramsey perfectly mixes the comedy, drama and action. The
animation is fast and fluid they is great detail all of the scenes.
They are great little designs such as the Christmas Elves and the Tooth
Fairies.The comedy is strong, being very physical and visual whiles also have
some little jokes and character moments. It is a film that provides
plenty moments that will bring a smile to people's faces. It is all
weighted with the drama and the darkness of the villain, Pitch (Jude
Law). Screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire clearly follows the Hero With
Thousand Faces template as a reluctant hero having a destiny thrust
upon him and has to prove himself as well find out about his past
whiles Pitch reflect of what Jack Frost could become.The film assembles a great voice cast with Pine being perfectly cast as
the cocky, fearless Jack Frost whiles playing the character. Combined
with the visuals it is easy to feel for Jack's plight as he longs to be
seen by the world. Law gave a sinister performance as the voice, also
playing it straight and Alec Baldwin was having fun being a Russian
accented Santa.Alexandre Desplat supplies another excellent music, giving the film
both an epic score for scale of the action and giving the seasonal
sound when needed.Rise of the Guardians will certainly make Christmas viewing, working as
a fantasy drama and a comedy and it is easy for the young and the young
at heart can enjoy.I saw the 3D Blu-ray version and the 3D effort were very score.
