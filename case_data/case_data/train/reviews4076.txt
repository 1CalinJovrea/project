Honor is the central theme

As this is a fantasy retelling of a historic event it takes liberties.
However, for me it was about Honor above all else. I left the theater
not only entertained and with a sense of pride in the story telling. As
a veteran it resonates what I felt when we finished what we had to
accomplish. I did not read the reviews going into today's viewing,
however after I seen it I read the reviews and I think they got it
wrong. This movie is very good with a lot of understatement and
sometimes it gets fanciful but does not takeaway from the story
telling. I believe if you go a see it you will be surprised how good it
is.
