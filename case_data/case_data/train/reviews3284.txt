The Three Stooges (2012)

I've never really sat down and watched The Three Stooges but I'm
familiar with their work through their impact on popular culture.
Before watching this movie, I decided to give the original shorts a try
and I absolutely loved them. The humour is simple but brilliant. So it
made me slightly cautious before watching this, but it's absolutely
fantastic. The Three Stooges set out to save their orphanage by raising
over $800,000. They find themselves mixed up in an assassination plot
and Moe ends up on Jersey Shore. The actors and the Farrelly Brothers
have completely recreated the magic of the originals. The three stars
have their parts down perfectly, each of them doing bang-on
impersonations but not overdoing the mannerisms and voices. The
Farrelly Brothers keep the comedy innocent and even manage to bring
originality to having babies pee on people. The slapstick is fast and
well choreographed with a few puns thrown in for good luck. This isn't
trying to convert any new fans, and some old fans may be put off, but
they should know this is a perfect continuation of these characters.
The Jersey Shore scenes are very well done, using the cast as simply
punching bags. If you never liked this kind of humour, I doubt you'll
like this, but I adored it for its simplicity and innocence.
