The Director Does NOT Understand 47

Neither the directors nor the screenplay writers truly understand 47 or
the story behind the lone assassin. The same stands for Hit-man (2007)
played by Timothy Olyphant.Only a true fan can portray an accurate 47 or write a screenplay worthy
of a 10/10 game series.The original 47 will always be David Bateson in my eyes (both voice and
looks), and Vivienne McKee the original Diana (what a beautiful,
British accent!). Though I'm a purist, I have to admit that Marsha Thomason has done a
fantastic job in Absolution. She's also young and sexy, so she should
have been the obvious choice for the film. But guess what? Yup, we have a new Diana and she's Asian (a Chinese
model, to be more specific)!They've also failed to understand the relationship between 47 and
Diana. What a shame!My point is: if you want a genuine 47 film, choose those that were
involved from the beginning, those that actually understand and respect
the characters and the story.They must also recreate the game's thrilling soundtrack (Jesper Kyd),
beautiful scenery and, for god's sake, they must stop trying to turn 47
into Chuck Freaking Norris.47 is all about stealth.If you are a fan of the game series, you will be disappointed.
