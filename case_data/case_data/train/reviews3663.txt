The Scottish Play reduced to a garbled Glaurfest

Sadly, this film is a real pig's breakfast - Noggin the Nog meets Once
Upon a Time in the West!The scenery is bleakly magnificent, but Kurzel succeeds in making it
look more like a wet weekend in the Greenland of Erik the Red than 11th
Century Scotland. Battles take the form of mud-wrestling with daggers
in Braveheart warpaint. Michael Fassbender and most of the rest of the
cast toy with versions of mumbled Lowland demotic. Sadly, nobody seems
to have told Marion Cotillard, who delivers her lines theatrically in
mannered Shakespearean English, hurriedly gabbling her way through her
first crucial scene as if she were worried about missing her bus. Sean
Harris seems to base his performance as Macduff on the insight that his
character's name rhymes with gruff.As a mere thane, Macbeth appears to live in a flimsy shanty town in the
middle of a Highland peat bog. After he becomes king, he and his missus
are able to move into an elegant castle in the high Norman style. 'More
than enough motive for murder there I would have thought.On the positive side, Lynn Kennedy, Kayla Fallon, Seylan Baxter and
Amber Rissmann make a good job of the weird sisters, steering well
clear of cackling crone clich√©s. And David Hayman puts in a good
performance as Lennox, a man careful to stay on the right side of
power.But overall, it's a big disappointment. Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa
have both made much better jobs of filming the Scottish play.
