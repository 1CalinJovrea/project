Winner of worst picture ever goes to...

Sorry for the language, it's the only way to get the point across.I don't even know what to think, it's just so bad. I am speechless,
it's a masterpiece of ass. This is truly the citizen cane of bad
movies. Girls gone dead used to be the worst film I have ever seen
until I watched this, in the same freaking day, one of the worst days
ever. This is the toilet bowl where bad films do their business. So
here we go.First things first, it's not funny, it didn't even get a small chuckle
out of me. It proclaims it's offencive, but I call bull-SH-t, it's
disgusting and immature. The humour is something kindergarten students
would make up, hell, kindergarten students aren't even this immature.
The only time I'll agree with that little brat Chloe Grace MORETZ is
when she said "I want to kill myself". I mean F****CK!, I'm mad as
hell. Balls on babies faces and pooping on each other is what this film
has to offer. It had me rolling my eyes and sighing left and right.
It's just sick and degrading of the mind, it doesn't even try to be
funny, I spent more time watching the time go by than I did watching
the film. Batman the as-hole was the only time it even came close to
having something to work with. The IBABE was just pointless graphic
nudity, I feel sorry for those two actresses. Denis Quaid seemed to be
the only one who even tried. And the 17 minute long credits with the
cat jerking off, screw you for torturing me, film.Please, for the love of GOD, stay away from this film. I'd rather watch
baby geniuses, or garbage pale kids, or Santa Claus and the ice-cream
bunny, anything but this abomination. This film must suffer the
tortures of the damned. It must never harm anyone else, this film is
the pure essence of evil. It must be destroyed in the fires of mount
doom. It SUCKS SOOOO BAD, I can't take it. Please for the sake of your
humanity, stay away.
