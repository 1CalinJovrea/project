JJ should be banned from touching Star Trek....

I am a huge Star Trek fan, and really did enjoy the first instalment of
this re-boot when it came out a few years ago. So it was with very high
expectations that I went to the theatre on Saturday night to see "Into
Darkness". I saw it in 3-D IMAX.Well, what a disappointment. And it is pretty much completely the fault
of the director, Jar Jar Abrams. Abrams is a classic example of someone
that got too popular too quickly, as sooner or later his inexperience
and immaturity were going to screw it up for him unfortunately, Into
Darkness is where he finally messed up (although some might say Super 8
was that film).Basically, Abrams only knows how to make one thing: "Lost". Everything
else he has done since then has essentially been Lost, re-badged.The style of this one-trick-pony has just become tiresome, and oh so
predictable. Injecting drama into everything is hardly the right
formula for a sci-fi action flick, but it is like he couldn't help
himself.The resulting plot and dialogue was so very lame.I can't remember the exact lines, but let me paraphrase some for you:Kirk: "Spock! Damn you, why can't you feel any emotions???" Spock: "I
do Kirk! But I hide them coz my mother died and I was so sad". Kirk:
"You have always been my bestest friend!" Spock: "Don't die Kirk! You
are my bestest friend too!"Basically the entire film was ruined with terrible dramatic scenes and
tears and just really uncomfortable acting  this definitely ain't how
Star Trek should be.Abrams over-played the Kirk-Spock relationship so much I was almost
expecting them to have sex. Seriously.And of course there are some completely useless and WTF characters e.g.
Dr. Carol Marcus. I know she was in the original, but in this one she
basically had no role other than large boobs.Here is praying that Abrams doesn't get to direct the next one.
