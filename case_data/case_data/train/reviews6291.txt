Truly Dreadful

I found nothing to like about this movie. It is billed firstly as a
comedy and then as a drama. There was no comedy. I didn't laugh. The
script was dreadful. There was no drama. Why did anyone think it would
be a good idea to make this film? This is the worst film I have seen
this year. My only purpose in writing this review is to warn you not to
go and see this film.The acting was wooden. The story line weak. The soundtrack abysmal. The
dialogue dire. I was bored. I kept hoping the movie would have at least
one redeeming feature. It fails miserably on all counts. I want my
money back.
