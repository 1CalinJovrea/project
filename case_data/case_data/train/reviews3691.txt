Incredible. Filled with heart and soul. About a boy and his father and their painful journey.

I'm not a big movie person. Shoot me. I went to see this movie at the
Sundance film festival and I was blown away. I've never felt so
connected and heartbroken by a movie. This is an incredible film with
so much depth and meaning. I want to take everyone I know to this
movie. I want to watch it a billion times. Again, I don't like movies.
I highly recommend. (the one issue that I have found is that I can't
seem to find this film anywhere online to purchase it so that is quite
frustrating.)
