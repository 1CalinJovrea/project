Entertaining but dumb

The girl that everyone thinks is boring decides to take up and play the
game Nerve. Movie had a new idea that was well wrapped and kept it to
the end and at the same time it was entertaining, wild and sometimes
even tense. Dare that will change your life or not, no it's not it will
try to kill you eventually because people are stupid and want to see
other people doing stupid things and even pay for it. Movie wants to
live up to it's originality but it fails in projecting ideas of people
and how they behave in different environments and under other people
influences, but at the same time providing you with money. Emma and
Dave were entertaining, enjoyable to watch and did not disappoint. On
the other hand there were characters that weren't so much inside the
game but they could have contributed. It is very watchable and
entertaining with few twists and some tense moments. 2.5/4
