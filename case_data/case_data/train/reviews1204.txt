If you liked the previous films, why not enjoy this one also?

I don't get all the critical hate for this movie. What did anyone
expect? It's frickin' Kate Beckinsale in latex!!! What could be better?
This is terrible to admit, but I would pay Redbox $1.50 to watch Kate
Beckinsale cook breakfast if she was dressed in her latex catsuit. But
this movie is frickin' awesome! Sword hacking, vampires flying around,
werewolves transforming into monsters, and (spoiler) Kate gets
resurrected and comes back with frosty tips and new magic powers. I
almost didn't watch this because of all the bad reviews, but it's the
same old greatness as all the other films. Keep them coming! Kate
Beckinsale is 43 years old and never looked better, plus she kicks @$$
with Euro ultra-violence. When (spoiler) Semira (Lara Pulver) gets
stabbed through her mouth from behind as she enjoys the sun for the
first time was almost as great as the ending as Kate says "I have lived
for a thousand years, and I may live a thousand more..." I hope she
does. :)
