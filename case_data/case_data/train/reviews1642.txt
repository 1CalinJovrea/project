Pretension

This film is literally a 90 minute porno hiding behind a 2 hour art
film. Everything about it is bad. The editing is horrific, every single
shot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The script
is bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality,
there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well,
these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hired
because they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex on
film. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it's
homophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughs
where the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and if
you're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoy
giving people seizures with random flashing lights.Literally the only thing about this that's in any way well done is the
sex, and you can see better sex in actual porn films. Just go rent a
porno, you'll get more enjoyment out of it and you won't have to deal
with this horribly made 'film'.
