Not as bad as most think.

This movie was not a bad movie at all. if you are willing to kick back
for an afternoon and enjoy a flick, this is the one. there is not a
whole lot of expectations for this movie. Yes the first one was great
and the second ( which wasn't bad either even though it was a copy and
paste)barley made it through. this one takes on a whole new journey
that gave a decent conclusion and we get more in depth with the
characters. this movie still had decent comedy and a good story with
references from the first 2. even Chow has more screen time and we get
one more wake up scene at the end with another misfortune. just watch
it and don't expect too much.
