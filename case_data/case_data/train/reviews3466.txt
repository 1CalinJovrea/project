Produst placement and more product places

If you seen any of the other 3 movies you seen this one.On the other hand there is so many product placements in this movies It
does it make worse. There is even a two minute long light beer ad in
the middle of the movie. Of course 5 minutes later they're smashing
into a Victoria secret truck. Then they are drinking some Asian brand
milk. Before this there are half dozen car model ads. There are product
banners on all the buildings. They Drink brand soda with crazy long
camera holds. There is a product placement every 5 minutes and this is
no joke.Its also really weird how they say the girl is 17 years old over and
over. Then they have a "thing" about how its legal...I see no point in
this at all.I would skip this movie. I don't plan on ever seeing another one.
