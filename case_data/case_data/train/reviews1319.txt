Too many comparisons to other 'mummy' movies...

Disappointed...no real story line, predictable events, and choice of a
particular character line was lame... Lots of holes in the story...
Story jumped all over without real connections to plot... Characters
lacked depth... Would have liked to have seen more actual references to
Ancient Egypt that would have made the story line more believable. Not
a movie I would see again...
