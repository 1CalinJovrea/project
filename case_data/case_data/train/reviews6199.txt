I'm thinking of all the incredible scripts lying in drawers around the world...that will never see the light of a boardroom.

Oh I tried to ignore the propaganda, I really did, the first two films
of this trilogy are very good films (and not in a back handed "for a
summer blockbuster" sort of compliment), but this is an awful 150
million misstep. This is my 2nd review ever and I don't review things
unless they particularly rub me the wrong way.I'll be spelling certain words wrong to get around word gagging orders
on IMDb.War of the Planet of the Apes literally beats you over the head with
this defecation of the human spirit, I'm in awe of how blatantly
forward it is and I love good sci-fi commentary. (Battlestar Galactica
and The Wire are some of my favorite pieces of fiction)Here in this script we have no sympathy for Harrelson's and humanity's
understandable dilemma as to how to beat a virus that is causing humans
to lose their speech and higher faculties. They don't even have the
balls to have the apes wipe out what's left of the human army as that
would make the apes even more obviously terrible than they already are;
so they have a natural disaster do the job. The blond girl/child that
they carry with them goes to live with the apes, dumb(from the virus)
but happy.......and humanity's downfall is complete. Even though exalt
the child's beauty early in the film! But what is beauty without brains
ultimately?What great moral lesson was I supposed to glean? That humans are so
terrible that we should walk quietly into the night? Oh look the apes
are thick.....but some of them are funny Totally worth it!Conversations and plot points are so monosyllabic that it was almost
orgasmic when Woody Harrelson turned up to speak more than than the few
grunts that we hear up to this point and FINALLY gives us a reason to
care.Bonus points for cultural maxisms (spelled wrong to get around
censorship) is when the blond child cries over the ape who is killed
that she has known for all of two scenes but doesn't even flinch when
her father is killed by said group of apes.Go out to the beach with your kids, hell even go the beach or lake by
yourself, hell go further, go out when its raining and make some
memories.Also I'm not the slightest bit Christian and I can see this picture is
blatantly not only anti-Christian but to the non religious out there as
well its this......anti human, anti intelligence
