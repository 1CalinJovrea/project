Purge on Mofo.

This third chapter of the purge was OK, pretty much what you'd expect,
streets of rage, murder and mayhem. The pacing was good and it kept my
attention as much as a purge movie can. There were some cool deaths,
and lots of fodder whom met their fate. The one thing I didn't enjoy
was the consistent attempts to make it a reflection of our decaying
society. The reason for this being I watch a Purge movie for the things
listed above, not to try to be fooled into thinking it's some deep
artsy overview of politics in America. The same as when I go to a strip
club, I go for beer and nude dancing, not for a social commentary. So
maybe and hopefully in part four they drop this, or at least dilute it
to just a mention, and use the time they've saved for more crazy Purge
murdering; seeing as that's the whole reason to watch this type of
movie. If you like this type of film check it out. I give it a five out of ten.
