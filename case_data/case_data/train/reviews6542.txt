Cliché upon cliché upon cliché wrapped up in fantasy

If you're looking for a puff piece that will reinforce your lack of
knowledge about war and strengthen your already crystallized belief in
the Christian faith, then this is the movie for you. Poorly scripted
and filled with exaggerated stereotypical cliché lines and images, this
will thrill the war-mongering, Christian right. If, however, you understand even basic military concepts and aren't
interested in proselytizing as entertainment, then you may want to
steer clear (or at least have something interesting to do while the
movie is playing in the background).While the acting is quite mediocre, the poor scripting and absolute
litany of cliché is very boring. I was finding the first 45 minutes or
so okay, but once we got to basic training and action, it went down
very quickly
