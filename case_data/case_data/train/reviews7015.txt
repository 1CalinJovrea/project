Gross but totally worthwhile

One of the grossest films I've ever seen, delving into mysteries of the
female anatomy that, as a man, I might rather have left a mystery, but
it's wild and original and smart. If you have a strong stomach, it's
well worth attempting. Carla Juri plays a horndog 18 year-old girl with
a bad case of hemorrhoids. The problem is exacerbated when she badly
cuts herself shaving her butthole. She quickly enters the hospital for
surgery. During the recuperation, she starts a flirtatious relationship
with a cute male nurse (Christoph Letkowski) and attempts to use her
hospital stay to reunite her divorced parents (Meret Becker and Axel
Milberg). The butt stuff is not nearly the most disturbing part of this
movie, but it manages to be quite funny and charming even while it's at
is most horrifying. Unfortunately, when it arrives at a more dramatic
climax, it doesn't really feel earned, so the whole film deflates a
bit. Juri is absolutely amazing, giving one of my favorite performances
of recent times. I was a bit disappointed that the film was directed by
a man, given that it has a refreshing female point of view, but the
original novel was written by a woman (Charlotte Roche), and at least
one of the screenwriters was female, as well.
