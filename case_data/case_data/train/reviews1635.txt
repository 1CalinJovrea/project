what a waste of time

I thought the first movie was bad... but this, this is the definition
of a horrible movie, terrible acting with a stupid story and awful
humor, this crap didn't even make me laugh once. I advise you to not
watch this movie ever in your life unless you want to throw away an
hour and a half of your life. Adam Sandler just can't make funny movies
anymore. Do not watch this waste of time. I remember watching Kevin
James on the king of queens and that is a really funny show, I really
don't know why he is also constantly in movies that aren't funny. I
guess its a way to make a quick buck in the industry, stick to real
comedies, like This Is The End. Its a very funny movie :) Don't get me
wrong, old adam sandler movies are funny, but he doesn't have the touch
anymore.
