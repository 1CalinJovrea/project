Bad but in a really bad way

A film that fails the Turing test - in reverse. Or something. What I
mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled
over me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment,
watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting
to provoke a human-like response. Stuffed with algorithms culled from
proper movies and musicals, the computer has generated a script and a
set of scenarios based on user-preference and targeted directly at my
very own demographic! Its eerie; the songs sound like songs but aren't
quite, the dialogue sounds like people but not quite, nothing that
happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the
plot, the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn't, quite,
and the set-ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me
untouched and feeling slightly hollow. What has been thrown, hurled and
heaved at this film is Oscar-seeking acting, Oscar-seeking direction
and Oscar-seeking technical twiddling. And hey ho and guess what, it
got Oscars. Its the apotheosis of junk food, finally. You don't even
need to make the effort to chew; it can now just squirt directly into
you via the eyes and ears, a simulacrum of nourishment, over-flavoured
glop taking the name of real love, real music, real acting and real
life in vain.
