A piece of trash that cost $165 million...

Independence Day, which first came out 20 years ago, has a venerable
position as one of film's most enjoyable 'guilty pleasure' movies. Yes,
it's cheesy. Yes, it's ridiculous. But damn, it looked good and was
buckets of fun back then and still is. It didn't need a sequel, but I
was surprised to hear when one was in production and was mildly excited
at the thought.I didn't expect much, we've moved past being wowed by fantastic CGI
(indeed, people seem to appreciate much more the practical effects
which are put to good use in certain films and TV shows these days),
but I thought it'd be great to tune out and watch an even bigger ship
and even more aliens again attempt to take out an extremely patriotic
and stoic human race.By the time I left, I didn't know whether to laugh, cry, feel anger,
hate, one thing I did feel was ripped off... gone is the charm and
appreciable cheesiness of the first film, what we have as a replacement
are characters you can't possibly like, let alone root for, inane and
predictable self-sacrificial acts that fell flat and generated no
emotion whatsoever, scene after scene of horrible one-liners mixed with
'it was great working with you' exchanges of dialogue from the
indestructible arrogant young army types and attempts at humour in the
face of millions of human deaths, by-the-book disaster film rivalries
that turn into friendships which also ended up turning my stomach,
boring plot lines that resurfaced again and again which slowed down the
pace of the main conflict, are immediately forgettable, add nothing to
the story and went nowhere, an alien race whose entire existence is
based on militaristic invasion with 20 years to prepare continuously
showing their glaring ineptitude at said invasion rather than having
humans fight back against insurmountable odds like the first film, a
cheap-looking CGI alien queen with a shield that survives a nuclear
blast yet can't take a few shots from an aircraft based on the
technology from her own race who'd rather chase a busload of kids than
shoot down said aircraft firing at her, a coma patient who wakes up
after 20 years and can immediately make jokes and walk around with no
sign of muscle atrophy whatsoever, a disabled, insane war veteran who
can still perfectly fly a jet based on alien technology...I could go on, needless to say if you see this, be expecting every
disaster movie trope and clich√© with none of the charm and likable
humour of the first film, and just try and enjoy the above-average
special effects. Aside from that, there's really nothing else there.
