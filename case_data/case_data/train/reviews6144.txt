very entertaining

Am a big Johnny Depp fan, but wasn't sure if I would believe him as the
character of Tonto. Well, he did a fantastic job and Armie Hammer is
not bad to look at either. This was a very entertaining and feel-good
movie. My husband liked it as well. Knowing who the Lone Ranger is or
having watched him as a child is not pertinent in watching this film. I
don't recommend it for small children as there are some bloody moments.
In our stress filled lives, we all need an escape and watching this
movie made me forget all of my troubles and get lost in this story. I
really hope it does well and maybe even have a sequel. I recommend it
highly to everyone. Sit back and just be entertained.
