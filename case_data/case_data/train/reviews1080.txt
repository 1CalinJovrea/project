Boring and derivative

Safe House starring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds is just one of
those pointless boring generic and very derivative weak "action" films.
The performances are really not that good to be honest. The dialogue
and script is boring and clich√©. Now I am a fan of both Ryan and
Denzel's work in the films they have appeared in before, but this one
is just nonsensical. The plot is utterly muddled and horribly boring
and just downright uninteresting. The action scenes are just kinda take
it or leave it, nothing new at all to bring to the table. There isn't
anything new, exciting, or even mildly entertaining here. This movie is
just bad at engaging the audience, making the audience actually give a
crap what happens. I sure didn't care that happened. How could I??? I
was too busy checking the time on my phone LOL. Skip this one, save
your heartache. Don't say i didn't warn you. 1/10.
