rooney knocks it out of the park

this movie literally broke me. it is haunting sad uncomfortable and so
very realistic. it is claustrophobic as it takes place in his workplace
- toilet, kitchen, staff room. ben mendehlson is so good at portraying
a character that is hideous. rooney mara is terrific. i found it hard
to watch a film where the audience that i sat with laughed and
snickered at una's actions. to me they were heartbreaking. was it just
a case of being uncomfortable? i hope so. being a victim of this crime
should be tolerated in a better way. got to see this at a preview
screening. very uncomfortable and not 'entertainment' but very true to
the subject matter.
