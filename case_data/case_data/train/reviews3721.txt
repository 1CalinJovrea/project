Bad movie.

Absoute torture! Very very slow. Sad and depressing. I don't know how
this movie has such good reviews. It one of those movies that tries to
be intelligent but is absolutely a bad one. Good animation though.
Don't waste the two hours in your life, especially if its a weekend.
Bad acting. Bad story.
