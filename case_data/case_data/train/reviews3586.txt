Pacy Espionage Thriller

Good movie with so many twists & turns with a stellar cast. Excellent
performance by Noomi Rapace, ably supported by Michael Douglas, Orlando
Bloom, Toni Collette and John Malkovich. Director Michael Apted does a
very good in maintaining the tempo and action sequences are very sleek.
Sharp dialogues, pacy screen play and believable story line add value
to the movie,
