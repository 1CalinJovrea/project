The sequel that nobody asked for...?

First of all I guess most people didn't ask for a sequel of TMNT, come
on. Or at least, no one was excited about another one. But if you
decide to produce/direct a new one, why is this a copy/paste from other
movies?? Was it necessary?? The sound effects are EXACTLY THE SAME from
all Transformers movies. And also they called Jablonsky for the music,
which of course is EXACTLY THE SAME from Transformers. And the best and
most innovative idea: "a portal". LOL! Looks like the portal must be a
cast member from these type of movies. New ideas? Anyone? Michael Bay,
I assume you were too involved, stop doing this. Lack of compromise and
a bunch of lazy people have produced/directed this movie, which as you
see, wasn't necessary.
