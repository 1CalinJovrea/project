Much better than I expected

OK, so the trailers for this movie had made me very badly predisposed
towards it, being a really big fan of the originals (yes, Robocop 2 and
3 included). But I won an invitation for the first screening in my
country so I thought why not.Well, it is much better than I expected and than what the trailers
show. I won't go into spoilers, but my biggest issue with the trailer
was the fact that Murphy knows from the beginning what they did to him,
no memory erase and all. Well, I have to say that they are actually
handling this very well in the film and it's not that simple. It
actually sets the tone for the impressive second half of the movie.During the first half of the movie I was like "OK, it's a nice film but
not near what the first film accomplished". Well, it's like they heard
me, because the second half feels pretty much like the old ones!The script uses actually some of the best concepts of the first two
films. Joel Kinnaman does a pretty good job as both Alex Murphy and
Robocop. He doesn't manage to steal the impression that Peter Weller
made of course, but he truly does a good job. I hope we see more of him
in the future. All in all, to all those who, like me, had low expectations from this
film: give it a chance. It's much better than what the abysmal trailers
let you think. By the way, what is it with awful trailers to good films
lately? First Pacific Rim and now this...Oh, and there are sequel hooks for a movie that will be even closer to
the originals. Here's hoping...
