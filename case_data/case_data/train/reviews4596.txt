Eh to no good.

Contains spoilers!A C movie (watchable once) if the bellow issues are not a deal breaker
for you (it is for me).(Deal breaker summarized, I am not covering all the issues - already
too much of a rant) Movie is horrible; I am writing this comment during the movie. If you
have any respect for relationships this movie will crap on that (she is
specifies she is looking for the one).The sick feeling of watching the double dating, "I need to have sex
with them to decide which one is "the one"", was mentally impassible to
the point that I couldn't enjoy watching the rest of the movie once
"gotta catch em both, gotta try them at the same time" began. Few example gripes (different points):When Lauren found out that Tuck and FDR knew each other she got
indignant and said "This is just a game?, I trusted you!". Seriously,
the one double dating two guys that she thought didn't know each other,
and she gets mad? Tuck's ex-wife left him because he wasn't around as a travel agent, so
couldn't spend time with the family. At the end of the movie she finds
out about his real job and decides to get back together with him, his
job has never changed (so the time spent has never changed).They end the movie with FDR telling Tuck that he had sex with his wife,
before she was his wife. But, that Tuck never had sex with Lauren-
upholding the gentlemen's final agreement. Moral to this story, choose the better looking liar who is less of a
gentleman and can lay you first, your job title means more than
actually who you are or how much time you have and your mistakes happen
but everything will be okay if not better because of them.(1 rating is my opinion, but barring I had no issues with how they
dealt with relationships and reasoning I may have had rated it a 5)
