This horror flick about geriatric Baby Boomer chicks luring young Millennial Lads . . .

. . . into the musty Love Webs they've spun within their Old Folks
Homes is enough to give any young student the Heebie Jeebies. Playing
like an endless product placement commercial for fighting Middle Age
Spread with "Relaxed Fit" blue jeans, HOME AGAIN should prove to even
the most illiterate young rascal that "you can't go home again." Sure,
it might seem "nice" to go slumming in the Black Widow's web for a few
cheap quick tricks, but these fleeting thrills cannot be allowed to
outweigh the clear and present dangers of permanent foreign
entanglements among the Me Generation. HOME AGAIN's tawdry spectacle of
Octopus "Alice" clutching at boys young enough to be her grandsons with
all eight of her desperately grasping tentacles should prove enough to
put even the greenest hetero tenderfoot off his feed. Geezers have been
trying to get us to chuckle over "The Face" of the kid in HOME ALONE
for years. Now they can see "The Face" on our own mugs IF they trick us
into seeing HOME AGAIN!!
