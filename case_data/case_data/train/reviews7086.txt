Plastic fantastic - boring and unbelievable

If you want a movie about magicians, and are not 12 years old, I'll
recommend The Illusionist or The Prestige. If you like superhero movies
- watch one of those. This is kind of a mix.I guess what I'm trying to say is:If you like movies that are fast paced, where they try to cram as much
as possible into the movie in as little time as possible, kind of a
movie directed by a hamster or something, then you'll probably like
this movie.If you suspension of disbelief comes easy to you, then you'll also like
it. Because there is really nothing very believable in it. All the
magic tricks smell of CGI and "movie", and there is never doubt whether
it's gonna work or not.
