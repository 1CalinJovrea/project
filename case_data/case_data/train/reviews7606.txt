Mindless repetitive action...no story, no drama, he can kill 100 guys at the same time...

And all of this equals boredom. 2 hours of the same thing over and
over. A movie for young teens who judge movies as they do video games;
the more kills, the better. After the 30th guy got his head blown off,
it became totally boring to me. John Wick gets hit by a car 6 times,
gets thrown down a flight of stairs 10 times, gets punched and kicked
500 times...and yet he keeps fighting. He fights 30 guys at the same
time, with a gun or without, and he always wins. There is zero plot,
zero character development, zero drama...it's all mindless action. And
repetitive. Fistfights, guns, and cars. Nothing else. Nothing creative.
Well they tried to be creative a couple times...like wasting 15 minutes
with a woman doing an elaborate yet gross suicide...and for no reason
other than to slap something 'original' up on the screen. It was
completely pointless. How this movie is rated highly is beyond me. Like
I say, it must be young teens who judge movies on number of kills. PS -
I'm not exaggerating. The main bad guy simply puts a message into his
phone, and within 3 minutes, literally the entire city is out to kill
John Wick. So he has to fight 30 guys at a time, killing 500 guys
within 20 minutes or so. Mind-numbingly stupid and boring.
