At last, a vampire movie that doesn't suck

I'm in the twilights of my years and no longer part of "Generation
Twilight", so initially I wasn't so hot on a vampire mockumentary. The
idea seemed good enough for maybe 30 minutes of comedy, and not for a
full feature movie. But What We Do In The Shadows is brilliantly done
and really buckets of fun. It rides on the great actors, but also on a
wonderful script and an ingenious mix of wobbly "porno camera" and
perfectly placed special effects. The movie addresses various aspects
of being a vampire in New Zealand today:* sunlight leaking into your habitat* vampire wannabes hassling you* virgins can be incredibly hard to get by* Wellington itself feels so dead you constantly have to remind
yourself that you're actually undead* discrimination is rife against immigrants (especially blood-sucking
vampires from Transsylvania like yourself)* same goes doubly for Nazi vampires* feminist "familiars" (servants) constantly bickering while they're
ironing your frills* werewolves and vampire hunters constantly riding your ass* mortal friends and chums frequently dieing off* flatmates refuse to do bloody dishesSo you don't have to be part and parcel of the vampire hype to dig this
flick. It's simply unusually great comedy.
