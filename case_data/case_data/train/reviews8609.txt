At The Very Center Of It All

We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision
and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes.
Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there
is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly
compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why?
In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It
took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor,
acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally
believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew
Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain
terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!
