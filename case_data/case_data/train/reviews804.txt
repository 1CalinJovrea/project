An Entertaining Samurai Epic That Falls Short

47 Ronin is a highly fictionalized take on the story of the 47 ronin
who took revenge on a court official who had the 47's leader commit
seppuku. In the film, Keanu Reeves portrays Kai, a half-British
Half-Japanese outcast who is called upon by Oishi, the leader of the
47. The 47 seek revenge on Lord Kira, who also has an evil witch (Rinko
Kikuchi) serving under him, who killed their master.The movie itself looks absolutely phenomenal, with amazing visual
effects, an emotional and gripping musical score, and strong
performances from Keanu and Hiroyuki Sanada, who portrays Oishi. The
major problem that i saw with the movie was that, it was over way too
fast. They left out important character development for the witch and a
few other characters, which really could have added more emotional
flame to the film. Plus, the movie overall could have easily been
twenty, thirty minutes longer. If it were, i would say it can rank
alongside 13 Assassins and The Last Samurai. The script was
well-written in terms of dialogue (some cheesy lines), but the overall
script was devoid of real depth and thought. Then, Carl Erik Rinsch's
directing was actually pretty good, but had a few too many cut-aways.47 Ronin is an extremely action-packed samurai/fantasy epic that is
something you don't want to miss on the big-screen (for a cheap price).
Though, if you want to see something award-worthy in terms of writing
and directing, hope for a Director's/Extended cut on disc, for you
won't find it here. But great performances, visual effects and emotion
really help make this movie stand out, even with The Desolation of
Smaug as competition.
