Not great, no point or plot or ending

They spent 12 years filming but no actual thought on the plot or
ending. Afters 2 hours I finally realized this movie was never gonna
get to a point or climax. And it ended with nothing. If you want to
watch just to see the actors age and their acting improve then yes
watch. But don't watch if you need a story, your not gonna get one
here. It was basically a movie about a family, no happy ending no
lessens learned, just life how it goes, super boring and slow. I think
the producers could have given it an ending or a meaning of something
or the kid learn a lesson or anything. But that didn't happen, it just
ended.
