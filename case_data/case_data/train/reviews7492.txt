I loved it!

As usual, I had a ball watching Tyler Perry's movie. My only critique
would be that my own daughter, Makayla Jones (ll), was not a part of
the awesome cast. The movie was short and fun. It was something that
both children and adults could enjoy and it included characters that
could relate to the culture of Black America...and our millennial
generation, lol. It is my hope that Tyler Perry continues to produce
movies of such to keep his followers jolly. I still have a few of the
former Tyler Perry movies to catch up on, but there are not that many
left to compare. Thanks for being so creative and hilarious with your
movies, and thanks for not making it so scary that one would have bad
dreams. In this case, we would beat-up the bad guys in the dream.
