I wanted to like it, I really did

I'm a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. Its what I read and what I love to
watch. This movie franchise took a great premise, swallowed it whole
and then charged movie goers to look at the digested remains for 2
painful hours. Yeah, I'm comparing this film to fecal matter. It's
harsh but fitting. This movie is so terrible that it inspired me to
write my first review on IMDb. Which is saying something, being that I
also saw After Earth and this is my 1st review.The dialogue hurt my ears, Woodley and James acted as if acting as
actors who had no idea what acting was, the action sequences were weak
at best, and then they wrap it all up with a predictable safe ending.Basically, if your IQ contains 3 digits, run from this movie. Simply
Horrendous.
