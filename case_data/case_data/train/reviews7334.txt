Adorable!

The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I
read the book, but I loved the adaptation. What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote her
own screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paper
to screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't really
needed to move the story along. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facial
expressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of
award all on their own. I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.Don't listen to critics and go see this movie.
