Unnecessary Remake

Even though i went in to the movie pretending i was watching an
entirely original movie, this remake was awful. The plot was ALMOST the
same but he changed things that shouldn't have changed but kept small
things exactly the same. The ending was a "fairy tale" type ending to
please the audience. SHarlto i usually love his acting but in this
movie he was almost like a cartoon character villain. Lee also
overemphasizes the blood and gore. The fight scenes almost look all way
too choreographed. Overall the plot changed made the movie less
believable for me and ending definitely was a way of "satisfying" the
audience.
