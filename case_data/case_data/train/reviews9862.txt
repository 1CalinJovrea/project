judi dench is marvelous

This has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year.Judi
Dench is peerless as Queen Victoria.She is the queen personified.We can
see that whatever understanding that she has of her Indian subjects
will pass with her and that the ingrained attitudes will eventually
lead to Independence and loss of Empire.A really excellent film.
