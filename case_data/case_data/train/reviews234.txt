The Age Old Tale

Humans generally have a superiority complex that makes them often
consider all other forms of life as inadequate. Civilization has
exemplified the mass exploitation and selfishness humans are capable of
in the past, and present, on numerous occasions. The Planet of the Apes
series delves on this complex. It displays the vulnerabilities of the
human race and how nothing is to be underestimated.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes will surely entertain. As the sequel to
the last instalment, we follow Caesar in his new habitat following the
human pandemic instigated by the Simian influenza. In a world where the
human population is depleted and infrastructure collapsed, society is
broken apart and in a fragile state. With stubborn and selfish humans,
the fate of humanity does not rest in good hands. Watching this film, I cannot say there ever was a moment of dullness
nor boredom. Though, for me, there was nothing exceptional about it.
The plot is one that we have come to expect and the CGI was certainly
state of the art. Putting this aside, it is the story of Caesar and the
strive for freedom of all that captures this movie's true essence.
Empathizing with these intelligent beings no longer being the tools of
humans is one to both support and fear. It is this unique mixture of
elements that make Dawn of the Planet of the Apes so touching yet
stimulating.This is a movie I'd recommend all to see since it offers a perspective
many contemporary films fail to produce.
