Scraping the bottom of the barrel

They are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this movie. Please
don't waste your time or money watching this. It shouldn't even be
called a film. What do we call it then? They really stoop low, so low.
Stooping low is necessary when there is really ZERO content. The
Dictator is VERY POORLY DONE. There is nothing to laugh about. It's NOT
FUNNY. The film is a disgrace. It is truly unbelievable what goes out
to market these days. Who approved this and how could it ever have been
approved? I felt embarrassed for the actors. When movies are this bad
customers should have the option of getting their money back. The movie
goes from scene to scene to scene. There is no consistency and it is
complete nonsense. In the previews they'll show you what you will think
is funny. I thought other reviewers were exaggerating as to how low the
film stooped, but they were not. The actors who were paid for this film
along with the producers and directors should refund the viewers who
were totally disappointed with it.
