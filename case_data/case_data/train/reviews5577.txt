A Fans Review!

Vampire Academy. It's not the best adoption but its mostly true to the
book. (A few of my favorite scenes were not in it but it's an adaption
so I understand the changes.) The beginning felt a little rush compared
to reading the book but it stuck true to the book! But the middle and
end did it sweet justice. The fighting scenes were bad ass and the
elemental magic...sweet. There was a lot of humor and changes to the
time line but I liked it. I yelled at the screen a lot though, as an
avid book fanatic and a college student for film directing and screen
writing. All over though, I love the movie as much as the book!! And it
is my favorite book series of all time ;). It is NOT like Twilight--we
do not have teams and our vampires do not sparkle. The Strigoi are the
most typical vampire stereotypes, the Moroi feed off of blood but are
mortal, and the Dhampir is a half Moroi, half human. The Dhampir's do
not feed off blood. The characters in the movie were so much like the
character in the book and the fans will be happy with the cast and the
movie! :)Even if you are not a fan of vampires, give it a shot! It might
surprise you. I highly recommend seeing the movie. It has something for
everyone and if you don't like it well that's on you. You never know
until you give something a shot so why not give this movie a chance?
