war is a business, and we're the commodity

I don't know enough about the original story to determine the accuracy
of Todd Phillips's "War Dogs", but it's an enjoyable movie. The tricks
pulled by David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli just go to show that the
people in the business of weapons have no principles (even violating
arms embargoes). They're out to make money by any means necessary. To
be certain, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved quite profitable
for weapons manufacturers. The mistake that Packouz and Diveroli made
was getting caught.It's not a masterpiece, but it does a respectable job showing the
degrees to which these types go to enrich themselves. A very slimy
world indeed.
