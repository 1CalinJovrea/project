Avoid and you will be happier!

Usually when the director happens to be one of the writers too, you can
expect such heights of boredom and nonstop drivel. Don't get me wrong,
I like this genre which I call 'yappy dee yap' movies. Movies which are
about lengthy blabber, random tantrums and pointless conversations.
Movies with no backbone except for chit chat. I loved the following:- "Before Sunset" which seemed to have a point or driving towards one.- The excellent "2 Days in Paris" and its inferior sequel "2 Days in
New York." - Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris." - "The Trip (2010)" with British comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon.But "Before Midnight" is just too much. Every 3 minutes I felt like
screaming "Will you please SHUT UP!" This is not a good sign. It
reminded me of young me being stuck at the dinner table with boring
self-castrated adults. Every now and then my imagination worked on how
the movie would greatly improve if a tractor rammed into the (clich√©
cute) twins or if the roof collapsed on the old people at the lunch
table. How about if the couple brought varying degree of bad luck
everywhere they went but they didn't know it was their fault until it
struck midnight and a giant meteor fell on their head? That alone would
have kept my interest up instead of downward sloping.I think the yapping was way over the top this time and nothing really
happened in the movie. It's crossed the line of truly annoying and
irritating. Even the nude topless scene was too much and disconnected
with the rest. I cannot connect with the characters, their life or the
story. If that couple were my friends, I would never invite over and
permanently hide their status updates on social networks.
