The folk scene without the folk or the scene

It's amazing how dazzled one can be by so very little these days.
There's very little here--a struggling unpleasant man who sings his
heart out about standard "folk" catastrophes but can't take care of
himself as he goes about damaging others, and animals as well. He's
your 50's college roommate who cooks on a hot plate and sings about
historic heroic starvations. The in- and-out mythic references are
unfocused and a game for undergraduates. When the Coens go flat it's
not even E flat. We're forced to watch this guy's face for an hour or
so without a clue to his demons; he's just a jerk, a driven jerk but a
jerk nonetheless. Best part is the recreation of the early 60's in cars, atmospheres, but
then John Goodman shows up from "Where art thou?" and spoils the
realistic angst. Sorry, but the early folk scene wasn't this creepy and
Bob Dylan didn't rescue it from oblivion or creepiness. Without a
political or sexual agenda (it got you chicks) it did flounder, but it
needed an audience for shifting values and social awareness. One's
suffering couldn't just be for one's art, but had to have a social
dimension that this guy can't see. A genius before his time? Hardly--a
guy who can't take care of himself, or his friends or family or
lovers--anything but "folk." The times they were a changin', but this
guy's a talented pathetic scrounge and lacks the connections to others
and society that might propel him to sing for the changing times.This might be the ethos of the Coens and their films themselves--within
society but not of it. Their characters struggle with their messy
quirky lives but we see them as curiosities rather than representatives
of anything important. There's a certain clown show aspect to their
films, which creates their charm and fun but little else.
