A good idea that ended up ruined.

This low-budget film starts from a promising premise: the legendary
quest for the Philosopher's Stone, allegedly discovered by a medieval
alchemist, Nicholas Flamel. However, the whole story is based on a
script so ambitious that it ends up being its own enemy. One of it most
obvious mistakes is to arbitrarily mix historical elements, such as the
unlikely link between a medieval pseudo-scientist (who, at most, would
know some Latin) and a Persian stone tablet in Aramaic, an absolutely
unknown language in medieval Europe. The use of Paris catacombs as a
movie location was an excellent move, adding value and interest to the
film but, despite the gloomy atmosphere, it failed to create tension.
The scares repeat themselves, successfully, but nothing more. There is
no real fear or suspense. The use of an old kabbalistic axiom (as above
so below) is determinant for the plot and the end of the film, always
having in mind the words and their meaning (difficult to understand for
those who are not fans of the occult). Perdita Weeks is the lead
actress and does a fairly reasonable job, but the rest of the cast does
not help. Cinematography is bad, but I think it was purposeful because
it's supposed to be a found-footage or something based on unedited
recordings.
