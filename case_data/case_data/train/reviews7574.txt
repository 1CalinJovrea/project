Do not waste a single minute of your life watching this movie

The worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Truly disgusting on all levels. Makes you wonder what kind of world
this is that we live in. There was a line at the customer service desk - everyone asking for
their money back.I was thinking that a support group might be necessary for those
subjected to the disgraceful chain of events that took place in this
horrid movie.You'd be better off staying at home watching a blank screen than to
watch a single minute of this waste of a film.P.S. I have never written a review. We were so disturbed we went to a
local bar and got drunk!
