Disappointing!

I saw the movie in 2D but to be honest, the low rating was not because
of the lack of 3D but rather that it was very disappointing. I felt
like the movie had a good storyline but it only touched on segments of
it rather than expand on it. The Cryogenics with a 12 yr gap did not
make any sense. If the little girl was her daughter than how come she
had no memory of giving birth. If the hybrid was a test tube baby she
would have still come from somewhere, unless the female scientist who
looked after the child was the real person who gave birth to her? Also,
when Selene met with Thomas, he knew who she was and that she was
responsible for killing elders but it didn't really touch on how he
knew even though he acted like he was an elder which I do not think he
was. As for me, the special effects were so/so but it was more like
watching the first Matrix movie. The scene where she storms the office
building and attacks the guards was very similar to scene in the
Matrix. It did not really leave much for the imagination.Towards the end of the movie where the bad guys get the upper hand and
the plot of the movie, it is short lived. The ending of the movie was
like when the Empire Strikes Back ended. Just when the movie was
getting good, and they followed a lead to meet with her hybrid lover,
the movie ended! Guess there will be another sequel! When the movie
ended, I looked at my watch and realized that it was just under and
hour and 1/2. There was so much more they could have done with this
movie and cranked out another 20-30 minutes to complete the storyline.It just seemed as if they filmed the movie in a couple of months. I do
not understand how there was a budget of $70 million when the special
effects seemed below par. Yet, Underworld 3, was budgeted around $35
million.Naturally, Kate Beckinsale looked as sexy as ever, which probably the
highlight of the movie.
