Plot? What plot?

Watched this film last night. We had high hopes of it - 8.2 on IMDb is
a pretty good rating. We both like sci-fi and I thought it was an
interesting premise. Guy falls in love with his computer - what a
fascinating background for a story.But it turned out that was it - that WAS the story.Nothing. Else. Happened.This was just awkward, boring, dull, terribly terribly slow,
uncomfortable. There is zero action, zero plot, zero interest. Nothing
actually happens. Actually that's not true - about the only vaguely
interesting thing that happens is when his computer gets him a book
deal, but even then that just gets dropped - they don't do anything
with it, except he unwraps his new book. There are side characters but
they don't have stories either. Guy he works with gets a lawyer
girlfriend and they go on a date. Best friend Any dumps her husband
over a row about her shoes. That's it. That's their stories.And what the heck was the thing with the dead cat?I did think the acting wasn't bad, but as a story it was shockingly
bad.
