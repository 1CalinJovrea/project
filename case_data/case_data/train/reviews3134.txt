The best movie so far for 2013

I went into "Mud" with no idea of what it was about. I immediately had
flashbacks to "Stand By Me". That said, I think "Mud" is a better
movie. I thought the acting was exceptional, the photography both real
and lush, the lighting well done, and the story was fresh, real, and
terrific. The direction MUST have been terrific also, as the result is
a near-perfect film that everyone can and should enjoy. The 2 young actors (playing the characters of Ellis and Neckbone) were
amazing -- especially Tye Sheridan playing the lead character, Ellis.
Sam Shepherd was great as Ellis' "assassin" neighbor (and longtime
friend of Mud), the actor who played Ellis' dad was TERRIFIC and stole
every scene he was in. Reese Witherspoon was only on film for perhaps
10 minutes but she was perfect as Mud's white-trash girlfriend. And
this was Matthew McConaughey's best job EVER. (Until now only his role
in The Lincoln Lawyer was good to my mind, and I was tired of his
constant good-old-pretty-boy act in everything else!) I hope it was not
made too early to get consideration for the Academy Awards next year.
Although it's a lowish-budget independent film, "Mud" is sure to become
a classic! I saw it the other night with my wife... and I plan to see
it again soon with my teenage son.
