A solid entry after decades

Honestly though I was stoked about this, knowing that the last movies
have been total garbage, I didn't lose hope. This definitely has the original TCM vibe in it. The colours,
cinematography. While it lacks the gore, it's still a solid movie
showing how it all started. Probably the biggest flaw is that it lacks
the silent tension the original had. However still more effective movie than the Beginning, 3D. Recommend!
