Stylish, but familiar

"Overdrive" seems familiar. The plot seems familiar. Scott Eastwood
looks very much like his father. Freddie Thorp looks like a young John
Rhys-Davies. It feels a bit like one of those movies where the
producers have access to some unique prop or location and decide to
make a movie around it, like "Corvette Summer" and "The Italian Job."
Here, the producers have access to some fabulous locations in France
and a couple of collections of exotic automobiles. The autos in
particular provide eye candy, but also a distraction. You know when the
bad guys shoot at a one- of-a-kind car valued at tens of millions of
euros, they won't put any holes in it and the car isn't about to crash
or blow up, as losing just one of the cars would double the cost of the
film. But it makes up for it with some other outrageous car chase
scenes. And the fact they are careful with the cars suggests they are
authentic and not replicas. The film is not cathartic or cerebral. The plot isn't Byzantine. The
romances aren't torrid. The characters aren't exactly multi-layered. It
isn't particularly exciting, tense or thrilling. But it works well as
low-involvement cinematic eye candy.
