Hope there'll be no "Resurgent" after this

The movie is very bad. fell asleep several times. I liked the first
one; not one of the best ever, but it was fine to watch. This didn't
capture my attention one bit. Didn't like the visual effects too, nor
the atmosphere of the movie. The story is boring and some of the scenes
are ludicrous. I didn't see it till the end, hence I don't know if the
final suggest another sequel. Hope not. I don't know what's happening,
but generally the sci-fi movies are getting worse. The plot, storyline,
or whatever are close to nonsense or, at least, vague and superficial,
and the action is all over the screen. I used to like watching
"superman" or "spiderman", now: avengers, thor, ant-man, transformers
are full of crap. Explosions over explosions, shitload of fights that
makes me look somewhere else than the screen. Expecting "tomorrowland"
now. Hope I don't get frustrated again.
