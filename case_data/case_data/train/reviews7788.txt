C'mon Really??

You have Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey 8 books of material, and you
put together a 95 minute movie? I absolutely hate that critics have to
hold their reviews on these movies so the public cannot be forewarned.
Its like restaurant critics not being able to tell you the food is dog
meat until after you place your order. Then there are those fans who
loved the books, so they delude themselves into thinking the movie is
good enough. Frankly the history of Stephen King material and film is a
mixed bag. The Shining is obviously superior, but when's the last time
you dug out Dreamcatcher? It just continues to shock me how inept some
of these productions are.
