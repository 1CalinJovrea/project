Worth the watch!

This movie will get your pulse up fast, revealing the "horror" very
early on. Interestingly enough, it keeps that pulse up throughout the
movie despite of this. The concept of something that can only appear
and be seen if it's dark (and with a somewhat supernatural ability to
destroy light bulbs) is bound to lead to a jump scare or ten whenever
it appears. Towards the end you've almost gotten so used to it that the
scare effect wears off a bit, and is one of two reason I don't rank
this a 10. But thanks to a good story and good actors, the movie still
holds its ground to the very end.The characters are really good, well written and performed, and with a
young boy that if not before, totally kick started his future acting
career with this movie. Who doesn't love a young prodigy? The plot has
some weight and emotion to it, and with a solid ending that wraps
things up in a much more satisfying way than most similar movies.The other small drawback with this movie for me was mostly because of
slightly unrealistic behavior from our main characters, occasionally.
Like when miss heels from Jurrasic World is worried that when she
releases T-Rex it won't be able to follow her if she runs. So, she
waits for it to come close, walks for a bit, then runs. Those kinds of
unrealistic behaviors. But I've seen much worse, and this movie doesn't
take the "unrealistic" very far, or often, so I suggest you just put
this on and roll with it!All in all you get everything you want from a jump scare movie with
Lights Out, with a good plot and good actors that deliver, and a scare
factor we all can relate to. You might not be so happy with turning of
your lights going to bed later that night, so if you have a weak
stomach you might wanna sit this one out.
