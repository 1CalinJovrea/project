Easily the worst full feature film seen in my memory, and that in the
context that I patiently allow my wife to make most film choices, many
that I might otherwise skip.Here, every event, every maudlin word can be predicted. Admittedly the
context, the tsunami constrains the plot, but that does not make it
forgivable. Makes for a constant dread of the next events, the next
dialog.I enjoy both complicated, slow drama, and an occasional action film. My
point is here that my film diet is varied, and it is not some genre
bias.What is most difficult to fathom is the immensely strong 7.6 rating,
many thousands of voters. Many films attain a high early glow that get
tempered in time, settling eventually to a less exuberant level. This
is a 2012 film, currently 2013, but the high rating is still
incomprehensible.
