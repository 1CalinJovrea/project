Horribly disappointed

Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments is one of my favorite series and I
was so excited to see this movie. I've been to plenty of book-to-movie
showings, so I knew not to expect the exact same thing, but regardless,
I went in with high expectations. The beginning was... weird (and out
of order, but that's just my OCD, no biggie). However, this movie was
so horribly different from the book that it lost all of it's value. I
don't just mean the events were slightly moderated to save time, I mean
they changed the entire plot. Jace wasn't terrible- could've been
cockier, Clary was horribly over-dramatic, Magnus was expressionless,
and they managed to ruin my favorite character: Valentine. He became a
bland, one- sided villain, unlike the ingeniously dynamic character
Clare made him out to be. The movie had changes in it that ruptured the
foundation of the book and a lot of what it stands for, ruining the
ingenuity of the plot and the world that Clare built which had me so
enraptured from the beginning. It's a shame because they had such
potential with this movie. I still can't understand how they could take
such a great story line and decide that it was only acceptable to warp
it to a point beyond recognition....
