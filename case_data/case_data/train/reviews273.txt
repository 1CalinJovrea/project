Pigs on a Wing

Much like the concept behind Pink Floyd's "Animals" album, and with the
great choice of music throughout this unsung gem, I was just waiting
for the Song "Pigs" to start playing in the one of the scenes. This film has great production, Acting and covers the rampant
corruptness in many of our cultural accepted norms. (even the "Animal
Liberation Front" shows some corruption, patterned obviously after
PETA)Great Film, Well done. (NETFLIX is competing with the big boys at a
fraction of the cost) Glad to see films like this finding the light of
day. Go See It, especially if you are a animal lover and/or sympathizer
