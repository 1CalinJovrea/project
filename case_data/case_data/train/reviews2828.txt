biased review of Wolverine fan

I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker
installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in
favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I
thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy
tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He
shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than
previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him
operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any
moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting
viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found
interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who
provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I
found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after
all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.
