An ambitious Australian offering

If you were judging Boys in the Trees purely on ambition and the
ability to dream big, debut Australian filmmaker Nicholas Verso would
be receiving top marks.A truly unique moulding together of 90's skateboarding culture, a
fantastical imagining of an Australian landscape were Halloween is just
as big as an event as it is in the USA and a confronting examination of
growing up and evolving into an adult, Trees cares little that its
budget is smaller than most films catering allowance and goes for
broke, without sadly grabbing hold of what its striving to grasp.As is the case with most directional debuts, clear components of
Verso's film that needed fixing was a script polish and a tight edit,
as this near 2 hour long film can at times drag as we become passengers
to thoughtful teenager Corey's Halloween night spent with bullied youth
and one time childhood friend Jonah, as the two reminisce and go on a
curiously long walk around the neighbourhood before Verso's film
finally clicks into another gear in the conclusive stages, but it's too
little too late to save Trees from its inability to click in its drawn
out middle section.It's a real shame for the film and even as someone reviewing the work
Verso has delivered as there is so much "could have" been in this film
and Verso's hand behind the camera and work with his young cast
showcases a real potential to become one of the nation's real
filmmaking rising stars.At its best (which is often in brief, fleeting circumstances) Tree's
evokes works like Donnie Darko, Brick and even Netflix's breakout hit
Stranger Things, all the while dealing with some extremely heavy topics
that other films may tend to shy away from and the performances from
young lead Toby Wallace and supports from Gulliver McGrath and Mitzi
Ruhlmann are noteworthy in their above average handling of roles that
would often be poorly played by local performers.Final Say Â– Saying to much about Boys in the Trees plot line, that unravels at an
unfortunately misguided pace, would ruin a tale that will surely find
an audience not only locally but abroad and despite Verso failing to
maximise his original and ambitious idea, this coming of age experience
suggests a bright future for all, even if this effort is a
disappointment.2 dead birds out of 5
