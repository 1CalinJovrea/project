Little Boy Reels At The Foot Of The Bed

I am arguably one of a handful of people who have never read a single
word of A.A. Milne. I've been an avid reader all my life yet somehow
Milne eluded me. I recall a family gathering when I would have been
around ten and noticing a cousin with a copy of 'The House At Pooh
Corner'. I assumed it was a one-off ephemeral as a butterfly ... I was,
hover, conversant with lines like 'if I open my fingers a little bit
more I can see nanny's dressing-gown on the door ...' and 'They're
changing guards at Buckingham Palace ...' but made absolutely no
connection with Winnie The Pooh. So I came to Goodbye Christopher Robin
in more or less ignorance. My first impression was of lyrical
photography, next it struck me as Merchant/Ivory lite and I think both
impressions hold up. As a study of a dysfunctional family it was also
up to snuff; traumatised father, hedonistic bitch of a mother, small
boy in the middle. It was all rather well done and I did learn that
Milne senior had been a successful journalist and playwright long
before, like Algy, he met a bear.
