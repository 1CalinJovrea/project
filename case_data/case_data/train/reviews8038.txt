Historically inaccurate

A bland paint by numbers thriller with just one good scene, it tries
not to be too flashy but ends up being boring. The characters are
straight out of the stereotype box. Disowned by many of the SAS men who
were actually there as inaccurate. An important moment in modern
history tarnished by this film but not destroyed. If you know nothing
about princess gate it might be a reasonable late night film when there
is nothing else to watch.
