A Covenant between Bankers and Hollywood to Fleece the Public

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WASTE GOOD MONEY ON THIS UTTER RUBBISH.Another rip-off designed to make a few richer and steal two hours from
movie-goers lives.The entire movie is shot in the dark...the use of shaky cam is
diabolical and the speed at which scenes change is mind boggling.All this combines to ensure that you will have no clue what is going
on.There is no point in commenting on the acting, as it would be
impossible for any actor to perform under this direction and
production.You will not forgive yourself for wasting your precious life on this
absolute rubbish.
