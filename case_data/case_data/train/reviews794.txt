Funny and well acted without a story

I gave this movie such a high mark because it made me laugh like I
haven't laughed in a while at a movie. It does not have an intricate
plot-line, it is predictable but has great lines.I will say this. With any other actors than Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L.
Jackson this would have been a flop. You can see the humor that
Reynolds has in Deadpool and that Jackson has in Django Unchained here.
I think this is what I liked the most.They also have great chemistry
together, I personally would not have guessed this, but now it makes a
lot of sense.It has interesting action scenes. I personally am not really into that
so it makes no difference to me, but they seem pretty good.They also
don't go overboard to make it not credible, but exaggerated enough that
it is funny.It is easy, it does not make you think a lot afterwards but it
entertains you and I think this was the role of this film. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.
