As funny and charming as the first

As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how
the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would
pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with
Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are
rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the
case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the
first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our
heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt
Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off
Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add
the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on
Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the
first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's
hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the
studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot
to say.
