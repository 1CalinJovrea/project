So why don't you cry?

The movie doesn't touch you at the right level so you don't cry. It's
the kind of story you know how it has to end so you're waiting too long
for Paige and Leo to get back together.The film requires plenty of just go with it. From the "here's a reason
to take off my seat belt" to the tap to the back of the car that
launches Paige through the windshield, things seemed so written. Add to
this Leo showing up in the hospital with a tea shirt cut like, and in
the color of scrubs to look like a doctor.The story about what turned Paige into a rebel complete with tattoo
seemed forced. If she was upset with her parents, why didn't she
maintain a relationship with her sister?Good performances make it watchable especially if you don't think too
much. Jessica Lange is well past the stage of King Kong bait. No reason
to see it in a theater, wait for cable or DVD.
