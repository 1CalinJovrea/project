return of the real horror

Finally a real horror in a long time! No more bloody, slasher crap.
This is how the really scary movies were made. Suspense and fear are
created by great cinematography and music.The pace of the movie is slow and almost no to few special effects are
present. I surely hope that this movie hails the return of the great
horror genre: we are scared of the unknown and not violence for the
sake of it.All the young actors are promising, they really pulled it off. Kudos to
the director who also wrote the script, I am looking forward to his
next movie.Go see it, you won't regret it!
