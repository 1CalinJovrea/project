A Disappointment

The premise for this film is fantastic, the cast appears great, and its
a movie that wants to be seen. However, it is a major disappointment.
The whole concept of hit men and time-travel is intriguing- and the
concept of your future self being the target, even more so, but this,
in truth, is not what the film ends up being about. In a Terminator
esque manner Bruce Willis turns his antics in the past to a 'save the
future' kill quest wanting to destroy a future-crushing "rainmaker"
(whom we know very little about and have little incentive to want
killed) whilst he is still a child. The aforementioned has 'TK'- the
films terms for Telekentic powers- and this is barely covered and feels
like one idea too far, almost an add on that is ultimately crucial to
the narrative but is not presented to us enough. In all the film leaves
you dissatisfied, feels clunky, and disappointing as on paper it could
have been so much better..
