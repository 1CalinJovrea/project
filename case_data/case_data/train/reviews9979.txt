Has Some Fun Moments. What Else Did You Expect?

'Keeping Up with the Joneses' is a fair Spy-Comedy, that has some fun
moments. Its got some laughs, despite all the silliness around. What
else did you expect anyway?'Keeping Up with the Joneses' Synopsis: A suburban couple becomes
embroiled in an international espionage plot when they discover that
their seemingly perfect new neighbors are government spies.Zach Galifianakis, Jon Hamm, Isla Fisher and Gal Gadot are the true
strengths of 'Keeping Up with the Joneses'. Zach is happily stupid &
raises some good laughs, Fisher is fabulous, Hamm is anything but a ham
& Gadot is the hottest thing you'll see on the big screen in a long
time. The 4 talented actors sportingly deliver in this predictable
comedy, showing us their potential yet again.Michael LeSieur's Screenplay is fair, with some hilarity in store,
while Greg Mottola's Direction is satisfactory, at best.On the whole, 'Keeping Up with the Joneses' is a great way to kill a
dull afternoon.
