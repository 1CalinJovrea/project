A 2 hour video game cut scene

Not sure if this movie is only for videogamers, but I can't see anyone
else caring to sit through it. The movie made it quite clear, early on,
that there would be no complicated plot lines or character development.
And the dialogue was equally simplistic. The lines sounded something
like this - go to the 3rd mountain and collect 20 coins and 3 golden
power boosters. One quickly sensed this was not a movie at all, rather
a simple video game cut scene. Also problematical were the incredibly
goofy scenes with thousands of bullets aimed point blank at the heroes
and all of them missing. It just takes all of the fun out of a movie
when there is absolutely no sense of danger to the heroes.On the plus side, the action sequences were very well shot and the cgi
was first class. That said, it just wasn't enough to make this reviewer
glad to be sitting in the audience
