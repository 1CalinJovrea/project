Originality and style are lost in the haze of nausea-inducing camera-work

As Above, So Below is a survival-horror video game I would have loved
to play. In fact, as I watched it, I couldn't help but wish that
someone would adapt it for the much more suitable genre.The film's premise and basic plot are intelligent enough to enjoy, and
as usual the blend of ancient mythologies in a "relic-hunt" (as per
Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider) is something I would have liked to
explore more fully. Unfortunately since this is a feature film that had
to enclose its dose of jump-scares and shaky-cam, it set up a great
first act and then proceeded to dash it thoroughly with standard
horror-movie tropes for the entire rest of its run-time. The actors are adequate but their characters unoriginal, and as with
all "found-footage" films there are multiple instances in which the
camera/cameraman are shoehorned back into the plot so that the footage
can continue to be created. The film was shot on location in the catacombs of Paris, and I am
deeply sorry that we did not get more solid camera-work of this unique
and fantastic location. Opportunities wasted make me peeved, and as
such I could not quite settle in for the mediocre B-Horror that is this
film....
