Stepmother portrayed with modern depth

Although this is about the stepmother, I want to first say that I found
all the characters well portrayed and supported by an excellent script,
cinematography, and of course a great director. I scanned some of the
user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me
that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be
an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want
today and should not become such.I particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because it
included clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to say
given that justification she was correct to have done what she did. But
a worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.The specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husband
telling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is the
love and support she desires - a more modern understanding of the
difficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenes
gives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of the
one-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was for
me many years ago.
