Great Horror Thriller with Time Loop Concept !

Movie with the time loop concept is interesting but really need many
good elements in it. It must contain good story, morale message, and
also the brilliant plot twist is a must. And what makes this movie
great ? Yeah it because Happy Death Day has all of the important
element. Simple story with popular girl in university, with good
directing, the repeated scene because of time loop doesn't seem boring.
They can make the audience to be curious and sometimes with extra
comedy it makes this film really great !No doubt you will like this horror thriller movie because it is not
similar like usual horror movie with some ghost, devil, or mysterious
phenomenon. Its more like thriller movie with mysterious psychopath
that kills you and you just cant escape from it. Even if I think this
movie is brilliant, I admit that with this film concept like this, I
like better if the movie genre is drama because it can offer you much
more emotional, dramatic, and better morale message.
