terrible movie

This movie was terrible! I watched it with friends and I wanted to stop
it less than 30 minutes into it. I was outvoted, but we all agreed
afterwards that it was a waste of time. Zac Efron has done some good
movies (The Lucky One and Neighbors) but this one was a dud. The
writing was terrible, and the movie just went nowhere. Miles Teller was
by far the worst actor in this film. I have never seen this guy in a
movie before, but he should look for another profession. There was no
plot in this movie. The scenes just seemed random. This was probably
the worst movie I've seen in the last year. Definitely not worth
renting or buying.
