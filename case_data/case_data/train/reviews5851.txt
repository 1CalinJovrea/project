A wonderful surprise!

Like some have written before me, I was ready for something in the vein
of Lost Boys... Instead I was served an amazing coming-of-age story, a
surreal depiction of how cruel kids can be - and what good they are
capable of. Part memories, part imagination, add real life, myths, and
a sprinkle of the paranormal - this is the recipe for a very good film.A layered film that should have obligatory screenings at high-schools
world wide. (I hope kids today get it)
