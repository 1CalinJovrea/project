Long, drawn-out and boring...

This should have been good, I really wanted it to be good. At the very
least it should have been interesting. Unfortunately, it took 2.5 hours
to tell 45 minute's worth of story... This film needed some serious
editing- too many scenes seemed forced, out of place or just thrown in
with little explanation or necessity... For example- why include the
scene asking Maya about being recruited to the CIA right after high
school, then drop the topic saying she can't explain why- it didn't do
anything to move the story along- and left me wondering "what was that
about???" I mean- would the answer to why she was recruited make her
motives and obsessions more understandable? What was the viewer
supposed to take away from that conversation? Skip watching this one in
the theater- if you must watch it out of curiosity, wait until it comes
out on DVD or cable- then at least you're only losing your time and not
a handful of hard earned cash.
