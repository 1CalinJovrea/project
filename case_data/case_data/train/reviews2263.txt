One Of The Best Films Based Of A Cartoon That Made Me Smile

Say what you want but I actually like MLP: FIM (My Little Pony:
Friendship Is Magic), It has good animation, good morals, good laughs
and good characters, It may not be perfect but It's great for what It
Is and I am a fan of It (or a Brony If you will) however the Equestria
Girls (or EG) were not quite as strong, It has good animation but
rather average as a stand alone series with the first EG being the only
great one, the rest go from okay to bad not that good at all.But when I heard there was a movie about the original series and not
another EG, I was overly excited, the trailer made It better and could
be one of the best movies based off a cartoon and........... It kind of
Is... "kind of", It's not quite the best but darn, I was surprised by
this movie, the effort, the animation, the plot and characters, this Is
what I always wanted In a MLP movie and they did just right, where do I
even started?.Let's start with my favorite, the animation, HOLY MOLY IT's FANTASTIC!,
It almost has a Disney look to It, the character designs on new and old
characters look very well crafted and nicely upgraded, the backgrounds
look beautiful and very colorful and the execution on all of It Is
great!, so nice work movie for upgrading the animation from good to
amazing!.The plot Is not anything special, It's very predictable and you can
tell what will happen from a mile away, but It's done well from
execution and fans can still have fun and get invested with what's
going on Including myself, others might not get into It as much as the
bronies or the younger fans but It's not for everyone.I like most of the characters, I like the Mane Six as always, the new
characters are interesting my personal favorites are Storm King,
Princess Sky and Tempest, the rest I do like Capper, Grubber and the
pirates but those three do stand out as far more interesting
characters.The voice acting Is very good, I'm glad the original voice actors from
cartoon are in this movie without them, this movie wouldn't feel like a
My Little Pony movie, the celebrities are also pretty great, Emily
Blunt, Michael Pena, Zoe Saldana and Kristin Chenoweth are all doing
very well and they do fit in, Sia Is the only one I thought was out of
place, not that I hate her In fact I think she's great and makes
wonderful music, but her character and her voice acting was sorta
strange even though she wasn't In the film that long and I know there
has been ponies that have played as other well know characters like
Doctor Whooves and one of the characters from the Big Lebowski, But Sia
who Is Songbird Is just....weird.So with all that said, Is this the best movie based off a cartoon,
well... close and I MEAN CLOSE, what the film did right was upgrade the
animation to make It look beautiful, colorful and well crafted, the new
characters are funny, well developed and interesting along with the old
characters, the story maybe predicable but It has enjoyment for fans
and maybe non-fans, this Is one of the best films based off a cartoon,
It beats all them garbage live-action films like Yogi Bear, Mr. Magoo
and especially Inspector Gadget, If you love My Little Pony then go
check It, If you don't then you'll hate It, I'm glad I saw this movie,
It made me smile so much and made me have hope for more movies based
off cartoons, not the love-action garbage.I'm happy to give My Little Pony: The Movie a 8.8/10.
