Born in the 80's

Really guys, for the whole movie I've just waited and waited for the
awful part but it really never came. Yeah, it's a bit geek-ish but for
all of us born in the era of Commodore it is a great reminder of time
when games were a lot simpler but we enjoyed them on a much more basic
level. If you think about it, those games didn't really have a story
but were insanely fun and addictive. It's like basketball V Halo, both
are games but..you know what I mean. Anyway, soundtrack was great, fun
parts were not hilarious but did bring smile to my face at moments,
acting was fine for the most part, pace also...in a nutshell: I had
great fun watching this and that's all you really need to know about
it. Forget the ratings and critics. Go watch this and you won't regret
it..at least not if you were born in the 80's.
