Excellent Performance

Another excellent performance by Robert Downey Jr.! By far one of the
better movies this year. I have never wrote a movie review but felt
compelled as I feel the film critics have not been so fair. Although
the premise of the movie is to unique in it's entirety - anyone having
family drama could relate and appreciate this story. The Judge is a
deeply moving film that showcases the acting powerhouse that is Robert
Duvall and the undeniable versatility and magnetic screen presence of
Robert Downey Jr. Don't listen to the critics, they clearly don't know
everything! Go see this movie and be prepared for a few good laughs,
bring a box of tissue for the tear jerking moments! Well worth it
