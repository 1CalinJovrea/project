Best movie in a long time.  Great Acting and Story

This movie had wonderful child actors and a great family story. Yes it
is a unusual family but that is why I liked it. The story is
believable. You will laugh and cry. A great story of a family that you
will grow to love. You will like the scenery. It is thought provoking
and shows all different aspects of family life. There is a small short
scene of male frontal nudity but other then that it is fine. You will
enjoy the full two hours of the movie. I think the child actors should
be nominated for Oscars. They were very believable. It makes you think
about the different ways we raise our kids. The dad may seem strange in
his beliefs but that is why I liked the movie We are all different.
