Great film but.....

In order to get over the impression that Paul Potts is shy, the film
ignores the seven years he spent as a politician, he was was elected
the youngest member of Bristol City Council, as a Liberal Democrat, and
he served until 2003. In my experience, being a politician usually involves knocking on
complete strangers doors in order to ask them to vote for you, making
public speeches and meeting the electorate at surgeries. Not the sort
of job that such a shy and retiring man would go in for, and as a
result this period never got a mention in the picture. That being said I thought the film was a genuine effort at making an
"American feel good movie" with British actors and locations. Port
Talbot never looked so good in the overhead shots, and no doubt
Carphone Warehouse will be delighted with the free publicity.I am a big fan of James Cordon and just loved watching the "The Wrong
Mans" on the BBC.
