Twlight Zone, but not as good.

If I was a budding film-maker and had a really low budget, this is the
type of movie to make like Open Water. Heavy dialogue with a "monster"
of some sort to add the element of, "Wow, this is a really low budget
movie."The transitional editing was annoying and unnecessary. Don't
overcompensate for your budget. A movie like this is ALL about
confidence. This movie was a long episode of; The Monsters Are Due on Maple
Street...but not done as well. Makes the original Twilight Zone all the
more brilliant proving nothing has developed since because this movie
did not capture the essence of terror that episode did. Do your
homework Mr Film-maker...if you're going to copy the 50 year old idea,
make it MUCH better. The acting was good, but the idea needed more depth over improv
dialogue. Too much rambling like a modern 30-Something episode which is
OK for TV on cable.Imagine how different this would be if it was set in the south with
truckers or farmers? This is too clich√© for the yuppie crowd that has
never mowed his lawn and lives in the business world, left helpless
without a gardener, auto mechanic, or accountant.Overall, boring movie and wonder what the director and writer and
producer were thinking. They were not on the same page and did not
listen to each other or told the other what they wanted to hear or they
just lack talent. This needed much more work.
