Skip it if you have a brain

I agree with the other negative reviews: good actors performing an
incoherent script. The film is more of a collection of clich√©s than a
story. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is how left-wing it is. We
are supposed to cheer when Michael Caine's character gets screwed. The
only reason I can see is because he is rich. Jesse Eisenberg on the
other hand plays a smug guy you would like to smack upside the head.
However, his heart is pure so it turns out good for him. Much of the
story and the tricks are based upon screwing the "one percent." If you
aren't a Wall Street occupier or are greater than 12 years old I
recommend skipping it. Come to think of it, it's too violent for
viewers 12 or less.
