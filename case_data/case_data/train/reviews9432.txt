Wedding Crasher Sequel?

The movie was great from beginning to end. I laughed harder than I have
in any recent comedy I've seen in the theater. I saw an advanced
screening in Chicago a couple weeks ago and the entire audience was
cracking up the entire time. Even the romantic scenes are funny in this
movie, and thats kind of rare. Also I'm sick of people giving it negative reviews just because it's at
Google, or it's a Google commercial. As if Google is really hungry for
people to come do their internships. Obviously they're getting the best
minds in the whole world to come there already. I'm sure everybody
knows what the heck Google is.Go see it, it's worth the price of admission. Vaughn and Wilson are
great together...feels like a Wedding Crashers sequel of sorts with the
way the two characters interact with each other...and of course a
perfect cameo early on was hilarious.
