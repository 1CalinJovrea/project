Oddly enough... very entertaining

This honestly surprised me. It goes without saying I was not expecting much from this movie. I have
seen various Pride and Prejudice movies before today and did not enjoy
any of them out of sheer boredom. Nothing against those movies or their
quality but it just wasn't my kind of movie. I assumed that this would
be no different and that it would just be the same exact story with a
few zombies sprinkled in. And to an extent, it was exactly that, but there was much more depth to
the zombie plot than I anticipated. The zombies were a very large part
of the story and even when there was romantic drama there was still a
close focus on the zombie aspect. There is always that underlying
tension that zombies will strike. The visuals were not the best but were still very well done. The
make-up and effects for the zombies were much higher quality than I
thought they would be. And the atmosphere kept a good mix of an old
Pride and Prejudice feel while also adding a new element of dark
zombie-apocalypse tension that I loved seeing. There were a few parts that I rolled my eyes at, especially when things
got a bit too dramatic between the lead characters Darcy and Elizabeth,
but all in all it was a good movie that I enjoyed. Very surprised to say I give this movie an 8/10.
