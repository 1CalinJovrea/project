More of the Same, But Different!

Perfectly enjoyable fun. Sound familiar? Doctor Strange being a
different kind of hero doesn't really excuse most of this film's
conventional plotting.There's a much more interesting film in here, one in which Mads
Mikkelsen isn't the main villain (yet) and getting in the way of the
hero's journey and in which Tilda Swinton is even more ambiguous. Her
obvious parallels to Stephen are perfectly apt and yet not allowed
enough time to breathe and spin. It's all a last minute reveal and then
a call to arms because plot and all is well because plot.A lot has been made of the "trippy" special effects, and I guess they
are compared to the traditional visuals employed in these types of
movies. But let's not get carried away. Besides the travels through
space and mind it's mostly buildings moving around like they're in
Inception.I didn't buy the last end credits scene. Useless and not earned. I'm
sick of hero's with photographic memories. Let the hero be exceptional
on their own merits. Action scenes could be less choppily edited. But
still, it's fun in ways other recent Marvel movies haven't been.
