I am Lost for Words...

To Summarize, for me it is a pretty bad movie. Why? (INCLUDES SPOILERS)1. Script: They've got it all wrong. Others might find it OK but if
your bad guy is in fact one of the most important characters of the
world history, you just can't go and change his story and the way he
dies. Sultan II. Mehmed, unlike in the movie, died from a regular
disease when he was 50 years old. He did not die in battle, especially
not killed by Dracula or Vlad III. In fact, they never even directly
confronted each other on a battlefield. Not to mention that the
timeline was all wrong Sultan Mehmed was known as Faith (the Conquerer)
and not Mehmed after his victory in Constantinople / Istanbul (1453). 2. Cast: Bad casting and performance all around. Except for Charles
Dance. AND... Again, if you are doing a flick including a real life
personality from world history, please DO BOTHER to go and check how he
actually looked like. At least google his name and see a couple of
original portraits for yourself OK? 3. Props and Looks: Ottoman janissary/soldiers never used regular
(straight) swords. They used bent swords like scimitars. The final
fight scene though presents Sultan Mehmed using a 2 handed sword,
strictly used by European Chivalry. Ottoman soldiers never wore that
kind of a heavy, full plate armor as well. Bad research and execution on scriptwriters and directors behalf which
might be ignored by many people but if you actually know the history of
these events, there isn't any way to agree, sorry.
