Great action , very realistic fighting scenes

Although I openly hate the recent years woman hero flood on the movies
, this one was different. Lead actress was very good , fighting scenes
were really amazing ( may even match the john wick ) , although stunts
were not good ( especially the first car hit on the agent with the
watch was really carelessly shot ( with that kind of effect on a human
that car should have hit the car in front ) ) . Also the last umbrella
scene , plus mcavoy dying was really simple. Anyway great acting from
mcavoy also .
