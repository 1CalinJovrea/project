A Pleasant Watch

I am the kind of guy who likes a movie with morals, art, music and
emotion. This is that kind of movie and it was a pleasant watch. Character & Development: The movie develops the characters well in my
opinion. I like how the main character is not some celebrity hot shot
that we are forced to love based on how they are in real life. Slow to
start and nothing is rushed. Of course, it does not follow every detail
from the book, but it draws the principles and ideals of it.Art: the style is done very well. Plain and simplistic as most
dystopian societies are portrayed. As the movie prolongs, the art in
the movie expands more beautifully. Watch the movie if you want to
understand what I meant by that. Music: I enjoyed the music of this movie. Gave me chills since I love
movies with great background music. Tingles everywhere.
