Such a beautiful movie

This movie perfectly captures the feeling of reading a fairy tale, but
instead of that, you actually get to experience it by viewing it. I am
so glad that they kept the Original story line, and the costumes and
setting are beautifully done. I have watched this movie multiple times
already, and still feel like I could view it many times more.
Definitely recommended for people that love classic fairy-tale stories.
