Excellent movie.  Amazing creativity and imagination.

The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning. A
great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our
futures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me
back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams
and made me think that anything was possible. The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular.
I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching
this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if
only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as
a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets,
most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen
in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my
lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations
of the creative people at Disney, who knows! All I know is that I don't
agree with the critical reviews and will always form my own opinion.
