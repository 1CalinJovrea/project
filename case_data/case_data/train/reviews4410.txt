Ben affleck can grow a beard

I was watching this movie with 2 friends and none of us said anything
until it was over. While I was watching it something was bothering me
but I didn't say anything because I thought the other two were into it,
Ben Affleck with a beard doing CIA stuff in 1980 Iran being a sort of
archetype of what an cool movie should be these days...Anyway I kept my mouth shut, and when the movie ended I looked at my
two companions. They both seemed a little off, I couldn't tell if it
was indifference or confusion or flat out boredom. One thing was clear
though: this movie sucked.First, at no point whatsover does one feel any connection and/or
sympathy for the main character. Ben Affleck makes the SAME FACE during
the entire movie, his eyes gazing in the distance and his mouth gaping
ever so slightly, giving him an expression vaguely similar to what I
imagine someone coming out of months of Electroshock Therapy would
have. I never saw how this 'acting' contributed to the 'character' in any
way. In fact, there is almost no character to speak of, and you'd
almost forget him if it weren't for the fact that he is in almost every
scene of the movie.Second (Spoiler I guess), even thought it started with a cool premise,
the story unraveled poorly and I honestly didn't get the point. So
what, they spent the whole movie training, all of it to get through a 5
minute scene at the customs where nothing really happens and another
climatic 5 minute chase on the runway where clearly the car has no
chance of stopping the plane, and in fact it doesn't, so there, the
end? I mean, seriously?? I can only imagine that this movie has such a good rating because most
people haven't even bothered reviewing it. There was a bunch of other
stuff I wanted to complain about but that movie was so bland that I
forgot.
