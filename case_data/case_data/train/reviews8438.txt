A scary movie that isn't scary.

The opening scene is good. From there on...not as much.I guess this movie will please those not familiar with the book much
more than those who are. That being said, I don't think it is possible
to make a satisfying adaption of "It" without doing it the Game of
Thrones way. More time is needed to dwell on each of the novel's parts
to create the feel the book gave us. To tell the story as it was told
on paper. So I guess I'll forgive the filmmakers for that.The kids are okay. They've managed to portray the losers and the
relationship between them as decently enough- considering the running
time. Again: more time is needed for better development. Much of what
actually happened between the kids and It has been cut, but again -
running time. They had to.That they've changed the setting from the 1958 to the 80s was a bad
choice, and so are the other changes. They're creating scenes that
aren't in the book. They're changing things that are there. The biggest
problem I have with the film is the execution of the horror. Constant
jump scares, way too much CGI, and a complete lack of understanding of
the fact that less is more. Waiting for a scare is the scary part of
horror, and this movie just throws everything at you constantly. It
just isn't terrifying. At all.I didn't find myself bored, though. Besides the poor performance when
it came to being scary, it is an okay movie. It just isn't a good
adaptation.
