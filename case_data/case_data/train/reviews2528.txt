Annoying characters, dumb ending

Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis, whom I think are wonderful comedic
actors, just made me near sick watching this movie. Anne's character
was a woman of few morals and a user whilst Jason's character went from
being nice and rehabilitating Anne's character to a controlling person
bent on having his way. All the while, they are personified by robots
in a US playground that manifests as monsters destroying Seoul. And all
this because as school children Jason's character stomped on Anne's
character's school project. Nothing original about a stupid plot that
makes some wonderful actors annoying beyond words.
