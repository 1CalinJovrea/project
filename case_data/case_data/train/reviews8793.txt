A 2 hour Apple computer commercial

Saw a preview screening of 'JOBS' movie, but went away feeling that I
just watched a 2 hour Apple computer commercial instead. I was
entertained but also felt the movie was incorrectly titledÂ… It should
have been called "the Apple Computer Movie" If you are a Jobs/Apple fan then go see the movie, otherwise save
yourself from frustration & wait to watch it on TV. Ashton Kutcher's
performance of Steve Jobs was very good. But that doesn't excuse the
fact that there were way to many holes in the writing. They missed to much basic info about Steve Jobs life. I understand that
you can't show everything about a person's life in 2 hours. But give me
some info. An example: the storyline introduced very serious issues
about his infant daughter, then suddenly later she briefly just shows
up as a teenager without any explanation or anything in between. No
mention about Jobs involvement with Pixar, Disney or music festivals
and almost nothing about Steve Jobs life if it didn't have anything to
do directly with Apple.What happened to the ending? Spoiler alert: Steve regains his position
at Apple, movie over. (Jobs get his job back) Why not mention his
battle with cancer/health issues & death? the story timeline never gets
past the 2001 introduction of the ipod, (sorry they didn't get to
iphones & ipads)The music soundtrack had some good classic tracks included but the rest
sounded just like the dramatic lonely piano music pulled from the
Shawshank Redemption. It worked well but seemed just like I've heard it
somewhere before.
