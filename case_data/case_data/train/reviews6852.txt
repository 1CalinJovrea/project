Save two hours of your life

Good actors doesn't mean good movie. Worst movie ever and the high
scores are misleading. The whole time I was waiting for something to
happen but then....wait for it...nothing. I wished I had gone for my
root canal instead. It would have at minimum made better use of my
time. Any guy that can drag himself thru the desert with a broken leg
deserves an academy award, if only this whole scene was half-way
believable. It's not. Neither was baffing his wife missionary style
like really bro? Aren't you putting some weight on that thing? The ridiculous sounds the troglodytes make is annoying and by the time
they sliced the guy in half which was gross, I kept wondering how the
heck the dude with the busted leg was going to save his kidnapped wife
when everyone else was dead or captured. What a guy! Dumb dumber
dumbest. And I still need a root canal. I'm almost looking forward to it. This
movie sucked.
