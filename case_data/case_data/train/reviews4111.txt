So Funny!

Baywatch was such a funny movie and is probably going to be the best
movie of the whole summer. This movie keeps you entertained the entire
time and again is so funny. I have never seen the original show so I
have nothing to compare it to but it reminds me of something like 21
Jump Street. Throughout the film there is lots of action which is
exciting and all the actors and actresses do an excellent job! Ignore
the critics and go and watch Baywatch, I have actually already pre
ordered a digital copy I liked this movie so much! I hope more people
watch it so they go and make a second film. If you don't watch this you
are really going to miss out!!!
