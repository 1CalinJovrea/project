Disney should make movies for kids again.

So this is just a taste of the famiy friendly, PG-Rated content that
this Disney film had in store for my kids: A line where a woman
actually says "he raped me" ... A scene where Johnny Depp is basically
singing a song about a "juicy young girl" he wants to eat but instead
of you imagining him as a wolf you're imagining him as a sick stalker
pedophile. Having fun yet? This film has scenes of mutilation of
women's feet to fit a shoe, because what we need in a kids story tale
movie is "SAW Part 8" ... And constant references to women being
literally chased around by men like objects , and last but not least a
random sudden scene of a married man and woman cheating on their
spouses. Having fun yet family viewers? This is stupid and offensive.
Should not be rated PG and save this garbage for adults who want to see
it.
