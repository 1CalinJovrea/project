The most pointless movie I have ever seen

I rarely rate movies with 1 star but this time I decided to make an
exception for this piece of garbage that dares to call itself a movie
and no I am not exaggerating. I have never been that bored watching a
movie but I guess that there is a first time for everything. 'A Ghost
Story' is simply an empty movie full of blank scenes with no dialogue
or action that makes you think that the filmmakers just forgot that the
camera was rolling and just left. I just gave up on believing that
something exciting was going to happen after a 10 minute scene of
Rooney Mara eating a pie. Seriously that happened. To be honest after a
certain point I was so bored that I just stopped paying that much
attention. Many might say that it had meaning and it wanted to show the
audience the life after death from a different prospective but let's be
honest with ourselves: Even if that was true the movie is so
unbelievably blank and boring that you are going to lose every interest
you had to pay attention to its secret messages. I wouldn't watch it
again not for 1 million dollars and I suggest you to stay away and
whatever you do just don't watch it. Believe me any another movie will
seem more entertaining than this one!
