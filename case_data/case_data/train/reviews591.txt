Mixed feelings, but still worth seeing

This movie has it's ups and it's downs. There were some really great
suspense scenes, while others where painfully obvious. I feel like they
should've spend just a little bit more time on it, to work out the
kinks.Overall I would still recommend you to see it and don't give up on it
too soon. There is some really great stuff in there. It's been a while
since a movie genuinely had me on the edge of my seat, which completely
made up for the bad parts.
