Very Slow Paced And Quite Dull

I am an avid horror fan, it is by far my favorite genre. I like all
kinds of horror and don't mind slow paced films at all. However
"Honeymoon" was a pretty big letdown. from the trailer and reviews and
I was pretty excited to give this a watch, but boy did it fall flat.The story starts out fairly generic, a couple goes to a cabin in the
woods. It quickly turns into something else entirely, and that
"something" else really isn't that great. The parts that were obviously
suppose to be tense and creepy just didn't do it for me, and the story
didn't have much to offer so I just found myself wanting to know what
was going on so I could just be done with it.The acting is by far this movies strong point. The small cast does an
excellent job, even though the script is fairly poor.I feel like as horror fans we are so desperate for new horror we often
grasp onto not so good films and try to convince ourselves that they
are great. People are praising "Honeymoon" but I'm not entirely sure
why, it really just isn't a good movie.4/10
