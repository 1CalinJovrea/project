What a Ride

I had an idea from the opening credits that Damian Szifron's WILD
TALES, was going to be fun. Images of animals with the actors' names as
counterpart, preparing the audience for the animalistic behavior about
to come.The film is comprised of six separate vignettes, short stories, if you
will. These vignettes all begin innocently enough, passengers boarding
a plane, a man driving through the desert, a restaurant on a stormy
night, a wedding, everyday slices of modern day life. Something occurs
to break the routine, the main character responds, then the scene
escalates, and escalates, and when you think you've reached the peak,
it escalates even more, and finally in the end reaches a perfect
balance of comedy and tragedy. The tales are all perfectly relatable
and escalate logically and realistically, nothing comes out from left
field. All the characters, each flawed in so many ways, remind us so
much of ourselves, both at our best and at our worst... and make us
laugh and feel in recognition.Great Movie.
