I really liked this movie, this is a feel good movie if that's what you need

Two stories in one, which is what made this movie, had it just been one
or the other I don't think I would have written this review. It
certainly didn't hurt that they cast Alan Alda in it too, he is such a
wonderful actor, no matter what role he plays, this included. This is a
simple love story, times 2. This is not any brilliant "oh my gosh no
one has ever made a movie this deep and this incredible before" type of
movie. It's mushy, sweet, romantic, hopeful, sad, happy, sometimes
predictable, and when it was over I said, "I really enjoyed that
movie". That's what it's all about, for me, enjoying the movie. If it
makes me feel good in the process, then that's even better. I would
recommend this, but not to someone who is not the least bit romantic or
hopeful, because you will be one of the people who writes a negative
review.
