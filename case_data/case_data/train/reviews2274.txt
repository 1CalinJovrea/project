WARNING!!! Don't waste your time, money or breath...Seriously...you'll regret it.

Couldn't even get through the 1st 5 minutes before I decided that it's
not even worth watching any further(and no, I do not have ADD/Another
Dumb Disorder) for the following reasons:1. Insipid dialogue right off the bat/dumb robotic acting. 2. Amateur
CGI, a 2 year old with an iPod could do better. 3. Stupid Director.OK, I thought I'd give M Knight another chance, but he hasn't improved.
In fact, he has become worse with each new attempt at movie making.How could this even be released? Seriously, it's that bad...(the first
5 mins of course).So, gut assumptions tell me the rest of the movie(if one would want to
call it a 'movie') is more or less like the first 5 minutes of Crap.I couldn't help but notice, also, that the movie poster is dominated by
two large heads of presumably Jayden and the other on the right of whom
I can't place a name is a good indication that the movie is all about
them and them alone. I can see Will and Jayden standing behind some
graphic artist in the studio telling them to enlarge their heads in
photoshop. The Smith's are bleeding money and defecate gold eggs, so it
makes sense now how this movie came to fruition; anyone else may have
been run out of town. I say this with sadness, realizing all the wasted
energy, time and money put into this from the catering all the way to
director.Maybe they'll make a sequel...oh, I can't wait...perhaps then it will
be straight to video.
