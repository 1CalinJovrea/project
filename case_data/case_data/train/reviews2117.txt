My favorite 2013 movie! A precious gem by a magnificent Rush!

This is, by far, my most favorite movie of this year! I've always been
a Geoffrey Rush fan, but in this movie, I've seen a very special Rush
who, by the way his on screen persona goes thru a life changing
metamorphosis, creates a real, day-to-day living among us man with real
life personal fears, heartbreaking disillusions and self rediscovering.
He makes us care for the very rigid and robotic Virgil Oldman in a way
that surprises the senses. He is, in the beginning, a character who
most people would find repelling by his uncomfortable attitude and
bossy ways. But, as the movie proceeds, he is changed by this peculiar
and frightful young woman who has a way of bringing him up, and
crushing him down within minutes in their dialog. I must say that
director Tornatore wrote this amazingly beautiful story with a golden
pencil, I'm sure. This is not another love story. It's a life story,
set in the world of Arts, where there's more to discover behind the
colors of paintings and the still faces of sculptures than meets the
eye. As the movie comes to an end, you will face a difficult task: to
be thankful that such a story made it to the big screen, or to desire
that it would've remain only in the writer's mind and heart. I give it
a full 10, with no regrets. Awaiting more from Tornatore-Rush team!
They get along pretty well I see.
