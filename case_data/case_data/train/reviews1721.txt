A bitter disappointment and awful ending to a brilliant trilogy.

The movie was so boring and lengthy that I considered to leave the
cinema. The script was predictable at some points and the acting was so
poor amongst some of the actors. Anne Hathaway was horrible, she was
not convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap Halloween
costume. Bane, the main villain of this movie was killed in a split
second and everything was forgotten about him, that's it. It's like the
script writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this
point. The actor playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's
daughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation, it
was some of the worst acting I have ever seen, you can tell that she is
acting. It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud. Blake who
appears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high
tech stuff that is in there, but he didn't receive any training at all
so he wouldn't know how to use it. Robin is just an ordinary cop in
this movie with no combat skills, yet Bruce Wayne gives away the cave
to him and settles down with the supposed Catwoman.
