Beautiful to look at, hard to watch.....

Alarm bells ring when a poster quote says that a prolific director
famous for organised crime thrillers would be proud of it.And then the Blu Ray case has not one, but nine four or above star
ratings from very well regarded publications, and so etching called Hey
U Guys.But fear not, for once this is a film that is worthy of all its
plaudits.In 2011, Ostia is the subject of a giant real estate project intended
to make the harbour of Ancient Rome the Las Vegas of today. But the place soon becomes a battlefield where criminals and
politicians either join forces cynically or fight each other
ruthlessly. The infernal showdown will last seven days, claiming many lives.....Suburban is divided into seven parts, each depicting the lead up to the
governments decision on granting permission for this project, and on
each day, so etching goes drastically wrong for one of the characters
who are crucial to the films narrative.And there are so many crucial characters, in the hands of someone lees
confident,this could have fell apart on day three. But coming from the
director of Gomorrah, Sollima keeps the film at a heady pace, keeping
the brutality of Gomorrah, but adding such a beautiful cinematic feel
to it.Members of parliament are more crooked and desperate than the two
organised crime families, who need to keep the peace until the deal
goes though. But this is impossible, thanks to one member of parliament
who got a little too amorous with two ladies of the nights, and a lot
of drugs.But it turns out that one of them was a minor, and died due to
overdosing. And this is where the dreams of the project begin to fall
apart.Lust, caution, as they say.It's a very hard film to watch, especially when the element of betrayal
begins to enter the narrative fray. It's a film where everyone appears
to be in constant danger, and Jean- Hughes Anglade is the unfortunate
pawn who is bullied into doing all the pithy jobs, and he's the best
thing in it.Set pieces are wonderful, in particular the siege on a shopping Mall,
done on a grand scale, but keeping that wonderful gritty realism.Well worthy of all the praise, this needs seeking out.Apparently Martin Scorcese demands it....
