Disney Going Hero

Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated
movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro,
his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live
in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called
San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements
to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel
movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more
akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means,
this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the
abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up.
There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most
important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted
in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure
(without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for
children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking
somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of
this movie.
