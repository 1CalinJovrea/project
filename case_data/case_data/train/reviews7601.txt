Deserves to be crushed under a shoe

Okay, enough already! Another formulaic load of old tripe featuring
boring, cocksure, dumb and supposedly somehow charming hero blessed
with super powers he doesn't deserve and boring us all to death through
two turgid hours of special effects and a plot you could write on the
back of a postage stamp. (Iron Man, Green Lantern, et al. anybody?)
This one thinks it's a bit of a comedy...except the lame jokes are sign
posted about a mile away and deserve to be punctuated with a
ba-dumb-tish on the snare drum.Ant Man. A lousy idea and a lousy film. 2 hours of my life I will never
get back. And the threat at the end?: "Ant Man will return!" Don't
bother!!
