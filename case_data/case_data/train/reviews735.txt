5
mocking-consumer part 2

5 out of 10? the mediocrity on display is shockingly average.look elsewhere!hmmmm.... someone needs to help me come up with more lines for this
review, but that, "roses are red, violets are blue, i'm schizophrenic,
and so am i" thing? it's just not gonna work out.so perhaps some more pontification regarding towing the mean line. this
movie is so forgettable that guy from that show wonders what Jennifer
Lawrence is thinking about the idea of prequels?!?remember that part? me neither!5 out of 10 - the review this film deserves.
