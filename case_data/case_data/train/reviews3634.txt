Stay not awake but asleep

i will keep this short. Having seen this movie it was genuinely one of
the best movies to put you to sleep that I have ever seen.The tension between characters felt nothing but awkward and as if they
didn't want to act together let alone build sexual tension.The wide screen views of trees and the garden where a highlight in the
movie, however did not understand the role they were to play in the
movie.The happiest and redeeming feature was that I had free tickets!I also no longer trust the official critics which I relied upon.
Internet community has overwhelming win my respect in forming an
opinion on movies. Critics have gone to far.
