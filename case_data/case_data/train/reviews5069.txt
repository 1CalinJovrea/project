An insult to history and viewers pockets

It was not even a waste of time because i got time to review mentally
the real history of the Battle of marathon whilst dying watching this
3D movie. Firstly, I am tired of the dualism that Hollywood tries to
portray when producing these movies: good vs bad. Portrays Greeks as
clean, democratic, free civilization,... OK, but always vs dirty, vain,
bloody Persians...!!! All that to get viewers to lean towards what they
have to judge is good or wrong (america - middle east...). The movie
does not portrays a single thing that was real at that time, not even
the boats, ...neither, obviously, Artemisa who "represents"a Goddess.
Overall, I am not even sure I want to write much about this movie. In
fact the chopping hands, heads, blood and bad 3D are representative of
what I thought it was an old style of making movies, probably addressed
to -sorry- ignorant viewers or those who are satisfied with bloody
movies regardless of how misleading they can be. Don't watch it, a
waste of time and waste of money....
