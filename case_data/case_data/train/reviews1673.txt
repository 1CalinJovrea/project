Difficult subject, but great execution

Whether or not I would recommend this to someone else depends a lot on
what they expect from the movies they watch. If you want to be
entertained, this movie is far from entertaining. Agonizing and
difficult to watch, yes, but entertaining, absolutely not. However, if
you watch movies to learn something or to be moved emotionally, this
movie definitely does that. Because I like my movies to be
entertaining, I deducted a couple of stars.This film was very well written, acted, and directed. However, you have
to be ready to watch it. It's not easy at all. If it's that hard just
to watch it, I can't even imagine what it would have been like to go
through it. I do want to point out to people who are outraged at the experiment and
how people were treated that this is not very far on how people are
treated during boot camp. Having been through basic training in the
Army, I can definitely say that they break you down psychologically by
dehumanizing you just the same. So if people have an issue on how people were treated for 2 weeks where
they had a contract that guaranteed their safety, imagine how a 18 year
old who just joined the armed services feels.
