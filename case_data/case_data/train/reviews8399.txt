A visual wonder that lacks depth

Christopher Nolan is a visual genius: this film is just stunning to
look at. From the bullets flying near soldier's head to gorgeous
explosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first
10 minutes of the screening. Furthermore, it is an accurate description
of the "Miracle of Dunkirk". This is where the movie nails it. However,
apart from that, I've had a couple of issues with it.The film is told from three perspectives: Air, Mole and Sea. This is
where the movie falls a bit short. The editing at some points feels
lazy and not very consistent: it cuts from a dramatic scene or intense
action scene very quickly. The film is told in a non-linear way: this makes us watch certain
scenes twice through different perspectives. Although this could've
been done in a very interesting way, it's very difficult to keep track
of whose perspective we're watching at times. Even when certain
semi-important (I'll get back to this later) soldiers die, it took me a
while to realise this happened.This is where my third and final problem come into question: the
characters lack depth. You don't care about the main character, nor any
of the other soldiers that are dying. If I'm watching a film about war,
I like to bond with the characters I'm seeing on screen. If none of
them show any real emotion, the viewer won't as well.All in all, Dunkirk could've been amazing. I personally don't
understand why it has such a high rating besides being directed by a
very well-known director / starring famous actors (including infamous
Harry Styles) / being a war biography. Disappointing.
