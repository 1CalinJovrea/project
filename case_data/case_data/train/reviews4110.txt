Don't waste your time

When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I thought that it would be
an cute, funny movie to watch. Unfortunately, it was anything but. This
movie portrays a middle aged woman(Leslie Mann) who is in denial of her
age. This movie perpetuates this society's constant obsession with
looks & age... what happened to aging gracefully?!(What message does
this send to viewers...) She's obsessed with how she looks like and
tries to act like a 20 year old. She has a very irritating voice, it's
very high pitched & she sounds like she is a 15 year old girl!! Not a
great actress either. The adults in this movie act like
immature;children & get away with their childish antics. Its not really
funny. All the funny parts are in the trailer anyways. ALSO, is it just
me or does Megan Fox always play the hot/dumb girl in all her roles!
Why doesn't she take on a role of an independent woman, someone that
would actually be a good role model for young girls! Anyways, the
characterizations of the women in this movie are terrible
representations of how women should be like (submissive to their
husbands/ needing to look "hot" to get a man). Don't watch. awful movie
