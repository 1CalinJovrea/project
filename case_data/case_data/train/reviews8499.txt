Sing

I went into this movie not expecting very much. I had recently seen
Zootopia and Pets, both animated movies set in worlds full of solely
animals, and had similar expectations. Sing, however, had much more of
a plot than I had expected. The animals go through some real issues and
struggles faced by people who own small businesses or businesses
related to fine arts. This is a good movie to take the kids to as it is
animated, full of songs, and family friendly in its humor. The
outstanding cast full of big names in the must industry makes the movie
more inviting to parents as well. Overall, this movie was worth the
watch.
