Starts in 1500s and NEVER ENDS

This is among the worst films I have ever seen. Even among those, I can
recognize good film making...this is NOT good film making or good basic
storytelling. Repetitive, dragged out foreshadowing so that the only
people who seemingly don't know what is going to happen next are the
people in the film, and plot and character inconsistencies that you
could drive a whole religion through. And it is LONG. 45 minutes would have easily captured this story and
done so with more suspense (less dragging foreshadowing) and more
horror. By the time each act of torture happens, everyone but the
stupidest priest who ever lived knows exactly what is going to happen
and it loses its effect. Speed this up, and it might be compelling.
Right now, it is like a third grade story...and then...and then...and
then...and then...we have to see every moment in time of the whole
freaking story.If this film had any other director, it would never ever ever see the
light of day in a theatre. And awards? Really shameful pandering, a
mockery of great film making and a great director, who went off the
rails with this.
