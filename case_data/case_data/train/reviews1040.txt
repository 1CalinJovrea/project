Affleck's acting is excellent but screenplay is half-baked

I've very much enjoyed other Kenneth Lonergan films, and I've admired
Casey Affleck's acting gifts for a long time. Because of the rave
reviews, I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, the film
went into production with a half-baked script. It probably needed
another 5-6 rewrites to make the characterization more layered, develop
the subplots more, and get to the pith of the central conflict, which
was extremely weak.The story didn't really get off the ground until the last third of the
film. It's a testament to Affleck's acting, not the story, that the
film managed to sustain my interest. The only thing I'll say about the
music is that the classical music was used in a very ham-handed fashion
to manipulate the audience's emotion.Affleck plays a character named Lee, who has suffered a tragedy from
which he can't recover. He does his best with an taciturn, undeveloped
character whose aims are vague and is so caught in depression and grief
that he displays little outward emotional expression. The other major
character is Patrick, a teenage boy whose father, Affleck's brother,
has died suddenly.One of the big wrongs in the screenplay is that we don't get any sense
that Patrick is grieving or even in shock about his father's death
until a contrived scene later in the movie about a refrigerator that is
a weak, unconvincing attempt to show Patrick has feelings about his
father.The relationship between Lee and Patrick is meandering and with mild
conflict here and there. It's supposed to be the spine of the movie,
but it's so flaccid that the film often lacks focus.I think this movie has something to say, but it's not fully
articulated, because the film was shot before the script was fully
ready for production.
