what a joke

140 minutes of silly CGI monkeys not at war at all. message is
pathetic. monkeys are better than humans that deserve to be wiped away.
a true NWO flick that envisions their idea of exterminating us. the
final avalanche is the classic symbolism of nature taking revenge and
wiping away all the bad humans on both fronts, sparing only the monkey
along with the mute, Jane-like baby blonde avoid this garbage at all
cost.
