A good premise but everybody's so rich

Spoilers!!! I laughed at Cethryn Hahn the most, she's great! lotsa
great stars made appearances, chick flick it is and i was prepared to
enjoy the premise of the movie. but everyone was so rich and lived in
Huge houses and they had no money worries. I couldn't imagine going to
a bar, getting bombed, then going to a grocery store to run around and
destroy food without being hauled to jail. that was over the top. i was
hoping to see more women of color, but Hollywod is so color-blind, more
diversity please! at least there was Jada Pinkett-Smith. Loved Mila
Kunis but she played a mom with a part-time job, 2 kids, in a Big-foot
house, yeah...not believable! and then riding off into the sunset with
friends on one of the friend's husband's private jet...please!! i
shoulda saved my little hard earned $30.00 and waited for HBO
