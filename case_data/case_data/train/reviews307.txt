Excellent piece of cinema, but not for everyone

Before I decided to see this movie I was familiar with the phenomena of
the novel I even read it but only half way through, because I thought
it was not leading anywhere.Most people around me say that it is pointless and everything the main
character does, all her little hygiene experiments, make no sense. Even
the few ones who didn't abandon the book half way through. Since the German critics gave the book positive reviews, I was
wondering what's behind it.I expected the movie to be trash. But it isn't. It is beautifully shot
and well edited, the soundtrack is on point and best of all - the
leading actress shows such a refreshing talent. At first, her face
looks so friendly and familiar. Then she strikes you with all kind of
emotions, acted out almost easily. If you are interested in what happens in the novel and want to treat
yourself to a little sexual gore fest, see the movie. However, what I
take away from it that feeling you only know if your family is
dysfunctional too and the realization that the choices you make in life
are an aftermath of that. I hope you are in touch with all your
mommy/daddy/sibling issues, if these things don't make you too
uncomfortable and you have learned to live with all that - you will be
deeply touched by this story.Warning: see the movie alone, as if you would be reading a book. If you
see it with your friend, relative or God forbid: a family member - it
might lead to complications in your relationship and you don't need
anymore of that. Luckily the fist 5 minutes of the movie show you what you are in for.
If you survive this, you're good.
