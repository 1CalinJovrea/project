Bad, bad, bad

This movie is cheesy in all the wrong ways. The dialogue is just clich√©
and awful. The acting (aside from Bill Paxton who is only on screen for
like 3 mins) is horrendous. I mean some of these people can actually
act, but they are either just phoning it in or something else was going
on. Either way, this is just complete crap. The story was so ham-fisted
and obvious that it just makes you cringe the whole way through. Avoid
at all costs.
