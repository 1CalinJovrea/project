Nice. Nice. Nice.

Well crafted movie with a beautiful cast, good aesthetics and some
nicely twisted elements made for a enjoyable watch even tho from my
point of view, the ending is quite predictable from the very start. It
was rather obvious the destination, yet the journey remained
suspenseful and filled with little hidden gems here and there.Bill Nighy is one great actor, I'm sadden by the fact that he didn't
manage to make a bigger splash earlier, but even now, his presence on
the screen brings so much force, so much seriosity, that you take
everything in deeper and leaves behind quite an impact with every line
he says. He was perfectly cast here, as the other actors too, a
diversity and character development that I loved from the very start.Of course I will recommend this movie, but bare in mind, there is close
to no horror here, you will find no such thing, but only the horror of
man. What man is capable of, his hideous crimes, selfishness, but has
nothing to do with jump scares or tension.Cheers!
