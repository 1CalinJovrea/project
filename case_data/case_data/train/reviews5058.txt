Powerful and shocking mystery

10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story
that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a
spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of
tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad
movie at certain points.First of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching
without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the
teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search
information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan
movies would lose all interest.I was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and
surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The
performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a
unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. The story is gleefully
unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of
all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the
monster POV storyline.Secretly made, impeccably marketed, nicely developed and finally here
along with us: 10 Cloverfield Lane promised thrills and delivered it
and then some. I was expecting some things that I tasted but I was
surprised by a complexity and a twisted sense of horror that I didn't
see coming. 2016 has released the very first great movie of the year.
