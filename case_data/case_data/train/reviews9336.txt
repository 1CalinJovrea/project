Humorous Feel Good Film

I never write reviews but after seeing how the film has been reviewed
as mediocre, I thought I ought to, but I'll keep it short and sweet. To
be blatantly honest, I saw the film mainly because Dylan O'Brien was in
it. However,now that I've seen it, I would watch it again even if Dylan
O'Brien weren't in it. It was humorous and I could connect with the
nerd references in the film which I found to be very funny. More than
it was funny, it was refreshing. The film felt modern and was spot on
about society and how it works today. The settings themselves will have
you in awe at just how cool they are. All the characters were lovable
as well and strayed from what I had first expected in a good way. I
mean, it was impossible to not connect with them, if not at least one.
The film contained that basic underdog story line but the way they
executed this story line was different and I appreciated it. This isn't
a film that has the biggest climax or heartfelt ending, but it will
keep you smiling the entire time. A very entertaining movie through and
through.
