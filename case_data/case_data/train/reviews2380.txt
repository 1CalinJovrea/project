Masterpiece

For me, this is the reason I go to the movies. Always in the
expectation that when I walk out of the theater I simply will not be
touching the ground. This does not happen frequently, but with "Maudie"
the magic occurred. An amazing story eloquently told. Sally Hawkins is
superb, touching and profoundly human. Ethan Hawke is at his best.
There is a believable chemistry between these battered beings. When
they do take flight, they soar over this crude grandiose landscape so
beautifully captured on film.It's early, but the award community have a sure bet in this
unforgettable gem.
