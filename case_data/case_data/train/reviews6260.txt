Godawful agitation for an average American target audience

Four soldiers are taking 30 (thirty) 7.42 caliber AK47 bullets to
different body parts, a bullet that tears a limb in half. They keep
moving and keep killing dozens of Muslims which blood is sprayed in
huge amounts of grape juice. Four Brave soldiers are taking 2 huge
falls hitting rocks and trees with heads and spines at high velocities.
They keep moving and keep killing dozens of Muslims. Four American
Soldiers getting hit by RPG HE rounds. They keep moving and keep
killing dozens of Muslims. Four Brave American Soldiers keep killing
dozens of Muslims with their godly M16A4s while they literally couldn't
be killed by shitty terrible Soviet/Russian weaponry (most reliable and
deadly weapons in the world actually).Yes, this movie is actually that bad. It brings disrespect to the
actual soldiers. When a professional in this kind of stuff watches this
movie, all he/she can do is laugh at the level of fiction and facepalm
at the stupidity of actions.Lone Survivor is rated 7.8 on IMDb and 90% on RottenTomatoes. This
shows the level of intellect and how brainwashed typical American
viewer is. The target audience the movie was aimed at.Mark Wahlberg should take some notes from Matt Damon, when the first is
taking part in retarded propaganda for dumb target audience, the latter
is bringing water and toilets to Africa, traveling there himself.
