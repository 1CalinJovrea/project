Ridiculous

I'm very much a fan of the Hit-man games and was (again) shocked by the
sheer ignorance in this film. Obvious mistakes and plot holes were
apparent from the first minute; things like reloading guns only when it
looks cool, guards with their backs to the elevator, contradictions in
speech. Lack of a credibility of the entire storyline can be forgiven,
since it's still a dystopian video game and don't we all love a dame in
distress. The disrespect director Bach shows in ignoring the very
nature of the games (stealth) and treating the audience as idiots is
culpable. Most of the shots seem to have been made just to look good.
CGI was not too good but unlike the rest of the film, functional.
