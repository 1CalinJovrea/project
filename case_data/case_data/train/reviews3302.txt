Hugely overrated

The movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and
somehow believed those. Huge mistake.To say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie, I have
seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better.The story is dumb and entirely predictable. The characters are almost
flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of
view nor from a parody point of view. Acting was also poor.Visual effects were OK and being a 3D movie helped, but that is the
only positive thing that I can say about the movie.The theater was half-full but during the entire movie there was not a
single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard.The only way I can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were
added for this movie is since all the brainwashed Marvel fan-boys and
sock-puppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal
reviewers.
