A PBS styled gruesome murder mystery for the big screen where the butler did it.

It's as if PBS decided to do a "Silence Of The Lambs" progressively
edgy and gory styled detective story with the pace and attention to
detail of a "Father Brown" murder mystery or "The Coroner".Anyway, the production, cinematography and gorgeously orchestral and
ambient musical soundtrack are the winners in "The Snowman". Never has
snow looked so beautiful until you see it photographed in Norway.To keep up with the plot you do have to pay attention to all the names
of suspects, victims and time lines spoken abruptly in British accents
within long contemplative pauses as if every character was avoiding
breathing the cold air.Val Kilmer is almost unrecognizable and his voice sounds dubbed which
kinda' makes his character oddly more interesting where I wish he was
given more screen time.It's a decent, intelligently and beautifully produced movie perfect for
curling up with some cocoa in cold winter months to find out who done
it. I was just expecting more "Silence Of The Lambs" and less
"Inspector Morse".
