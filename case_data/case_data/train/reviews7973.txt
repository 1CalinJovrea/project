Give the franchise a second chance! You'll be glad you did!

I've heard it said often: "I've never seen a bad movie make a good
sequel." Well, I'll bet my entire life savings that the reason why is
because you never gave the sequel a chance after seeing the first film.
That will be a big mistake this time around! I'll admit that the first
Purge movie was, for the most part, mediocre and not the best start to
the series. But James DeMonaco has heard and answered our cries and
made dramatic improvements to the second installment. Whereas the first
film was merely violence for the sake of violence, Anarchy has a
gripping plot line, dynamic setting, an unbelievable amount of
character development, and a suspense factor that keeps you guessing
right down to the last five minutes! And you leave with a fresh
understanding of all the pros and cons of legalizing crime for one
night a year. Whatever your expectations are going in, I guarantee you
no regrets!
