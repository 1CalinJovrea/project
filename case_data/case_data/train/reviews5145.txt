a beguiling exercise in form over substance

When movie's form and substance are not in harmony the strain can be
obvious. With a stellar cast, superb cinematography and magnificent
American Gothic period setting, The Beguiled (2017) has
uncompromisingly beautiful form. In terms of substance, on the other
hand, its characterisation and narrative interpretation are
underwhelming.The storyline is uncomplicated. A wounded Union mercenary Corporal John
McBurney (Colin Farrell) is found in the woods by a young pupil of a
nearby prestigious girls school. She helps him limp to the school where
the headmistress Miss Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman) agrees out of
Christian kindness to provide shelter from the Confederates. The slave
servants have fled and the Civil War rages, but the school stays open
for a handful of orphaned girls. McBurney knows that his charm and
seduction skills are vital to his survival as he smirks privately at
having landed in a crinoline paradise compared to the battle outside.
The ladies are aflutter at his presence and an atmosphere of repressed
sexuality and jealousy simmer below the surface. But he is too clever
for his own Irish charm as he tries to worm his way into too many beds.
When caught out for his duplicity, the sweet angels of charity exact
their revenge.With a story rich in narrative potential and star-power like Kidman,
Farrell and Fanning, you might expect a delicious thriller melodrama
with characters of depth, complexity and nuance. But instead we find a
flat narrative with two-dimensional caricatures devoid of emotional
expression. Apart from McBurney's angry outburst at having been
thwarted by a mere handful of women, nobody in this film seems to feel
anything more urgent than how the plates might be arranged for dinner.
Piques of jealousy, fear, passion, feminist rage? Â– none of seems to
have made the final cut. Perhaps it's a Gothic affectation that
upper-class Southern ladies enjoy French grammar and music lessons
accompanied by exploding cannonballs. Whenever there is hope for an
exciting narrative twist, the ladies spontaneously assemble for a posed
composition of exquisite elegance and formality as if beckoned by a
painter for a portrait sitting. Seeing this the first time is a visual
delight; seeing it multiple times displays a level of artifice that
distracts from an already slow narrative. Gothic atmosphere is usually
full of tension but here it's more about smoky mists and mood lighting
that varies between dark, darker and darkest. What could have been
offered as a triumphantly gruesome finale is instead played out as
deadpan politeness in a sewing lesson for once rich young white ladies.Opinions differ widely about this film. Some will have seen the 1971
version or read the source novel, others of course will see it cold.
Perhaps it is meant to be a deliberately restrained feminist Gothic
noir interpretation. However, despite its high-quality inputs this film
is more about form than substance. It has not risen to its potential.
