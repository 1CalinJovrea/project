Disaster. Absolutely forgettable.

Recently, I tend to think that the first couple of thousand of votes
and reviewers are paid by the studios on IMDb.com and the flick will
receive its real score about half a year later.I browsed through dozens of 7 to 10 reviews and I couldn't believe my
eyes. Have you seen the same movie I watched yesterday? I loved 300 but
this one is a million miles from it. I really don't want to write about
the performance of Eva Green and Sullivan Stapleton because they
perfectly matched the movie itself: the storyline, the bloody scenes,
the dialogs, everything. Forgettable, CGI-packed action with
predictable rhythm of "calm" and intense scenes from beginning to end.
As far as I remember, the Persians never destroyed Athens and the
"rebirth" of Xerxes was also a joke, not to mention the union of
Artemisia and Themistokles. 300 was almost a perfect movie but it has
nothing to do with its glorious predecessor.
