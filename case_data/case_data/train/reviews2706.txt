Conventional but Effective Action-Thriller

In Cape Town, South Aftica, the rookie CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan
Reynolds) is a safe house keeper and is in love with his French
girlfriend Ana Moreau (Nora Arnezeder) that does not know about his
double life. When the most wanted rogue and former CIA agent Tobin Frost (Denzel
Washington) surrenders to the American Consulate to escape from an
attack of dangerous soldiers of fortune, he is brought to the safe
house to be interrogated by the specialist Daniel Kiefer (Robert
Patrick) and his team. However there is a breach in the safe house and
mercenaries break in the place expecting to capture Tobin Frost and
they kill Daniel and his men. Matt escapes with Tobin and he contacts
the CIA senior management Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard), David Barlow
(Brendan Gleeson) and Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga) that give
instruction to Matt to reach another safe house with the prisoner. But
Tobin warns Matt that there is an informer in the CIA and he shall not
trust in anyone. "Safe House" is a conventional but effective action-thriller with the
usual shootings, car chases and explosions. But the great cast, with
the charismatic Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds; great veteran
actors Brendan Gleeson and Sam Shepard; the always excellent Vera
Farmiga; and the gorgeous and unknown Nora Arnezeder, makes the
difference. The Hollywoodian commercial happy end is unrealistic but
certainly will pleasure a great number of viewers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Protegendo o Inimigo" ("Protecting the Enemy")
