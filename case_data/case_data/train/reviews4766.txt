A Great Indy Sci-Fi Flick

Wow - what a pleasant surprise!: A movie based on an interesting and
unique premise for a change (instead of another pimped-up Hollywood
reboot Leftist propaganda-fest). "Infinity Chamber" is an excellent
example of how a compelling story can make up for a smaller budget.The acting is decent, the dialog isn't distracting, the cinematography
is respectable, the sound design is balanced - which is to say nothing
pops out as being sub-par - everything "fits" pretty well. The story
can be a little confusing in places, but that's part of the appeal as
you find yourself wanting to figure out what's going on - what's real,
and what's fantasy/simulation.Is "Infinity Chamber" filled with Michael Mann-splosions and crazy CG
effects? Nope. Will you miss them? It depends on what you watch movies
for: something that makes you think, or, something that requires zero
mental involvement and that you flush the moment you walk out of the
theater (this movie is the former). If you like movies like "Primer",
"Cube" and "Moon" (somewhat cerebral movies taking place in limited
environments), you will likely enjoy this one as well.
