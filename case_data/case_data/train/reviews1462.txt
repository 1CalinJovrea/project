Deep and moving movie

Demolition is an amazing movie, combining several intertwined lines all
connecting at the end. There were some heavy and sensitive issues
tackled by this film and they did an awesome job.I thought the script was well written. I must admit, I didn't see parts
of it coming toward the end.I thought the acting was outstanding. Jake keeps himself in incredible
shape and he needed to for this role. It was very physical in parts.
His character, you have to feel for him and what he is going through,
losing his partner. Chris Cooper is one amazing actor. There are bits
where the water works almost turn on. Just amazing.
