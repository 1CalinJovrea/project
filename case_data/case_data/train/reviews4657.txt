Absolute crap

I really liked the first ResEvil movie, and I've been going along with
them ever since, but this is the end of the line for me. This movie was
a total waste of time and money. There's no plot, just a situation that
Alice has to fight her way out of. There are some good stunts but
nothing we haven't seen before. Most of the action is just
ridiculous...bad guys that don't die, guns that don't run out of ammo,
characters that can be interchangeably good or evil at the whim of the
scriptwriter. It's like a five-year-old playing with toy soldiers. The
actors are so wooden, and look so plastic that I honestly couldn't tell
if they were CGI creations or actual human beings.Milla and her husband should be ashamed of themselves.
