Far worse than imaginable.

Let me start by saying something good about this movie. IT'S OVER!
THANK GOD!I won't bore you with the details, but clearly once you make a name for
yourself in Hollywood you can take on as many bad roles as you want and
still get work. I damn near walked out of this one on a few occasions.
Painful to sit through and very likely my last time wasting money on a
Will Farrell movie. Amy Poehler was every bit as unwatchable and should
be lucky to have a job.
