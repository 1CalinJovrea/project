Unbelievable

This is the worst movie I have ever watched on the big screen. This is
my first review for a movie and I am sharing my opinion towards this
movie because I don't want anyone to waste their time watching this.So basically the story is about four college girls that are massive
partiers who want to escape reality and go somewhere for Spring Break.
But wait, they don't have enough money to go anywhere so they steal it;
they use that money to go to Florida, to party! Then the girls are
like, "I love it out here, it is so much different from reality." In my
head I was like "what?" all you did back in college was do drugs and
party anyway. Then they all get caught up with a gangster and things go
crazy. Selena Gomez leaves first, then the girl with the pink hair
leaves second, after realizing that they are getting caught up in some
crazy stuff with a gangster. Later on guns go off, people die, the end.So is there a message in this movie? The message is that over time you
will find yourself reflecting upon your past actions (crazy actions in
the case of this movie)and realize that what you have done was
horrible. The message was shallowly portrayed in this disgusting movie.
For one, there was this one scene that was repeated like 10 times, and
other scenes were repeated multiple times as well. The line "Spring
break forever" was repeated like a million times. The action was
horrendous and the comedy... hmmm, there was none of that. This movie
was like one of those annoying pop songs that repeat the same line over
and over again and which are meaningless as well. The script of this
movie was so dull and ridiculous. This movie could have been like
thirty minutes shorter if they hadn't repeated the same thing over and
over and over again. The only reason I watched the whole thing is
because my friends wanted to watch it. If you want to watch a fake
party, and the four main girls doing ridiculous everything for an hour,
watch it.
