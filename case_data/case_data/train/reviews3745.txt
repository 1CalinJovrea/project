Sparse and disjointed, not at all like the book,  made for TV , watered-down, sterilized, pop-art depiction of a classic!

I despair to think that people who watch this movie will think that it
is in any way representative of the book, because it simply is not.(Please, please read 'On the Road' and follow that by reading 'Junky'
by Burroughs, they are life-changing books).The film is not, in one iota, representative of the book! It is
lifeless, has no spirit, dilutes and disinfects, sterilizes for mass
consumption one of the most important books of the 20th century and of
American literature! In one word, the treatment of the book is
irresponsible.There is no time spent on one of the most important aspects of the book
- the flowing prose style that Kerouac employed to truly engage the
reader and bring them into his world and the pace at which he felt he,
and the time, was moving. Very important parts of the book are brushed
over, and the parts that remain are not recreated effectively.I don't have time to list the many ways in which the creators of this
movie just simply did not "get it".If I did not know better, watching this movie I would assume that the
people behind the movie hadn't even read the book, and if they had read
it, they had not understood it in the slightest.However, I am sure Hollywood played a part in removing the soul of the
movie because they were afraid the mass audience wouldn't understand or
be interested in it. Of course they would! Read the book you hacks!
