A Most Beautiful Love Story

At times I feel that humanity has forgotten, or never really knew, what
it is to really love someone. Jojo Moyes obviously isn't one of those
people. Love isn't the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship.
It's not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could be
like or how compatible we are. It's not about how financially
successful a prospective partner is. It's certainly not all about sex,
although it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the media
generally plays strongly to that idea. It's the undeniable,
overwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really let
ourselves care about someone unselfishly. Thank you Jojo for playing this out so beautifully. Thank you Emelia
and Sam for either knowing this experience or fabulously, convincingly
portraying it on screen. This movie is a treat to watch and a glimpse
of what it feels like to be a person who lives their life with a moral
conscience, an open mind, a respect for beliefs that are different than
yours and a desire to see the best in the world. I feel absolutely cleansed of negativity after watching this and my
hope for the world is renewed. A glorious experience!
