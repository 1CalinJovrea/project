excellence from michael bay

From last 4 days i have been reading reviews for this movie n 95
percent of audience give it a low rating...critics are dumb i know that
but audiences now too r becoming dumb..this is the best transformers
movie from michael bay...i was actually waiting for this direction from
michael bay since i watched 2007 part and age of extinction..he did
it...the best director of all time..a great cinematic experience beyond
imagination..only bay can do it...thank u michael bay for this.
