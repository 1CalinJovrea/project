Derivative and plain boring.

Goodman plays Howard, a paranoid psychopath and the proprietor of a
large underground hideout, built for the occasion. In said hideout, he
plays house to two co-dwellers: a bearded moron (John Gallagher Jr) and
an attractive young lady played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Is there
really a threat outside, will Howard behave himself? The problem is,
after 20 minutes of tedious scenario and bland characters, who really
cares?The film never picks up any speed, sports no subplots, feels like it
could go anywhere without sticking to any internal logic (which indeed
it doesn't) and merely serves hollow and underused characters. It's obvious the writers of this project wanted to fuse two genres of
film but ended up having half the audience wet their pants over the
ridiculous ending in which an alien spacecraft is destroyed by a bottle
of Single Malt and the other half of the audience so abashed, they dare
not admit they just wasted 2 hours of their lives.
