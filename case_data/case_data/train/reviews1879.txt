A perfect way to ruin your evening

I'm beginning to think that any film containing Ryan Gosling is going
to be garbage! Before watching this film, I promised that I wouldn't
compare it to the silent musical he featured in prior; Driven. I should
have known better.The Place behind the Pines jumps from 1 year later to 15 years later
and still leads you to a dead end. Just when you think this movie is
about Gosling robbing banks to support his son, it makes a left turn
and now we are thrown into a movie involving corrupt cops. As stated
before, the movie then jumps 15 years a head in time to a screen play
you could find on the Lifetime channel involving a father and his
rebellious son. When the story tries to make it's explosive twist to
bring all the stories together, you are left thinking; who cares and
what does it matter.... Once the final, riding off into the sunset,
scene displayed, I realized that I was sitting there with my mouth
open. Why? If you want to waste a good 2 hours of your life, by all
means- check this movie out. As for me, I could have done my laundry.
