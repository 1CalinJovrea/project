Best comedy in years

I watch this at least once a week. It just gets better and funnier as
it goes along following Melisss's character and her side kick. This
movie wouldn't have worked without Miranda. Great yin and yang!
Theyshould remake AbFab! Melissa as Edina ans Miranda as a super tall
Patsy. AbFab on Speed! I can't wait for the sequel. This was a
brilliant movie for adults, apparently some people are squeamish. I'm
lucky I'm not a little bitch who leaves 10 bad reviews from different
emails because my 12th cat died. I don't understand these bad reviews
unless it's just haters with a bible up their butts. They'll probably
vote For Trump lol. Ewwwwwwww can you say pass√©? I don't trust reviews
usually so I'm here to say this movie actually made me laugh. Nothing
makes me laugh anymore. Five stars
