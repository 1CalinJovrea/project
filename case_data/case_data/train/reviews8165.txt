Awful film

I started to look at my watch after about half an hour in to this awful
film. I call it the watch test, if I am straining to see the dial on my
watch to see how much longer it goes on for, it is going to be a bad
movie. Will I be able to endure the torture or will I spring out of my
seat and walk out. I never look at my watch in a good movie, because
time goes quickly. The film has no proper story, is badly directed,
badly acted and just about as exciting as watching paint dry.The story is ridiculous, the bomb bit straight out of 'Goldfinger' but
there the resemblance stops! I know it is supposed to be a comedy
thriller, but it just isn't funny or thrilling in any way. Nearly two
hours long, it seemed like a long haul flight. Guy Ritchie should pack
up making movies and just live on 'Lock Stock' memories. I was
astonished to see that the film has done well at the box office, but I
guess the dumber a movie is these days doesn't stop it making money.I feel hurt that my eight quid adds to the profits, I hope you save
your money and buy a DVD of the old sixties show.
