Really depends on what you're looking for..

Baywatch is super cheesy, low brow, campy, ridiculous, etc, etc.....but
you know what? That's enjoyable sometimes! You don't knowingly buy a
ticket to a movie like this and then go write a review afterwards
complaining about plot, teenage boy humour, and character development.
hahaha. I had low expectations, shut my brain off at the door, and
enjoyed this movie for what it was.
