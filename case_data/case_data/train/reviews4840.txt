Loved it! Feast for your eyes and ears, best movie this year

Amazing Rush, very believable story in a beautiful setting. It is so good, it almost hurt when it ended, beautiful music too.I must admit i could see where it was all going, but enjoyed it
nonetheless.How could Rush believe that Sutherland would be satisfied with so
little money?! He should never have disclosed the real value of his acquisitions to
him. And the morale of the story is - don't tell an artist that he can't
paint, as he will get back at you one day.
