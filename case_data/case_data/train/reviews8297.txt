spoiler alert! The ending makes no sense

I found a fascination in watching the early Wrong Turn movies. The
premise of the first film was a group of tourists who take the wrong
turn and end up fighting for their lives against disfigured cannibals.
One of the early films in the series revealed that the people resorted
to cannibalism after there was no game to hunt and kill. The birth
defects were the result of some kind of company went out of business. I
believe it was a chemical company that poisoned the environment. The
early films tried to explain the disfigured family of cannibals. In
this film which makes no sense especially the final scene. Like the
resort is suddenly restored and there are guests all of a sudden. I
thought the resort was abandoned. Then Danny doesn't seen bothered by
the cannibalism and Sally. The final act in the spa and the cannibals
watching them have sex was troubling. Danny wants to get Sally
pregnant. The scene was creepy and bizarre. The film made no sense
whatsoever.
