Refreshing

Movie is not as disgusting as announcements and trailer were
indicating, but it definitely isn't for those with weak stomach.
Teenage drama with elements of black humor about girl who tries to
overcome her childhood traumas and find herself through exhibitionistic
sexuality and pretty sick experimenting. Movie is a bit shocker, but it
is not disgusting only for the sake of shocking audience. Everything
has its place and purpose in telling this story. Movie is refreshing
and entertaining, but not too good. I would rate it between 6 and 7,
but Carla Juri deserves 10, so let it be 8/10..................................
