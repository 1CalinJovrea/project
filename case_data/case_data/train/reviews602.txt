Well done, under-seasoned

A well-written film, with great casting (I'll honestly watch anything
if Rebecca Hall has a part), and a good set of producers, just how I
like'em.Sadly, there were some parts that made you "wonder" if this was a low
budget project. The obvious references to The Imitation Game from the
trouble-with-the-law intro to the burning-piles-of-paper ending.And does Tom Howe not understand how to make an "original" soundtrack?
It's embarrassing to take an entire score from 2014 and change a few
notes in an attempt to make it unique. They might as well gotten
Desplat himself, but didn't because, of course; the budget. There are
so many independent artists who would've done a proper original score
for almost nothing.At other points, things would just go left, far left, completely
derailing for a couple minutes as if two writers were struggling to
work together, one trying to tell a proper and engaging story, and the
other trying to announce the film's LGBT agenda.A small note to the production team, it's 2017, not 2007. We can tell a
fake plane when we see it (Ahem Mr.Lingenfelser). If you're going to
add CGI, please don't go cheap or rush the CGI team. Proper rendering
and shading matters.I did very much enjoy the film, but the familiar taste and conflicting
ingredients made things a little hard to swallow.7/10
