An animated masterpiece

My Little Pony: The Movie is jaw dropping beautiful in it's artwork, a
solid story of the power of friendship, and a musical score to rival
other animated masterpieces such as The Land Before Time, All Dogs Go
To Heaven and An American Tail; indeed, a viewer could think Don Bluth
himself was at the helm of this venture.The young pony princess, Twilight Sparkle, stays committed to saving
her homeland alongside her friends, fighting her own fears as she
resists the very real threat pursuing her. Innocent, gentle, and
emotionally fragile, she is inspirational in her bravery to seeing this
adventure to the end.Children will be swept up in the silliness and vibrant colors and the
not-so-young will enjoy the nostalgia of a finely crafted 2D animated
movie such as were made when they were children themselves. This film
will be a treasured part of any families video library for generations.
