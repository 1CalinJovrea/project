Hard punching and straight forward film delivers

Scott Cooper takes a sharp turn from the school book tone of his last
film Crazy Heart and brings us to a more dismal world in Out of the
Furnace. Our hero, Russel Baze, (played smartly by Christian Bale), is
a well intentioned and responsible man who in trying to protect his
brother meets cruel and cold irony and is sent wayward in this ruined
world. Meanwhile his brother returns from deployment with a terrible
case of post traumatic stress disorder and brings his chaos into the
"imbred" and lawless hills of New Jersey, led by the degenerate Harlan
Degroat, (Woody Harrelson).Now, the story in the vein of films like Deer Hunter and Winter's Bone,
two films I personally admire for capturing the delicacy of people amid
depressed communities. It's hard to say this film doesn't measure up.
The lighting, sound, cinematography, editing, story, are all
accomplished with the utmost professionalism. However, if the script
fell into the wrong hands its flaws would easily be detected because
the weakness of its integrity would show. The story takes too many
short cuts to get where it needs to go. Some might already find it
slow. It is after all a vignette of the decline of our hero. However, what really made this movie work for me was the brilliant
performances of the trait. William Dafoe as a local and smart small
time boss. Sam Shepard as the uncle, a face of masculinity and
integrity, Tom Bower as a complex and familiar bartender and gate man.
Casey Affleck as the young and traumatized brother, Forrest Whitaker as
the conflicted cop, Zoe Saldana as the girlfriend. Though, it's
Harrelson who really steals the show, he's evil, beyond logic and
powerful You can't wait to see him again and that antagonistic
combination is rare and even more scarcely pulled off.Out of the Furnace won't be nominated for best screenplay. However, in
my eyes, it should get a nod for everything else.
