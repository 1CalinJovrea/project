One Of The Rawest Dramas Of Recent Years

An emotionally hard hitting and raw film that focuses on Lee Chandler,
a man whose life has gone down the drain and is now leading one of
personal emotional mayhem. There may be those out there who find that
this film drags in certain parts, however the cleverly executed
non-linear plot and near-flawless performances of conflict, hate and
sly humour from the likes of Casey Affleck (who is now my favourite for
the Oscar) makes 'Manchester by the Sea' one of the most gritty and
emotionally-reverent dramas of recent years.With a plot that dashes backwards and forwards, Lonergan has crafted an
intense and almost shocking plot that gradually builds Affleck's
character through the clever use of flashbacks and disguised thrills.
Affleck has slowly been proving himself as an acting body to be
commended, and this film has finally given us his most complex
performance to date, that of a man on a path of self-inflicted
emotional trauma. A film that hits hard and leaves a lasting
impression.
