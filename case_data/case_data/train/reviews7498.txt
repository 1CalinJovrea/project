Great possibility but very frustrating

At the beginning, you sense great possibilities and the plot looks
exciting; then, flop down!!! To start, there is no connection between
the mother working as a housekeeper and the rest of the story about a
girl locked up. You figure it out and join the dots.WHY?? Why can't the
story be told smoothly? The rest is a bunch of little stories put
together with the only connection being that you see the same actors
so, in your mind, you figure it out and fill the holes. Why? Another
example, Rosario's big poster is shown at the beginning with no
explanation whatsoever while Vince looks at it pensively. Who is she? a
dead wife? A sister/cop killed in action? Mystery! Later on, you see
Rosario but there is no connection between all of that and the charity
event. Suddenly, Jeffrey and Nicole are kissing and seem to be having a
relationship whereas, in the previous scene, he is just joining the
force. When did that happen? You only discover that 8 years have passed
in their casual conversation. And this goes on and on. There are so
many holes you could have played cartoons during the movie. Like I
said, there was a great possibility but somebody goofed big time.
