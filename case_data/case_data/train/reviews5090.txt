Incredibly funny and emotional

It's an amazing movie filled with love and incredible moments of
life.Its about love for your family,a crazy family or a dysfunctional
one,one might say but though they've drifted apart a bit they still
love each other.You will laugh,cry,feel annoyed at times but most
importantly love this movie.You will be laughing at the hilarious
scenes and feeling incredibly emotional at times. At first I thought it
would just be another movie to follow in the lines of others but it
was't. It's fresh,something new and heartwarming. If you're looking for
something with a mix of drama,comedy and love,then this is your stop.
You won't be disappointed. It's something that I'd want to watch more
than once and actually feel like it was a great waste of my time. It's
worth it!
