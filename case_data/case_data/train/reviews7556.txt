Why not loans?

I couldn't help but wondering this whole movie why these parents are
going through such crap when their child could just take out loans like
every other millennial these days. Irrelevant plot.There were some
funny points, but Amy just isn't funny here. Jason Mantzoukas was the
best part of the film.
