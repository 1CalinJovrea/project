Awful, absolutely awful!

Against all reasoning I decided to watch the full movie remake. Where
can I begin. First, Leslie Jones (while sometimes funny on SNL) should
hang up her acting career and stick to stand-up. She was horrible! I
thought I was watching a female Richard Pryor on steroids. Kate
McKinnon must have gone to the same acting class as Leslie. The only
female deserving of being on the movie at all was Melisa McCarthy
because she at least can hold up the others in the cast.They should have cut the remainder of the movie 15 minutes in and
replaced it with old Godzilla footage. Maybe have Melissa McCarthy
stomping on toy trucks and cars.
