A thrill ride of a movie that will leave you awed by the time it's finished. JUST SEE IT!

One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is
unrivaled, twists and turns around every corner. You can't predict
what's coming next.The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption
nepotism even greed and how deep it goes in the system. This will
strike a cord in many countries today. It's about a cat and mouse game
to see who can pull more tricks.Sloane is one badass character. Jessica Chastain delivers a phenomenal
performance! I'm definitely going to see more of her films now.Besides the amazing plot and acting, another thing that stood out to me
was that the only person not selling her was the call-boy. Talk about
irony. One considered working a "filthy" job is the only one with
ethics and moral.Probably some of you won't agree given the low ratings the movie has
here but we're all entitled to have our opinions.A thrill ride of a movie that will leave you awed by the time it's
finished. JUST SEE IT!
