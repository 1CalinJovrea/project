boring horrible movie

I could not understand a word she was saying half the time like she was
mumbling, no shot of JFK Jr. when he saluted his fathers coffin an very
important moment. it bounces around and becomes confusing as the what
the hell is going on. what a waste of time. I am so sorry I even
watched it kept hoping it would get better but no such luck
