Sweet Gothic Horror

"Crimson Peak" has much to recommend it. Its cast is spot on, its
costume design and set are beautiful and spooky. The story itself
doesn't really go for the cheap thrills that most horror today goes
for, and I appreciate that.Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston have a fantastic chemistry and you
readily fall in love with the love story they present you, but the real
jewel of the film is Jessica Chastain. As soon as she walks on screen
you know something wicked this way comes. Her piercing glare and
overall sense of distaste for the other characters really unease's you
in the most fun way. You can see little to no sympathy in her face and
you cannot wait to see just where she'll go with it.The story starts off as pleasantly as any period piece and you wonder
what the ghouls and ghosts are up to, and whether they are in cahoots
with Hiddleston and Chastain. Unfortunately by the second half, the
movie looses some of its spook and becomes somewhat predictable in
plot, but because of this you will be able to watch it over and over
again without ever really getting bored. This is because the horror
isn't the selling point of the story, the heart of the characters are.
And each character has more heart than they could possibly know what to
do with. The acting is superb and although this story has been told in one way
or another, you still root for a positive outcome. Guillermo del Toro
creates yet another masterpiece of film. I fully enjoyed it. 8/10
