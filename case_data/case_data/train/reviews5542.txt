Awesome trip to the late 80s

Charlie was outstanding. I haven't been so entertained by a woman agent
since Along kiss Goodnight. She played the hell out of that part. The
movie took me back to a time I had long forgotten with their great use
of 80's classics, wardrobe and the general feel of that time period. I
was only 15 in 1989 so didn't much cared for the Berlin event. Seeing
it through this movie gave me a new appreciation of that period in
US,French,British, Russian counter espionage, so Move over Jason Bourne
and 007. This blonde is a killer.
