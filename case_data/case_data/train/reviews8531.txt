Excellent movie, well worth the price of admission.

Very well made movie, very well acted, and directed. Going in I was worried that the movie would turn into an action
thriller or a love story that would cloud what really happened.I was pleasantly surprised to find a step by step account of real
events with a deep look at what goes on behind the scenes at the
various spy agencies.Personally I would have liked a little more time spent on the
politicians (and other behind the scenes players) and how they acted
before and after the Snowden revelations, but maybe that's a topic for
another movieI would recommend this movie to anyone interested in modern history and
geopolitics
