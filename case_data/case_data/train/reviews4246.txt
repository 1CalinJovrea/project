Humorless, you might have to be retarded or below the age of 5 to enjoy this

It is a really bad movie. The jokes (if any) are nonexistent unless you
laugh at people named poopypants in which case you should watch it. On
paper, it looks like an interesting idea but the execution is terrible.
The main motive of the supervillain is to eradicate laughter from the
world and he seems to have succeeded because I wasn't laughing at all.
I don't think anybody was. There is no story, the dialog is meaningless
and boring, the plot - no plot here. I don't understand why this movie
had to be made. There is no place for jokes about poop and silly names
n movies anymore, maybe a long time back but Hollywood has come a long
way and if they feel that such jokes are still in vogue, they have
underestimated the audience. Or maybe they haven't and I am being
harsh. No. That's not it. This is clearly a cash grab and it's
pathetic.
