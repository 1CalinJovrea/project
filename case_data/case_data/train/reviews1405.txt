God, it stank!

I'm a fan Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy's been making some good
performances lately, but this is one movie that they should just write
off as poor judgement. And I'm really sorry to say this, because it was
a good idea and I certainly hope that someone, sometime in the future
will take the idea and make a good movie out of it.The comedy of the movie was too forced, which, I have to say, has been
happening to most of the American comedies. I really haven't seen a
truly good and funny American comedy in years.They moved to TV.I'm trying to find specific things to say what was so wrong, but there
was too much of it. Firstly, I don't buy the bromance between FDR and
Tuck. You just don't see the closeness they talk so much about. No.2,
Chelsey Handler is soooo annoying, I actually hoped she'd die when Tuck
blew her tires. The whole movie has just too much talking and talking
and talking without saying anything (a good movie for politicians LOL).
For me, personally, a good movie is quite the opposite - saying with
very little talking (guess that is why Woody Allen annoys me so much).Actually, the only decent performance came from Til Schweiger and I
hoped he'd be the last one standing.And, one more thing, since I'm from Serbia and can't help mentioning,
since Sokolov and Tuck talk in Serbian: Sokolov is not a Serbian name,
it's Russian. Russian language is not the same as Serbian language.
Serbian people, who speak English fluently, speak it with almost no
accent and, if thay do, it certainly doesn't sound Russian. I'm
surprised that Mike Dopud messed it up.
