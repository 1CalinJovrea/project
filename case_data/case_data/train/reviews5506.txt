Josh Brolin is cool!

The MIB duo of Agent Jay (Will Smith) and Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones)
are back in action. When the world is threatened by an evil alien,
Agent Jay travels back in time to 1969, where he teams up with the
younger Agent Kay to stop an evil villain named Boris (Jemaine Clement)
from destroying the world in the future. Emma Thompson will play
take-charge MIB operative Agent Oh, who is monitoring a prison
breakout.The first of the Men In Black franchise was a great movie. It was
highly successful and from that spawned a Men In Black dance, a no. 1
hit single from the soundtrack, loads of toys and a cartoon series. The
second film was awful; truly awful; beyond terrible and instantly
forgettable. This latest instalment is somewhere between the 1st and
the 2nd film. To be honest, it wasn't great at all! Let me get straight
into it this.Performances, apart from one, measure up from terrible to very good.
Smith reprises his role as Agent J and is as funny and charismatic as
he's always been. Tommy Lee Jones has a small part to play in this, but
he's an actor who can say one line throughout an entire film and still
show more presence than most of the cast members. Emma Thompson throws
in her 10 pence worth and does OK, but it's Josh Brolin who is very
good playing the younger version of Agent K. Most people will agree
that Brolin is a highly rated actor who has played a myriad of
characters in his career. An almost uncanny performance from Brolin as
well as the talented Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) who plays alien
Griffin are the standouts in this film. Everyone else does what they're
supposed to do and they are where they're meant to be I suppose.Set pieces are boring and nothing special. The actual story itself
isn't that bad, but the whole thing feels rushed. The main villain
Boris The Animal played by Jermaine Clement from Flight of the Concords
fame, belongs in the category of one of the worst villains ever to
grace the screen. Just rubbish Â– nothing special about that him at all.
I think only Lara Flynn Boyle in the second movie faired better, with
Vincent D'Onofrio being the best of a bad bunch. Actually D'Onofrio was
awesome in the first film.I think I fell asleep for about five minutes or five seconds. I don't
know, Men In Black 3 is just average. It didn't grab me like the first
film did and I was really hoping that this would. There's nothing else
to say, but just don't make a 4th film Mr Sonnefield. A real let down
and real waste of money, time and energy spent to get to the cinema on
time to watch this.
