The whole cinema was in hysterics by the end. Made the Spice Girls movie look good.

I've seen a lot of horror films that have been kinda OK. But this, I
mean. I honestly didn't think it would be that bad. THAT bad. You would
actually think that it was a comedy, by the end of the film, people
were actually laughing so hard, the whole cinema was laughing together.
Not even kidding.It was just so stupid. The acting wasn't bad but everything else was
stupid.1. Pointless symbolism? Kind of? (I don't even...) The moths for
example. Appeared in the movie about 5 times as if they were really
important and it wasn't even explained as to why they were SO key to
the plot. What was the point if it wasn't going to be explained what
their purpose was. Just threw them in there for the hell of it. Maybe
the director just likes moths. 2. Characters that are completely
oblivious and just dumb. Don't get the hint till about 20 mins from the
end. Yeah your child is just going through a phase...a phase of raw
steak eating, being obsessed over some stupid old box, stabbing you,
becoming the moth whisperer, looking like they're on deaths door. Yeah,
just a phase. I went through that too once. 3. The ending. I stopped
caring about the 'plot' at this point.Daughter possessed, dad
possessed, all possessed together! Yay! Exorcise my child? Here, take
my expensive as hell bmw! I don't need a car anymore. Randomly getting
hit by a lorry. Woops. R.I.P Jewish exorcist man, you will be missed.Don't waste your money if you think you're going to get horror. But if
you like comedy, I strongly recommend this. I laughed so hard I cried.1 star for the acting.
