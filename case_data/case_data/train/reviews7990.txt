Bland.

I'd like to begin by saying the original 2005 Sin City is one of my
favorite movies. The way it was put together, the cinematography, the
characters, the dialogue...everything. It was truly a breakthrough
film. This sequel however is a letdown. It's not the type of letdown
where the product can't match the hype, it's just everything I enjoyed
about the first movie turned over. Yes, A Dame to Kill For is still
broken into chapters and shot in B/W with occasions flashes of color,
and I loved the allusions to the previous film and comic books-
however, in contrast to the rich character depth and storyline, the
storyline(s) is flat, bland, and lacks the energy the dialogue
contained in the previous film. Also, the storyline isn't remotely as
interwoven as it was in the previous, the directors struggled to keep
the chapters intertwined-the *only* connection being Kadie's Bar, which
all of the characters visited at least once. I appreciated that Robert
Rodriguez and Frank Miller attempted to bring humor into the mix, but
Marv's second, "I hope you don't mind me saying this...." scene really
doesn't belong in the movie. This was my first review I hope you like it, I know it's not perfect,
but these are my thoughts in a nutshell.
