excellent and action packed

This film is by one of my favourite directors Michael Apted. I loved
Gorillas in the Mist and Chasing Mavericks and he has not disappointed
with Unlocked.The plot is very current with many unexpected plot twists, high action
scenes and a refreshingly powerful female lead.
