Most disappointing film of the year

I know, everyone is gushing about this movie. That, on top of the fact
that I am a PT Anderson fan (Magnolia, for one, is probably a top 10
favorite of mine), is what made this so disappointing.First, the good. Amy Adams does very well in a supporting role. The
whole thing is beautifully filmed, and I liked the music as well. I
thought it captured the feel of the time period very well.On to the bad (of which there is substantially more, in my view). I'll
start with the plot. There is almost none, and the movie has no hook.
It never made me forget I was sitting in a movie theater. Its pace is
maddeningly slow, and it is too long. A good portion of the film is
spent watching Phoenix walk back and forth between a window and a wall
for reasons that remain rather opaque. Yes, it's that kind of movie.I didn't care at all about Phoenix's character or Hoffman's, and
despite the rave reviews, I think neither actor brought their A-game to
this one. Their characters were one dimensional, unsympathetic, and
unrelatable. They didn't feel like real people. They don't really
change much over the course of the movie.What irked me most, though, was that the movie really didn't have
anything to say. It had no real insights into anything. It didn't make
me think or challenge my mind in any way.When a movie fails to make me think or feel, as this one did, I can't
help but regret spending money on it.
