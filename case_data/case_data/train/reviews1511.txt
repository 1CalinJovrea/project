What Movie was this again? It was NOT The Jungle Book that I knew . . .

I guess this will be a spoiler because I found the story line to be so
far from the original, I feel I had to tell you before you wasted your
time and money to see it.I don't know what story this director was trying to copy, but it wasn't
The Jungle Book that I know. The only resemblance to the original story
are the character names.There's some stupid part that the elephants created everything, and
they had to bow to them to show respect?? What?And, he never sees the little girl! As far as we know he stays in the
jungle??No where near the original story line. Disappointed that this guy felt
he had to re-do the entire story to conform to his stupid theology.NOTE: the animation and graphics were really cool, but that's not an
excuse to change the entire story. It would have been a super movie IF
he would have stayed with the story line.This guy obviously likes himself a little too much to think he has a
right to make Jungle Book any way he wants and still call it "Jungle
Book".
