10
A beautifully crafted version of Dracula. Worth the watch

First and foremost I know it's appalling that I am giving this a 10 but
because I went to watch this movie knowing fully that I ought to
disregard the true history of it and the classic Dracula novel from
1897 Gothic horror by Irish author Bram Stoker. I kept and open mind
and my mind was blown away. Luke Evans is an amazing actor that carried out such a brilliance
performances. I was so moved by the internal struggle he was portraying
as a good hearted prince Vlad to the demon that he was becoming
Dracula. I felt for his character deeply. It may have been a short
movie in comparison to most movie out there but in that short period of
time, I thought it was beautifully told how much he loved his wife and
his son. How much he cares for his country and the length a good prince
would go through to protect what he holds dear to him heart. The cinematography was very beautifully artsy. It is not like 300 where
there is unnecessary blood and gore. It's more artistic and tastefully
done. No need for all those gore. This movie isn't about horror or
violence's. It's about how he became Dracula. It's about the person he
was before all the evils. About a men that gave everything to save the
things he love and the ultimate sacrifice he made to protect his
family. I know there are a lot of bad criticism out there for this movie
because it's not gore enough or there isn't enough bloody mess and also
some that say that the special effect was a joke but I think it's
definitely worth the watch and I think this movie is worthy of being in
the "good movie " category. The special effects may not be as good as
lord of the ring or 300 but considering the budget wasn't as high as
those other movies, this movie surpassed all of them. It's worthy of a movie that is consider a better movie than most out
there. Give it a chance. You will not regret it.
