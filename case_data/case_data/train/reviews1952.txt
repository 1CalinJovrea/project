Thoroughly enjoyed the movie

All movies can be scrutinized for faults, as some reviewers have done,
but if the movie makes a mark, then those faults really don't matter,
do they? I found the "angry" Will Traynor not completely believable,
not like the anti-social Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets, but Sam
Clafin did well with his transformation. Emilia Clarke was absolutely
wonderful and I will be on the lookout for other roles she has taken
and will undertake in the future. Kudos also to the characters who
played Will's parents, Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Two thumbs up
for the movie. Am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bump
another movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list.
