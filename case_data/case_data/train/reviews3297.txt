Nicely highlighting the evil inside mankind

Humans are failed species and this movie reminds me that nauseate
information again. From beginning of the movie, all humans on the screen aimed only
destruction. Kill or mock everything they interact and got troubled all
because of their own actions.After the worst thing could happened to them happened they ask for
mercy... which we do not deserve.And add idiotic back stories like, trying not to give away "secrets"
like cannibalism, etc... This movie makes me sick because it reminds me how shallow human being
can be.At the end, main characters refused to tell a lie, not to obey the
rules of "companies that keeps the wheel running" and reveal the bs
they caused is just plain awful. That didn't even important because all
the whole oil industry goes on to this day? that integrity does means
nothing.It tells us about the importance of honour, virtue, integrity etc. but
let me tell you something. All virtues and merits created by man,
serves the man to justify all mankind's moronic and absurd decisions
and actions.
