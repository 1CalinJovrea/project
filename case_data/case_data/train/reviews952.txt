A once great franchise raped without any shame or remorse and doing so with a smile by Arnie all the way through.

What is there to say? A quick summery: Everything is over the top.
Instead of using one good idea like T1 and T2 they try to cram as many
(bad) ideas as possible into one movie. We get like 4 terminators, 3 time machines, 3 time periods, an app that
is about to take over the world, nonstop cheesy one liners, to many
'funny' moments, to many plot twists. Ridiculous characters. A high
school princess as Sarah Connor. B-grade acting. Generic action. A
senior terminator attempting comedy.The worst part: it has no tension buildup at all. What made T1 and T2
such great movies was the suspense of being chased by one (not 3)
almost completely indestructible machine. That haunting feeling, done
so well in the past, is totally missing. Overall it felt more like a
poorly executed attempt at comedy with a convoluted mess of a plot. This is a new low point in the franchise with a terminator named 'pops'
saying awkward lines and doing creepy smiles. This is Terminator for
the marvel generation. Braindead entertainment at its finest. Sadly a
growing trend in Hollywood.Please tell me this was just a fan made parody and the actual movie is
still under development, right?
