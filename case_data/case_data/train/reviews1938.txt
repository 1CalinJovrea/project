Ignore all the bad reviews!  This was a good movie.

** Possible Spoilers **First off, I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about
with this "alternate universe" theory. The fact is this movies ties
perfectly with the first one. All the same characters are in the movie
from the first one and many references are made to Doc, so not sure how
this thought came about. This movie is essentially a version of cars where Lightning McQueen
actually aged, meaning he is not the same age as in the first one. With
age, especially in sports, comes new, and younger, talent. In this
movie lighning McQueen is faced with this same challenge, new, younger,
talent who are training in new, more advanced, ways. With this younger
talent and better training methods (Lightning McQueen still trains like
he did under Doc) Lightning is having a tough time competing against
the new guys. He essentially has to make a choice, adapt with new
training or retire. I won't go into the details of his choice as I
don't want to spoil it for anyone. However, this movie was very good and, I thought, a fitting end to the
franchise. Can you imagine a Rocky movie where Rocky never ages and
just keeps fighting and beating everyone? No, and that is not how the
Rocky series ended. Rocky retired and helped the new up and coming
fighter. That is somewhat what happened here. I can only assume the others making the reviews wanted Lightning to be
perpetually young and just keep racing and racing and beating everyone,
movie after movie. The writers wisely chose not to follow that formula.
Yes, I will agree, there is a bit more of a story here than just pure
racing, and perhaps that is what people didn't like. However, that
didn't make it a bad movie. I hated Cars 2 but I did really like Cars 3. It's not a perfect movie
but also isn't what people are making it out to be. Give it a chance
and I think you will like it.
