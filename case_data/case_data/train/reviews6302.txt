Beautiful love story

I have been looking forward to this film because of the story line.
There are so many things to like about it - the flashbacks are well
done and so believable. The costumes are so fun to watch. I do not
think I have seen Blake Lively act before and I was clearly entranced
by her performance. She carries the film so well and is so quiet and
well done. I liked the actors - Michaeil Haisman is gorgeous and
believable. Harrison Ford - so happy to see him in a movie again - and
he is also believable as the father of Ellis. Elen Burnstyn is
delightful. This story could have been presented in such a different
manner - director Lee Toland Kreiger got it, and it is beautiful
story-telling. I love the last scene.
