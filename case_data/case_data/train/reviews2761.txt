What Planet Do These People Live On?

Lots of trepidations writing this review, as I see others liked the
movie, but, to be honest, I just thought it was atrocious, annoying,
and highly irritating. I'm no prude and can enjoy a good sex comedy if
it's funny, but when a film is just trying to be outrageously raunchy,
lewd, and crude and is terribly unfunny, I'm looking for the nearest
exit.Jason Sudekis and Alison Brie are most talented actors, but their
characters here are so obnoxious and self-absorbed that it all gets
quite nauseating. What planet are they from? Maybe, I should ask do I
belong on this planet, with a movie such as this getting some critical
acclaim?All in all, I've seen in some reviews comparisons of this movie with
"When Harry Met Sally", with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan. Huh? To me,
that was a real heart-felt classic rom-com from the past and, in my
opinion, should not be compared to this crapola.
