Kutcher is so wrong for this movie

Whoever thought the Kutcher could play Steve Jobs needs their head
examined! He makes the movie so difficult to watch (where was the
director for God's sake!).But the problems don't end there. Jobs' life is only partially
portrayed, so if you only know about Jobs being at Apple--that is still
pretty much all you know about him. Engineers are portrayed, as they
typically are in "Hollywood" films--nerdy enough to be uncool.Where is the story??!! Most people will be lost, there is not much
continuity, and you are left at the end wondering why you came to the
movie. You didn't learn anything new about Jobs, you are not sure what
the point was, and yet you spent two painful hours trying to get
something out of this film.It's a shame this movie was so awful.
