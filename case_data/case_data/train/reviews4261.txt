Brilliant drama

A lot of people are giving Lawless fairly negative reviews so I think I
need to explain why it's such a great film. First of all it's really
unique because of the specific setting of it during the prohibition in
the United States which made it interesting viewing.It is about three brothers who are running an illegal but successful
business which soon attracts attention they don't want and trouble
ensues. There is quite a lot of action in this film but it is mostly
about the drama and the different things each character goes through. There are some fantastic actors in this film who all show their
versatility and most notable for me was Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf who
did an amazing job of making their characters real to the audience and
made you really care for them. It is quite a long film but so many different things happen and it kept
me glued from start to finish. There are some very grim scenes, some
intense action, emotional scenes and of course romance and even a few
comical moments - I think this film has a bit of everything. This film is not all about the action so don't expect it to be, but the
main element is the theme of brotherhood which I loved. Also the fact
that Lawless is based on a true story made it really interesting for
me.It won't be for everyone but I thought this film was brilliant and
would recommend it.
