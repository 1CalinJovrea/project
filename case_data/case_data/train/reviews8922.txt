Not a bad action flick, indeed.

â€ŽNoomi Rapace does it again, bringing us another suspenseful action
thriller. (She did a Sci-Fi thriller for Netflix called What Happen to
Monday (Would recommend). For Unlocked, Rapace plays a CIA interrogator
called in after years of inactive duty to get info about a possible
bioweapon, when she discovers that the people she was working for are
not CIA. Now she's on the run and racing against the clock to prove to
the CIA she's on their side and stop a terrorist strike.Would have not expected the original Lisbeth Salander from The Girl
with The Dragon Tattoo series to become somewhat of an action movie
star. It maybe too early to make that call, but so far I like what
she's doing and I like what she was doing in this movie. Unlocked is
not a bad story to follow and it has plenty of action to keep me
satisfied.http://cinemagardens.com It also has a pretty stellar cast that
includes Orlando Bloom, Toni Collette, John Malkovich and Micheal
Douglas all taking Rapace lead. Little surprise that it was not in more
theaters as it turned into a good movie to watch.
