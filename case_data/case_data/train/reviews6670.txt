Took my 12 year old to see it and we were both BLOWN AWAY! A++

So no joke, I bought the soundtrack while the credits were rolling for
the car... for me the Mom! I was so utterly impressed, never got bored
and thought it was a kiddie movie, never not wanting to hear the next
song. Who ever chose the songs they perform is genius. I still cannot
get over the vocals of all of the actors, they were incredible.
Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Golden Slumbers is soul lifting. We just
saw t after the Christmas rush in 3D, and that was the best way to
really appreciate it. If your tween wants to see it, this is one you as
a parent will love.‚ù§ I can't get over "Eddie the Eagle" as "Mike", his
vocals are beyond incredible.
