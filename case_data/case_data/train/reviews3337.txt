Kind of fell apart for me at the end

Despite the many tropes of betrayal and faked deaths, I kind of liked
most of the movie. It had interesting parts and had some decent twists.
But the real bad guys and their motives were revealed. They basically
wanted to release a deadly virus to wipe out both the UK and the USA.
Of course, our heroine saves the day. But I missed a proper motivation
for the bad guys. Only the Joker gets away with 'just wanting to see
the world burn'. The jokers in this movie want these countries to be
more aware of potential danger, by endangering them. Really? I don't
buy it. Also, a boy gets infected in a lab and he runs back to play with his
buddies. The guy in the lab does not interfere. The child becomes ill,
but is quarantined in time and, miraculously, none of his buddies was
infected. This scene is just to show how horrible the virus is, but it
creates a giant plot hole.
