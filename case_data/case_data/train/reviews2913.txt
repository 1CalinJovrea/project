Intelligent, fun, moving and very entertaining movie with great cast

In my opinion the best movie out of Sundance in 2014 (and I watched
quite a few). Loved the concept and the cast, movie could be slightly
edited to move faster but what a trip! It presents itself as an
intelligent broad appeal release, not the typical indie-low
budget-gritty product of Sundance. I like more mainstream movies, and
loved this movie so my guess is that will resonate with a very large
audience when released. The love story is so convincing that casts a
haunting spell in the rest of the movie, and the scientific discovery
(don't want to spoil the story) is so cool and full of heart that if
true in real life would completely change the way we look at life and
relationships. Kudos to Fox Searchlight, they seem to be on a roll with
award winning titles and out of the box, but mainstream appealing
movies.
