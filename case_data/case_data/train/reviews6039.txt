Weird Movie

"Victor Frankenstein" is a weird movie using Mary Shelley's notorious
and famous character. There are many versions of this adaptation of the
novel to the cinema, but this one rewrites the story in a totally
different situation. The result is entertaining and intriguing in the
beginning but becomes boring and annoying in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Victor Frankenstein"
