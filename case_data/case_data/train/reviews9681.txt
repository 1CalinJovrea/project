Wow, why have I not heard of this film or seen any trailers?!

I am blown away after watching this masterpiece after hearing a friend
talk so highly of it. I asked them what it was about, and they said
"just go watch it". Well, every now and then a film comes along that
will leave an impact on you that will make it hard for you to forget.
This film is one of those.This story was told with such realism, even the actors did not seem
like they were acting. At first I was hesitant when I saw that Nikolaj
Coaster-Waldau - Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones was cast, but wow
did he nail his role. His transition from a white collar to jailed
convict was perfect. Even Jon Bernthal's acting was great. For that
matter, every character was cast perfectly and were very convincing in
their roles. The writing and screenplay is what truly made this film so great. It's
a story told really well, transitioning back and forth at just the
right time from back-story to current time, although I wish it had
opened with the white-collar scene first, then how it led into the
incarceration, and then additional back stories filled in. Had the
transitioning not happened, it would have been the best
documentary-type film I've ever seen, and felt even more realistic.
Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the way the story was told as well as the
unpredictability and surprise twists. By the end, I was left wanting
more!Stunt-man turned writer/director (also both for this film) Ric Roman
Waugh did an outstanding job converting the screenplay to a very
convincing on-screen masterpiece. The cinematography and editing were perfect, but the score could have
been a little better.I hope that based on the ending, there is at least a part 2 that comes
out very soon. It's a well deserved 9.5 rounded up to a 10/10 from me.
So now, just go watch it!
