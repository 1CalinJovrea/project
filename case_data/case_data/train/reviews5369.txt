Lars von Trier lost a plot a little

As much as the first part held a plot of the history and background of
a sex addiction to some extent,Vol 6 just hurt my eyes and ears and
bored me to sleep. The drastic images of self-abortion and self-
inflicted pain, as well as the vulgar sex scenes; I am not a qualified
psychologist/psychiatrist, but it all seems a little vague and
improbable to me. It is sort of upsetting that a film spiked with such
great cast (from Charlotte Gainsbourg, Shia LaBeouf, Uma Thurman,
Stellan Skarsgaard and Willem Dafoe) brought such poor outcome. Changes
between the young/old characters for Joe and Jerome did not work for me
either - the plot lost out on even more of its scarce credibility. The
film looks like a clueless mix of shocking images and clich√©
philosophical statement, and the poor, predictable and almost annoying
finale made me want to score it a 1/10 initially.Lars, we want more Melancholia and less of this.....
