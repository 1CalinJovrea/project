Boring, Unintelligent and Underwhelming

Well, that was rather disappointing unfortunately. Not that I can say
that I am very surprised though. The first installment in the series
started off being "okayish" and the rest of them slid downwards towards
mediocrity. This, the final installment, is a notch below mediocre as
far as I am concerned. I really cannot understand all the hype about
these movies. None of them really shines even if you try to look at
them as young adult movies which they really are.This one was downright boring. There were numerous scenes where Katniss
or some other character was just dreaming away or sitting around
brooding. It took quite a while for anything to start happening in the
movie.When something started happening it was the same mess of political,
unbelievably stupid, propaganda, messy and unintelligent fight scenes,
Katniss walking around looking, I do not really known, disconcerted,
sad, disturbed, whatever.How the chief villains (yes plural) was one could figure out without
too much effort. The moment the flyer came into the picture and started
to fly over the refuges and the children not only I but all of my kids
as well guessed who had sent it.There is really only two things that I liked about this movie. One is
that Donald Sutherland was really good. The other is the ending which,
although being 100% predictable, was quite satisfying. Well, that scene
(everyone having seen the movie knows which scene I am referring to) is
where I consider the movie to have ended. After that it was only boring
filler scenes remaining.
