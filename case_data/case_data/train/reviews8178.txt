Very suspenseful mystery thriller with an outrageously good ending

El Cuerpo (THE BODY) was my first experience watching a Spanish film
and I am extremely pleased I found it because it's a truly memorable
movie.The plot seems rather simple at the start, just like any usual police
investigation but it goes so much deeper throughout the film. I was
questioning everything and everyone and I still didn't see the twist
coming. It was completely outrageous but executed to perfection,
leaving me truly satisfied. The ending absolutely blew me away.Most of the film is set in the morgue with lots of interrogations and
phone calls being made, the film flows along at a nice pace with plenty
of twists along the way. We see a twist, think the story is over and
explained and then something else comes up! We see different parts of
the movie from many different perspectives.The story towards the end becomes so complex that we might just assume
that it will have some sort of supernatural twist because I didn't see
a way how it could go that would be realistic but what an ending! truly
one of the best twists I've seen in any film.I highly recommend this film, an excellent mystery thriller with an
excellent cast. The subtitles were also easy to follow so that was
good.9/10
