Not even worth my time watching it on the plane...

I actually smelled the odor of a piece of "riiiiiight" cinema pretty
early on, and decided to stop watching. A "riiiight" film, for those
who don't know because I just made it up, is where the filmmaker tries
to make you believe something so unrealistic and far fetched that you
say to yourself (or maybe even say out loud): "riiiiiight, possibly
followed by "suuuuuuuuuuure".The boredom of a 10 hr flight got to me in the end, and I decided to
turn it back on. Many "riiiiight"s later I got to the end. I often get
people telling me that they like these movies even though they know
they are far fetched because they are "just entertainment". But when
everything is so overdone that it looks like a satire but it really
isn't, I check out. This was such a film. In spite of maybe murdering
50 villains during the movie, Denzel is the good guy, and we are
supposed to feel sympathy for him. And the Russian bad guys were so, so
bad. Thank god Denzel is there to slaughter them all with no collateral
damage. He's such a bad ass.
