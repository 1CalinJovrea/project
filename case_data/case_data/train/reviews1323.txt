This movie made no sense

This movie was awful and a massive waste of time. Physics is apparently
non existent. The NSA guards are worse than storm-troopers at shooting.
A huge cast but no character development at all. You get no idea of
there names as well. The plot makes no sense at all. The acting is all
over the place as well. Flying planes, flying cars, flying people and
even a goddamn flying boat. Then there are people who definitely should
have been killed but still they stay alive and then there are people
who died and I don't know how. Overall, one word that perfectly
describes this movie is 'pretentious'. It tries to define what's cool
and what's not but fails miserably. I wanted to write a sarcastic post
about this one, but this stupid movie doesn't deserve that. I hope
everyone sues the crap out of the producers for creating such a
godawful movie.
