great film!

Love this film! no it is not like the original but it is great in it's
own way! The prince is more developed as a character, the step-mother
is still great, and Cinderella is great too. I think this Cinderella is
more quiet and with that a quiet beauty and strength comes through her
and it really shines. I love this movie and I will always love to watch
this one and the original one.
