Sorry Wrong Number

So a strung out guy, driving a high powered sports car, gets double
crossed from some previous heist. He's being pulled in different
directions with threats of death, his wife and daughter. All this plays
out on a cell phone and in the car. Occasionally he miraculously dodges
bullets and one mess or another. The camera is always tight on the
freaked out driver whose dialogue ranges from swearing, shouting and
threatening. His car survives all kinds of bullets, rear endings and
smashes. Must have been the run flat tires. Without the soundtrack and
intense camera angles, this would be even more bland. He drives like
every hack behind the wheel of an expensive car. The car could be going
around in circles for all the difference it makes. It uses every clich√©
in the genre. Give it a pass.
