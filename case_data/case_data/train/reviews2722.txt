good picture, solid message and strong performances

We must destroy in order to rebuild: the message of the picture is
clear, I would say very physically clear, since there's much physical
destruction, and I found it a very empathetically convincing message,
since who has never felt like destroying a place, just to get rid of
the past, of something we hate or no longer stand? The story develops with a steady and quick pace, but is also
intertwined by dreamy moments, which soften the overall realistic
attitude of the movie. The incisive soundtrack is also wisely chosen to
give more value to some emotionally intense moments or to enliven the
atmosphere. The cast does a great job, Jake Gyllenhall truly inhabits
his difficult and at times incomprehensible character, and is worthily
supported by a never disappointing Naomi Watts, and the little boy
offers a good performance, too. On the whole an enjoyable and also thought provoking picture, which
leaves much to think about what could lie beneath the ruins if we had
the courage to deconstruct the more or less frail scaffold of our
existence.
