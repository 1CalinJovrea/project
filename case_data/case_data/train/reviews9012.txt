Ridiculous Describe it

Ridiculous describes the film. I wasn't expecting much when coming into
watching the film, but I was still disappointed. Adam Sandler takes his
humor to a new low, making stale jokes that aren't even funny if you
are breathing laughing gas. The film has very little real entertainment
value, other than how low Sandler's career has fallen. 6 brothers who
have nothing in common, other than they are all stereotypes of slow,
rob banks to save their father they don't even know. Nick Noltes career
has also fallen that this is what he is now playing as an actor. It had
a good cast of funny-men, but they just weren't funny. The misogynistic
film, seems like it was something that would be the comic book
doodlings of a ********. (fill in the blank, almost anything works)
