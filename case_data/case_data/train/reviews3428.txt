Marvelously Stupid

The story goes, Marvel runs out of ideas. They got excellent stuff
shown in the first movie, then something lesser in the second one, and
then the third one was like - somebody damn insisted on making it, even
though there was no story written...When the evil is all defeated, the continuation is not due till the
next movie, and all avengers are simply bored, in the shortage of
anything interesting going on, why not have all the heroes beating the
crap out of each other? That should do the trick, and keep the sheep
happy.The movie has no story, its conflict is superficial and borderline
idiotic, even for the way the avengers split into two groups had no
logic in it, and, of course, no explanation. They just really wanted to
flex their muscles, and so they did, period.
