Watch this instead of, or along with, the documentary: Keep an open mind

For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden,
which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our
government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a
portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the
work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and
then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend.
Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his
whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home.
Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire
cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was
reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open
mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a
cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by
Stone and his cast.Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey
