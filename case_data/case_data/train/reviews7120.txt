In spite of an array of average romantic-comedies these days, Stuck in Love tries its best to be humble yet having it's fair share of ROM-com uniform.

Once in a while a special romantic comedy arrives with the up most
intention of bending the rules of the genre. Predictability is lost and
truth is portrayed - the rare essential in the ROM-COM environment. Try
mixing this with a typical family flick and you might have a few
problems. Next add a few curse words, sex and drugs to get it going. In
the end, Stuck in Love, has it's proportion of predictability yet is a
noble debut for Film-maker Josh Boone.Novelist, Bill Borgens (Greg Kinnear), is the center of the film
amongst his two kids and ex-wife Erica (Jennifer Connelly). From time
to time he spies on his ex and her new, much younger partner. You could
say he's in a boring mid-life crisis. Then there's the two kids -
Samantha and Rusty, both aspiring writers with different views on love.
Yes, the bunch are stuck in love.With reasonably good acting, the cast were well chosen. The smaller
parts were given well to Kristen Bell who pops up a few times with good
cause and a surprise cameo may interact pleasantly yet a tad cheesy.
Nonetheless, the cast is crisp. Its a decent plot to say the most and when things try spice it up it
falls short. These few hardly innovative circumstances aren't resolved
the way we wish. They offer capability to provide more state-of-the-art
stature, but as you guessed, and knew all along, leave you dry. However
where it is decent, it's a good watch despite a sappy ending.All in all, Josh Boone makes a worthy debut. He's a stack of potential
waiting to find the correct film - which is great. He deserves to be
somewhere in the 'film-makers to look out for' list whether or not his
debut isn't anything significant. It's the seeds for a promising plant.
