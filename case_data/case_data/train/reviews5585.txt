Vince Vaughn Hardcore!

I was pretty much blown away by "Brawl in cell block 99". I was a big
fan of S.Craig Zahler who Directed the film Bone Tomahawk. This film is
better in many ways. I'm hooked on his genius.To say the film is violent is an understatement but nothing any
hardcore thriller/Horror fan hasn't seen before. This film delivers the
violence, however, with a purpose and is almost just given the
narrative. Zahler turns the protagonist into an antihero. With superb
zeal.I am a fan of Vince Vaughn and this film is a testament to his terrific
range and ability as a great American actor. In fact, I think it's his
finest performance to date. In the spirit of not divulging any
spoilers, I will just give potential viewers my opinion of the film as
a whole.Supporting cast of Don Johnson, Udo Kier and Jennifer Carpenter are
outstanding! Direction was phenomenal as it guides the viewer through
the story line with such ease, in a hard to tell plot.Nothing is gratuitous or overdone. It's simply a great story with
simple plot, done in a purposeful way. For a film with 132 mins.runtime
it goes very quickly. A testament to a great movie.I have become a huge fans of S. Craig Zahler and can't wait to see his
next film. Fans of violent Thrillera told in a relevant way with great dialog, do
not miss this film!!Once again..,Bravo Vince Vaughn for a spectacular performance! It's
hard to believe, after seeing this film, he spent most of his career in
comedic roles.
