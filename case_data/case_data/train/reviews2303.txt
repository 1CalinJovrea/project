Into The Woods - A journey through LIFE

Firstly I am very surprised Disney did this, as it is NOT for kids.
Sondheim is my favourite composer and I think the film did justice to
his lyrics and music. Those of you who could not understand it or
follow it, cannot be a big lover on psychology and human behaviour.
Sondheim is a psychologist! The woods represent the paths we choose in
life, and how wishes cannot always lead to wonderful happy endings
(true to life!) You go on your journey, and experience joys and pain
and heartache, which you learn from. You finally discover yourself and
your true purpose in life. Those of you who said their are no memorable
songs in it are not listening to the deeper meaning of those lyrics. No
One Is Alone. - You've lost your guide (mother) who meant everything in
your world, but there are others out there in that World who are also
guides. You just need to open your heart to them, and they will show
you the way - put you on the right path.
