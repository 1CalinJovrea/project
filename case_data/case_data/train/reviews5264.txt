waste of time

If you are going to pick a lead actress, at least pick one who can act
and has depth. I don't care how many movies she's made. IT WAS AWFUL.And the trailer was definitely misleading as story didn't pan out as
someone fighting the system but as someone joining in and egging on the
worst instincts in this cult and the public. I guess that does
represent much of this world today, but still.Bad acting, bad writing, bad ending...don't waste your time.
