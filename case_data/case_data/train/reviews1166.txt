Rubbish

I was not particularly hyped up for the movie, but my family members
were. So, as soon as it appeared in the cinema, we went to check it
out. It was a huge disappointment to me.The sounds, visuals, the animation, the 'acting, are all 10 out of 10.Combine that with an utterly boring, useless, rubbish script.It's not that the movie got plot holes or anything, but it's got no
meaning. The whole Zootopia city and universe held so much
possibilities that the creators could have built upon... but instead,
they went for a really dumb clich√© story. So as a movie, it's an utter failure. As a CGI render, it's a nice
video.About the story, I am still confused. There are two things at the end.
First, you can be anything and can do anything - which is kinda not
true - but hey, kids do love false dreams. And the second is, it's
perfectly fine to be oppressed, to be ruled by the predators. Which was
the weirdest part. I mean, yeah, evil sheep, boo. But she was kinda
right.I won't waste any more words, I just hope Disney will step it up next
time.
