Tired and worn out...seriously

'Drunk Jack' is nothing new, and for that matter, nothing else except
ONE small point is new. First, the worst in a tired, exhausted, barely-there plot line that
serves no purpose, doesn't take you on a refreshed journey and doesn't
project real interest, anywhere. The special effects throughout are up
a bit, but to be expected, though not slow enough to appreciate much of
the available graphics wizardry of 2017. The austere and unsurprising
plot leaves so little in imagination that someone forgot to develop
characters, build something and have buy-in. This movie fails on so
many levels that you ponder who thought this was a great direction??Secondly, Jack is tiresome. Nothing new from him. Boring. The hatred
from the 'villain' is sincere if not the plot that seems to put Sparrow
at second whistle throughout the film. There literally is ZERO flavor,
no life. The boorish overall theme is like a thief that takes all the
charm out of the series with this installment. My two college daughters
watched it with me and after the movie, combined, we struggled to find
value, humor or interest in the movie as a whole. I hope it's the
'last' one because they have clearly beat the proverbial dead horse on
this one. Very disappointed is just one stance as a starting point
here...
