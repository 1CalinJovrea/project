Kafka meets Lynch!

Denis Villeneuve, whose last two films were the hugely impressive
Incendies and Prisoners, has concocted a real oddity here. If you can
imagine David Lynch adapting a Kafka novel, then you will be in the
right neighborhood! In Incendies and Prisoners,Villeneuve inserted
serious moral and social issues in the context of first rate thrillers'
Here he follows the same tradition but the tone is more abstract and
absurd. Neverherless, Enemy, adapted from a novel by the Nobel prize
winner Jose Saramago, is always gripping and totally fascinating. A man
(Jake Gyllenhaal) gets a recommendation from a colleague to watch a
particular video. The main actor in the video appears to be his
doppelg√§nger and the two agree to meet. To reveal any more would lessen
the enjoyment of this highly original film. Well worth catching.
