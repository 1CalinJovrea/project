I walked out after an hour

Samuel L. Jackson's character ruined this movie. I found the plot and
theme to be very interesting, but so much of this movie (that I
saw...walked out right after the two parties met up and decided to go
look for the airman that was already dead)was just wrong. Flying
helicopters, in close formation, through a hurricane so severe no ship
can survive it? Ludicrous. Attacking a 300 ft. gorilla the 1st time you
see it, without even considering pulling back and assessing the threat,
and losing all of your helicopters in the process? Even more ludicrous.
The determination, by Jackson's character, that he's going to avenge
his fallen airmen and kill Kong? Just plain asinine. This seems like a
dig on the military as a bunch of crazed killers, whose first instinct
is to shoot and keep shooting until something, seemingly anything, is
killed. Rational, thinking people don't do this. A few changes would've
allowed this movie to be a wonderful adventure. Take Jackson's role out of this movie and it might be a classic. As it
is, I wouldn't rent it from Redbox. Very disappointed in this film.
