Absolutely dreadful

I just watched the first half of this movie on recommendation.It is just dreadful, it's a long string of expletives, unfunny
situations and terrible acting. You know when the movies has lost it
when the dialogue is just insults, expletives and nothing else.I would certainly not recommend this title to anyone and putting it in
the comedy genre is doubtful to say the least. There is very little
storyline, basically a copy of true lies, which was a far better movie
and it fails on all scores.The level of this movie is best summarised by one of the scenes showing
pictures of an erect penis from a recovered camera. Hilarious for a
sniggering teen possibly.
