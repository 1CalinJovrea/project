Fantastic

Rarely we see a creative idea in today cinematography. Same tired and
predictable plots are being recycled to death, peppered with explosions
or violence." Locke" is a brilliant idea brought to us in a short, only
85 minute long flick full of masterful movie-making. A decent man makes
a mistake and tries to the right thing. That's about it. He drives and
through series of phone conversations his life alters forever. Sounds
simple but it certainly isn't. Amazing actor Tom Hardy carries the
immense burden on his handsome shoulders, but the actors, some of them
quite well known and respected, just through voice draw vivid and
colorful personalities. A lesson in creative movie-making.
