Cruise makes a Comeback

Tom Cruise is back with a vengeance and after the train wreck that was
The Mummy i can safely say that this movie proved that Cruise can act
and Liman can direct.While the narrative structure isn't always the best flowing the movie
delivers great performances, an atmosphere that sucks you into the time
period, and well made shots.A highly underrated movie that i would personally recommend and a
definite 8/10.
