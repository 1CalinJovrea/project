A variation on a theme - adequate road movie

Two women who have known each other since school find themselves down
on their luck. One is impulsive and care-free the other responsible and
considered. A spontaneous trip away sees them stranded with a hot guy
they are both interested in.This is a pretty well used format, but normally with two guys chasing a
pretty girl. With the genders flipped it means the knob gags are
switched for boob gags and the girls try to out-flirt each other rather
than out- do each other.Now there is nothing particularly new here and I didn't find the film
hilariously funny.But the two leads are very engaging and have great chemistry. Their
relationship is quite subtly handled and I enjoyed their antics. Their
quarry fits the bill perfectly and feels worthy if their attention.This isn't the funniest or slickest comedy out there but I found it a
great waste of ninety minutes.
