Pure Perfection

Pitch Perfect 2 was a pure perfection that will entertain you til the
end of the film. I rate it 10/10 for its funny humour and jokes. I
laugh at the jokes and didn't find it boring. It has full of life and
it gives a new texture to a musical film. Like High School Musical
meets Step Up movie. The mix of music and conversation was just equal
and there are no dead scenes at all. They blow us away with their
opening performance and the final performance exceed to the top. I enjoy this than the first one. It's funnier and the flow of the story
is not only focus on Becca but also to the whole group. Rebel Wilson
was the saviour of the movie. She acts as the clown and portrays her
funny awkward character well. I enjoyed her with the new girl Flo, who
will make you laugh with their punch lines.
