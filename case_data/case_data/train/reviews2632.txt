A must see prequel

Monsters University is the prequel to Monsters inc., a wildly popular
animation by Pixar. It's basically a college movie set in the monster
world, but with a nice deviation from the standard.The good. Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its
colors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. Interesting story, especially
for the twist. Great animation, as usual. Easily enjoyable by adults.
Perfect ending. Excellent voice acting.The bad. Lots of college movie, underdogs, and jocks versus nerds
clich√©s.The ugly. Nothing.The result. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too.
