It didn't work for me

Our hero is an angry man who can't seem to hold it together. Through a
series of flashbacks we learn why: a great tragedy has traumatized him.
But this is not just any tragedy, I can't think of anything worse that
could happen to someone. Oedipus Rex plucks out his eyes with less
cause. So there is plenty of motivation for him becoming an angry loner, but
his past could motivate any dramatic outcome, celibate monk, mass
murderer, iconoclastic artist, CIA assassin, raving lunatic. Call a
suicide prevention hot line with his backstory and they might direct
you to a right-to-die website.Psychotherapy is apparently never an option in the townie macho culture
the film depicts; the local police have a very strong reason to get him
counseling, but there is no indication they ever do. Self-medication
with alcohol is the only succor he gets. OK, so I understand why our hero is angry, but why are most of the
other characters attempting a Boston accent so touchy? The accent-free
characters in the film never get upset. Despite the portentous music, the film's front story is not so tragic.
(A different score could turn this glass-half-empty downer into a
half-full feel-good charmer. Some film school should do the
experiment.) Our hero realizes his limitations and makes some
reasonable choices. The brilliantly acted and Oscar-headed moment when
his ex-wife tries to help made me wonder just how she managed to get
over it so well.An inability to control his fists is our hero's one shortcoming.
Watching a seething Casey Affleck staring out his late brother's
bedroom window, my immediate reaction was at least he isn't punching
his fist through the glass, and then, a second later, he does. No
angry-male stereotypes were harmed in the making of this movie.My takeaway? Check your smoke detectors regularly.
