Finally a good horror!!!!

Obviously the average crtic thinks that a movie with the Amityville
name should never ever happen again especially when it's a bigger
budget film. Well they did and did an amazing job. This movie proved
many critics wrong so much that it was prevented from being released
for years. A 5.1 on IMDb? I think not!! A solid 6.8 definitely.It's a shame us horror fans were punished because of egos and Hollywood
bs. If you go in to this just wanting to be entertained and not
thinking what should and shouldn't be you'll whole heartedly enjoy this
film. Obviously there was no one that moved in to the amityville house
that was based on any character in this movie. But I don't care same
way I didn't care that penny wise is a fictional character
