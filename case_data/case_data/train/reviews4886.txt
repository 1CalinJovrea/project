Tedious to watch

I was really expecting another good story in the series, but this
failed to deliver. The movie was very tedious to watch, and a number of
times, I almost walked out, but kept thinking it had to get better. It
did not. Jack, was a weaker, and not as focused on his stunts, but
being drunk and unable to function in any manor. The story line was
weak, and not very interesting, although it could have been better
done. Most of the actors, seemed to be there more for the paycheck,
than to give another good performance. In all, I could not find
anything that made the movie worth the money I spent. Did not even get
one laugh out of it.
