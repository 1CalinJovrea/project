Only Watch if You Are Brainwashed Into Paying For Garbage Like This as Actual Entertainment

I have never seen such a bad movie like this one. The script is a huge
load of illogical and absurd events which in the end collapse together
into am anti-climax ending. And the acting even manages to out-worsen
the completely trashy plot. Every actors and actresses in this film
seem to worry that the audiences might not be able to hear them clearly
so they just yelled at a maximum volume and it was not pleasant at all!
The the slap-tick humor could have been able to save this film from
becoming a total disaster but frankly it didn't work at all.Trust me, there's literally nothing good about this cheap piece of
B-rated half-ass movie. Save your money and never give it a go!
