1 out of 10 is too much!

I don't usually let reviews over here but man... this is one of the
most idiotic movies I've ever seen. Budget $5 million? Five? Five
Million Dollars? For what? For 5 tons of ketchup? There are millions of
ideas to make a movie with less than $5 million dollars and actually
good. I'm very sorry to say that but again... this is the most stupid
movie I've seen so far. And I have one question: who the hell does this
even if it's a real situation?! No man... I cannot give a better
rating. Even 1 is too much. Sorry, but it's awful.
