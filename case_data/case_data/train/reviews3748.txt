Mocking Moviegoers -  What a  Horrible Movie

The screenwriter team for this movie was obviously under pressure to
extend beyond reason the simplistic narrative of this movie. The
result: over two hours of acting without substance. I cannot complain
about the actors, for they did what they were paid to do, but COME ON,
did it have to be so melodramatic and empty? Emotions are simply not
credible, and only inspire scorn.I want my money back. I want my time back. What a waste of effort to
extend this film beyond one installment. Had they compacted the movie
in 1 hour, then probably all the bad cinematography would have been
eliminated.Sure producers will make a profit at the expense of unsuspected viewers
and several (perhaps demolishing) hits on actors careers. I will NOT
view the last installment. I refuse to give my money away for nothing.The saddest part is that this movie could have been great. The acting
talent was there. Technical resources were available. But he most
inexpensive part of the production was neglected beyond belief:
storytelling. The screenwriters in this movie are not idiots. It is
obvious that artificial constraints were placed to extend the story to
two parts.SAVE YOUR TIME, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT WATCH THIS BAD, BAD MOVIE.
