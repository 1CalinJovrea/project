dreadful

Not much to say except this film is arty farty pretentious rubbish. Was
looking forward to watching an engrossing film of a good book but after
the first 30 mins gave up trying to understand what the heck was going
on. Only glad that I hadn't paid to watch it if I had I would have been
strongly tempted to ask for my money back. It would appear that the
producers think that the inclusion of Keira Knightly is enough to
guarantee box office success how wrong can they be. Whoever came up
with the format of this film needs their head examining it may appeal
to the cinema snobs but as far as the general public is concerned it's
a candidate for the raspberry award.
