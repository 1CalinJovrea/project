The perfect blend of comedy and horror

Having not seen the original movie and only tidbits of the trailer, I
didn't really know what to expect when walking into the cinema this
evening. Someone described the movie as 'The Goonies' meets 'A
Nightmare on Elm Street' - this turned out to be an extremely accurate
description!The opening scene seems to suggest that the movie will be very dark,
yet these expectations are quickly dispersed as the horror is undercut
by comedy. This happens repeatedly throughout the film: and it works.
My friends and I (as well as the entire packed cinema) found ourselves
gasping at scenes of sheer terror, then only moments later laughing
hysterically at the banter between the main characters.I would say that this is not a film for the faint of heart, yet I think
even those individuals would find themselves enjoying 'It'. If not for
the horror, then certainly for the comedy and camaraderie. It's as if
this is a movie within a movie: a mix of a
high-school-problems/coming-of-age movie and a horror. A brilliant
two-for-one if you ask me!Great acting from all of the cast as well as excellent writing make
this movie a must watch!
