Number 1 movie in most countries.

"Hotel Transylvania" is truly an excellent family movie with all
elements of success included: good script,perfect
entertainment,wonderful direction and great comedy.I saw it with my girlfriend after hearing this film has been achieving
international success.Honestly "Hotel Transylvania" was extremely funny for adults and the
movie theater was crowded. People were looking for a real comedy that
would make them forget their own problems and the movie was absolutely
hilarious from the beginning till the end.The voice acting was stunning and honestly this lovely film is worth
seeing for all ages,you will move into another fantastic world for 90
minutes.I am not surprised at all why this movie has been number 1 in most
counties around the world.Well Done!.
