10
Maybe not for 10, but certainly it's above 7.

Just watched the movie and I have to say I'm shocked that it's rated so
low on IMDb, as I have watched much, MUCH worse movies with better
ratings. Scrolling to evidentially biased ratings and reviews I'm
giving it a 10, just hoping it will balance out the harm done. Jessica
Chastain delivered great performance, but she wasn't the only one,
whole crew was really good, but she really did earn that globe
nomination. Furthermore, movie is beautifully captured, cinematography
is great and whole atmosphere is really nice. The last but not the
least, it's a great thriller, with an unpredictable twist and not
boring for a moment. I do understand it's might be different experience
watching it for an European audience, as from the start second
amendment and gun legislative is for most of us here absurd, however,
although I can understand that for some Americans it might seem one
sided story, my question is aren't many of story lines one sided, to be
honest it's not advertised as documentary, so why should you even
expect other side to be equally represented? Strongly recommend to give
this movie attention it deserves.
