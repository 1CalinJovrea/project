Quirky little gem from Sundance that just has to be seen

It's easy to dismiss such a quirky film as Me and Earl and the Dying
Girl, the latest independent film to get a release after making quite
an impression at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won both the
Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize in the drama category.Make the film too quirky and you could alienate an audience however, a
subtle amount of quirkiness combined with a good blend of comedy and
drama will give you a film like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, which
ends up being both irresistible and infectious to its audience.Greg (Thomas Mann) is a high school student who just wants to get
through school without associating himself with any of the various
cliques or making enemies. Along with his friend Earl (RJ Cyler), Greg
spends his spare time making parodies of their favourite classic
movies. When he learns that his childhood friend, Rachel (Olivia Cooke), has
been diagnosed with leukemia, he is forced by his overbearing parents
to befriend her in her time of need. Through this friendship, Greg soon
finds his outlook on life altered.There is always the uneasy feeling of laughing at a film that centres
around a girl suffering from cancer. There is great care taken though
by director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, in making sure that the subject gets
the delicate treatment it deserves with the perfect combination of
comedy and drama. He is aided by a delightful screenplay from Jesse Andrews, the author
of the book the film is adapted from, full of enough wit, charm and
quirky cutaway moments, such as the feeling of when the hot girl at
school talks to you, to leave you with a smile on your face.The film is elevated to another level by the three main performances
from Thomas Mann, RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke, all showing fine range in
both the dramatic and comedic departments. They are supported quite
wonderfully by the likes of Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Jon Bernthal
and Molly Shannon, and keep your ears peeled for a funny voice cameo
from Hugh Jackman that fits the quirkiness of the film so well.Critics love it and so should audiences, I'm just hoping people decide
to go and see it instead of some of the inane drivel that Hollywood
produces these days. It really does deserve all the success it can get.
