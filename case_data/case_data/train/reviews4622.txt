Better than expected

I was expecting a boring, typical horror movie, instead I was really
surprised, in a good way, by this film. The script is not that
bad,pretty original, and it keeps you wanting to see more, to see how
it will end. The acting is good, great performance from the main
actors. Better than the score, I saw a lot of worst horror movie this
last year. It was fun and worth watching. Not a masterpiece but highly
enjoyable. I was thinking oh, no, another clown horror movie, but
actually is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. Highly
underrated on IMDb, I recommend you to watch it, you will not be
disappointed.
