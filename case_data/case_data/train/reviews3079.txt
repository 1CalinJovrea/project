Worth seeing. Think low ratings on this site are exaggerated

First off, Expendables 2 was better and I do not think anyone will
argue that. But some of the poor reviews on here almost made me second
guess going, and the reviews likely had an effect, since only a handful
were in the theater last night (9:45 showing) My take on the young
actors/new team is yes, the older one's are better but they tied in
nicely in being immature where when the old team returns to clean up
the youthful's inexperience issues. Bandera's was Hilarious, the few in
the theater were laughing a lot at him. He was annoying, but that is
what made it comical. The one disappointment, wish Chuck Norris would
have made a brief appearance like in part2. Agree, the younger actors
were used to attract a younger audience, but did not see that in the
audience when I was there. I'm 39 and would say audience was 30 and up.
Also thought perhaps the newer actors were used to pull lower the $$
down some, might be BS, but just my thought. Not the movie going type
either, haven't been to theater in 3+ yrs, much rather watch at
home(DVD or Blue ray) to take b-room breaks and refill my mug ;-). This
movie was worth going to. Solid performance, but bar was so high with
Expendables 2, will be hard to beat.
