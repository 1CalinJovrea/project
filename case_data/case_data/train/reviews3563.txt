I think IMDb should have an age profile to show which age groups like or dislike a movie.

Age: 50-65 We walked out about half way through.I am just a regular guy - not a professional movie reviewer by any
means. But I felt like I needed a shower after watching this digital
equivalent of a sewer pipe spewing out feces. I really like both of
these actors so when I saw the trailer I thought it might work. But
gee, what a train wreck. The slow slide down the toilet began when the
13 year old daughter gets corrected when she refers to a rim-job and
ended with the writers keen comedic sense with the over-use of ". . .
and stuff" WoW!!! Genius!I wonder, really wonder how hard-up Russel Crowe was to take this part.
I wonder how many hours Ryan Gosling watched Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis'
shtick to get his part. Man, I sure wish I could get my $17 back. But,
hey, the popcorn was good.
