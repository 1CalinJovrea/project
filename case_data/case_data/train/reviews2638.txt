Overall decent watch with a major flaw

Let me start off by saying the film as a whole was decent and
watchable. However it left a sour taste in the mouth at how amateurish
they portrayed the SAS. Instead of the in and out factual event that took place in 1980 they
decided to portray the SAS looking like a bunch of mates on a paint
balling stag do, getting stuck on ropes, accidentally breaking windows,
setting themselves on fire and hesitating to shoot a terrorist pinning
a police officer to the ground at 5 yards.Some of the acting was great, Jamie Bell did a great job however the
BBC female journalists accent was incredibly cringe.I feel the film could have and probably should have scored higher, but
it is what it is.
