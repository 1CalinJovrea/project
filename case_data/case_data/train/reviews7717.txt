Terribly Disappointed

After reading so many glowing reviews of this movie, I thought I would
be treated to a hysterical comedy. Instead what I found was unfunny,
repetitious and rather lame. At least I'm glad to see that some
reviewers on this site feel the same way, as I was expecting to be
alone on this.Of course, the plot revolves around the wise-cracking and irresponsible
Simon Pegg, as Gary King, trying to reunite his former school buddies
to complete the Golden Mile, in Newton Haven, England. It's many years
later from when they were in school, and the Golden Mile is a series of
12 pubs in close proximity in the town. Their goal is to be able to
drink at all 12 pubs and complete the cycle, something they failed to
do years before.However, one "small" problem emerges when they realize the town has
been taken over by robotic aliens, who take human form and are looking
to eventually take over Earth. To me, without being too caustic it just
seemed like a poor imitation of the classic 1950's film "Invasion of
the Body Snatchers" Anyway there's lots of talent here aside from Pegg,
including Paddy Considine, Eddie Marsan, Nick Frost, and Martin Freeman
as Pegg's school chums. Also, the talented Rosamund Pike joins the
group as Freeman's sister Sam.Unfortunately, I felt this talent was wasted in this disappointing and
rather overrated film.
