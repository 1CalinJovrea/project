Simply brilliant.

Take a simple premise, automated prison cell no one but a computer to
reason with add some great acting, throw in a smart plot beautiful
cinematography, clever twists as you go and you have a great film.The people giving this bad reviews either want crash bang wallop
transformers style or possibly didn't understand the end, but that's
half of its beauty, it's a love story a Sci-Fi classic and a thriller,
there are nods to 2010 space odyssey, inception, moon and many other
great films, if you like your movies smartly done and want a movie that
makes you ask questions, this is really worth your time.
