Entertaining, good music, cool fight scenes, pretty to look at and with some cool acting from Crowe. Deserves better rep

Okay so I read a lot of reviews on IMDb before deciding whether or not
to watch a movie, but this is my first time writing a review. Because I
was really interesting in seeing a movie by RZA and the preview made it
look like a Tarantino kill bill-esque movie, which I really like. I
felt I had to review this movie because the rating is currently pretty
low. I watch a lot a movies and am really into writing and screen
writing, so of course I wasn't expecting an exceptionally scripted or
written movie.In the past couple of days I have seen a few movies I wasn't too
excited about seeing, but I'm running out of new ones. I saw Abraham
Lincoln Vampire hunter, Alex Cross, and Sinister. I just watched this
movie this morning and although all of those movies are very different,
I was by far the most entertained by TMWTIF. I though Russel Crowe did
a pretty good job with what he was given, and RZA did okay as actor and
I really like when he narrated. Also the fight scenes soundtrack is
really cool, with good wu-tang beats and a few verses. It was pretty
cool seeing the Kung-fu fighting with the rap playing, pretty
different. All in all, if your looking for a movie with a really good storyline,
plot, and script, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie. If you
just want something to put on that's really cool to look at, with good
music, attractive Asian women, and really good fight scenes then you
probably won't be disappointed. It's a fun movie and deserves a little
better rep. I'd watch a sequel.
