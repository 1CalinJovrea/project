mac-dreck...BOO!

SPOILER ALERT: unforgivably, irredeemably DULL...Shakespeare can be played and interpreted many ways, fine...but there's
no excuse for this flat, one-note -- and I don't just mean the
monotonous, dirge-like score -- utterly tedious, tiresome mess. (this
movie could give "miserable-ism" a bad name.)OK, the dead baby opening is a brilliant stroke...congrats to somebody
for making visual something only hinted at in the play -- but it all
goes downhill from there -- and not fast. "tomorrow and tomorrow and
tomorrow" really does "creep" in a very petty pace."macbeth" has so many pulpy audience-grabbing elements...it's an
operatic funhouse of witches, blood, murder, omens, pitched battles,
visions. swordplay and ruthless ambition...boisterous and violent and
pitched to a frenzy at points...in short: FUN! -- so why is this
misconceived and woefully misbegotten production so hopelessly mopey
from the first frame?...and all melancholic remorse for its entire
insufferable length?..fassbender has no feel for the language, the less
he says the better...cotillard comes off better, but only because her
face is so powerfully expressive...and the burning woods of burnham are
the only heat on screen. (hey, Scotland's blasted heaths are kinda
foggy -- we get it!)wish 0 stars was an option...(or even negative
numbers)...BLCCGGGGHHH!...a curse on the (so-called) film-makers.
