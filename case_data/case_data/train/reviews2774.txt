Good Movie

I thought Owen Wilson was excellent in this movie. It was very
suspenseful and really did keep you on the edge of your seat the whole
time. Pretty graphic I must say, which is the only reason I did not
give it a 9 or 10, but well written with an excellent plot. Going in I
was a little apprehensive as to how good Owen Wilson was going to be in
an "action" movie but he did not disappoint. A tad unbelievable given
his build and stature as to what he was able to do from a physical
standpoint in the movie but still kept me on the edge of my seat the
whole time. All in all I would definitely recommend this movie to
anyone who likes action and suspense.
