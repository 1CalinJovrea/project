Bad movie - don't waste your money

If you want to see Casey Affleck stare silently for two hours, this
movie is for you--if not, then go see Rogue One. This is a slow moving,
terrible movie. I don't see how it ever got produced. The dialog is
thin and would never fly in a novel. The editors would reject it
immediately. I can't believe it's been nominated for anything. It's a
snooze. Lots of long scenes with no dialog...at first I thought the
camera had frozen. It starts slow, has no real middle part, and a bad
ending. This movie should never have been made. If you take out all the
silence and staring, you'd have a 30 minute movie at most. I don't usually pan a movie this severely, but it's just bad. The fact
that it's "critically acclaimed" has no effect on my opinion. To me,
it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's obvious they shot it
on digital media, because no one would waste this much actual film. 1
star is a gift on this one. Pass it by.
