Not the most exciting film, it's a horror mystery, that's more mystery
than horror and the mystery was not that interesting. It was about a
faithless journalist trying to prove God is not real by doing a story
about a Priest in jail for murder because an exorcism went wrong.
Sounds like a good story. The setting of the movie also seemed good as
it takes place in Romania, during a holiday that, according to the film
is similar to Halloween, and when I herd this at the beginning of the
film I was jazzed to watch a Halloween picture during the season. Â The
Crucifixion shows a lot of elements of mystery and sexuality that makes
if feel like a homage of Hammer Horror, but it falls a little short
from become a classic of even a cult classic, real short.
