One of the best romance movie

The movie is about a story of best friends who move away after school,
but after years, they realize that they both miss their friendship.
They find out that they still like each other communicate again, until
one day they meet again on the boy's wedding day. It's a really good
movie to watch, when you start, you can't stop anymore, you get curious
about what is going to happen, if they are going to be together or not.
It's a quiet movie, to relax your mind, but really exciting!
