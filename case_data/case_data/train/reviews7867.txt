Visual trip, good action and characters, major flaws

Contains all the good stuff you can expect from a good supernatural Vin
Diesel movie. Even supersedes my expectations. The visual effects and
the feeling of being plunged into a dark world matches Constantine. The
acting is good - Michael Caine and Rose Leslie are really great in
their roles. All the main characters are engaging and believable in the
context of the movie. Even the baddies have souls to feel through the
screen. I would like to see sequels of this. The witch-world really caught me.Some flaws exist that annoyed me. I try to just ignore them and not be
the negative guy, but it was hard this time:Who decided the title "The Last Witchhunter". Last how? Was there any
other ever? "The Witchhunter" would sound better and match the movie
content.The witch magic was very diverse and immensely powerful. Yet all
witches were afraid of the one Witchhunter and failed to beat him. They
could drag people to different dimensions, trap them in eternal
mind-dreams, throw them around like leaves etc. But the Vin Diesel
character was just too cool maybe? He always beat them with fists, a
sword or a thrown dagger. What's wrong with some firearms? If
non-magical blades worked, some rifles would be a better bet if the
fate of the world was at stake. Not cool enough I guess. I truly hate it when the hero fights for his life and needs to save the
world, but when he has won and just need to finish of the enemy, he
needs to pause, say some cool one-liners, spin around the sword or make
an absolutely ridiculous finishing-attack - like a wrestler making a
flip from the top-rope.But I loved the movie.
