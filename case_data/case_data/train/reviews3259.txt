4
Omg... retarded audience needed

I watched the movie as I read here on IMDb that "An airline pilot saves
a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions
reveals something troubling." OK, I thought, good cast, Denzel usually
doesn't let me down and waited for more than 100 mins to see if
something would actually happen. But nothing... It turns out that the
whole theme of the movie was just alcohol abuse. As a south European, I
always have a hard time understanding whats the problem with alcohol
abuse in the US, why people cant just enjoy a drink from time to time.
On top of that, there are some hints of other drugs abuse, but it seems
that for some reason the producers think that smoking isn't that bad
after all (I'm a smoker so I can relate to that... LOL).That said, the movie is very well made, nice photography, nice scenes,
good acting. But 130 something minutes to get to the conclusion that
alcohol is bad... well I wouldn't have watched it if only I knew. Pity
for the misleading description of the movie.As for the rest, some characters don't seem to really have a real
impact on the story or the main character. They are just there probably
to give a little flavour to an otherwise pointless movie.So I give it a 4 as it doesn't deserve less in my opinion; the
packaging is very well made. But I really do not see the point of
crafting such a huge context just to express this kind of message. The
guy could have been a taxi driver. For the sake of clarity, in my scale
4 is crap with some merits, but not to be suggested to anyone.
