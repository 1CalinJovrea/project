The director of this garbage deserves his name in the Death Note

I don't even know where to start. First of all, i've never seen the
anime or the original Japanese live action movie. That's something I
regret. The truth is I love manga and the reason why I yet need to see
"Death Note" is because I simply watch to much, and have to little
time. But it's one of those titles that is on my to do list. I guess
this gives me some sort of advantage over those people reviewing this
title with the worst reviews ever. Claiming this is the biggest garbage
they have ever seen, and does not honor the original.I cannot agree more with them. This is the view of someone who hasn't
seen the original. But let me tell you this: it doesn't get worse than
this. I don't even know where to start. Everything was just so off. The
casting was ridiculous. Every character except Ryuk was just completely
off. Acting was terrible, dialogues even worse. I can't even figure out
how fake the character L. was. It just made me feel like crying, seeing
how he took this role. It was so bad that I was asking myself at one
point if I wasn't just watching some amateur high school movie made by
students. My god... I could go on for ages about how terrible it was,
and how much I am traumatized by this. The only reason I rate this movie a 2/10 is because I really liked how
they made Ryuk. He actually looked really good, and was the only thing
that kept me watching this movie.
