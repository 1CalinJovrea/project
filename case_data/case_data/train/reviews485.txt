Hollywood Should Know People Want Happy Endings to Love Stories

This had all the makings of a love story that could touch many people
with nice performances all around. So why not have a happy ending and
insure a much bigger box office? The story unfolded in flash back and
present day rotation. It told the story of pair of star crossed lovers
who through circumstance broke up and went their separate ways only to
reunited 20 years later.The present day leads, the versatile James Marsden and the lovely
Michelle Monaghan turn in deeply moving performance from a sentimental
screenplay...one that could have played out nicely with the lovers
living happily ever after. That wasn't to be and although there was an
attempt to put a brave face on the ending, it wasn't what people
wanted.Also,Luke Bracey, who plays the younger lead, looks as old as Marsden
and a bit taller.
