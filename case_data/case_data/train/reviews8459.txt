Jack Reacher....... just good fun

Having never read any Lee Childs novels regarding Jack Reacher, I went
into this one with somewhat limited knowledge on who Jack Reacher is
and what his claim to fame is. So like many, I read where the "serious"
fans were disappointed that Tom Cruise was picked to portray this
iconic hero. To them I say, so what, did you watch this movie? In truth
Tom Cruise is very good in this role, the movie is fast paced and
action packed, the writing is cleaver and spot on, so to those who
would continue to pan this movie I say lighten up and relax. This was a
very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several
one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with
plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism. This movie was
good, it was entertaining, well acted, and should be viewed and enjoyed
by all who watch it.
