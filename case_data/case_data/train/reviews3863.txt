Better than the first

I loved this movie, I saw it opening night. First of the characters are
good. Chris Pratt and everyone else did a wonderful job. The dinosaurs
look awesome, in fact they look better at the end, you can tell they
wanted to put a lot more effort in the 2nd half of this movie and
that's not a bad thing. They make it very emotional. That seen with the
dinosaur dying made me tear up. The ending is the best ending to any
movie ever. When the Tyrannosaurus Rex came out I was so happy and when
Blue saved him that also made me happy. When the giant sea monster
killed the bad dinosaur, I started clapping and everyone in the theater
did too. So now I have a poster on my wall, the entire soundtrack on my
computer(my the way, the score's awesome) and have seen it twice
already and am hopefully going to see this masterpiece again.
