Review

This so called sequel to the Maze Runner is completely a waste of time
for anyone who is expecting any similarities to the original Maze
Runner. It is full of nonsensical fighting, clueless people, zero plot,
a shame to actually be associated with "The Maze Runner".If possible, take this movie back to the recording studio and delete
each and every sequence of it and Think and make a sensible adventurous
movie. Crappies movie of all times! It's not only misleading from the
word "Runner" but also there is no Maze! Isn't it fantastic? The Scorch
Trials! What does that even mean and how does the name actually is
relevant to this pathetic low standard movie!
