A predictable, but very charming romantic comedy

Romantic comedies have reached that point that horror seems to have
reached in that any tweaks in the formula has dwindle. There's only so
much that can be done to differentiate one movie from the others in the
genre and that's very true for the romantic comedy genre. The one
aspect that can truly help a movie in this subgenre is the strength of
its leads and the situations in which they are put into. What If
doesn't do anything new with the formula, but it provides enough charm
that overcomes the predictability to deliver a solid outing.Good: This movie primarily is Daniel Radcliffe continuing separation
from Harry Potter and become a leading man and he does a good job. He's
charming, awkward, and you root for him to find love. Zoe Kazan works
on the same level as she also contributes a lot of likability and charm
to the movie. They both shine as their attempts to remain friends
begins to be a challenge. Adam Driver pops up as Radcliffe's friend and
he's always trusted to bring in some laughs. I also liked how Kazan's
boyfriend wasn't a complete jerk like most movies would have him be.
The movie also has this quirky indie comedy vibe to it with some nice
animation and silly flashbacks.Bad: The main fault is that it is still a predictable rom com. It has
the two leads, they are friends, and then they realize that maybe
things could be different and well that can't be avoided. The movie
also has some lulls when it comes to the jokes as some of the comedy
doesn't work.Overall, it is a charming romantic comedy very much in the vein of When
Harry Met Sally showcasing Radcliffe's growth as an actor. Well worth a
watch.
