Terrible. Clich√©d. Narcissistic pleasure vehicle for Cruise

I'll get right to the point. Cruise leaves one location and then
somehow the camera cuts to an empty street, leaving you the viewer to
guess that Cruise arrived there from the previous scene. Nobody is in
view as he turns the corner. Suddenly two guys appear from behind. And
then he approaches an intersection and there are more men coming from
the sides. I wonder. Will Jackie boy beat them all up as if he's Chuck
Norris taking on stiff bullies? This is like a bad 70s TV show except it takes itself deadly seriously.
The few jokes in the film are flatter than the EKG of those who wrote
this script. The big Reacher reveal about secret that may change his life forever
his hilariously bad. Things don't happen the way they did in the movie.
Everyone is guilty or responsible because they have to be in order to
keep the plot going. Proof? Unnecessary. Even a shred of it. People
don't act on claims that aren't believable. And that's how this movie
falls apart from the start, including the laughably bad promises of the
villain. Zero chemistry from any of the actors. This was purely a made
to pay off of Cruise's name. Terrible.
