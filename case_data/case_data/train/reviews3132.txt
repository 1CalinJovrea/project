Oooohhh dear!

2 hours of my life I will never recover. Can I sue?The worst thing that any director can do to an audience is to create
the 'event that never happened'. Any director that still does not get
that has no business directing. What do you get in this movie?1hr of nothing happening at all except puerile dialogue. Perhaps the
worst example of CGI (I simply cannot believe they thought that baby
was OK) in the history of lala-land. One brief moment of bloodlust,
sanitised by making it justifiable because the victim had the temerity
to be an English musician plying his trade in America (way to go you
yank twits). Then a 20 minute battle scene which looked promising as it
looked to decimate whole populations of useless actors, quickly
followed by a horrible retraction. Then finished off with 2 or 3
totally pointless and puke-inducing endings.Even Sheen could not put a sheen on this pile of dogs droppings. I hope
that Taylor Lautner gets fat.
