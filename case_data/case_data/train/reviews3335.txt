Chronicle : A Realistic take on Sci Â– Fi Action

Chronicle is an engaging offspring of two very separate genres. Reality
based horror / thriller movies and Super Hero's. Never would you have
imagined a super hero origins movie being shot with a hand-held camera.
They are often related to high octane action sequences and graphics and
CGI. Well that thing doesn't change here either but the treatment is
creative and thoroughly engaging. If suppose paranormal activity and
any super hero movie were to mate, their offspring would have been
called "Chronicle".I think by now the "handheld camera" trick in films is becoming a
little stale. Sure, it can help smaller productions and can make some
films visually spectacular. However, it seems that it is used in way
too many films, usually horror flicks at that. Chronicle, however, is
nothing less than a masterpiece at not only the "found footage" style,
but is also a brand new way of making a superhero movie, mainly because
the people it centers on are far from heroes anyway. They are portrayed
as everyday people. People with real problems and psychologies. All the
larger than life characters of other sci fi or super hero movie is
nowhere to be seen here.Read the rest of the review at :
