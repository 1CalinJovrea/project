A horror buff's delight, a must watch!

Horror ensues when a young family moves into their dream house in rural
Texas, unbeknownst to them the true evil that lies within. We have all
seen countless horror films tackle the now clich√©d haunted-house tale,
The Amityville Horror, The Conjuring, Poltergeist, Insidious, the list
goes on and on. What makes The Devil's Candy unique and different is
it's clever, and at times, satirical approach at redefining the horror
genre and letting the story unfold itself in resourceful and
unpredictable ways. Masterful cinematography, thoroughly original, and
flat out scary, a horror buff's delight! 4.5 out of 5 stars (9/10).
