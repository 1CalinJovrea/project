There's nothing spectacular about this movie.

OK, there is... the title. But that's it. From the reading of the title
til' the end of the movie, you will just go through a very average
movie, based on a very average script. The story of a young lost man
who feels completely uninterested in his future and just wants to live
the now. We then realize that his missing father disappeared when he
was a kid, and he tries to find him again. Only to discover that his
father doesn't give a damn about him (what a surprise). But the
important part is really the young man finding love in the most
unlikely girl. In fact, she is so different that it's almost impossible
to sense any chemistry between them during the movie. But since the
director decided they should be together, it is what happens. I don't
know, maybe I am too harsh, cause there was an attempt at doing
something decent, but I love cinema, and this really left me completely
flat.
