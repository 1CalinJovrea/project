a dreadful movie - some spoilers

I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this... the IMDb
description says Electra is unstable - sorry, nothing wrong with
Electra... Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. The
movie should have been called "Borderline Personality Disorder". The
writing is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slab
rider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the characters
evokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an
(expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification for
his mindless violence - "I'm an American an we fight for what's ours
blah blah" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him -
what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has few
women whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guy
and a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not Des
Moines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow minded
pillock? This reviewing effort is far more than this abomination
deserves - it's not even worth fast forwarding to the amateurish sex
scenes (clearly directed by a 14 year old). In a just world this would
be a career ender for all involved.
