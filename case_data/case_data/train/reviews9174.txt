Worst edited film in history hands down!

Aside from the usual problems with this type of movie and this
particular franchise. This movie looks like it was edited by a high
school film class on crystal meth. The action scenes are a dizzying
mashup of half second cuts each from a different angle. There are
dialog scenes where there is a camera a cut on every. single. word.
They even left it open for yet another sequel. I wish I could give it
negative stars.
