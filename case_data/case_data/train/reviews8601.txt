Is this classed as a film? How can it be classed as a film?

Grown Ups was alright in my opinion. I tend to enjoy almost any film
that is thrown in my direction for some reason or another. Grown Ups
had a few laughs which put the label of 'Alright' on it. Below average,
but watchable.Grown Ups 2, however, is the worst film I have ever watched. Seriously,
if you can find a film that is more terrible than Grown Ups 2, please
enlighten me. I mean, was this wrote by a five year old? Who can tell.
The humour is astoundingly bad, there simply isn't a plot or a moral to
the story and the entire film will just leave you cringing. I know one
or two people who would like this, but those people also have the worst
sense of humour that I have ever encountered.How this was released, I do not know. It is simply a terrible film and
I cannot find one good aspect about it. And to think Adam Sandler was
once a good actor for a few years. 1/10. Never gave that to a film before. At least, not that I can
remember.
