Awful movie, worse than Rocky 5

This is not actually a movie rather than a Jordan shoes and
chemotherapy 2 hour commercial.I turned off the film the moment I saw Rocky training Jordan while
doing chemotherapy. Who writes this crap anyways. Who's idea was it to
give Rocky cancer ? Maybe in the next film Rocky dies, goes to Hell and
trains Apollo Creed to fight the Devil. What a load of crap.Everybody at one point made fun of the Rocky saga because one day we
would see Rocky dying of old age but still fighting in the ring.
Stallone actually made a Rocky film out of this joke. This is really
weird.What's next ? Adrian The Rocky Chronicles ?The Rocky saga has been milked to it's last breath with this one.Appolo's abandoned kid with social behavior problems, a deaf girlfriend
who is a singer, Rocky has cancer, Adrian, Paulie, Mickey, Appolo,
Appolo's wife are all dead. Everybody is dead but yet Sly filmed
another Rocky movie and had a director who has never directed a film
before.Give me a break man, it is a failed attempt to do a sports drama movie
all the way to the grave. Stallone did an excellent drama job with the
first movies and no one was dead or dying.I have only one message to Mr.Stallone. Let the Rocky saga be, man.
Just let it go. You don't need the money and we don't need a Rocky
movie inspired by a school joke from 1985.
