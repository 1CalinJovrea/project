depressing

I'm a kid who I think this meant to appeal to but what happens is
everything it looks like something good is gonna happen it just ends up
being something completely random like when they get on the train it
just happened to be to late at the time when they got on the train and
joy is one of the meanest characters if ever seen in a movie when she
leaves sadness behind at the end and at the end when she try's to run
away it's just so depressing the voice acting is terrible I would 100%
skip if I'm watching it It's such a lazy idea anyone could have come up
with the story in five minutes This movie implies we only have five
emotions which is stupid I don't know why it has such a high rating it
has no memorable scenes in it no excitement I'd definitely watch
something else
