Great movie, Outstanding performance by Jessica Chastain!

This is a powerful female driven film about the title character and
politics. It's one of Jessica's best performances if not the best. This character
allows her to show so many things of her skill set. She's so
believable, every nuance, every line she delivers is just so perfect.
She should have been nominated for this role for every award show...Miss Sloane is a great movie which has a very fast pace. You can't
predict what's coming next, great performances by everyone on the cast.Forget about the bad reviews, even if you don't like politics this
movie will keep you interested. It's upsetting that It bombed at the box office. I think It's because
of the subject matter and people might had enough of the political
climate in real life. But It really deserves to be seen. I highly recommend this awesome, very underrated movie.
