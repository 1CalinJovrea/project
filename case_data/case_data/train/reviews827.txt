War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay
we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive
and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer
Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at
least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a
damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a
rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is
IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have
been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game
to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's
performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many
really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta,
Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course
Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great
villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the
so-called BR2 'fans' look more justified than ever and leaves you
scratching your head wondering how entire sequence are shot for shot
ripoffs. How can this go unpunished?
