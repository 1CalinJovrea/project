This franchise just keeps getting better and better!

You would think that after five films this would have become a tired
premise, but the way that it takes on the spy genre as both an
intelligent espionage thriller as well as a big-budget blockbuster
makes it even better than the new James Bond films. It's exciting, slick, cool and fun, but this series, most of all in
this film, has got an amazingly inexhaustible energy to it that makes
it so brilliant.Let's start, then, with the main attraction of this film: the action.
Simply, it's stunning. There are five separate big action sequences
here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all
high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an
entertaining film.Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no
other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching
himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike
through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most
exhilarating car chase ever).On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of
the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to
director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a
good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work
(avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining.Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it.
There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent
storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's
absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well
as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes
you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be
properly engrossed in the current story.Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to
McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes
that this is set in all over the world. From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London,
this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous
films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in
my opinion!www.themadmovieman.com
