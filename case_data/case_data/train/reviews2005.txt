Film Different: A Cool Movie - Not meant to be a documentary

This movie is a dramatization, based on stuff that really happened, and
it is a really cool movie.No, this movie isn't meant to show history exactly as it happened. If
you want to know all that read the book by Walter Isaacson. It's a
great book.The script is pure Sorkin-Porn. Rapid-fire dialogue with 2
conversations going on at the same time. If you liked The West Wing or
any of Aaron Sorkin's other movies, you'll feel at home with this one.They also get the small emotional moments right as well. Some of the
best moments are between Steve and his daughter.The directing and editing is masterful. I liked the choice to shoot on
different formats for the different years and the flashback scenes
punctuate the drama on screen perfectly. All the actors do a fine job, especially Michael Stuhlbarg who plays
Andy Hertzfeld.I hope when they release this movie on blu ray they include the video
of the real Steve doing these product launches as bonus features.If you can get past the fact that this movie isn't a word for word
recreation of history, you will enjoy it.
