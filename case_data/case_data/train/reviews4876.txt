Boldly go where no man has gone before my arse.

(THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS PEOPLE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)I'll start with the good: Cumberbatch is excellent and knows how to
make a good villain, but only when we do realize who he is I can't help
but think it's an imitation of the previous version. Peter Weller makes
an excellent admiral and really does bring presence to the screen.The action and visual effects are all excellent, but this is to be
expected of a film this large and Abrams does a solid job giving every
crew member their moment to shine, bar one character whose names should
have been Mrs. Plot Point.(SPOILERS)My main problem with this film is the fact that for those fans out
there, there will come a moment where you put two and two together and
sigh in contempt - which I heard about another 70 people do at the same
time as me. The whole third act kind of felt like a slap to the face to Trek fans,
I'm no die hard Trekkie but I enjoy the films, and every throw back to
Khan felt forced and melodramatic. The fact that Quinto's Spock can
call Nimoy's Spock out of the blue is cheap and out of place, and the
whole radiation chamber scene while "clever" for reversing the roles is
boring and predictable. But if you haven't seen Wrath of Khan then this
will be quite a shock, for a few minutes at the least.Overall, I wish that the Kilngons had been given a larger role as they
were quite awesome, and I have the feeling they will be the main
antagonist in the third film in 20-whenever-it-gets-made. The many bad
things in this film outweighed the few good bits.
