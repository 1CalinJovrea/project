Dumb..

Unfunny, forced and wrong in pretty much every place Daddy's Home is
another stupid film starring god-awful actor Will Ferrell. I like Mark
Wahlberg but my god he goes from good movies like Lone Survivor to this
crap. This movie also takes logic out like that scene with the bike or
the scenes with the Skateboard. The best scene from the movie was the
ending where John Cena appears and Triple H Metallica song starts
playing other than that the movie sucks. Go see a better comedy not
this one. Final Rating 4/10 dumb and stupid in every possible way.
Michael Bay's Transformers 4 had better acting and scenes than this
film has in 1 hour. PS: John Cena the only good part of the movie.
