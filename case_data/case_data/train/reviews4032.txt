Truly awful 1/10

If you've seen other disaster movies then you've already seen this film
. In fact this film was a disaster ! Gerard Butler has history with Olympus has fallen ( better check that !
) gone are the days when he was in good films such as DEAR FRANKIE or
LAW ABIDING CITIZEN . If you like far fetched outlandish plots where America is great and is
the saviour of the world with its environmental credentials intact then
this is for you . If you prefer to be a little more down to earth stay clear . Pad.A 1/10
