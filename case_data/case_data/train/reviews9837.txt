don't let the clich√© description put you off, this is a great horror.

When i first saw the description of this movie, I thought "oh yeah,
just another possession movie ... yawn, probably going to be a waste of
my evening" ... but then I took a look at how many positive reviews It
was getting and decided to give it a go ... and to no disappointment!
This movie was well done, lots of original material, well crafted
cinematic horror, good acting, good plot, actually reasonably scary and
suspenseful... it's a solid horror movie. I recommend it strongly to
other horror fans and trust me I don't give that recommendation out
easily, there is plenty of 'horror crap' out there, but this is horror
gold. Good job.
