It is not even close to what you will be expecting!!

I was eagerly looking forward to the 5th installment of this series and
I am sorry to say that I have been really let down! Apart from the once
in a while visuals, the movie has not been able to get even close to
expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start
feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is
gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 & 4, I was
expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but
he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes
rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny.
There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued
to screen. Milla Jovovich looks pretty as always, but that won't save
the movie. All others have done a horrible job with their acting,
especially Sienna Guillory. I would say that the only reason you would
want to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the resident evil
series and you don't mind wasting your money and time for the sake of
this series.
