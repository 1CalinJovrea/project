Not Your Typical War Hero

Part way through I began to feel the story was a bit slow moving, maybe
a little flat. I realized this is not an indictment of the film, but of
Americans' movie going habits. Everything these days is a blockbuster -
LOTS of action, tons of special effects, one- dimensional super hero
characters. Megan Leavey is a quiet, understated film about real life
and real people, and they are not always pleasant, exciting or
interesting. If you like your war heroes shiny, perfect and larger than
life - this film will not be for you. Megan Leavey is about a flawed,
troubled, not very likable young woman who joins the Marines with no
heroic idealism - she is just looking for an escape from her miserable
life - made so very much by her own doing. And Rex is not Lassie. There
is no instant, feel-good bond between a girl and her dog. Rather, the
story illustrates the importance of showing up - taking one step at a
time, and that with hard work and patience - redemption and second
chances are possible. Not an easy feel-good film but worth the effort,
as is true of most important things in life.
