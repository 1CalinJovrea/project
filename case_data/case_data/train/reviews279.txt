slow and boring shut it off after a hour

This movie is such a let down, I watched a hour of this horrific peace
of writing and cannot believe that they made such a stupid movie. The
scenes were jumping from junk to more junk that made no sense. I
absolutely love batman and superman and this movie is just insanely off
what it should of been like... Good actors playing super popular parts
but no story line what so ever. I was super confused throughout this
whole movie. How is lex luthor not bald, and why is he being played by
this quarky guy who should be like the riddler or something. I feel
like I waisted a hour of my time watching this garbage and I would
never put this in my top batman movie ever. Batman with Michael Keaton still rains supreme !
