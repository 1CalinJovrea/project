Charming.

Really surprised by this one;was expecting the run of the mill rom-com,
but it is so much more than that; it's about family and the smiles and
cries of life. The whole film was filled with charm, wit and had its
fair share of heartfelt moments. Time travel is a subject that has been
visited many times in the film industry, but this had its own unique
touch to it. The film flows really nicely, it oozes class at some points. And the
mere thought of having the ability to travel back in time sends your
mind into a whirlwind of what-ifs? The acting is superb by all, but
Bill Nighy was my favourite as Tim's Dad. When on screen with Domhnall
Gleeson (Tim), the connection is very convincing and it was those
scenes that i enjoyed the most.A very good film and worthy of a viewing by any standards 7.25/10
