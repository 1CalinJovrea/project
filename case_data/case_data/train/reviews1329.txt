Pretentious treacle

The sets were nice. As were the locations. But as a character study, or
a study in family dynamics and dysfunction, we've been there before,
many times, and this plows no new ground. All the supposedly clever
repartee was vacuous bloviation, making little sense. The only actor
who came out of this disaster unscathed was the one who brilliantly
portrayed Sigourney Weaver.The opening sequence, chewing up 4 valuable minutes of a movie goer's
time, with Adam Sandler looking for a place to park in Manhattan, set
the tone for the movie. After that scene you thought that if the movie
didn't get any better it would be unbearable.The movie was unbearable.
