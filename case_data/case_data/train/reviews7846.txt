Simply a work for the PC Police with Gratuitous Violence to Spice it Up

While I don't find the topic of the movie (transgendered individuals)
to be totally repulsive, I must admit that the whole hoopla surrounding
the release was totally unwarranted. In fact, I believe that this is
simple a rewarmed effort which has been previously covered.
Specifically, this is simple a boring retelling of the prose which was
at the core of another of Redmaynes works - The Theory of Everything.
In fact, the most daring portion of the entire film was the sheer
plagiarism surrounding the storyline. Of course, if you haven't ever
seen the prior works, you might be enticed to think that this was an
original work. But even if this were so, how can you justify the
gratuitous nature of the flick? I mean using ionizing radiation to
immaculate a man? How is that either necessary or realistic?
