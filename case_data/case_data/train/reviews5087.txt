Disappointed beyond belief!

First of all David O. Russell is one of my favorite directors. I've
enjoyed his films and absolutely loved "The Fighter" and "Flirting with
Disaster". This film also boasts an incredibly talented cast including
Christian Vale, Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams.The problem is with the story, the film's pacing and length. Of course
if I was enjoying the film the length would not be an issue. The film
did not hold my interest and I was bored for most of it. I read that
most of it is improvised, and I think this lead to it feeling very
fragmented and disjointed. My mind drifted often and I checked my watch
many, many times. What should have been a compelling, interesting movie
was turned into a bore fest with several funny moments.I am surprised at the overall extremely positive reviews and will watch
it again when it is on cable but expect my reaction to be the same.
