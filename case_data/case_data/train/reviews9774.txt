Superb Satire - Jonestown Rebooted?

In the same way "They Shoot Horses Don't They?" was a satire, then so
is this movie. It is demonstrating that in moral vacuums, in the
"anything goes" era, anything can be justified in the name of one type
of "spiritualism" or another.It is no longer the "why?" forming the moral predicate before action,
but rather, the "why not?". So madam would like a reversal of the moral
test, for satisfying an egocentric need for an after life on her own
terms??? Why not!It is showing that in the permissive society, where egos shape their
own virtues without reference to anything else, then mass murder can be
justified on the basis of "well, why not?" --- and hence that is as
superficial as it needs to be in this superficial age of ours.A genuine surprise with many strong performances. Superb satire.
Jonestown rebooted.
