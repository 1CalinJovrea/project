Jeremy Rush's debut as a writer-director creates a B-grade production with A-grade results!

I've never heard of Jeremy Rush and noticed this is his first full
length major film as either a writer and/or director. He accomplished
both with great success. He created a B-grade production with A- grade
results.Don't go into this expecting (or comparing it to) another "Transporter"
as it doesn't have the huge Hollywood budget, A-list cast or
professional production team and backing. Nor is it meant to be a full
out action thriller. Instead, it's a neo-noir mix of fast paced action
and psychological thriller.The writing had a few flaws but made up for it with excellent directing
and outstanding cinematography (i.e. camera angles/shots)Frank Grillo nailed his character and I think this was one of his most
convincing roles.I highly recommend this film, especially as a Sunday night pajama and
popcorn flick.A well deserved 9/10 from me.
