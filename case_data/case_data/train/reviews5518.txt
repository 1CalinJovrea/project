Much better than the first movie

I loved this film so much better than the first one. I felt the first
movie left a lot of key plot points out, but this movie brought some
things in without making the movie seem jumbled. Sea of Monsters starts
by telling the story of how Talia, Luke, and Annabeth came to camp half
blood. It also brings in the characters Tyson and Clarisse. Granted,
the way they brought in Tyson wasn't exactly how they did it in the
books, I thought that they did it in the best way possible considering
the first film. In the books, Tyson was a classmate of Percy's, but in
this one, they brought him in to help Percy's confidence, which he
needed, and also brought in the story of the great prophecy. I
understand some people were looking for the movies to be an exact
replica of the books on film, but I didn't expect that. Ad I don't
think anyone should. The majority of the the characters were there, the
basic storyline was there, and I thought that they brought the Kronos
and Talia story lines in very well to make a cohesive and fun movie.
The special effects were great to me, especially the hippocampus (I
know there were supposed to be three of them, but the one they did have
was impressive enough). I definitely encourage people to not rely too
heavily on anyone's opinion (even mine) and go see and enjoy this
movie.
