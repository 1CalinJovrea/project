Hi Ho Silver and away!!!

IGNORE any bad reviews of this movie. Here's another great summer
comedy (also see The Heat) but without the R rating so it's a good
family movie. I laughed and laughed at this movie. I was thinking it
was going to be a serious take on the Lone Ranger (yeah, yeah I
know...even with Johnny Depp). But very quickly as the movie progressed
I was laughing and having a great time watching these two.Johnny Depp is a master at facial expressions and this type of comedic
timing. Sort of like Jack Sparrow but without the flamboyance. I was
totally entertained the whole time he was in a scene in this "long"
movie which went by very fast. The other actors also did a good
supporting job with just enough drama to add to this movie rather than
distract.The scenery is awesome and the action scenes are beautifully
photographed or green screened, CGI'd or real...whatever. I have
nothing negative to say about this one...funny, no gratuitous sex,
violence or language, imo. Just fun. What a nice break...I do believe
I'm going to see it again!
