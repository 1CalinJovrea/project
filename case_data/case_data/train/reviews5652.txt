Guardians of the what?

The most astonishing thing about this movie to me is how fast I forgot
the entire experience.I kinda remember that cool opening scene with Groot - but after that?
Guardians of the Galaxy 2 moves from one action scene to the next with
a bunch of random banter about an extended family... which is
completely contradicted in the final 15 minutes.I also remember a bunch of absurd happenings during the action scenes.
Improbable results, luck, weird environments that do not follow any
known physics and characters screaming at one another over the ambient
sound.To paraphrase someones wisdom - the script wasn't the result of time,
hard work, skill and craftsmanship. Things happen on the screen because
the screen writers say so. This is what many superhero films have
become: glorified CG cartoons that feel like really long TV episodes.Ironic too - in an age of great TV writing, many blockbuster movies
have been reduced to mass world wide appeal instead of any unique
writer/director vision.I really didn't like this movie 3/10
