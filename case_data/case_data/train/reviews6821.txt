One of the best Stephen king adaptations I've watched.Carla Gugino
plays a really remarkable performance. I am so impressed while watching
the film. The movie is as attractive as the book. I hope Netflix will
make more Stephen King adaptations. I loved it very much. And the form
of handling child abuse was also very sensitive and subtle.
