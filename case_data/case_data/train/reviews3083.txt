G.I. Joes Are Much Better This Time Around!

G.I. Joe: Retaliation is the sequel to the much maligned 2009 film,
Rise of the Cobra. While I did enjoy the first film to a fault, I think
it's much better this time around. Unlike Rise, this film is less campy
and has a more serious overtone. There is still some well-timed humor
to like. The action is incredible and it certainly outdid it's
predecessor.Jon M. Chu's film takes place several years after the events of Rise.
In this film, a revolution is in progress led by the fearful Cobra
Commander and his comrades. But it's up to the Joes led by Duke Hauser
and Roadblock to put an end to this rebellion. But with the government
infiltrated, it may not be an easy task.This time around, the cast is bigger with more brand-name stars here.
First, Channing Tatum was good and if rumors had it, his screen time
certainly was expanded. Dwayne Johnson was an excellent addition to the
cast and his persona fills up the screen. Bruce Willis was another good
addition to the cast and quite frankly, who doesn't love Bruce in these
kind of films.Overall, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is bigger, badder, and better than the
first film. These kind of films certainly bring out my inner kid and I
can't help enjoying them no matter how preposterous they are. This film
stretches its plausibility just a little bit, but what does it matter.
It has plenty of explosions and action to make my inner kid happy.
Also, this film was directed by the guy who did the Justin Bieber film.
Who would have thought that? I rate this film 9/10.
