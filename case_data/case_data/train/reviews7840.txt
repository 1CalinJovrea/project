GREAT FOR THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN! And maybe everyone!

They don't make many science fiction films these days. This was a
pleasant surprise all throughout the film. Man did I like this film.And in my opinion. Tom Cruise really likes what he does, and works at
his craft as an actor very seriously. In my opinion 95% of Cruises
movies in the last 10 years have been good choices. And I'm sick of
what the media says about his personal life.I am one who went and saw Prometheus with an open mind. And listened to
what the director said about it NOT being an Aliens movie. And LOVED
IT. Good Sci-fi. Such as this film.It definitely turned out to be something I wasn't expecting.Excellent Job by Everyone involved. Nice work Cruise!
