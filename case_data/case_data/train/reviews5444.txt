Best religious meal ever.

40 minutes into the movie the religion is served to you nice and warm,
fresh, and ready to eat. You are told what to think, given biased
views, and plenty of illogical premises, mmmm! What? But, but... the
acting is actually GOOD!? Lots of the science is bogus, but, not that
much more bogus than so-so Hollywood flicks... How can this be a
religious flick?Just enjoy the show my friend... no more religion, we're so sorry.1:15:00 in, and oie, one of the lead roles suddenly believes in
religion for no explainable reason other than to drive the plot, which
has now crumbled, ever forward, toward Sunday school.Your choice of a Cesar's things to Caesar Salad, or an unlimited amount
of Breadsticks and Fish, oui misure?Now you're forced to choose something else entirely, as after this
point, the religion is thrust down your throat nearly every scene,
until at 1:26:00 we're faced with a religious debate between our
scientist and some lady that logically pummels him using illogical
reasoning, and clearly, somehow, the music tells us that she pwns him
with something that is apparently supposed to make logical sense but
keep in mind this is a work of fiction.It is apparent that this moment is "the point" of watching the movie,
because from this second on, you can practically describe every next
scene in complete detail. They are just going through the motions; The
scientist becomes adamantly religious, because lo and behold... science
has proved religion is actually true! Love prevails! Science bad! Stop
doing it now! Lesson learned already? Good! No more make-y research!Roll slow-mo hugs and kisses, sorrowful yet thoughtful music, long
shots of peoples faces thinking and realizing God must be real after
all, covered everything? That about wrap it up? Roll credits. Jackpot!
Chalk one up for the LORD!We're half-way to heaven! Jesus take the wheel!
