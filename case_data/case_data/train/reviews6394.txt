Much better than than the reviews have one believe!!

If you enjoyed other Nicolas Sparks movies, you will enjoy this one. It
is heartwarming and one with integrity that depicts what it is to love
someone unconditionally. It is a sweet, and sensual romance of a young
couple struggling to come together while each follows their dreams.
Sophia, wants to follow her passion of art, and Luke, follows his
passion as the world's best bull rider. Their love story is entwined
with the memories of a relationship of love long ago, told and acted by
Alan Alda, who plays Ira, as he reads letters he wrote to his dear
wife, Ruth. The scenery of the movie is lovely, the bull riding is
exciting, the script, thoughtful and touching. Have Kleenex on hand,
you will cry. At the end of this movie the audience clapped because it
was good all the way through.
