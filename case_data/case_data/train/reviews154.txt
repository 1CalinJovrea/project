Movie Has Been Written A Thousand Times

"It must be great. Bradley Cooper acts in award winning film." But no.
It's the same movie that every other actor has done at least once in
their career. The lead is arrogant, chip on their shoulder, lacks
social skills, loner by choice... There is sexual tension with opposite
sex (usually) supporting character. This tension helps the lead start
to let down their guard. Something happens that upsets the lead so bad
they are worse than every before. Then the lead has a mental break
down. The opposite sex character helps pick them up. Usually at that
same time the sexual tension is broken. The lead makes peace with their
demons from the past. Voila!! He/she is no longer an angry prick but a
lovable person with great social skills. It all revolves around an
unique career, skill or hobby. The only reason to watch the film. In
this movie it is world class chef, but it could be a snake milker,
innovative uke player or a deep sea crab hunter.
