Transformers: The Last Knight --- A True Disasterpiece

The movie cuts and jumps so much and so quickly (Some scenes are
literally less than 20 seconds long... in succession...) that by the
end of the first half you'll feel dizzy from trying to follow.It takes everything from the other movies... and spits them out in raw,
bloody bits which make no sense and flow like chunky soured milk.If Michael Bay has gotten tired of the franchise.... it finally shows.
The last 45 minutes of battle were so bad... it didn't even redeem the
movie.Trust me... don't bother going to see it in the theater, it's a waste
of your time.
