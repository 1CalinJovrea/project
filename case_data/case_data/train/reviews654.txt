From a person who hates horror movies

Yes, I hate horror movies. I watched them in the past and I am usually
disgusted by this genre of movies, rather than afraid of them. However,
the title of the movie and the brief plot indicated that this should be
a rather different and interesting horror movie - and it was! It was
not one of those movies where seemingly smart characters make stupid
assumptions or decisions, and the movie mostly kept you thinking what
will happen next.The actors (including Jane Doe) were awesome 9.5/10
and the effects were good 8/10. The movie is only 1.5 hours long which
is just perfect.Worth watching even if you are not a fan of horror movies!Spoiler: The only thing that I did not like was that it was clear from
almost the beginning that the girl was a witch. The main characters
found so much evidence that she was a witch and even listed all the
evidences, but only later in the movie they admitted the fact.
