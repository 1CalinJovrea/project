Nothing compared to it's predecessor

I remember watching the first Trainspotting twenty years ago. I
remember how much I liked that timeless movie. I thought Danny Boyle
did an outstanding job in that time. So I was very excited about
watching the sequel after twenty years. But all in all it was
disappointing. I just sat it through. Maybe I had too high of
expectations but during the entire movie you have that feeling that it
will never get better or even close to the first Trainspotting. You
can't really blame the actors, that aged very well, because they just
play their roles like you should expect of them but the story this time
is just not as entertaining. Too bad because it had potential to be
another classic but unfortunately this one won't be a classic. I
remember watching the first one over and over again. This is not going
to happen with this one. Okay to watch once but that's about it.
