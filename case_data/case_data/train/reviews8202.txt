The Ridiculous waste of time

At first, b/c the humor was SOOO bad I thought "well, Adam is targeting
tweens with this movie,that's nice" and then later I realized NOPE,
this is just a realllllly bad attempt at Adam being Adam. And then I
thought.... how old is Adam now? I get that most of Adams movies have a
certain level of "off the wall" slapstick that comes with seeing a
Sandler movie and that not all can be great or a reasonable facsimile
of great... but wow, just wow. I can safely say that there are Sandler
movies that I admire and no matter how ridiculous the humor had some
underlying meaning that left me with that feel good feeling when it was
over... but this heaping pile of dung was not one of them. I think I
must be at least 2% less intelligent after watching this movie in its
entirety.Find something else to do!
