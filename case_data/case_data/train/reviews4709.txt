The worst Nolan's film ever

Very disappointing because of:*The worst voice quality of the recently watched films - terrible *Bad
start ever, asphalt road, clear walls etc!!! *Too sterile pictures,
sights - every body who starts a research will see on the old 1940s
photos of Dunkirk that roads , buildings and coasts were full of mess,
debris etc. *The casts have no faces, names like zombies - only a died
boy's name - George- remained in my mind. There is no really main
character(s) *Very poor views of the dogfights *Poor picture quality
-grain noisy and sometimes the objects is out of focus- and camera
movements compared example to the War for the Planet of the Apes - over
all the best quality every levels, sound, voice, picture quality,
camera movements actors performances etc.- and compared to other IMAX
movies *I gave only 1 point because of these reasons, the huge budget
and the very professional A list directors, crews and actors. The
bottom of the B category for ~150 mil.Finally I was a big Nolan fan but now I am very disappointed and a bit
up set in turn I'm and my family big fan of the cinemas especially
ODEON ISENSE with Dolby Atmos. Usually I didn't do reviews I'm sick of
this terrible movies.
