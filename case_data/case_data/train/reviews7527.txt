Disney Excels Again

My disappointment was hearing that critics had found fault with this
work of perfection.The characterisation has been thought through carefully and the
temptation to make caricatures of the step-mother and her daughters
consciously resisted.The retelling of "Cinderella" (apparently known, in the 19th century,
as "Cinderslut") with the benefits of modern techniques and processes
is impeccable.Often, films that are 'great works' suffer from some minor weakness or
other, a detail not followed through, a hasty bit of editing, a clipped
or overly long scene but never did I feel that could be said about
Disney's film. "TLC" (tender loving care") from beginning to end.True to Walt's original intentions, here is a film for all the family
(well, some teenagers may want to wait a little).Good luck, it's great to see memorable films making it to our screens.
