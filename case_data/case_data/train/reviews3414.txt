Great topic, poor acting and dialogues

Based on the IMDb score, we decided to watch this movie. Unfortunately,
although the concept of the movie was great and something to ponder
about, the poor acting, bad dialogues and overall poor flow really
ruined this movie. It was definitely not funny, very dark and the story
line was not well connected. Some people compare this movie to 40 years
of virgin, or 500 days of summer, and the comparison could not be more
off.
