Hardy terrific, film so so

I was really looking forward to this one; the trailers were great and,
whilst I'm not one of those who glamourise the Krays (they loved their
mums, would do anything for you blah blah blah), I do find it bizarrely
fascinating how the Krays/Richardsons have passed into London folklore.
Alas, it's a bit of a let down. Hardy throws himself into both roles,
by turns amusing and scary as Ronnie and compelling as a Reggie trying
to build an empire while struggling to keep his brother in check. But
he is let down by a clunky structure, it takes a while to get going and
subplots and characters are introduced and then discarded on a whim, an
awful Frances Kray voice-over, and an uneven script which can't quite
decide if it wants to be an American style gangster flick or tread the
same path as The Long Good Friday, Get Carter et al. And who let Duffy
and her nails down a blackboard voice back in? I really hoped we'd seen
the last of her after that crap Diet Coke ad. The club scenes aren't
quite working guys. I know, let's get Duffy, stuck a wig on her and she
can caterwaul her way through some 60s classics. High five!!!
