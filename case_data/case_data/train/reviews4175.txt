Quite boring and unbelievably bad sang

I wanted to watch Les Miserables in a movie theater but somehow I did
not manage to do it on time, so I bought the DVD.... Sorry for the
money.I do not know if my expectations are too high (being myself a musician)
but I sort of think that what a musical is all about is singing. Acting
is important, costumes can be nice and it does not hurt if the takes
are nice too. However, hence the word MUSICal, it's all about music,
and Les Miserables are simply miserable in this respect. The main two
actors (Jackman and Craw) are undoubtedly very good actors but have no
idea how to sing; They are incapable of singing a straight note and it
is obvious that they never had any real lessons except probably at
acting school (as usual with these cases a month's coaching before the
shooting is not enough - all professional e.g. Broadway singers who
suffer for years are not stupid, they do it for a reason). Had they not
been famous, everyone would laugh.Whoever does not believe me simply please buy the CD with some proper
cast (for instance Michael Ball or Anthony Warlow).If one can tolerate the insufferable singing, I admit that the rest is
excellent. The acting is superb, the takes breathtaking, the costumes
and sets fantastic, and the emotions overwhelming. If....I take away five stars for the awful music and give full credit to the
rest. However, music is in my opinion half the job, and in this case
half a job very badly done.
