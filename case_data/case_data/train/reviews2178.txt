"Not enough Tommy guns" - IGN

"Live By Night" sees star Ben Affleck back in the director's chair for
the 4th time, his previous directorial offerings being "Gone Baby
Gone", "The Town", and best picture winner "Argo", and sadly, it's
easily his worst. "Live By Night" boasts a wonderful cast, stunning
cinematography, and enthralling action set pieces but lacks any
emotional weight or an interesting story, it's your usual by the
numbers gangster flick about tough guys in over-sized suits blasting
each other with Tommy guns and stabbing each other in the back. "Live
By Night" is not a bad film by any means but is a forgettable entry in
the gangster film genre and a disappointing directorial effort from Ben
Affleck.
