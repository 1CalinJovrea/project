Not-to-forget movie

Vera Brittain made me think about time, immortality, about unspeakable
suffering which brings war to all who participate in it. The beauty of
nature, the joy of life, aspirations, plans - everything is so fragile,
so elusive. It is so easy to destroy, to shatter all the dreams, it is
so easy to bring nothingness, emptiness, nonentity.Vera helped me to notice the word "Memory" in my life. Do I want to be
remembered? How I want to be remembered? How I will remember those I
love, respect, admire?I've bought her autobiography after watching this movie.Thank you Alicia for the great performance!
