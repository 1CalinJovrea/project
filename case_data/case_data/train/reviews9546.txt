Not The Best

Honestly, to me the movie was a complete and utter let down. I had some
high expectations for this movie because the 1st and 2nd movie were so
good and I thought this 3rd movie would have been way better. Although,
when I went to the movies to see the movie I was really disappointed on
how it turned out. There were many flaws from the movie. For example on
how the video effects and cinematography turned out, this had way more
green screen action then the 1st and 2nd movie those two movies took
place in the open and I think this movie didn't get enough of the open
area. Also I was a little disappointed that they didn't tell us who Jeepers
creepers really was. That was one of the reasons I wanted to see the
movie. I do understand why the movie looked the way it did because the
video effects and it was because they were on a low budget which is
also why it wasn't advertised as much. So probably why a lot of people
didn't know about the movie's release date or anything. Even with a lot
of the things that was wrong with the movie I just hope in some way if
they make another movie it comes out to be better.
