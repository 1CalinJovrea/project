Like watching a piece of toast turning black.

I could not stop mentally vomiting. This movie is so clich√©d it should
never have been made... 3 michelin star chef eating in burger king..
come on, product placement has ruined the movie industry. There was NO
story line, no script, bad acting. The only good thing about the movie
was its name. Burnt. And its a pity they did not burnt the manuscript.
Why do the make these movies. At least we have a good contender fort he
razzes. Also the film industry needs to stop taking money from British
American tobacco.. Its 2016, the general population does not smoke, yet
in the movie all the main characters did. It was just bad getting
worse.
