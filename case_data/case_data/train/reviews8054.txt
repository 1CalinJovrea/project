Not what you expect

I saw this film on Copenhagen pix yesterday. The movie was compared to
"the orphanage", and even though i liked that film i was a bit in doubt
if i should go for it because i was not in the mood for a heavy
emotional, mother and son horror-drama. But its everything but. Sure
its horror, sure its drama, but the tone is very different from the
Spanish movies around same kind of subject which are very serious.This
is way more fresh, snappy and sometimes funny actually, without being
lame. But also creepy, its the change of moods thats freaky. Nice
style. The actors are supreme and the whole socialrrealistic scene
around it is far out and overexagerated, which the horror part also is.
But it works, because its a metaphorical movie describing a feeling.
Its highly original. If you expect the same supernatural children
horror movie As you have seen before, think twice. This is new, this is
cool, different. The best movie i have seen in a year. Serious. It
never gets melodramatic, its fast, entertaining and a bit psychedelic.
Very refreshing. And smart, clever. It has it all. I am a big fan.
