Live Free or Die Hard Meets 2012, But Better Than You Thought..

This is an action-packed movie that will entertain you; and you will
feel pretty okay about what you've just witnessed.Very nice special effects. The storms were nicely done. CGI was
convincing. Why I think this works better than other "Natural Disaster" films is
because they did not revolve the plot around the storms...the storms
were just the vehicle of destruction used. It's more like a Live Free
Or Die Hard conspiracy, but instead of hi-jacking the IoT, they are
hi-jacking weather control satellites.Good CGI, a fun movie. 7/10 *Had Bruce Willis been in it... would have made it an 8.5
