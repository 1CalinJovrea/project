Simple but very effective.

This is what horror films should be like - focused on the scares, has
really effective jump scares, even a few humor thrown in, and a not
complicated story line that is very easy to follow.This is very much a very "popcorn horror movie" where it delivers the
right scares & thrills. Maybe it was a little too short, but that's
okay compared to long horror movies that don't really work.I found myself jumping/shouting/screaming a couple of times watching
this in the movie theater and I assure you it was not because I just
wanted to do it or due to the influence of peer pressure of everyone in
the theater also jumping. And it has also impact beyond that, because
you'd be thinking about this movie when you get home and you have to
turn off the lights.It's a very entertaining horror film and in my opinion, what horror
films should be like (especially PG-13 horror films). "PG-13 horror
films" can indeed be very effective in the right circumstances. Those
people who are saying this is "only scary" because of the "jump scares"
don't understand effective jump scares when they see them.So bring your friends along with you and watch this in the cinema and
you'll be surprised.
