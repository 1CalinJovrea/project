Must see with my girls

OK, so I saw it by myself in an almost empty theater with two white
ladies sitting above me. But I gotta see this with my girls. It's
funny. It's fresh. It's elegant. It's sacrilegious. Each actress brings
her own bling and booty with her. Lisa slays. Sasha swings. Dina is da
bomb. And Ryan is the truth. This is a fun movie for adults. Leave the
kids home and go see this with your girls. If you see it with your man,
you will need to hold back til you get home or get a room. Feelin' hot,
hot, hot! 'cause Malik, Julian, Stewart are fine!!! Love the trippin'
scene. Funnnnny! I laughed out loud but I know my girls and I would
cackle even more together watching this film. Great comic relief!
