Don't listen to anyone, watch it for yourself! :D

This movie. Was simply hilarious. A lot of people expected a bit too
much from this Movie, but me personally did not. I have to say, it
literally ended with a Bang. People are not thinking about how
difficult it will be to make a Hangover III as if you could imagine
yourself, the Director would be thinking what would be the Hangover
about?This story has a great twist, and it is best of for you guys to watch
it yourself spending a couple of coins on the tickets and ''wollah''
enjoy.10/10 Loved it! Specially the End! ( Comes after the Credits, don't
leave your seats ).
