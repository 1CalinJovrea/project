Poor story and even worse directing

I've seen the other reviews of Jason Bourne and I am starting to
question my own judgement, maybe I am too biased to write a review for
this title. But I can't help it as I absolutely hated the movie. And I
hated it after I had low expectations for the latest title, since I
heard Tony Gilroy wasn't involved in the script. The story is atrocious, I realize that it is supposed to set the basics
for another 15 Bourne movies, but the story is so bad that they decided
to overcompensate for it with prolonged action scenes, which are just
terrible. It reeks of desperation to watch nothing happens for so long
periods, just throwing dust in the eyes of the viewers with effects and
low quality action. I realize that this goes beyond Ludlum books, but
Greengrass is pretty much willing to do anything to fill the movie,
other than to continue with the traditions of the original Bourne
series known for Ludlum's excellent story-telling and spy- craft
realism. The fight scenes, they're just terrible. Too fast camera shifting, even
more than previous Bourne series, leaves you thinking that those actors
are good for nothing amateurs who can't act a fight scene, so you need
to make sure the viewer never really sees it.I loved the first 3 movies, even liked the Bourne legacy, and I adore
the books. But this movie is so bad, that it shouldn't be even put
anywhere near them. The acting is good, the story is bad and the
directing is just painful. And btw, when you're doing realism spy thrillers, don't make hacking
look like a freaking Pokemon hunt. It's just pathetic and unbelievable.
Go watch Mr. Robot and think again how hard would be to present the
"hacking" with at least proper interfaces instead of embarrassing
yourself.
