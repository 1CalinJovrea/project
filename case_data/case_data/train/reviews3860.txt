The Emoji Movie is a true masterpiece

What are you talking about the emoji movie is the greatest cinematic
masterpiece of all time I haven't even seen the film and I already know
it is greater than all other films. Better than Godfather. Better than
Forrest Gump. And sure as hell better than anything Disney or Studio
Ghibli could even imagine. Your mind just cannot comprehend the pure
cinematic experience that is the Emoji Movie with its complex three
dimensional characters, highly developed plot, beautiful settings and
animation, its ability to tackle complex and modern issues of self
worth and identity, and the fantastic comedic dialogue that cements it
as the greatest comedy in cinematic history. To end this the emoji
movie is an amazing piece of art in its purest form and should be
treated as such and deserves to be held at the highest pedestal of
cinematography earning not just an Annie but an Oscar and an Emmy too
because this film is just that amazing you just weren't able to grasp
what can only be described as perfection.
