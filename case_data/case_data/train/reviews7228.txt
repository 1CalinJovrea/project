Delightful Original Adventure

Jake (Asa Butterfield) is an outcast teenager that adores his
grandfather Abraham 'Abe' Portman (Terence Stamp) that used to tell
stories of the orphanage in Wales where he was raised to him. When Abe
is murdered in his house in Florida and has his eyes removes, Jake sees
a monster and his parents take him to a psychologist. Jake asks to go
to Wales to visit the orphanage and his psychologist agrees. His father
Franklin Portman (Chris O'Dowd) travels with him to Wales and Jake
discovers that the orphanage was bombed in 1943 by the Germans. When he
decides to visit the ruins of the orphanage again, Abe finds a girl and
soon he learns that the orphanage, the headmaster Miss Peregrine (Eva
Green) and the children still exist trapped in a time loop. But they
are in danger since monsters are hunting them down. And Jake has the
gift of seeing monsters. What will Jake do?"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" is a delightful original
adventure directed by Tim Burton. The fantasy is a sort of X-Men and is
highly entertaining with lovely characters and evil villains. Despite
the confused idea of time loops, the film entertains adults and
children. My vote is eight.Title (Brzil):"O Orfanato da Srta. Peregrine Para Crian√ßas Peculiares"
