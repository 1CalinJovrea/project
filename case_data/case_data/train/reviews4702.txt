The vampire genre gets another reinvention

A mother and daughter flee the mayhem they've caused in London and
relocate on the Sussex coast. Clara (Gemma Arterton), a ruthless
predator, opens a brothel on the top two floors of a Victorian
sea-front hotel owned by a local weirdo (Daniel Mays) who's infatuated
with her. Daughter Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan)befriends sickly teenager
Frank (Caleb Landry Jones) and, to her mother's anger, tells him the
truth about herself. A couple of creeps masquerading as cops are on the
women's trail: in this revised vampire orthodoxy "The Brotherhood"
doesn't allow lady members. Johnny Lee Miller plays Ruthven, a Georgian
dandy who unintentionally recruited Clara 200 years ago. Tom Hollander
has a thankless cameo as a New Age therapist.Screenwriter Moira Buffini takes other liberties with the traditions of
the Undead: instead of fangs they use an extending fingernail (borrowed
from Wolverine?) to open up their victims. Much as he did in INTERVIEW
WITH THE VAMPIRE, his previous foray into Bram Stoker territory,
director Neil Jordan applies a highly individual approach to this
"hallowed" (or should that be unhallowed?) ground. A glimpse of one of
the more threadbare Hammer Dracula series on TV reminds us that things
have moved on since Christopher Lee hung up his cape.Inevitably we're going to compare this to Sweden's LET THE RIGHT ONE
IN, the Swedish movie that reinvigorated the vampire genre a few years
ago. The weakest link in BYZANTIUM is Gemma Arterton's performance: she
plays Clara like an EastEnders barmaid (to be fair, the script
encourages this interpretation: she's given some crudely modern lines),
whereas Eleanor and Ruthven and the Brotherhood all seem to belong to
the age in which they were spawned.Still very worth seeing. Jordan's movie makes harmless Hastings (I
lived there for five years) seem as spooky and dark as John Boulting's
Brighton in the original BRIGHTON ROCK.
