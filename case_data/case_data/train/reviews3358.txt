decent at best, too predictable.

In hope of being scared, I was ready with my blanket and pillow to
cover my self. I started the film and the first act looks promising. It was scary, the
psychologically horror was present but not for long, until the second
and the third act. It became another jump scare horror. And it became a
bit predictable at worst. You know exactly what's going to happen next. On the other hand, my girlfriend, who was a bit wuss at horror movies,
enjoyed the movie and she was genuinely scared as well.Therefore 4 stars from me, making it decent horror/jump scare movie,
enjoyable fun for the whole family maybe not for the children, but for
friends and adult family.
