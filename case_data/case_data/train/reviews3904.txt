Great expectations but massive letdown as a comedy

I would probably have rated it slightly higher if it wasn't because of
the high score and headlines as Buttcracking funny". It was the most
boring movie I've seen and my partner fell asleep quit early on. As a
romance, nothing particularly new or inspiring there either. I would
say that the Brits are more capable of making interracial stories that
feels heartfelt, warm and funny. Holly Hunter and the main character
performed well but the rest........ :-( I would not recommend this
movie to anyone and do not understand the praise it received. Would
rather watch 5 episodes of Friends.
