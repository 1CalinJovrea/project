If I were to watch it again, it would be on mute and I would FF to all the stripping scenes.

This movie has blinded people with lots of washboard abs. I was one of
them, and I flocked to the theatre. While the stripping scenes were fun
and well choreographed, that was the movies only good quality. They had three plot lines going during the movie, all were not
developed enough and it made the entire story scattered. Furthermore,
they didn't give those story lines appropriate endings, so we just
ended with breakfast and kissing and called it an effing day. What a
waste. Channing Tatum was okay in his role, but there were times where he
stumbled over his words and I was left wondering if that was an error
and poorly edited, or if it was left in to make it seem more natural.The sound editing was weird to me, conversations from the upcoming
scene began before the shot of the ending scene was over.
