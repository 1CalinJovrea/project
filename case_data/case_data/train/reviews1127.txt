the little you know about it the better

it's been a while since i've been this satisfied with a movie, it's
compelling, thought provoking and extremely clever film that keeps you
guessing to the last frame.excellent storytelling thanks for the great work from the
directors/writers despite the low budget they pulled out a great movie
with good production values, sets, costumes and special effects.powerhouse performances from the two leads Ethan Hawke as usual is a
very serious actor though he haven't been in any good movies in the
past few years but you can see that he's making a comeback with this
one as well as this years magnificent BOYHOOD but his performance in
PREDESTINATION is a very strong one because he had to handle such a
very complicated character, same thing goes for Sarah Snook.the less i say about the plot the better, this is the kind of movies
where you have focus throughout the whole runtime of it trying to
figure out where is it going and any detail that you miss might ruin
the whole experience for you but hey don't worry there's an explanation
for everything here. this movie is one of this years' personal favorites as well as the
indie of the year so far (still have to see BIRDMAN).
