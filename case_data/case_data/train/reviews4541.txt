Weak-age

Seeing the crew back together was fun. The core characters are still
likable, and the actors for the most part deliver. Stifler, like he's
done throughout this franchise, nails some genuinely funny moments. The
lack of an engaging story was the undoing here. The writers had so much
to work with but, unlike the first film, create only a thud. The story
lines concerning Oz-Heather and Kevin-Vicky are so much on the
back-burner that they become nonexistent. More attention should have
been devoted to them. Less on the tiresome plot of Jim and Michelle and
their martial problems. Still can't understand why these characters were constantly commingling
with high school students. Its was unnecessary and awkward. They're
adults now, just like their fanbase, and no one will cry if they party
with... ummm... adults.
