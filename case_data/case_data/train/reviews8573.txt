Bad enough to make one doubt IMDb ratings forever

Divergent was not brilliant, but it was your average young adult movie.
Insurgent is way below that. It is so bad that I wanted to leave the
theater and read my book.But anyway, let's talk about the movie. In the first film Tris learns
she is special, in the second she learns she is *very* special, but
just if her boyfriend lets her do anything. Seriously, I actually had
to ask my wife if girls like guys like him or is it just the submissive
fantasy of the author. Apparently, a lot of girls like overbearing
assholes who think they know what is better for you. And guess who
makes her appearance in the sequel? The mother in law!Bottom line: the sci-fi aspect of the film was marginal, the characters
clich√©d to the point of monomolecular cardboard and the basic story was
learning to accept yourself as your boyfriend tells you what to do
while he deals with his mommy issues. I am not kidding: the most
sympathetic character in Insurgent was Peter, the asshole who always
insults and betrays everybody.P.S. The Erudite test was remembering something that had happened to
you two nights ago? Really? That's what makes you smart?
