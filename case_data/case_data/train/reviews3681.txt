See It for Affleck!

In spite of a most annoying & pretentious score, this was a very moving
film--actually a mouth-gaping appreciation of Casey Affleck. He carries
the film, along with the actor playing his brother, Michelle Williams,
& his nephew. Some scenes early on seem to plod on, and the pivotal
scene of Affleck's past (that will forever haunt him) is reconstructed
by voice-over rather than __seeing__ the evidence, which becomes a
little disconcerting, considering how important it is. I was really
impressed by Affleck's character, who seemed incapable of enjoying
anything in his life. His alcoholism is palpable, as well as his
violence, but he plays a wholly realized character--infinitely better
than he did in "Gone Baby Gone." I hope he wins an Oscar for this role:
I've never seen him better. And Michelle Williams is wonderful,
especially in a near-conclusion confrontation with Affleck: that alone
is Oscar-worthy. It's beautifully shot in the actual
Manchester-by-the-Sea, and it's definitely worth seeing.
