"Warcraft's success is contingent on audiences accepting Xena-style cheese in the era of Game of Thrones"

I'm a fan of Warcraft and all the games and a big fan of epic fantasy
cinema. But this film misses the mark and seems like it was made
without any idea of what actually makes a story engaging. The opening scene is the only time I felt engaged in this movie,
bringing shivers to my spine inspiring nostalgia of dueling in front of
Orgrimmar. Yet the intertextuality of that experience is one that is
exclusive to only those who actually played World of Warcraft. The
entire movie must look like a completely incoherent mess to anyone who
doesn't share that experience. Every scene after that demolishes any hope I had of this being an
enjoyable experience. It's obvious that a ton of hard work went into
this film from many talented artists, technicians, and professionals,
but the truth is no matter how much lipstick you put on a pig...http://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-movie-review/
