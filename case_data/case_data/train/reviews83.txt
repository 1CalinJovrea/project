Transylvania again...

I know Transylvania is a cool name and sounds very interesting, but
really people, when are you going to get the simplest of facts
straight?I know this is a movie, and perhaps I could get past all the wrong
years and characters' age inconsistencies. But when are you American
film-makers going to grab a history book and read that Vlad Tepes had
nothing to do with Transylvania?Basic historical facts: - Vlad Tepes, son of Vlad Dracul, was a ruler
in Wallachia (NOT Transylvania) - his castle is named Bran (not Castle
Dracula, wtf!) and is in the mountains indeed, but still belongs to
Wallachia, not Transylvania+1 for mentioning that "Dracul" meant "The Dragon" in old Romanian
language, referring to the Order of Dragon that Vlad's father was part
of. Only in the recent history has "Dracul" become a synonym for "The
Devil".Anyway, I was ready to accept all historically wrong facts and enjoy
the movie. But I could not.The plot was so bad with so many inconsistencies and underdeveloped
characters that I don't know what to begin with.I don't want to spoil so I will not bring exact details, but here's
what happens in this movie: - there are characters who appear out of
nowhere in 1 or 2 scenes, who apparently have an important part in the
story, but we get to know absolutely NOTHING about them - nobody in the
Turkish army seems to have any fear whatsoever after witnessing an
extremely powerful, supernatural force; they see Dracula killing
soldiers like crushing ant with a boot, yet the Turkish generals remain
cocky and eager to fight him with... well... a sword. - the dumbest
idea I have ever seen of how to prevent soldiers fear Dracula before
going to fight him... watch and amazeOverall, a very bad movie. I can't remember the last time I've seen
such an awful piece of cinema... makes you wonder what was going on in
filmmakers' heads.
