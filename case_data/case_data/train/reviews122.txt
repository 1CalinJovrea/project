Although sometimes slow, still a "must see".

I saw this movie at the Sonoma International Film Festival, and
although I felt like it could have been edited tighter, it was an
amazing story that I'm glad that I experienced. The acting was great,
the period costumes and sets were flawless, and the story that it told
was heartbreaking and needed to be told. I doubt there was a dry eye in
the house (my wife and I certainly cried).
