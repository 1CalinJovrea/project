En Route to Servitude

Before I proceed please note that I have not seen the Despicable Me
movies. I merely took a chance with this one. Thankfully, I was
pleasantly surprised to find it decently entertaining, despite its
intended target audience and the fact that I've been around for at
least 38 years.IMDb reviewer elliemcnair and Co. have beautifully summarized the plot
so I'll go straight to my 2 cents': the movie is entertaining in the
sense that it has something for the young and the young at heart to
enjoy, while having other things that more mature audiences can also
appreciate. It was a treat to see references to British culture and pop
culture such as James Bond, the Beatles, rock and roll, etc.. The people who will best appreciate this movie, however, are the fans
of the Despicable Me movies or folks who love the minions' silly
antics. The latter idea was what caused the move to feel like
hit-and-miss for me depending on the scene. Certain jokes and scenes
were humorous to me while others felt a bit flat, as if the writers
were trying a bit too hard to provide something funny just for the sake
of having a joke.Overall, however, it was easy for me to to empathize and identify with
the title characters' search for a master to serve. Ultimately, that is
what appeals to adults: the identification with a desire to find--even
create--meaning and purpose in one's life. Yes, the movie is a comedy
yet it is also a metaphor for life. It is nice to know that underneath
the seemingly mindless slapstick humor is a deeper meaning that all of
us can resonate with, regardless of age or station.
