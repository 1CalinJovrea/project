I know that chicken ... I voted for him .... TWICE!

Instant classic.Easily ranks among the best from the Disney Studio, and a very worthy
successor to Mulan 1998, a similar story equally well done.Oddly also seems to be best work ever from Dwayne Johnson, perhaps not
the first name I would have associated with "voice acting," but a star
turn nonetheless.If you want to be picky -- which is the reviewer's job, after all --
the momentum slows a little at the top of the third act, but the
ultimate themes of redemption, forgiveness and self-discovery at the
finale are an absolute joy.As they used to say, "for children of all ages."
