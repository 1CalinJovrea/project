Anti-criticism

I've voted 10 in order to raise a bit the very low rating for this
film. It's actually a good movie by Maestro Stone, which seems to be
strongly under-appreciated. I read many negative reviews here and
laughed at them. In my opinion, the plot is interesting, acting and
performance are good, and the dynamics of the film is excellent.I've watched the uncut version, so there are several important scenes
have been added, which make a huge difference. Without these cut
scenes, the theatrical version should look pretty plain. The monologue
of Travolta about the American order is extremely important, and of
course it has been cut from the theatrical version (no surprise), as
well as the true relationship between Lado and his wife. Both cut
scenes serve a good basis for the finale of the movie.The questions about love in three is completely irrelevant. Reading
reviews questioning this kind of love and wondering 'why' and 'how'
made me really laughing. They just love each other, so what's the
problem? Should everything be explained for the dumb and childish
audience, which has got used watching the rubbish movies full of CGI
effects, with brainless heroes and minimal acting? And I well
understand the motives of the guys. This is the love movie in ala
Tarantino environment. It reminded me True Romance in some way. Now I
see, where Counselor came from.All in all, Savages is highly recommended, although it's not a chef
d'oeuvre, just another good movie to watch in your free time.
