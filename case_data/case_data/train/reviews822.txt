Better, but not quite good

It's weird to think that with something like "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles", you might lower your expectations. If something's really
popular, shouldn't you make your expectations higher which is why
everyone complains about "The Phantom Menace"? Anyway, this movie was
just okay, but I will give it props for being an improvement over the
original. This is a movie where they just want to put in all the
popular characters for the fans. For the most part, it worked out. We
got Baxter Stockman, Bebop and Rocksteady, Krang, and Casey Jones. Even
though I haven't seen the newer TMNT shows, I still know who all those
guys are.The effects haven't improved much, which is what really weighed this
down. A lot of this is stupid action, but the franchise itself was
never meant to be that intelligent. Still, the bad seems to outweigh
the good as I found the dialogue predictable and it was pretty annoying
to hear that tired clich√© of people being scared of something they
don't understand. The original Ninja Turtles movies just seemed to
capture the spirit more. I'll give this movie for once again, having
all these characters. They're mostly in character even though Krang
should have had more screen time. It's certainly more servicey than a
lot of other TMNT media. Maybe I really should get into the newer
shows. **1/2
