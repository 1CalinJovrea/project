Disappointing

Based on the reviews I read in here, I was expecting much more from
this movie. Yes the movie is action packed, but very much over done.
Certainly not a quality movie by any means, with a weak story line. It
was like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited
lives....he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot! There
are assumptions that we will understand the rules of the "committee",
but these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the
end. In light of the over the top and often excessive violence and
killings, I must say Keanu Reeves' performance is the only highlight of
the film. Overall however, a very weak story with unnecessary and
excessive violence, and a plot that is more suited for a PlayStation
game.
