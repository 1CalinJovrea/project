"I'd thank him for trying to teach me what love is"

SPOILER ALERT well made movie & beautiful acting by Kate Mara the movie talks about a
marine girl who fall in love with a dog while she's in the service.
good ending the she adopted him, but the ending could be better if
Megan and the marine man get back together
