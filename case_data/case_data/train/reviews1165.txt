Not as Good as the Original,but Fans will still be Pleased,

Horrible Bosses 2 is a great movie with a well written storyline and an
outstanding comedic cast.The first Horrible Bosses is certainly
better,but this sequel this totally holds up and delivers many very
entertaining and laugh out loud scenes.The three leads are still in
great form the second time around and you can tell that Bateman,Sudekis
and Day are all great friends,and they are joined by a star studded
supporting cast that includes Christoph Waltz,Chris Pine,Jennifer
Aniston,Jamie Foxx,Kevin Spacey and Breaking Bad's Jonathan Banks.Pine
would have to be my favourite out of the supporting cast,his character
had the best dialogue and he was surprisingly great at comedy.The movie
thankfully dosen't follow the same premise as the first,which is
something that a lot of comedy movies do and I was very grateful that
they took a very different approach from the first.Packed with tons of
laughs and a great cast,I would definitely recommend Horrible Bosses 2
to fans of the first and to anyone looking for a good comedy. After they fail to get an investment from a very successful business
man,Nick,Kurt and Dale decide to kidnap his son to receive the money
they need to run the business. Best Performance: Jason Sudekis Worst Performance: Lindsay Sloane
