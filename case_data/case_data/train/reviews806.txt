A Portrait

I remember when back in 2013 the Jobs movie came out. Everything about
the film's trailer was "do not see". Still to this day the moment when
Kutcher says "we're making Apple cool again" makes me laugh. Right from
the start this film looked like they were going to do it right and I
was anxiously waiting for it. And even though Steve Jobs wasn't
everything I thought it would be it is still a quality drama.Yet I can also see why it was not so commercially successful. It's
weird format of taking place before three computer unveilings and the
film essentially consisting of conversations with limited action
between them. It is by no means a biography of the man's entire life
but it does paint a portrait which, like any picture, only reveals some
aspects of the person.The film has a great cast who give solid performances. Michael
Fassbender creates a character whose tyrannical and devilish behaviour
you want to keep watching while longing for a glimpse of the human
side.Overall Steve Jobs is a very watchable and engaging film, provided you
are already into end of the year Oscar bait drama films.
