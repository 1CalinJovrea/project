flaws here and there but astonishingly memorable

At its core every romantic movie ever filmed is just a BOY MEETS GIRL
story. It is a tried and proved formula and more or less embedded in
our DNA.So kudos to these two film-makers for re-inventing the story in a
startling new way. We will never know what "Hollywood" would have done
to this had they got their paws on it --- I am thinking it would have
ended up as a sequel to The Conjuring -- but fortunately for all of us
this remains a sweet and refreshing indie flick.I was glued to the screen to the end, which, given the volume of films
I see, is saying something. Nice seeing one of my favourite directors
in a cameo also -- Jeremy Gardener.What really really elevates this film is the performance by Nadia Hiker
which is to be fair beyond mesmerizing. Bringing back memories of
Hepburn in her earlier films, Hiker takes one of the most bizarre (and
arguably over-written!) characters in the history of film and makes it
her own. Very impressive work.Would happily recommend.
