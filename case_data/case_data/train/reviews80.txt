Great movie!

I am a fan of the original TV show and also a fan of Henry Cavill and
Guy Ritchie. I have been looking forward to this movie for quite some
time and am pleased to report that it was as good as I had hoped it
would be.I prefer being entertained at the cinema rather than being shocked. I
like leaving the theater refreshed rather than depressed. This movie
was perfect for me. It was fun and witty. There was no inappropriate
language or gratuitous sex (only what you see in the trailer). The only
disturbing (very brief) scene helped establish the villains as evil and
fanatic. This movie pays homage to the decade of my youth and brought back
memories of the history and style of the times but will still be
enjoyable to the younger audience who are not familiar with said
history, style, or TV show.I think Henry Cavill is a talented actor, and I found his performance
excellent. It was his job to establish Napoleon Solo as a suave and
lighthearted cad who is nevertheless an intelligent and capable crook
turned CIA agent. He got the job done! This movie certainly shows he
can play a variety of roles. Armie Hammer is so funny in "Mirror,
Mirror" that his performance as a dedicated and austere career spy was
a delightful surprise. Hugh Grant and his brand of humor really added
to the movie. Alisha and Elizabeth are great in their roles and play
them with relish.I loved the retro spy gadgets. Certainly enough action to satisfy me.
Too many funny scenes to name them all or without spoiling. Just go
watch the movie and see for yourself. Enjoy!
