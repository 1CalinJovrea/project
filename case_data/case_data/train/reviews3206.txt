Ten Entertaining Tales of Halloween

Divided in ten segments by ten different directors, "Tales of
Halloween" is an entertaining horrorÂ–comedy film in the style of "Tales
from the Crypt" with the theme of Halloween. 1st) "Sweet Tooth": A boy collects candies in the Halloween, and his
babysitter and her boyfriend tells the legend of an evil being that has
sweet tooth and kills those who do not share candies with him. They eat
the boy's candies and discover the truth about the legend. This tale is
funny and gore. My vote is six.2nd) "The Night Billy Raised Hell": a boy dressed like a devil is
forced by his sister and her boyfriend to throw an egg at the house of
a secluded man. However the man is the devil and he teaches how to
create havoc in the Halloween night. This tale is also funny because of
the devil's tricks and has a surprising end. My vote is seven.3rd) "Trick": a group of drugged and drunken friends are attacked by
kids that ring the bell and break in their house. Why are they under
attack? This gory tale has an intriguing screenplay with a surprising
end. My vote is six.4th) "The Weak and the Wicked": a gang led by a teenage girl bullies a
teenager and he summons a demon. The three bullies hunt him down and he
run to the place where his house and his parents had been burned to
ashes by the gang. This dark tale of revenge is too short and could be
a little longer, but with a surprising end. My vote is five.5th) "Grim Grinning Ghost": a young woman goes to a Halloween party at
her mother's home that tells a story of a fiend. When she goes home,
her car breaks and she has to walk home. She startles with footsteps
and a laugh behind her on the street. Could it be the evil spirit? This
tale has a creepy atmosphere and a scary conclusion. My vote is six.6th) "This Means War": a man discovers that his wife is a witch that
likes to eat children. This tale is silly and one of the weakest of
this anthology. My vote is five.7th) "This Means War": a man is proud of his Halloween decoration that
attracts many viewers. However his new neighbor with his friends
dispute with him the best decoration and they begin a war. This tale is
a tragic comedy with a stupid situation. My vote is five.8th) "Friday the 31st": a disfigured serial-killer confronts an alien
that possesses the body of one of his victims. This silly tale is a
parody of Friday the 13th but the fight between Jason and the alien
does not work well. My vote is five.9th) "The Ransom of Rusty Rex": two thieves abduct the son of a wealthy
man o ask for ransom. However the man refuses to pay and the men have a
surprise. This tale is certainly the best one with a great twist. My
vote is eight.10th) "Bad Seed": a man carves a pumpkin that eats him. A skeptic
detective has to hunt down the pumpkin and finds where it was produced.
This tale is also great with a trash story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available
