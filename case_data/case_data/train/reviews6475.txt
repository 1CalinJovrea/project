An Incredible Achievement, Intensely emotional and Action-Packed.

Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan
and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh
installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious
Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time,
home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the
franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in
favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was
an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded
off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess
that because these films taught the significance of family and
substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to
end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the
legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other
hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special
effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast
entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling
ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker.
