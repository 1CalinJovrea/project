Let your inner-nerd out.  This is AMAZING.

I literally could not stop myself from writing this review. There's 

just so much to talk about, I don't know where to begin...but let's 

just get this out of the way...



PACIFIC RIM IS A 5 OUT OF FREAKIN' 5.



Guillermo Del Toro, you deserve a standing ovation. From an unbiased, 

stand-alone movie point of view, this film does an incredible job of 

being exciting from beginning to end, while still developing an awesome 

back story and character depth. 



Charlie Hunnan (of Sons of Anarchy fame) solidifies himself as a good, 

respectable action movie star, but Idris Elba CRUSHES his role, and 

steals every scene he's in. Solid acting all-around, much better than 

what you might expect from an action movie like this. 



THE ACTION IS TOP-OF-THE-LINE. What is there to compare this 

to...Transformers? Transformers WISHES IT COULD HOLD A CANDLE TO 

PACIFIC RIM WHEN IT COMES TO EPIC-CGI-ACTION SEQUENCES. Every hit, 

every explosion, every gut-wrenching Kaiju kill is a work of art. A new 

gold standard has been set.



VISUALS AND GRAPHICS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE 

IMAX 3D TREATMENT. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE PART OF YOUR BLU-RAY 

COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE VIEWED ON 9 BIG-SCREEN TVS 

STACKED ON YOUR LIVING ROOM WALL. Do not cheat yourself by simply doing 

2D on this one. 



OK, now the nerd-out part of this review. If you are a nerd in any way, 

shape or form, then this movie is for you. And if you're an anime nerd, 

then this is your favorite movie ever. EVER.



The inspirations from and references to Godzilla are obvious, but 

you're very likely to notice influences from several different sources. 

Anime fan? Then I dare you to not see the nods to Big O, Neon Genesis 

Evangelion, Gundam, or even Gurren Lagaan. That female computer voice 

sound familiar? Maybe that's because it's the voice actress of GLaDoS, 

from the motherf*cking Portal games. Your inner nerd won't know what to 

freak out over more.



5 out of 5, gold star, thumbs up, A++, 100%, NOW STOP READING THIS AND 

GO SEE IT!!!
