So much more than a "romantic comedy"

Romance, cultural conflict, betrayal, compassion, and redemption. All
neatly wrapped within the context of a comedic memoir. Michael
Sholwater did a superb job directing and the writing collaboration
between Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani gave the audience a
wonderfully intimate sense of how the warmth, power, and growth of a
couple relationship can expand and strengthen the bonds of family.No story or movie becomes great without a superb cast. Again Kumail
Nanjiani proved his versatility with an amazingly strong performance
(in my opinion award winning). And this movie was not a one man show,
Zoe Kazan gave just the right energy to her role, Holly Hunter should
get an Academy Award for best supporting actress for hers, Ray Romano
was excellent as were Zenobia Shroff and Anupam Kher. This was the best
movie I've seen in a very long time and just may be the best romantic
comedy I've ever seen.
