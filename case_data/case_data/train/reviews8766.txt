I was duped

My initial thoughts after first seeing the trailer for Passengers was
that it was a gross excuse to put Hollywood's two hottest actors on
screen together. I saw that the critics had given this abysmal reviews
and I wasn't surprised. I was however surprised to see that user
reviews contradicted what critics had to say. Reviews contained
descriptors like unexpected, great acting, suspense and the like. Well
let me tell you this film was none of those. Passengers was
forgettable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it just was. Like I said,
nothing more than an excuse to have studly guy and sexy girl on screen
and cash some cheques while they were at it. The visuals were meh, the
acting was passable, the script was something a fourth grader could
have written. I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times in some
different form. I'm only writing this to detract from the other user
reviews that say to ignore what the critics are saying. Though it's not
terrible it DEFINITELY isn't worth going out to see.
