10
first paranormal themed scary film in ages that actually scared me

Like the title says, i enjoyed this movie immensely, the usual horror
clich√©s are there but i still feel the movie felt fresh, and did things
slightly differently from the norm. Mama herself is an excellent
creation,they keep her image out of it until later for maximum tension,
and then when she is unleashed its like all the dread thats been
building explodes into fear. her movement etc is exactly what is needed
to make this sort of film scary. There are a couple of moments that are
pure terror and i was laughing after a few of the bits just because i
was so amused and entertained by the scariness. My girlfriend actually
moaned with fear at one point! Her face throughout the 2nd half was
priceless :P i think some of the other reviewers are being overly
critical, yes the end wasn't amazing but it think it did a much better
job than a lot of other films like this, and seeing this gives me hope
that there's still very scary things that can be done in this genre of
horror. :)Its maybe not a 10, more an 8.5/9 but im giving it a ten to balance out
the negative reviews.
