A young woman becomes a sexual adventurer.

Writer-director Marielle Heller gives us an almost voyeuristic look at
a teen looking for self discovery. Minnie (Bel Powley) has no real self
assurances, but finds her sexuality beginning to be a portal for her
deeper discovery. She finds something in viewing herself in the mirror,
but what would it feel like to have a lover's touch? Her artwork allows
her to reach out to a female comic-creator (Susannah Schulman), and she
records thoughts in her diary. She is desperate to share her
experiences with someone in order to actually understand herself. Her
friend, Kimmie (Madeline Waters), shares the adventure into sexuality.
To boost her own sexual experience, Minne enters an affair with her
mother's 35 yr-old boyfriend (Alexander Kkarsgard). Minnie is impulsive
and craves sex; she has much to provide to pages of her diary.This movie earns its R rating with strong sexual content, graphic
nudity, drug use and raw language. I found it worth watching more than
once. A mood elevating soundtrack features: Mott The Hoople, T. Rex and
the Dwight Twilley Band.Also in the cast: Kristen Wiig, Miranda Bailey, Abby Wait, John Parsons
and Carson D. Mell.
