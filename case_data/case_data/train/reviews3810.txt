Jennifer Lopez pays the director to be in this film

Wow is this movie a terrible mess. It's a Statham standard, whom I
love. But the insults to the intelligence are just remarkable. If
you're going to put together a by the numbers movie then just do it
well. Jennifer Lopez cannot act. She is a disaster. This movie is an excuse
for her to have a large role and try to show off how beautiful she
thinks she is. Word to Jenny from the block - you have aged. You're not
that hot. You're sad, very sad.Parker is a thief who is double crossed. He's not going to hunt down
the gang that tried to kill him and couldn't do so even though he
should have been dead at least twice. As he goes through this
far-fetched and forgettable story, he meets Jennifer Lopez, a woman who
is a desperate female willing to do anything - and I mean anything - to
land a few hundred dollars to make her car payments.Not very good butt kicking. Lots of incredibly stupid dialog. The only
thing that would have been worthwhile would have been to make this into
a threesome and a more restricted rating. Other than that, this movie
has nothing compelling. It's a bad C movie. Skip it.
