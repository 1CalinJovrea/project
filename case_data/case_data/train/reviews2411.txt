nice movie

I wanted to see what would happen even afterwords,I wanted it to continue. I was stunned to my seat with lot of thoughts
and emotions. Tanned surfing teenage boys with model-beautiful mothers
in bikinis, The beautiful filming that is so well themed and
constructed, this relaxed and ecstatic feel that transcends from the
screenmaking the audience feel the exact erotic atmosphere in which the
characters dwell and that pull of desire that comes across in the
silence and in the sound of the ocean; and Robin Wright's extremely
deep character building and original portrayal of female strength, pull
the film together to a true work of art. The location, beach houses,
cinematography are beautiful and makes you want to move to Australia.
Just for that the movie is worth watching.
