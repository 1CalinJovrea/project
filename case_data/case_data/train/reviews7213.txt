I'm not sure I sorted through that to find the message

I'm not sure what the message was... Ego, cheating, debt will get you a
nice car and babes? Be yourself, unless someone tells you to do
something else? For every thousand people following dreams only 5 of
them will get selected? Passion doesn't always equal talent? If you are
smart enough the people you cheat and steal from can't touch you. I
like the understanding the boy and his father came to. I've usually
found that a good movie focuses on conveying a good clear theme or
message and this one was kind of all over the place with weird
conflicting messages. It kind of felt like a movie trying to ride on
some of the success from Zootopia.
