Iron Man 3 delivers in spades.

Saw IRON MAN 3 last night and it was superb. It was the sequel IRON MAN
2 should have been but wasn't and the perfect extrapolation of life
after AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. The set pieces are suitably awesome and the
acting performances are uniformly excellent from the leads right down
to the tiniest bit part (there's a jewel of a cameo from a guard that
upstages even Downey's comic timing). The script gets the balance
between the epic and the personal just right and Sir Ben delivers two
performance for the price of one and both are genius (can't say more -
spoilers!). Mr Downey Jr also manages to show even more of the
complexity of Tony Stark. Just when you think there's no more to be
fracked out of that particular mine, he goes deeper. The writer set out
to deliver a fun story and that's exactly what it is. It draws you in
from the first moments and doesn't let go. What more could you possibly
want?
