A Terrible Misfire

There's nothing much to say about 'The Gunman', but I'll keep going
until I've said too much for an action flick that deserves an
assessment no more than a "disaster".It will be a real wonder to be able to find something that is of any
interest through the movie's entire two hours. The film itself strikes
as a mere guessing game that pushes the audience to asking themselves
which asset (if there's any) it actually aims to present: the bad-ass
hit-man story the writers seem to claim the film has, or Sean Penn's
overexposed shirtless bulging physique. Unfortunately, two hours isn't
enough to achieve a sensible answer, as both eventually grow to become
extremely irritating toward the end of the film. A handful of
overqualified actors and aesthetic settings may come across as efforts
to salvage the wreckage, but none of this attempts seems to have
manifested an evident result. The plot is plagued with predictability
and clich√©s, but bears no real shocker twists to shake its overly
familiar course.'The Gunman' feels like just another attempt to make another Liam
Neeson out of another over-50 star. Unfortunately, with its utterly
thin and convolutedly-written material, the result is neither near
'convincing', nor far from 'misfire'. OK, I've said more than too much
already.
