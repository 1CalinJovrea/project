Unrealistic & Predictable, but still worth seeing

Look, the movie is completely unrealistic and some of the situations
quite absurdÂ—but you kind of know it's going to be that way in any type
of movie like this. I don't need absolute realism to enjoy a movie, and
if you do then you're going to be disappointed in 99.9% of every movie
you see.PARTIAL SPOILERS: ---------------------------------------------In this flick, the situation is absurd to begin with. The shark
behavior is unrealistic. The decisions the girls make after they get
trapped at the bottom in the cage are just stupid. The decision of one
of the guys from the boat to jump in the water knowing there are
multiple sharks is just silly. And the ending just kind of ticks you
off in an inconsequential way.---------------------------------------------All that being said, this movie was entertaining, suspenseful and
exciting to watch.
