The Snowden story, well told

Oliver Stone is such a great director. He's succeeded once again in
producing an interesting and sympathetic historical movie, this time
about the Edward Snowden whistle-blowing story. His movies are so
credible, so finely crafted, so watchable.It is a pleasure to just sit back and let Stone show Snowden's story to
you. I can't imagine anyone ever producing a Snowden movie that is
better than this one. I felt the story was presented objectively and
neutrally. Only near the end did the political aspect become a little
too much. Yes, Stone is taking a pro-Snowden position and is trying to
convince you that his position is right. If you are unable to
emotionally handle that didactic aspect, don't see this movie.Can I also talk about Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The man is clearly a great
actor with enormous range. He's been in dozens of movies now, and his
performances in each of them have been excellent. He really does
capture Snowden in this movie. Kudos to him, Stone and everyone else
involved in this film.
