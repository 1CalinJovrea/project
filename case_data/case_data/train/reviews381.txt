Awful movie. Total waste of time.

I want to start by saying that i'm a big fan of horror movies. I've
probably seen almost everything out there that's considered a "decent
horror movie". I also read many horror & thriller novels by authors
such as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. In short, i'm a big horror fan.When i saw the trailer of Oculus and read a few reviews on here with
headlines "Refreshing" , "instant horror classic" etc. i got really
excited and decided to give it a watch. Boy was i disappointed!!! I
don't want to say that it's the WORST horror/thriller movie i've ever
seen but it's pretty close.I'm not a professional so i'm not going to comment on script , director
,sound etc. All i want to say is a WARNING to dear horror fans, Stay
away from this movie unless you really have nothing to do. Boring as
hell. I had to skip the last 30 minutes or so just to see if it makes
sense at the end ( couldn't take it anymore) and i was happy with my
decision. If you have a ps3 you could set the forward option to 2x or
4x so at least you won't feel like missing out and not waste any time
in the process. :)
