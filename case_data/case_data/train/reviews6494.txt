I Loved It

Even if you know the end of the story, which I will not reveal, you
will enjoy the ride. Paul Potts is a chubby young man who loves to
sing, which makes him a target for bullying by one of the young toughs
in his school. The bullying is realistically portrayed except for the
fact that I do not think Paul could keep ahead of the bullies for that
long a run. Small quibble.As Paul grows up with few friends, if any, a doting mother and a tough
father, the one constant joy in his life is opera. After he finishes
school he gets a job in a cell phone shop with another odd character
and they end up as best friends. His friend plays a trick on Paul and
invites the woman to come meet Paul, who has been emailing this woman
for a year but has no idea what she looks like or even if she is really
a woman. She describes herself as looking like Cameron Diaz, spoiler
alert she does not look like Cameron Diaz but turns into the love of
his life.He goes through many highs and lows and finally has one last chance to
sing in Britain's Got Talent.I loved this movie because it is a real example of someone who could
have easily given up on his dream but keeps trying, one foot in front
of the other. I found it to be funny, inspiring and at one point even
brought tears to my eyes. The supporting cast are all brilliant as well
as the actor who plays Paul.
