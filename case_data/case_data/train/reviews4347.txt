Saw it at Dallas Film Festival

I have been looking forward to this movie for a while. I saw the
trailer and was instantly gripped by it. I got to see it early at the
Dallas Film Festival three months before it was actually released. The
film was incredible. The dialog was amazing, If you enjoyed fast wit
like Juno, then you'll have a blast with this one. It's a must see, and
deals with cancer in such a touching way. The acting was amazing. Nick
Offerman and Connie Britton were hilarious and touching. Thomas Mann,
Olivia Cooke, and RJ Cyler were also brilliant in every way. The
director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, did an amazing job here. Every scene had
it's own feel to it that made the film feel unique. It captures high school in a great way that I didn't expect. It shows
cliques in a new light, and it gives a great representation of how the
protagonist deals with it. The film changes tone with ease. With a
gradual enough change that doesn't feel forced or awkward. It's an
amazing movie.
