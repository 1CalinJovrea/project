Funniest movie I have seen in 20 years.

Laughter is healthy for your mind, body and soul. This movie is funny
from start to finish, congratulation to the team for their excellent
comedy, which is very difficult to execution, but you guys make it look
like, it was effortless. The last time time a black comedy movie made
me laugh so much was "Two Can Play That Game". Shout out to Will and
Malcolm.
