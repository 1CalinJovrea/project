Surprisingly involving

It's not just animal and dog lovers that will enjoy this war movie.
Quite eye opening to see how the dog sniffers and their handlers train
and work. The scenes in Iraq are quite well filmed. There is quite a
lot about the emotional bond between the dog and the soldier played
quite sympathetically by Kate Mara. She is suited to the role sweet yet
tomboyish enough to be convincing. The animal PTSD is something that
didn't occur to me and is fascinating.
