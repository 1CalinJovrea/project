An Enjoyable travel to the past

Interesting and captivating with a new twist to the classic formula.
Great cinematography and excellent acting contribute to this refreshing
Sci-Fi/Time Travel film.Rising actress Sarah Snook with a stellar performance is backed by
solid performances of both Hawke and Taylor. Such movies usually suffer from failed attempts at originality and
complexity boarding on confusion. This movie avoids both by not trying
to surprise and shock the viewer but rather act more as a mystery novel
- unfolding with precision, letting the viewers participate in the
events and discoveries to come. Much like a good old Agatha Christie
book would successfully do.The Spierig brothers keep getting better with each movie and this is a
great step forward in what seems to be a promising career.There is nothing new under the Time Travel sun but the delivery is
excellent which makes this movie worth watching - at least twice, as
any good Time Travel movie requires.
