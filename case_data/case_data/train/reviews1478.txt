A cult movie to be remembered

John Carter of Mars was an epic. A detailed story, written in a time
when pulp fiction was a cultural phenomenon like today's epic superhero
movies. This is not a wham bam in your face Avengers movie, but a grand
epic with a tribute to one of the greatest American writers of his
time: Edgar Rice Burroughs.Thank you Disney for your bold efforts. Sales might be the standard of
today, but in the hearts of John Carter fans this was a great movie.
Put to the screen with taste, class, and detail that will let this
story live on. May your efforts be rewarded with continued sales as
this movie finds its way toward cult status.
