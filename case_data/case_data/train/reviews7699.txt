Not a love story

While I wasn't aware there was already a "Parker" character (in books
that is), I was more drawn to the movie because of the director. Taylor
Hackford has done some extraordinary work. Be it "Officer and
Gentleman", "Devil's Advocate" or my personal favorite "Blood in Blood
out". But you can't compare this to any of those movies of course. I
was however surprised seeing him working with Jason Statham. A man more
known for his action filled roles.And while this might not be one of the better works of Hackford, it
still is good action cinema. Michael Chiklis has been better though,
although he doesn't get much to play with here. Jennifer Lopez gets to
play in a good movie too for once (after U-Turn and Out of Sight), but
don't expect to see too much of her here. This is the Statham show and
that is pretty obvious.
