Not as Clever as It Thinks It Is

A father and son are in a car accident. They both are taken to the
emergency room. When the boy is taken by stretcher to his emergency
operation, the surgeon says, "I cannot operate because he is my son."
How is this possible? I was reminded of this riddle all throughout watching The Limehouse
Golem, an atmospheric and detailed Victorian era mystery. In it, a
series of murders have scandalized the east London district that bears
the film's name. Inspector Kildare (Nighy) is put on the case partially
out of political convenience. "The public needs fresh blood," says the
power hungry Inspector Roberts (Sullivan). To whit Kildare is primed to
be Scotland Yard's newest scapegoat. As luck would have however,
Kildare comes to believe the serial murders are linked to another case
Â– that of a young actress, Lizzie Cree (Cooke); accused of poisoning
her husband (Reid). Can the embattled Inspector crack the case before
Lizzie is sent to the gallows? Despite having the pedigree of a
slightly cheaper Downton Abbey (2010-2015), the atmosphere of Limehouse
Golem is surprisingly layered. The squalid city streets, the busy wings
of the burlesque, the hallowed halls of the Limehouse Library (really
the John Rylands Library in Manchester) all shot with foreboding beauty
in mind. Likewise the camera glides seamlessly between scenes of murder
and actors weaving macabre recreations of current events. Theater, so
it seems, is its own form of alchemy and director Juan Carlos Medina is
determined to show off what jewels he can create.Yet while the film does its due diligence to build its case, the main
conceit can't help but leave the impassive viewer uninspired. Don't get
me wrong, the plot makes sense but this is a police procedural with a
capital P. And as with any police procedural, much of the case is spent
trying and failing to create a working scenario with a diverse array of
suspects based on the clues provided. Depending on your investment you
may just be frustrated that Kildare and his lapdog Constable (Mays)
aren't barking up a different tree. If however you're old-school
flabbergasted by the big third act reveal, chances are you walked into
a mystery movie by mistake.So essentially the mystery doesn't live up to its own hype but the good
news is the acting definitely does. Bill Nighy and Douglas Booth are
fabulous as always with Booth stealing all the best lines as a
vaudeville star and Lizzie's effeminate best friend. The real takeaway
however is Sam Reid as John Cree the husband who may or may not be the
titular bloodthirsty Golem. While remaining a suspect throughout the
film's nearly two-hour run time, Reid remains effortlessly charming. He
subtly reveals through action that his character has plenty to hide and
can play multiple versions of himself (depending on the narrator) with
aplomb. Olivia Cooke likewise gives a stunning performance though
because she narrates large swaths of the story proper, she isn't given
as much an opportunity to show rather than tell.Considering the movie is based on a novel written by Peter Ackroyd,
Limehouse could have been far more of a trial than it ended up being.
Thankfully Jane Goldman's capable script and Juan Carlos Medina's
affecting direction is the one-two punch needed to prevent The
Limehouse Golem from being a gloomy trudge through Victorian England.
It could have been a better mystery but at least its not as airless as
it could have been.
