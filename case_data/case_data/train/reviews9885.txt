Good, but watch Das Experiment instead

The plot is based on a true story, blah blah blah. It's a good one as
well! Not the amazing ingenious movie and certainly not the thriller
that "Das Experiment" was... If you can find it at your local video
store, go and get it and watch this instead! Don't get me wrong, the movie is a nice attempt, really interesting and
raising all kinds of moral questions and dilemmas. The actors were true
and professional all the way and overall, this is more than a movie for
a pleasant afternoon... The science behind the experiment was kind of crappy, but I guess back
then, psychologists were a bit on the rough side and not too cautious
with experimental parameters, etc. Anyways, if you want the thrill and the tense, "Das Experiment" is what
you should be looking for. This movie was unparalleled. Better yet,
watch this one first and then "Das Experiment"...
