Driven Insane by the American Way

I'm not at all surprised that "The Homesman" slipped through the
cracks, as it defies categorization and may just be one of the least
commercially bankable films I've ever seen. But it's a surprisingly
good little movie and one that deserves an audience.Tommy Lee Jones directed and stars in this film about a drunken
roustabout (Jones) who teams up with a prim spinster (Hilary Swank) to
transport back to their families three insane women who've been undone
by brutal life on the American prairie. It's a film about the weakness
of men to do what is right, and the fortitude of a woman whose faith
and sense of goodness gives her the strength to do what others can't or
won't....Until it's not, and it instead becomes about the difference
between those who want to do the right thing but can't get it done and
those who do the right things for the wrong reasons but are actually
successful at it. It's about the practicality of goodness, and about
how sometimes the world exposes things that are generally considered to
be valuable human traits -- empathy, devotion, religious conviction --
as weaknesses when they interfere with the ability to actually do the
right thing rather than simply talk about it.Swank and Jones are sensational, as are the production values that
bring alive the American nowhere of the mid-1800s. The film is
completely unpredictable in the best way. I had no idea where it was
going from one moment to the next and enjoyed every minute of not
knowing.I found this one streaming on Netflix and it's well worth checking out.Grade: A
