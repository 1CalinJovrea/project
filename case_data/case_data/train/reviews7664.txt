10
from the best movies i've ever seen

the movie story is really outstanding from the beginning to the end .
prefect directing , everything is prefect . 15 minutes before the end i
would give 8/10 but the last scene made me forget that Alex didn't call
for a lawyer, who would prevent punishing Alex or keeping him as
prisoner in this room for 8 hours . i am always looking for this kind
of movies that steals u from the beginning to the end i watched a lot
of Spanish movies but i gotta say this is the best .they didn't showing
sex material as usual at Spanish movies what i hated so much. you can
not blink your eye for a minute . great script and prefect suspense at
all the time ,i really enjoyed this movie especially the final scene
thanks for all participate of this film .
