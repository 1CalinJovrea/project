Every You Would Want In A Family Film,

Despicable Me 2 is a brilliant film with a great storyline and an
impressive voice cast.I definitely wouldn't say it was better than the
first Despicable Me,the first one was a lot more heartwarming,but it
still is a very good sequel and has everything you want in a family
film,humor for both young and older audiences.However,the story of the
movie feels very scattered and throughout I felt like they were trying
to fit too much in one hour and a half.Like the first Despicable Me,the
Minions are the best part,and they get even more screen time in this
one that they did previously,it's almost impossible not to laugh at
these goofy and lovable characters.It's not as good as the first
Despicable Me,but this sequel is very funny and an enjoyable movie for
the whole family and I look forward to seeing what Illumination
Entertainment does with these characters in the future.Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) joins the Anti-Villain League in order to
find an anonymous villain working on an experiment to turn the world
evil.
