Thoroughly authentic

I am retired from 31 years in the Army, and I watch a lot of movies. I
enjoyed "13 Hours" more than any movie I've seen since "American
Hustle." Just tremendous. Generally I avoid movies about the military
because the makers usually get it so wrong. I never detected a single
slip, a comment or reference that rang false. This has to be one of the
most compelling stories in recent years, and it was told with no
comment on politics or any effort to affix blame for what transpired.
Generally I tire quickly of "action" movies, but this one kept me
enthralled. By the end I was exhausted and exhilarated. Truly a
superior story told with taste and craftsmanship.
