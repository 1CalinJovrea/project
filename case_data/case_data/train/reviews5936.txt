This movie is about a teenage boy who stumbles upon a hotel run by an over-protective father version of Dracula who wants to protect his daughter, Mavis.

The movie starts out looking like a sweet movie about a vampire father
and daughter growing up together. Well, don't let that mislead you.After the first two minutes of the movie, we go from 1895 to present
day. It shows Dracula planning for his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday.
He has invited all his monster friends to come stay at the hotel and
prepare for Mavis's birthday extravaganza. This scene is utter chaos,
and just looked like "bad animated movie" to me. I mean, when the movie
includes the vocal talents of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Ceelo Green,
and Selena Gomez, I didn't have very high expectations. But instead of
being a cute animated movie, it turned out to be 90 minutes worth of a
random spew of events.I would recommend this movie to families with children under the age of
seven, who are going to the movies only for the purpose of
entertainment. But if you're a parent looking to go see a quality film
with your kids, this is definitely not the next Up.
