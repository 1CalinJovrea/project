Silly, but Entertains

The teenager Zach (Dylan Minnette) moves from New York with his widow
mother Gale (Amy Ryan) to Madison, Delaware, where she will be the
vice- principal of the local high-school. Zach is bored and upset and
while bringing his cardboard boxes with his belongings home, he meets
his gorgeous next-door neighbor Hannah (Odeya Rush) that welcomes him.
But soon her creepy father R.L. Stine (Jack Black) threatens him if he
gets close to his daughter again. Zach befriends the clumsy Champ (Ryan
Lee) at school and they schedule to go to a party together on Friday.
However, Zach meets Hannah again but they are caught by Stine. Zach
believes that Stine is an abusive father and he breaks in his house
with Champ to seek out Hannah. When Zach opens a book in Stine's
library, he accidentally unleashes a monster from the book. Soon he
learns that the weird Stine is a famous writer of horror stories that
keeps his imaginary friends that are monsters locked up in each book.
But Zach released the evil Slappy that promises to bring havoc to
Madison opening all the books on the same time."Goosebumps" is a silly film that entertains. The plot has funny
moments but Champ is an unbearable character and Ryan Lee does not help
with his face. "Aunt" Lorraine is also annoying, but Amy Ryan performs
a nice character. The chemistry between Dylan Minnette and the lovely
Odeya Rush, who seems to be a sister of Mila Kunis, are worthwhile
watching. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Goosebumps: Monstros e Arrepios" ("Goosebumps:
Monsters and Chills")
