Well Seth, you blew it...

I was expecting something at least sorta funny and entertaining. But
alas what I got an overly gross, less than childish, stupid movie that
hardly had any chuckles and no real laughs to me. The thing that made
me chuckle the most was the "runaway slave" shooting gallery because it
WAS funny and audacious to put in a movie. (I think we all need to
mellow out and laugh at ourselves a bit more because our history can be
funny/silly).Anyway, back to Million...sheesh what a waste of time and money, IMO. I
am thinking I will not see the new 22 Jump St. because I am sick and
tired of so-called gross humor & from the trailer it is more of the
same crappola. It is gross and not humorous. Ugh.Charlize Theron is always a good actress to me and how Seth got her to
play in this gross movie is beyond me. And Liam? Puleeze, he must have
made mint to be in this piece of junk. Just writing about it puts a bad
taste in my mouth. I gotta go see the other Million movie...Million
Dollar Arm!
