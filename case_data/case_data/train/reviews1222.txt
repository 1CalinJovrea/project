Must be something wrong with me...really liked this movie.

Yeah, I don't get the bad reviews either. really liked Pixels. It was
not as campy as I thought it would be. I rolled my eyes and sucked my
teeth like ten times during the movie at some corny scenes, like when
the Josh Gad character tried to kiss Brenner on the lips, or when
Serena and Martha Stewart waved Eddie up at the end from the White
House window. But it was an easily understandable comedy. Lots of
reviews said there was no premise to the story, but there was. Lots of
stories from the 80's and 90's were conjured from the idea that the
capsule of human info sent from earth to space would be misinterpreted
by aliens from space and they would decide to destroy earth. It has
been used all the time as punchlines because back in the old days it
was the biggest risk when the capsule was first sent to space. I think
even a star trek movie was based on the same concept(look it up,not
sure about that one). Anyway, it was a good movie.Wouldn't go up for an
Oscar, but good for a lot of laughs, I liked it.
