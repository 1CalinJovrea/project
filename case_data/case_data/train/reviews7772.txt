Steaming pile of human excrement

Spike Lee should be ashamed of himself. This movie took an amazing
concept, script and an already amazing film, and took a big dump right
on top. Not that I'm all that surprised, Spike Lee has been churning out sh*t
movies for the last 20 years. As pretentious as this cat speaks, I
would hope that he would at least make an interesting movie once a
decade. It's been awhile Spike. Just sayin. We all loved the 90s from
you homey, but you have been turning dookie out for too long!Go to the original source (goes without saying), and while you're at
it, watch all of Park Chan Wook's films, he's an amazing filmmaker,
unlike this once original voice turned hack.
