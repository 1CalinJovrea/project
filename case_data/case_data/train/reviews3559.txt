Last Chapter (We Hope}

In Washington, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) is disputing
the Presidential election running against the New Founding Fathers'
candidate Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor). She claims that the NFFA
uses The Purge with economical purpose to get rid of poor and sick
people and is the favorite to win. The BFFA leaders plot a scheme
revoking the protection of government officials to kill Roan. Her chief
of security Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) uses his agents and snipers to
protect Roan, but there is a breach in the security system created by
two agents that betray Barnes and a paramilitary group breaks in the
house killing the loyal agents and snipers. However Barnes and Roan
succeeds in escaping but Barnes is shot on the shoulder. They are
captured by a group of Russian tourists and rescued by two locals that
are protecting a store. They call their friends and they decide to
protect the Senator until the next day. Will they succeed in protecting
Roan? "The Purge  Election Year" seems to be the last chapter of this
franchise; but the riot in the very end of this movie may be the
beginning of another sequel. The idea of the dystopian society is too
much imbecile and unrealistic. Therefore there are only funny and
violent situations to entertain the viewers. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "12 Horas Para Sobreviver - O Ano da Eleição" ("12
Hours to Survive- The Election Year")
