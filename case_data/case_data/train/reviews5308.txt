Trolls

Trolls is exactly what I expected it to be, good lighthearted fun. The
plot for the film is basic and very predictable but nothing really
worth criticsing since at the end of the day, it's just a fun film that
hopefully all the family can enjoy. At just over 80 minutes it passes a
bit of time. The animation is superb, really nice to look at with lovely vibrant
colours throughout the whole film. The songs were really catchy, some
moments even made me laugh out loud but overall it was just one of them
films that I happily sat and watched with a smile on my face. I like
animated films but most of the recent ones just aren't very good so I'm
pleased that I at least enjoyed this one. Also I don't do singing in
films (can't stand Frozen) but this one wasn't a constant song fest.The voice actors were very good, although most of them were easily
recognized without even looking at the cast list. Overall a solid first
film in which is more than likely going to end up as a franchise. Worth
checking out.7/10.
