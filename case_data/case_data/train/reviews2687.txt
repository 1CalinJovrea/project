True Gothic Horror

I don't normally write reviews but with all the horror films coming out
these days and so many opinions about them, I figured it was a good
time to start. I think there needs to be clarification about what type
of horror movie The Woman in Black really is. It is "Gothic Horror".
We, especially those of us in the US, have associate horror with blood,
guts and scary monsters. Gothic Horror is dark, suspenseful without the
great amount of blood and gore. I've grown up on horror films of all
kinds and it is rare that one will make me jump or feel creeped out
anymore but The Woman in Black did just that. From the opening scene of
the three little girls playing and to the end when, in a ending much
like "The Ring", you know it's not over I was engrossed and yes, I
jumped quite a few times. The dolls, which were period appropriate for
the children of that time, added a good amount of creepiness to this
dark story. The acting was well done. I was especially impressed by
Daniel Ratcliffe's performance. The location and scenery were very well
filmed. I highly recommend this movie, but be sure to go in with the
correct expectation. Sometimes the scariest things are not monsters but
the things that make us feel the most uncomfortable because we can
identify with them.
