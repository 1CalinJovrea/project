They tried but failed...

This was just awful.... tiresome, predictable and boring. I wanted to
love it, but there was nothing to even like. Top talent in every
category but it fell flat, like a souffl√© that did not rise. Satire
should be funny, but there were few laughs. Irony may be too
sophisticated to pull in an audience. It felt like something was just
off - timing? Editing? It dragged on and on without reason. So sad, it
coulda been a contender.
