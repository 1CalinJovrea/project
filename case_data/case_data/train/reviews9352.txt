American comedy

Is very refreshing to watch Scarlett Johansson in such a role. Reason
being why I decide to watch this film. The first 20 min of the film did
threw me off; after that it got better. Why? because there was actually
a plot, now you got my attention.Overall an OK comedy film. Please don't expect that much. I will
suggest this film if you want to get some laughs and you want to kill
some time.
