This movie made me happy

No really, it did. I couldn't believe how nice this movie made me feel
as I was watching it. The story is a pretty standard hero's journey,
but with the evil trolls or grendels or whatever eating happy trolls to
get happy themselves. It seemed a little dark at first, but everything
works out in the end of course, as this is a kids movie. It shows good
and bad in equal measure, which I believe is how we should educate
kids, not keep them in a bubble. The lessons it teaches are actually
nice, don't give up, persevere, happiness is within. The boy troll
(Timberlake) is so funny, especially in the beginning. Anna Kendrick is
hilarious with snappy dialogue. The songs are a bit old fashioned, the
fact that the writer is nostalgic really stands out. But they fit the
story, rather than being just music breaks, so it's good.
