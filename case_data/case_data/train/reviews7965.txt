Anthem For Doomed Youth

I remember being given this book as a set text for an English A-Level
examination over 30 years ago and am aware that there was a prestigious
BBC production of it also several years back but this is the first
dramatisation I've seen of Vera Brittain's novel documenting her own
experiences in that golden age of post-Edwardian pre WW1 England when
for coming-of-age birthdays you got given a piano from your father.
That's if you were a girl of course, her more musically gifted brother
conversely gets what she would have wanted, a scholarship at Oxford
although on the other hand he is also at the the prime age to be called
up for what he and most everyone else (but not their knowing father)
believes will be a short, heroic and clean war which of course it
turned out not to be (apart from the heroic part).Young Vera is headstrong, not only about wanting to make her own way in
a man's world (female emancipation was still years away), but later
about making her own contribution to the war effort by enrolling as a
nurse while her lover, brother and other male friends are fighting in
the trenches. Told wholly from her point of view, it's an entertaining
if not enthralling watch, beautifully shot and well acted if somehow
just lacking some extra pathos to really capture the hellish undertow
of the War to end all Wars.Alicia Vikander is appealing as the vaguely tomboyish, intellectual
Vera. In those days, it would appear, the golden youth had to be
chaperoned everywhere by a usually imposing maiden aunt figure and make
their feelings about each other known by writing and sending poems as
the film strives to contrast the idyllic pre-war days of carefree
swimming and carousing with the bleakness and destruction of war
itself. For me, I didn't feel the contrast quite sharply enough and my
abiding memories of the film are of the big family house and the
dreaming spires of Oxford rather than the hell of the makeshift
military hospitals and muddy and bloody trenches on the front line. The best shot for me was when I perhaps detected a tribute to all-time
great movie "Gone With The Wind" as Vera goes Scarlett-like amongst the
wounded and dying, searching for her wounded brother where the camera
ascends into a sweeping dolly shot showing the full extent of the
number of the casualties, just like Vincent Fleming's rightly famous
take all those years ago.The supporting actors are picked from the familiar directory of
experienced British character actors, notably Miranda Richardson and
Emily Watson, while the young actors in the leads, all of them
unfamiliar to me, perform with aplomb.There is a great true-life story to be told here and this film does so
respectfully and responsibly, if just a little too carefully at times.
