Sweet combination of story line, actor,actress,places and soundtrack!

This is a sweet combination of all factors in the movie; the actors,
the actresses, the choices of the places, the story plot, even the
soundtrack. I love every single of it. Expect to feel warm and
heartbroken at the same time in the movie. It's been says after
watching it, I still cant stop thinking about this movie. You'd better
watch it with someone who could provide a shoulder to cry on for you...
:)) My favorite (which seems to be everyone's favorite as well) is
during the wedding ceremony where Will seemed so alive again. My most
heart-breaking scene is when Will said "will you be here?" on the last
scene. That is when I burst into tears a lot. like A lot.
