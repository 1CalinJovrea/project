Total Re-gurgitation

I wish I could recall the last two hours of my life. I really thought
this movie would be fun - not good, mind you - but fun. A re-make of an
old classic with an even bigger budget, better actors, and today's
special effects would be worth 8 bucks. Plus Jessica Biel is sexy as
hell. I was rewarded for my rare optimism by poor acting (seriously,
the robots were more engaging); clich√© dialogue (at one point, the
villain actually said darkly, "Go handle it" to his henchman); and
unpredictable plot-turns (the audience was kept guessing what the hell
was going on). And these were all carefully scripted for the sole
purpose of getting to the next action sequence - none of which had
anything to do with the original movie. The only call-back to the
original title was the appearance triple-titted hooker. No need to
explain how the hell a regular human came to have these mammoth
milk-monsters, because there are three of them. I should have walked
out after they made their five-second cameo. I would have been happier.
