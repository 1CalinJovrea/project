Powerful movie.

This movie is great. It immediately engages and then keeps the
audience's attention. The story is compact, the acting strong and
ending plausible. Perhaps the strongest performance is that of Marie
Bello, who plays an emotionally disturbed woman. However, all of the
performances are outstanding. The movie succeeds in creating a mood of
foreboding as all are engaged in a fight for survival against an
unknown malevolent force. The movie avoids the pitfall of becoming just
another scary movie with contrivances that inspire laughter. Instead,
it succeeds in telling a story and building the tension to its
inevitable climax. That is the hallmark of excellent story telling and
why this movie is worth watching.
