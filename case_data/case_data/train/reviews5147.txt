Fans, bring your non-WoW playing family and friends.

Watched this movie in a IMAX 3D theater. The sound makes it well worth
seeing in a theater with a state of the art sound system. The Orcs are
believable from the start. Well rounded characters with great
motivation. The motion capture work by the actors was a work of
passion.Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer did a wonderful job playing the magic
wielding Mages. Perfect depth, effort and really showing the strain
magic has on the human body.Paula Patton did a fantastic job with Garona. Duncan Jones made a
compelling ass kicking female character. But more important for the fanboys, feel comfortable bring non-WoW
playing friends and families to the movie. All non-WoW movie goers seem
to enjoy the movie and really liked the CGI.
