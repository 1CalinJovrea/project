Nothing But Crap !!

This Movie is a complete waste of time and money .. I went to a couple
of dreadful movies such as " open water " and " Jumper " but this movie
was the best of beating them in all kinds of awfulness .. and for that
a friend of mine just couldn't stand watching it and just went out the
theater going for " Sherlock Holmes 2 " which was running in the
theater beside us although it was his SECOND TIME watching it !!I Admit that the visual effects was good comparing it to other bad
graphic movies but unfortunately it wasn't applied with a better story
.. the action and the thrill in the last half an hour was COMPLETELY
ruined by the shaky hand camera and the bizarre pauses and skipped
scenes were so Annoying . I Just need a 0 or .5 rating star in IMDb to give it to movies like
this oneFor God Sake .. DON'T WATCH THIS AWFUL MOVIE !!
