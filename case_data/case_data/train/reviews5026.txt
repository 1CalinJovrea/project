Way overrated. I walked out

First, a car wouldn't cruise by a stranded family trying to replace a
tire and not slow down. Second, even a kid would have instinctive
enough to not bolt out into the road when they're in the middle of
nowhere and there's a car coming, especially on a dirt road. Even
though the kid's on the far side of their handicapped car, she can hear
the car coming. All throughout the movie thereafter, the victim screams
only a portion of how much she ought to; it's like she's forgotten she
has vocal cords. And the unrealistically little screaming she DOES do
is never heard until it's too late. Everyone around her has
ridiculously selective hearing that it's like they're deaf until the
victim's already screwed. She also keeps turning her back on the doll
that's obviously creeping her out to death. The second girl's even
worse. She doesn't scream at ALL, just lets the spirit keep suspending
her. And not just that but why scram around to the top of your bunk
bed? Run out of the room! Get away! Last, it's so horror- typical for
only the areas right in front of a window with sun shining through to
be well-lit while every other spot around the house is dark, even
pitch-black.
