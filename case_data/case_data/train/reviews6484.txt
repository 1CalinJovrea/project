Heartwarming, and inspiring, with the dearest love story to lead the way.

Before you watch this movie you should hydrate, then get ready to open
the water works. Such a touching story, and it is just so well acted by
this cast of some very funny folks. I was completely caught off guard
by this movie, and sit here now very satisfied, and left completely
fulfilled. What you find under the wrapping is a fully epic movie that
spans years, and once again technology is used very well to mark very
simply for most of us the certain points in time, and culture. The
story opens up from such a small tale to one living, and breathing on
the much grander scale of the world. I Enjoyed every minute of this
movie you have to admit that you really hate Trystan Gravelle all of
the way through the story, but that just shows what talent is on
screen, and how well all of the characters are burrowed into your
heart. Recommended without any thought, and I think that anyone with a
choice, and this is on your list should jump at it, and you will not be
sorry.
