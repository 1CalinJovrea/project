The book was so GREAT........This movie was so terrible

This is really awful. There is so much wrong with this rubbish...one
could write a book about it. Mixing modern music with 1920s music? Hey
Baz Luhrmann (director)----cant you live without CGI and additional
nonsense??? The 1974 version was not great...........but it was in so
many ways much better than this drivel. Robert Redford was a real
Gatsby ...his use of the upper class language was 100% better than
DiCaprios .....who never got the Gatsby character (he was terrible).
Bruce Dern, Sam Waterston, Karen Black, Scott Wilson.....the 1974
supporting cast...... were far superior to this 2013 rabble. The
director Baz Luhrmannm came to Australia recently to promote this
insult to Scott Fitzgerald on the television media and said he was
retiring soon. He needs to. O.K.....Old Sport ?....Fitzgerald would
have hated this. He would have also disliked the 4 previous movie
attempts at this work. Leave Gatsby alone movie makers----or call in
the A team of directors. (and actors)
