Enjoy the ride, it's going to be fun.

If you're looking for a new age view on witches, a historically
accurate yarn or a film with a deep message, you're going to be
disappointed. If however you are looking for a wildly entertaining,
laugh out loud, over the top, gory action movie ...your search is over.
Hansel & Gretel is a lot of fun. The brother and sister from the Grimm
tale are all grown up and have been busy making a career out of Witch
hunting, capturing and killing their quarry in a variety of gory and
inventive ways. The arrival of a head witch and the imminent
fulfillment of a dark prophecy, force the siblings to uncover some
unpleasant truths from their past while ensuring the world remains safe
from darkness. It's not always cool to admit enjoying popcorn movies
any more. Even action movies have to hold a message or something to
elevate them beyond simple enjoyment. This film will never win awards,
even the leads expressed some misgivings, saying it was done purely to
pay a bill. Doesn't matter, after all isn't that why we little people
work? At the end of the day Hansel & Gretel does exactly what it says
it will and with style.
