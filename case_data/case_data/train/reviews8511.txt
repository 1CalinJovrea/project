Tough to watch... for all the right reasons

This film is tough to watch having lived through the housing crisis and
unemployment meltdown of 2007 to present. It inspires righteous
indignation and they are a lot of unlikable people that you encounter
throughout the film. Don't get the wrong impression, this film is an
absolute necessity on raw economics majors and even the fringe
behavioral economists.We now spend a tremendous amount of time discussing the poor leadership
and lack of responsibility that we encountered during that time period
but nothing of such gross negligence should escape unnoticed (according
to the film maybe it didn't).That it still shows that intelligent people will prosper even from the
most ignorant, gross misconduct is somewhat painful to watch.Generally speaking, these are the films that don't make a lot of
headway on the road to the Oscars but the cast is very stellar and is
undeniable in their efforts to bring the story life from a very real
point of view. Not shocking to me, Steve Carell turns in a superb
effort with a highly nuanced performance overall. I wish them all the
best on the road to the Oscars.Having lived through the time period, I never read the book but the
last 6 to 10 minutes of the film make your stomach hurt long after the
ending. If the point in cinema is to get a reaction or some sort of a
dialogue started this movie is highly successful.This movie may bore the poop out of kids through the mid- to late
20s... but it is a hot weapon against the machine for anybody who is
beyond that age range. Historical economic movies don't usually do well
at the box office but pick up a hellacious head of steam later on if
they're on target and this movie is.I recommend you catch it in theaters and have an interesting
conversation on the way out to the parking lot and beyond.
