Holy Crap!! Better Hide the Kids!

HOLY CRAP!!!! BETTER HIDE THE KIDS!!!! I watched this movie not
expecting much given the title. Boy my wife and I were in for a
Surprise!!! This was the best Horror movie I have seen in a while. This
movie went well beyond our expectations.This was a "Gutwrenching" wild ride of a true horror.I still cannot believe the carnage done to those sweet innocent kids!!!
I also found the story regarding the "origin" of "The Clown" an
interesting touch.The title although appropriate weakened my expectations a bit, so
perhaps they should have used a better title.This movie would have given me nightmares forever if I had seen it as a
kid!!!!! The acting was more than top notch, in that their reactions to
the horror before them was believable on so many levels Well done!
