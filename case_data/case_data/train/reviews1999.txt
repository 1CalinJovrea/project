Why!

I am a HUGE Will Ferrell fan as well as Zack G, so I can't really blame
myself for having high expectations. This movie was a complete
disaster. I don't like politics to begin with, and was hoping to get a
good laugh at them mocking politicians. They seemed like they would be
a comedy dream team, but I ended up laughing maybe a total of two times
in the entire (and seemingly never-ending) movie. I fell asleep at the
end, which I almost never do. I just gave up hoping for it to end up
being good. It literally seemed to drag on and on, and Will looked like
he knew it wasn't good and was trying hard to make up for it by pulling
out all his comedy bag of tricks. I don't know how this ended up into
such a terrible mess of a movie but I tell everyone that loves Will
Ferrell like I do to not watch it as it might ruin their opinion of
him.
