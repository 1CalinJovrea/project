10
Most original movie in 2016

FYI: I don't review a lot of movies, except when I feel like I need to
tell the world about how they would be missing out if they decided not
to watch it. That's how I feel about Demolition. Plus, I've never voted
for a 10/10.Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show, once more. His performance astounds me
in every single movie, and just when I thought, oh this may be the
first movie I'll watch where he'll disappoint; he does the opposite. I
also think that the trailer is way less exciting than the movie. This story is so honest, refreshing, naked, thrilling, and yet dreamy
at the same time. Most of the movie I was sort jealous of them, of the
way they are dealing with life. It's disturbing and quite wacky to be
honest, but still. The way Naomi Watts and Jake Gyllenhaal portray the
characters is phenomenal. Great casting. Also the kid does an amazing
job. This movie portrays how people are far from perfect, and not in a way
we've all seen before. It's original, moving, and a pleasure to watch.
