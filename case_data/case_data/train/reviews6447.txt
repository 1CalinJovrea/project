Great Movie and Story!!

During the early years of Nazi occupation of France in World War II,
romance blooms between Lucile Angellier (Michelle Williams), a French
villager, and Bruno von Falk (Matthias Schoenaerts), a German soldier.
Suite Francaise is based upon the very popular best seller and honestly
i don't know about the book but this film is fantastic the acting is
superb and i loved the story and how Lucile and Bruno started to fell
in love day by day another thing i liked was Bruno himself Schoenaerts
gave a terrific performance as a good German. The rest of the cast also
did great Kristin Scott Thomas, Sam Riley and Margot Robbie even
Lambert Wilson did great the only bad thing about the whole movie was
that some characters didn't got the screen time that they need it to
become even more interesting for example Margot's character should have
been more in the film in the cast she's 3rd but she is in the film
barely for around 5 or 6 minutes top even Kristin Scott Thomas should
have been more in the film in my opinion but still one hell of a great
film with a huge impact and that's for sure and that is why i'll give
Suite Francaise a 8/10.
