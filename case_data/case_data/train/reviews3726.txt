A movie you can't forget

Cinematic orgasm. Cinematic. Orgasm. Put the words together and
separately, it does not matter actually. I was watching the film with a
sense of bitten apricot in my mouth, so from time to time I kept
checking if indeed something was dripping from my lips . In any case,
you can feel all kinds of dripping in this garden of delight and from
many different angles. A deep diving into puberty, into the raw desires
of youth, above the thunderous victory of human need. Adele is the
personification of youth, just in time when it begins to grown. That
exact moment when the juices of love are instantly aggressive and the
human body seems like a fruit with the heart as a kernel. When you are
in the midst of immortality, gaining the illusion of eternity, just
before the fruit is eaten, shortly before the kernel sits at your neck
with the bitter taste of rejection, while you greedily swallow life,
which seems so inexhaustible. I left my local cinema with the feeling
of a hot lump in my throat and stomach. As a teenager in love and
disappointed at the same time. And from that moment I keep seeing
little hearts and stars everywhere. I keep seeing Adele everywhere.
