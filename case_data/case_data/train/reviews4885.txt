A Disney dystopia, what rubbish

There's nothing more annoying than a movie that sets itself in a
dystopia and then has a bunch of pretty people running around doing
unbelievable things. Maybe if I was a third grader I would appreciate
this fantasy but as an adult it was torture to watch.This movie would need some serious surgery to actually pass as
something I could make all the way through. I didn't make it all the
way through by the way. The casting, direction and writing would all
have to be redone. Basically, throw it all out and start over.
Otherwise, this could possibly work as a Yahoo TV movie.File this one in the folder of movies that think the audience is dumb
and will just be wow'd by ridiculous action and young heroes. So
annoying and such a waste of my time.
