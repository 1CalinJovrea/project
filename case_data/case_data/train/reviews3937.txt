the worst film ever

first of all after watching the trailer i was really looking forward to
this film...and after suffering it i honestly believe this is the worst
film i have ever watched in my life..i would have awarded it zero
points out of 10 on this site but the minimum has to be one point.the acting is diabolical, none more so than the fella who directed
it... the story is all over the place the dialog is embarrassing... the
action is laughable and far too hurried and blurry.. the music is out
of place, and felt like rza was only putting it in the film to sell his
records.. it had every clich√© in the book not once do you feel for any
of the characters...the whole film is just one big ego trip for RZA
which fails in every departmentit is not a fun movie like the director deluded himself is...it's not
cool either as you haven't got a clue what is going on!..let alone
understand half the actors..don't waste your time on this garbage, and god forbid RZA ever gets the
chance to do another film....AVOID AT ALL COSTS
