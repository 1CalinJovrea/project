Disappointed

As the film is titled 'Jackie' you expect to learn more about her
through the film, it should have been called 'JFK's widow one week
following his assassination'. This is a woman who was powerful and had
a background, a life, buried two babies. All we get from this film is a
portrayal of a grieving, often selfish and self absorbed woman who
smokes and drinks too much. Who wouldn't fall to that after something
as traumatic? The film is flat and bland, it gives us no indication of
the type of woman she was, her role in white house (aside from her
expensive renovations and insistence on a huge funeral for her husband)
We see nothing of her personal achievements. Natalie Portman and the
excellent cast's acting skills are the only interesting thing to watch.
Disappointing and does 'Jackie O' no justice at all.
