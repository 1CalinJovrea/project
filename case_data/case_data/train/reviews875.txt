Most enjoyable movie for me.Thanks for giving me joy marvel.I really needed it

Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi
gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents,
especially Hemsworth and Blanchett, who are rarely seen having so much
fun. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa
Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty
hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard. Overall, the film
benefits from its director's distinct style and measured irreverence,
giving Thor a welcome boost of vitality.
