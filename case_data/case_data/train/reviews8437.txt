Just Plain Awful

What a disaster. What a boring disaster. Finding a spider in my bed
would have been more exciting than suffering through this sophomoric
and predictable flick. I love Liam Neeson and I respect him as an
actor. For whatever reason, he has chosen to stick to fast paced action
movies instead of dramas and that's fine by me, but this mess of a
movie left me speechless with all its inconsistencies and plot holes.-Julianne Moore goes out of her way to comfort Neeson during take-off
because he's nervous but when he asks her what she does for a living
she says she flies a lot and has to get some rest.-When Neeson confronts the other air marshal in the lavatory he tells
Neeson 'We can split the money' but never gets a chance to explain
before Neeson kills him.-In the beginning of the flight Neeson duct tapes the hands of the guy
who asks him for a 'light' at the airport and the guy is able to slip a
phone into another passengers pocket, yet Neeson kept receiving text
messages throughout the flight, while said phone was supposedly in the
pocket of an unsuspecting passenger? -Neeson becomes suspicious of Julienne Moore and asks her again what
she does and she goes into this long story about how she had heart
surgery and likes the window seat,but never answers the question.-There's a passenger on the plane who can send a signal to the phone
that's been sending all the messages to help Neeson locate it, but when
Neeson gets the phone he does not use this tech savvy passenger to help
him hack the password, instead him and Moore play with phone and
eventually set off the timer for a bomb concealed in the other air
marshal briefcase.I can go on and on with all the ridiculous and inconsistent plots but
why bother. This movie has already made its fair share of money and
that's all the studios are concerned with.
