Beautiful on so many levels

Take a child to see this beautifully made, thoughtful, animated
feature. I went by myself, but the theater was full of children, and
their laughter at the myriad slapstick humor added so much to the
experience. Which is better;staying safe or taking risks? This is the
premise of "The Croods" as the Crood family and Guy, a newcomer,
experience tectonic plate shifts and other violent geologic events
together. Interspersed with these big changes, though, are Eden-like
ecosystems where the colors are vibrant and inviting. Emma Stone,
Nicholas Cage, and Ryan Reynolds are perfectly cast. I will be buying
this movie when it comes to DVD.
