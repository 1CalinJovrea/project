Horror ? Not in this film. Not even thrills and chills

I have watched many many scary movies, some good some bad, none truly
scary. Anyone who reviewed this film as scary or awesome obviously has
not seen the film. This is a complete snore-fest, from start to finish.
I saw perhaps 3 "jump out of seat" scenes where it was totally
predictable on it and was yawning each time. The conjuring was a
terrific film, and this one is just trying to score big bucks off that
name with 1/4 the budget. I was left feeling angry and cheated. There
was no depth, no character relation, no story-line, nothing to get you
even remotely into the film, except "saw the previews, this is gonna be
so good !" feeling you saw when you watched the previews and couldn't
wait for this to come out. A complete letdown in all aspects except the
fact it actually ended and I could go do something else.
