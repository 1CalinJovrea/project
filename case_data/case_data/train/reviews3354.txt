Absolutely Jaw-Dropping

Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one
bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all
together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a
good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly
realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and
what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127
minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast,
you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot
of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film
switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at
the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of
animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects
in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for
the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor.
An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and
I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too.
9/10. Worth it.
