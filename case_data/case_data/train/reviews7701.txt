Not Up To Predecessors

While the folks as Disney/Pixar don't have anything to worry about
quite yet, the creative minds behind the Lego Movie franchise have
created a nifty little enterprise for themselves.After "The Lego Movie" in 2014 became a surprise hit, earning $469
million on a budget of $60 million, and "The Lego Batman Movie" this
year did nearly as well, the folks at Denmark's The Lego Group found
themselves with a solid foothold in the animated movie business. The Lego Group's signature product, of course, is their line of toys,
the colorful and seemingly-indestructible plastic bricks children can
use to design and build virtually anything. Lego bricks have since
their introduction in 1949 become a worldwide phenomenon, actually
replacing Ferrari in 2015 as the world's most powerful brand name.The creative minds behind the Lego movies so far are navigating with
remarkable grace the razor-thin line which separates silliness from
camp, and archness from innocence. And they're doing it by somehow
channeling the undiluted wonder of a child's infinite imagination and
combining it with the elbow-in-the-ribs, wiseguy brand humor of the
animators at the Warner Bros. studios, the creators of Bugs Bunny, the
Road Runner, and dozens of other beloved characters."The Lego Ninjago Movie" is the first Lego production to be based on a
specific Lego product instead of a genre or a character, and therefore
bears the faint scent of commercialism. Such an enterprise has worked
quite well, however, for the Walt Disney organization, which has built
entire film franchises around individual attractions at their theme
parksthe "Pirates of the Caribbean" film series after five
installments has earned a worldwide total of nearly $4.5 trillion.Opening in 4047 theaters across the country, "The Lego Ninjago Movie"
was expected to earn over $27 million during its opening weekend, but
due to lackluster ticket sales the picture actually finished with a
little over $21 million in gross earnings. The picture has received a 53% average approval rating from 64 reviews
included on the Rotten Tomatoes website, and an average audience rating
of B-plus from CinemaScorefairly undistinguished by Lego Movie
standards, but still eminently respectable for an animated motion
picture."The Lego Ninjago Movie," with a PG rating from the MPAA, is suitable
for all audiences...and recommended for most.
