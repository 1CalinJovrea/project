It's an OK movie; don't go to the cinema with high expectations

Sadly, a step down from Man of Steel. First of all, I was a bit
skeptical about this movie, and thought the runtime (about 2 and a half
hours) was way too long (and I wasn't completely wrong though). The
action scenes were better than what we saw in the trailer. Although the
doomsday scenes had terrible CGI (you'll know it when you'll see it),
but overall I was happy. The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it
was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn't
know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and
I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than
what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet
to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up.
He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect and
has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything
nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen. Other
than that, I think there are some fan-boys who'll be satisfied no
matter how bad the movie is. Hope my review didn't give away any
spoilers in any way whatsoever, and that you end up enjoying the movie
as much as (or more than) I did.
