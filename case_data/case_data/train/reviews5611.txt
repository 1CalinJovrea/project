Better than I thought it would be

Antman. When I first heard about the plans for this movie I laughed to
myself and thought, "How can becoming smaller be cool?" Sure enough,
Marvel has surpassed my expectations and turned something I thought
would be lame and uninteresting into something hilarious and actually
pretty cool. I'm not going to include any spoilers, but I will say the
fighting style of Antman is much better than I thought it would be. I
learned a lot about the story as well as the abilities he has. Antman gets much more interesting when doing combat. The ability to
shrink and grow at will is something Marvel has gotten very creative
with. The language in this film is good enough for my young children to
watch. There are no F or GD bombs to ruin the mood and the moment with
the family. I'd say I'd surely watch it again.
