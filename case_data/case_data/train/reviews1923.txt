if the original was solid, then this is movie diarrhea

This stuff is right up my alley too. But, 22 Jump Street is a shred of
the original,.. a terribly written, unfunny mess of a sequel.FOr me it instantly becomes one of the, imo, most-painfully- overrated
movies on this sight. This film doesn't deserve to see the light of a
6-point-something rating, let-alone a 7-pt-something... No chemistry
between the characters... everything that made me think the original
was mindless hilarity, is painfully absent here.Definitely pass on this one. FIne with turning the rehashed idea into a
self-aware, template sequel, but the omission of "laughter" seals the
deal for this piece of junk.I love stupid comedies, I love sex romps, buddy comedies, AND I really
enjoyed the first one, but this film is as bland as an unsalted, plain
baked potato. The best thing for me to do is forget this was ever made
and watch the original a few years down the road.Painful.that would be my one word review if I could have left one.38/100 Will go down as one of the worst of the year without question.
OUt of about 35-40 2014 releases I've seen so far - this is probably
the second worst film I've seen, and in terms of disparity from the
IMDb score... something is rotten in denmark... 7.3? I'm at a loss.
Terrible, terrible movie. Expect a slow, but steady decline into
6.5-land, and it doesn't deserve that.To think that this now sits next to "Anchorman"(7.3),and
"Swingers"(7.4) on the career ratings, is simply dumbfounding... a
little disturbing actually. Another reviewer said 'lazy film-
making'... that sums up the issue with this.
