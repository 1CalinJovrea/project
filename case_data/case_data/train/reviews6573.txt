Loved this movie

For the first time in many, many years with this movie I was taken away
from the problems in my life and went to a place where those things
didn't register anymore. It was almost magical. I had to keep reminding
myself about the bad things in real life, but then a new robot vs
monster battle happened and all the sudden that didn't matter any more.
Total escapism done with excellent design attention and detail. Thank
you GDT. You have to be an artist and a science fiction geek to
appreciate this. I came out of the movie and realized all my problems
were still there but I was also hearing the theme music in my head. Got
the DVD now and I escape that way. Channel your inner six year old,
lean back and enjoy.
