'Predestination' deserves more recognition.

I feel like sometimes great movies don't get enough recognition, films
like Prisoners, Enemy, or Predestination. This film impacted me heavily, and it kept me thinking and thinking
about it for a week after I saw it. Ethan Hawke gave a great
performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do "The
Purge", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in
her role.One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was
going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies
make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the
cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were
outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect.My only complaints are that the movie's first act was a little slow.
However, as the film progresses into the second and third act, the long
first act is absolutely necessary. If it was a little shorter, it
would've worked so well. Confusing? Yes. Enjoyable? Big time. If you can see Predestination, definitely do so. 8/10
