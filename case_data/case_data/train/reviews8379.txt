A very good, very Spielberg motion picture, starring Tom Hanks.

This movie hit me really strangely.I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed
it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of
Spies to be so humorous. The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just
sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal,
was a great performance by Tom Hanks.Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an
average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets
caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him
off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals
were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his
last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James
Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being
completed. Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming
situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly
enjoyable. Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between
Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge
of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining.
