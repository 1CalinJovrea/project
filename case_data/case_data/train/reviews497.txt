Why? Oh why?

How deep has Antonia Banderas fallen? He has been never the archetypal
action star - but an off-beat action hero. Here he tries to be the
first, and just fails.The story is really weak sauce. He is looking for a low paid job - but
there is no real indication, why he is separated from his wife and his
child. The rest is a rather typical set up.The characters are pretty weak, there is no back story or no real
character build up of most of them. The action - on the surface
actually not bad - in depth pretty weak as well. When do directors
understand, that we don't want to see people shooting with almost
unlimited ammunition (and if the "gun is empty" the hero is throwing
it?). When do they understand, that a soldier would never gun with an
assault rifle (or a PDW) in one hand and with an semi-auto in the
other? Or when do they understand, that sliding on the knees and
shooting with both hands in different direction, is not really what
anyone wants to see? This stereotypes even become "old" if e.g.
Sylvester Stallone is doing it. But worse, if anyone else attempts
that. Overall the set up would actually have a lot of potential. Even if we
would only get some "reasonably real" action. Instead, it is a B-movie,
with two known faces (and we don't know, why Antonio Banderas and Ben
Kingsley signed up for this movie? Was it a lost bet? Or are they both
totally broke???Nowadays even "normal" TV shows are better made (without that much star
power). It seems that the producer and director, just focused
completely on Banderas and Kingsley, which did a rather woody
performance. With more details and more preparation and a better story,
this could have been definitely rather entertaining - unfortunately it
wasn't at all that. Just disappointing!
