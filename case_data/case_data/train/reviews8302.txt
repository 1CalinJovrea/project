Worst one ever

The film was awful and extremely boring. It was just so depressing and
sadness was possibly the most annoying character ever conceived...why
why why did she have to keep touching things after she was told over
and over not to, just irritating. It got to the point where I was
dreading the character coming on the telly. Animated Disney/pixar films
should stick to what they are good at and that's making children (and
adults) happy. Yes they can have a moral lesson and sad bits but the
general overtone is happiness not depressing characters inside another
depressing character that I couldn't care less about. Should never have
been made, should have saved their money. Im very sad that I can never
get back the time I wasted on it...I could have watched paint dry.
