Punches all my buttons: segregation, space, engineering, computers

I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during
the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an
early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV.
I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for "colored" but
they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were
there and I knew it. This movie, "Hidden Figures," brings all of these
worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA
didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the
ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this
movie feels real. Very real.The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one
of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA
Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human
"computers" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers
right. As "colored" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse)
restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not
America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the
time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just
before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when
resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as
the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become
widespread.There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights
perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the
early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived
during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later,
see this movie to see what things were like.
