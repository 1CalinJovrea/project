Pleasant Surprise.

Well, okay. First of all, I've seen Chris Evans grow into this
ethereal/refined actor (London being his turning point, in my humble
opinion) and I couldn't imagine he was going to do such a good job
directing. I watched this expecting nothing cause I get disappointed
easily, but if I had any kind of expectations, they would've been
exceeded. The storyline is original - we all dream about meeting that
one stranger that's going to turn your life around and end up finding a
soul mate... but I've never seen it quite like this. It's a script that
takes your heart on a little ride until it breaks a bit. You've found
her/him, yet, they're not yours to keep. Ouch. But, it's an experience
that'll live with you forever. I hope this is not the last I see of
Chris as a director. Great expectations have been placed on his back.
