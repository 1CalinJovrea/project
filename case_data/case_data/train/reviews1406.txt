Barely tolerable

Normally I really enjoy movies written by Simon Pegg. I especially
liked Shaun of the Dead and Paul. This movie really stumbled.Remember that scene in Shaun of the Dead in which they decide the best
thing to do is head toward a pub and defend themselves from the zombie
horde from there? This movie makes that idea its central theme,
changing the zombies into some sort of alien robots, and multiplying
the pubs. That's it.Paul had me laughing out loud every minute or two, and I never get
tired of watching it. The World's End gave me just a couple of chuckles
throughout the film. And I almost nodded off several times.The setup before the robots appeared was too long and tedious, and
after the robots appeared I couldn't quite understand why our
characters kept running from pub to pub. And worse, I didn't much care.It just wasn't silly enough, witty enough, or clever enough to hold my
attention.
