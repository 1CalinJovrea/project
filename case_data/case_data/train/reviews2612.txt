This is the story of the Boston Bombing. We are introduced to a number
of characters in quick fashion and to Tommy Saunders (Mark Wahlberg) a
composite character used a a conduit for story continuity. The bombing
occurs 26 minutes into the film and the rest of the film concentrates
on locating the evil doers who made gross mistakes. What I found
surprising was the initial encounter with the police. It was a lot more
horrific than what was covered on the news. The production was able to
splice in actual footage.In spite of using a composite character, the film was very accurate and
emotional.Guide: F-word (It's Boston). No sex or nudity.
