suspension of disbelief

I can understand if you do not like the so-called 'found footage'
films, for example; Blair Witch and Cloverfield. I must admit, some of
them work, some of them don't. Cloverfield worked for me, but only on
the big screen in a cinema. Blair Witch worked for me, but only on a
small PC monitor. Some things work better depending on the way you view
these things, but also, what works with one person, will not work with
another, everybody is different.With that out of the way, let me honestly try to convince you that my
small review on this film is mainly based on its merits, and not just
what I enjoy personally.I think the credit is due to the effort that went behind making this
film, because even though each of the video tapes the guys find and
watch are very strange and hard to swallow, they have genuinely tried
hard to convey a sense of realism. But it also helps if the viewer made a little effort, and suspended
your disbelief in order to get into the film. Some people can do this
easier than others. If your a horror fan, this will entertain at the
very least. Each of the five found tapes start off innocently enough
like home movies, but each one reveals shocking footage of something
strange or unravels into a horrifying ordeal. It reminded me of 'Tales
of the unexpected' or 'The Twilight Zone' but with the use of a
hand-held camera instead.Again, it'll either work for you or it wont. But the makers of this
film tried hard and kudos to them. The effects were great, the acting
was as expected, just as in any 'found footage', if its going to convey
realism, its NOT going to have Oscar worthy acting, don't forget these
are meant to be 'real' people. And the stories behind each tape were
all entertaining.In the end then, before you watch it, heres some top tips; Turn the
lights out. Keep telling yourself that what you are watching is 'real'.
Open your mind. And enjoy.
