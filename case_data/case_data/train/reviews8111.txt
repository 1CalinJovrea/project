Disappointed with the changed ending

specially Created my first account to tell Sony what the hell they have
doneEnding was the biggest let down When you expect the movie to actually
show virus being released as compared to the clich√© plot of virus being
contained in the last moment , it is disappointing and waste of money
to be let downIrfan Khan was wasted while Felicity Jones was expressionlessFor Book lovers it would definitely be a letdownEmotion building was missing, and it was too fast paced that made it a
let down.... If you are reading this avoid Inferno...
