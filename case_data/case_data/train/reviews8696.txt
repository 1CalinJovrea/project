Bolivar Trask was Right

Ordinary people do not matter. In many ways this film apes the way that
people who belong to minorities have more rights than everyone else and
think they can do whatever the hell they like.In this film the mutants have nearly been wiped out by robot Sentinels
built by humans and programmed only to kill people with the mutant X
gene. Yet is makes it clear in the dystopian future the movie starts in
that these Sentinels also kill ordinary people, which makes no sense
whatsoever.Like a lot a time-travel movies, it has daft plot holes and doesn't
care about consistency. Towards the film's climax, serial murderer
Magneto manages to get the anti-mutant robots to obey him by using his
powers to put steel inside them. Okay, that would allow his powers to
work on these things, but he wouldn't be able to give them orders,
that's just dumb, but he does when it suits the meandering plot.Over long, overly serious and ultimately disappointing. The effects are
good, but they're the usual high end computer Paint Box fare that are
blatantly not actually there.If you're easily impressed and don't care about logic or any
characterization or depth, you may still enjoy this.
