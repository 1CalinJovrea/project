Writer/Director Peter Berg Takes Police Work to the next Level

PPs (police procedurals) are a staple of the film/TV industry and are
(believe it or not) as common as comedies or romcoms. However, within
that category, "big" PPs based on big crimes are not that common. In
fact, you would have to go back to the early 70s when a number of "big
PPs" like Day of the Jackal 1973 were all the rage.So, a film like this done properly (and, trust me, this one is done
perfectly) would be a treat all by itself. However, what makes this
film extra-special is the extensive use of video footage.Now, to be clear, video footage as a plot device is not new by itself.
It is now, and has been used extensively in British film and TV
because, as we all know, London is the most "surveyed" city on the
planet.But -- the point -- nothing the Brits have ever done with the forensic
use of video comes even close to what Berg brings us in this excellent
film. Much the same way that the original creators of CSI-Vegas
introduced an entirely new sort of sub-genre, it can be argued that
Patriots Day similarly has taken the police procedural to an entirely
new level.The film itself? Brilliant! Berg has taken a stellar group of A-listers
and make them work as a team, mirroring on the subliminal level the
theme of the movie, which is both positive, and hopeful, and suggests
that if we all work together, we can accomplish pretty much anything.
