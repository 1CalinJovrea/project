unrealistic romantic flick; cute through

If you're in for a light watch, click the play button right away.well, but for those who make their romantic picks very sparingly, I'd
say this movie falls short in being able to develop into an ending that
one can treat as satisfyingly "happily ever after".the whole story setting is of high-school romance. the lead
actress(Bianca) has a crush for a guitarist/musician which settles as a
sufficient persuasion to warrant all love-striken drama. However,
slowly as the story unfolds, suddenly on an eventful date night, which
she has been so wishfully waiting for, Bianca's love for poor guitarist
wears off and she falls in love for her friend/neighbor(Wesly) dude who
helped her with some dating tips and makeover advice.But wait, Bianca's newly found love just doesn't seem settling for
viewers, since the story hasn't given them those handful "take the
breath away" love moments. More so, because of which, Wesley's walk-off
on his beautiful ex-girlfriend's rekindled romance, just seems so
unfair for the poor lady.Overall this story could have benefited in developing some characters
deeper, so that viewers could have empathized with their emotional
u-turns.
