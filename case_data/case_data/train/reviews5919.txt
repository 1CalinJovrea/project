Too dark for its own good

I went into this movie with hope and optimism and not put off by the
negative light shone towards it. An hour and 40 minutes later, I left
feeling empty and unsatisfied. Comic book films are supposed to make
you feel inspired, but not this one. So what is wrong with it? One word  chemistry. In any superhero
team/ensemble there should be great character interactions and a
feeling that these guys can effectively make a team, never mind a
''fantastic'' team. The best team movies all have characters playing
off each other as in the Avengers and X-Men.  However, there is zero
chemistry between any of the F4. We see an attempt at some early
romance between Reed and Sue which doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Storm is
billed as a genius but troubled kid however we never see why he has a
high IQ, he is just shifted in to make up the numbers. We never see him
form any sustainable bond with any of the others. Ben Grimm also
appears as an outsider, brought in with little sense to the project to
fill the final slot. The chemistry between the original F4 (2005) was
MUCH better whereas here they feel like 4 individuals.  The climatic battle takes place in the most boring environment that you
can imagine. It is over within 10 minutes, with not much ingenuity to
overcome a half decent attempt at Dr Doom, who at first seems very
intimidating. This film will be quickly forgotten and the question
isn't whether a sequel will be made or whether it will cross over with
X-Men, but is the original Fantastic 4 film a better watch than this
depressing, dull comic book movie. Final score 5.5/10
