Waste of time at its finest

This is my new "worst movie ever". I was pretty sure that da hip hop
witch would always be at the bottom but this one is even worse. If you
want to troll your friends tell them to see Ghost Story and check their
reaction later. Also 95% of the movie's budget was for hiring positive
reviews because there is no other explanation for its current
rating.Too bad i can't rate below 1.
