I Wish this movie had never been made...

With the release of this big turd, there may not be much hope left for
the horror genre. "Wish Upon" is just awful. Unoriginal, unscary,
unmoving; well, it's just as I stated: AWFUL. Really whiny poor girl finds a Chinese "wish box." As this movie would
have it, she's also taking a high school course in Chinese. She can
make out just enough of the calligraphy on the box to realize she will
be granted seven wishes. What she can't translate, however, is the
grave warning on the box. Oooohhhhh, I'm scared. Anyway, she wishes
away, people die, but she still keeps wishing. After using her final
wish, she thinks she's in the clear...but she's wrong.The movie failed on just about every level imaginable. It might work
for a group date of 13 year-olds, but it won't scare anyone else. Hell,
it's not even a given it would scare the 13 year olds. Rated PG-13 for a better box office, this one is a complete waste of
time.
