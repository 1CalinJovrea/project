Flawless film about the first summer of the war in France

What a strange feeling it must be to wake up one morning in familiar
surroundings where nothing is familiar anymore This film captures what
it was like to live under occupation in France during the early months
of the war. It is a captivating story about Lucille, a soft- hearted
woman played by Michelle Phillips, whose husband is a prisoner of war.
She lives with her severe, controlling mother-in-law, played by Kristin
Scott Thomas. The two of them are in the middle of collecting rents
from their tenants when the war suddenly comes to town. Over the next
few months everything these people thought they knew about themselves
and each other changes. German officers are billeted out to homes of
villagers, some of whom vindictively write letters denouncing
neighbours or accuse sympathizers of liaising with Germans. While
Lucille discovers the truth about her husband she begins to fall in
love with the sensitive German officer who lives under their roof,
until the self-centred mayor's wife sets in motion a series of events
that rips the town apart.At the end of the film a synopsis about the author is given that is
difficult to read -- this film is based on an unfinished manuscript by
Irène Némirovsky, a Ukranian Jew who died in Auschwitz. The hand
written pages were rediscovered by her daughter in the bottom of a
suitcase and published in 2004. This is a tale of everyday people trying to cope in their
unrecognizable world. It is both heart wrenching and beautiful to
watch. It is also one of the most authentic films I have ever seen of
this era. Every aspect of this film's art direction, from costumes and
hairstyles to sets and streetscapes captures occupied France in the
summer of 1940 better than any film I have ever seen.
