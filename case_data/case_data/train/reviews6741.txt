Rock n Roll Vampires

One knows that a Jim Jarmusch movie about vampires is not going to be
like any other vampire film. In fact it would be unkind to class this
as a vampire movie. Only Lovers Left Alive is a highly stylized and
atmospheric film bemoaning the passing of the great rock n roll and
Hippy era. Here we have a vampire couple (Swinton & Hiddleston - both
excellent and perfectly cast) living an isolated life in an abandoned
house in Detroit, USA. Hiddleston used to be a famous rock n roll
artist who has become a recluse collecting old guitars and records.
They survive by purchasing blood samples from a corrupt doctor. We also
have one of their old vampire friends (John Hurt) living in Tangiers
where the blood is specially pure. Things take an unexpected turn when
Swinton's mischievous sister (Mia Wasikowska) visits them. Only Lovers
Left Alive has cult film written all over it. The music is great too
and blends perfectly with the atmosphere. Essential for Jarmusch fans
and recommended to others too!
