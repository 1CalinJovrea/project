10
Deserves an 8, but gave it a 10....

... to balance out all the users who don't seem to look beyond trailers
when they go to see a movie. I mean, did these people even read
anything about this motion picture before seeing it? It's by Aronofsky,
the guy who made Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan... I mean, were
people expecting Ouija? Mother! isn't perfect, but it's damn
interesting, funny, disturbing and entertaining. It's audaciously
resistant to current Hollywood conventions, and it's oozing with
themes, metaphors, allusions, and symbols. The performances are great,
the camera-work incredible, and the whole experience a carnival of
filmmaking verve. It doesn't carry any kind of real dramatic weight,
but it leaves one with lots to think about. If you're really a movie
fan, ignore the naysayers and check it out.
