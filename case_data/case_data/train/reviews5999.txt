Excellent Film, Awful Camera Work

The efficient LAPD Police Officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and
Mike Zavala (Michael Pe√±a) are partners and best friends. Mike is
married with Gabby (Natalie Martinez), who is pregnant, and Brian is
having a serious love affair with Janet (Anna Kendrick). Brian has the
intention of making a movie and is using a handy cam to film his daily
work with his partner, under the protest of his colleague Van Hauser
(David Harbour). After killing a powerful gangster in self-defense,
they are transferred by Sarge (Frank Grillo) to South Central Los
Angeles where there is a war between black and Mexican gangs. When Mike
and Brian arrest a gangster and find a great load of drugs and people
involved in human-trafficking, they are sentenced to death by the
Cartel and hunted down by a Mexican gang. What will happen to them?"End of Watch" is an excellent film, showing the story of two
charismatic police officers patrolling the streets of South Central Los
Angeles in their daily work and personal lives, since they are best
friends. Despite the great storyline, the execution uses the annoying
"found footage" cheap style, maybe with the intention of giving the
idea of documentary using an awful camera work. The film is realistic
and the conclusion is heartbreaking. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Marcados para Morrer" ("Marked to Die")
