Born again to reach the sky.

I definitely did not expect it. It's a biographical-sport-drama, that
tells an inspiring story of a talented young American boxer who faced
the biggest setback in his career after met with a car crash. The
remaining parts focused on how he struggles to come back, while
recovering from the serious injury.The biggest advantage was the cast. I particularly liked Miles Teller
in the lead role. His recent rise in the Hollywood was phenomenal and
this one is his another must watch film. Even the supporting cast and
roles were awesome. If you are a boxing/sports film fan, you will love
it. But there is sufficient drama in the tale to build an impressive
storyline.Feels like it is under-appreciated, and being a Hollywood film, the
recognition was too poor. In the coming days, years, it will reach the
largest audience coverage. From this film, the director is the one who
gained big. Surely he should make use of its success to his next films.
Because I'll be expecting much better and bigger than this. This film
is one of the best of the years, so don't miss it.8/10
