Action movie that felt like an episode of a TV show

No Michael, just some crazy kid who looks like a girl from 'The Curse'.
Only one kiss (in flashback!), one semi-Sexy naked Selene scene, and
that's all 'eroticism' in there. The whole script was probably like 10
pages and half of it was pain grunts. The police, the time frame, the
afraid vampires - poor confused story. Bloody, some killing methods
were hilarious. 3D worked really well with all the jumping, walking on
walls, blood on camera, fire, etc. They left the story very open at the
end and that's why it felt like an episode of a TV show also the movie
seemed very short, expect more Underworld movies if this one makes
profit. But I got to see it for free and free is always good! :)
