I knew I'd like it, didn't expect to love it!

With casting like this I knew I was going to like the film -- what I
didn't expect was the incredible writing, directing, and soundtrack! I
loved this movie! The complexity of everyday modern life is brought out
with some of the best subtle yet revealing dialog that deftly weaves
the past, present, and future of a variety of very relatable
characters. The story is about the inevitable conflicts and inter-
connectedness of families and community and that it is possible to
resolve problems with honesty and acceptance -- and time. This is the
kind of movie that doesn't leave you with all the answers at the end,
but does leave you with the impression that characters are all on the
right track.
