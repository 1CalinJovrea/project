Just don't...

SPOILERS! Just saw this movie. Like Avengers 2, if you love bad jokes
and don't have a brain you'd probably enjoy it. This movie was PACKED
with bad scenes, story, small-talk and "hot- angles" of hunks and a
petite girl. This movie is truly for small minded people. If there was a way to get my money back after seeing a movie I'd do
that in this case. I almost left the theatre half way through (I only
stayed because I payed for the junk). Even if I downloaded this movie
for free on piratebay I would just stop 15 minutes into the movie and
delete the file.What happened with Guy Ritchie? I love his old movies and are a big fan
of even buying them to see again, but this movie? Really? It's like
Apple after the death of Steve Jobs. It's just Hollywood trying to milk
a dead cow.This movie is like a soft-porn where you have two hunks, where one of
them wants to nail the petite teen (Alicia Vikander) but with clothes
on. The other guy are nailing every other girl in the movie even if
they're enemies and you're not even seeing the scenes. There are no
real connection in the acting and are just "hot" people but into a
movie to cash in on the publics interests of sex, without sex. It's
sooooo boring. I got a bit of panic cause there are just nothing in
this movie that was interesting, funny, hard-to-figure- out, or
anything... It's simply 116 mins of waste of time. I'd even watch
PewDiePie before this. (and trust me I hate him as well)I do not recommend you to watch this peace of junk. I guess I have to
wait for The Hateful Eight to see a REAL Hollywood class movie again.
All love to Tarantino so far since he and very few others still have a
soul for movie-making and are not falling under the roof of milking the
dead cow.
