Taut, thrilling and surprising empathetic

What a stunning film - the imminent threat of deadly violence tempered
with the tragic circumstances that drive people to such desperate
actions made for a very human story.If Hanks is nominated for an Oscar for this, then Barkhad Abdi deserves
a nomination too, because their scenes together were electric - never
once did Abdi appear the junior party, every bit Hank's equal as two
cunning foes trying to outfox one another.The best lines in the film were perhaps when Phillips beseeched of
Muse: "Surely there's something other than fishing and kidnapping
people you could do?" To which Muse replied, sombrely: "In America, maybe".It's a must see, the best film I've seen this year.
