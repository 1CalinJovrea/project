An exorcism is in a young girl's future.

This feature from Lionsgate is not just creepy; it is damn right scary.
Clyde(Jeffrey Dean Morgan)and Stephanie(Kyra Sedgwick)Brenek are
finalizing their divorce; Clyde gets his two daughters Em(Natasha
Calis)and Hannah(Madison Davenport)on most weekends. On an ordinary
weekend featuring forbidden pizza, Em is curiously obsessed with an
antique wooden box at a yard sale; so dad buys it for her. Before long
Em's behavior becomes erratic and questionable; she seems not like
herself. Clyde and Stephanie believe EM's attraction to the box may be
the cause of this disturbance. What they later discover is the antique
box was built to hold a dibbuk...a disjointed spirit seeking to
completely devour its human host. Talk about a white-knuckle, "jumpy"
movie; some very disturbing sequences containing violence. The super
special effects as usual come near the finale. In-your-face scary may
be putting it mildly. Of course the best acting comes from Miss Calis.
Other players include: Grant Show, Brenda Crichlow, Jay Brazeau, David
Hovan and Matisyshu, as the Jewish Holy Man.
