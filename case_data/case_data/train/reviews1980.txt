The Daniel Day Lewis Factor

I remember fondly, Henry Fonda and Raymond Massey as Lincolns in "Young
Mr.Lincoln" and "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" They gave remarkable
performances. But, here and now in this extraordinary Steven
Spielberg/Tony Kushner version, the illusion is complete. I was
watching the president and not for a moment thought of the actor. That
in itself is close to unique. I left the theater with the feeling I've
just had an out of body experience. Everything around the central
performance - and I call it a performance because I don't know what
else to call it - falls into place in a miraculous way. The
photography, the production design, the wardrobe made it possible to
actually smell the period. Congratulations and thank you.
