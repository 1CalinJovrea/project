Complete and utter disappointment

Wow. What a complete and utter disappointment. From the moment that I
saw the rumours and the pictures popping up around the web that Michael
Fassbender was to play Macbeth, one of the most brilliantly written
characters of all time, I was all over the place of excitement. The
imagery looked stunning and anything that Fassbender touches becomes
gold. To follow it up with a brilliantly cast Paddy Considine as Banquo
and, in my opinion a little too young, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth
I thought we were set for success.The opening is harrowing, beautiful and brilliant and it really sucks
you in to their world. From the first moment costumes, props and
carpentry look great, cinematography beyond beautiful and it really
sets the mood. For nothing.What follows is a drawn out, slow-paced, pretentious interpretation of
the text that loses it's insanity and rhythm completely. Now I'm all
for revisioning and reimagining, and there's a LOT of room for that in
the play Macbeth, so I was excited, but utterly disappointed.It's an orgy of meaningless violence in slow motion, topped off with so
many close ups of blood and vomit that doesn't serve a purpose,
sprinkled with, what I can only imagine being a directors "vision" with
complete disregard of his actors talents.The "redeeming part" is it's beautiful imagery, but everything else
pushes this movie down to the very bottom of my list. To cite Macbeth
himself, "It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."
