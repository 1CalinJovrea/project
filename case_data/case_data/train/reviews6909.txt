Race- and class--baiting garbage

A dreadful film that comes across as a Very Special Episode of an 80s
sitcom.The facile race- and class-baiting is worthy of Spielberg at his most
myopic, any nuance or balance washed away in a froth of 1-D stereotypes
-- the precocious ethnic minor that can warm the coldest heart; the
Black Radical (Poor Omar, reduced to this!) who is supposed to be
Malcolm X with a YouTube account but ends up laughable, as threatening
as Homie the Clown; the spartan, conflicted anti-hero who Does The
Right Thing and Pays the Price; and of course the Evil Rich White
People (ERWP) fresh from Central Casting, complete with capitalist hair
parted on the side and the odd halo-like back-lighting that denotes The
American Chosen and seems to ensconce ERWP in terrible movies such as
this.The brief moments of honest thrill are lost amid such drivel, appearing
more like a mistake of editing than a conscious effort to create
atmosphere.In short, the epitome of why movie piracy exists; you download it for
free, suffer through it, then send it to the Recycle Bin where it
belongs. I may as well have wiped myself with the money I spent at the
theatre for this
