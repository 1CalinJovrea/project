Generally nice, modern and well-made

Nowadays, people ought to check a IMDb score before watching a movie.
But naturally there's lots of points of view there. So, this time I'll
try to keep it short. This is a decent modern SF production. No one
should be disappointed. Obviously, the production team seem to kept it
up within the given budget and gave us a timely well paced, nicely
trimmed script and eye-lubricated product for every SF lover out there.
Of course, one shouldn't expect some "eye soul candy" nor
genre-breaking original ideas (as genre in general, not only within
movies, but also games or literature). But, as I noticed above about
briefness, we all should be satisfied within the given parameters. A
recommendation.
