Sweet, beautiful, and funny

I loved this movie! One of Wes Anderson's best - up there with Rushmore
and Fantastic Mr Fox. Top reasons to see this movie: The love story between the quirky dark characters was so sweet. The
casting for the 2 lead kids was spot on! You can take kids to this
movie. They won't get all of the subtle humor but you will. The music
and the film setting. The quirkiness of the filming, scenes, and
narrator. Everyone in short pants... classic! Bruce Willis is actually
good in it. Beautifully shot. You leave the theater with a smile on
your face and a tear in your eye. Best movie so far this year.Anyone who said they did't like it, doesn't get Wes Anderson. If you
like his movies, you will love Moonrise Kingdom!
