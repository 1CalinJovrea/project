You Can't Go Wrong with Brad Bird!

From Walt Disney Pictures and Brad Bird, the Oscar winning director of
animated classics as The Iron Giant (1999), The Incredibles (2004), and
Ratatouille (2007), comes Tomorrowland, a new sic-fi action flick with
a powerful message, great acting from George Clooney, Raffey Cassidy,
and Britt Robertson, and breathtaking visuals. I give this film a
9.8/10 instead of the mixed reviews from the critics (like a 50% on
Rotten Tomatoes). It is also too bad that the movie was a box office
flop only earning $210 million worldwide against its HUGE $190 million
budget. It is a film about how fun the future can be if everyone has
the thought of "a great big beautiful tomorrow". I highly recommend
this to any Disney fans or those looking for a fun action flick, then
go check this one out.
