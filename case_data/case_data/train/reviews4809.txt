Horrible theater experience

I saw Annabel: Creation last Thursday & really wanted to get into &
enjoy it but sadly just as my showing was about to start a group of
about 40 Asian teens walked in, took seats all over the theater then
proceeded to talk loudly, play with their cells, hoot, holler & make
animal noises from the time the lights went out & thru the entire
movie. At one point I moved two rows down to get away form it & the
little brats moved as well. During the movie a guy that was there
before me kindly asked them to quiet down which made them even louder
so he ended up walking out. I really felt like shouting STF up but that
probably wouldn't of ended well. Don't get me wrong I'm all for a good
scream or funny comment when appropriate. But this was just to much.
When I got home I FB messaged & left a complaint for Cineplex &
apologized & are sending me two free passes. Besides the bratty
behavior of the idiot teens I really enjoyed the movie !!
