Entertaining, but inconsistent sequel in the X-Men series...

The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by
extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed
with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is
portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a
devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome
Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain,
she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice.
These are things that enrage fans over and over again.It is not about being a purist, but about honoring the original. In an
age where superheros are invading our cinemas, one could do worse if
one watches a film about hope and freedom, about homophobia, racism,
bigotry, immigration and all sort of other social issues. And somehow
none of the X-men films so far have successfully brought these themes
to the screen.This film suffers from having to focus on thousands of characters and
locations. Some characters like Mystique and Magneto are given
substantial screen time, while others such as Psylocke are given only a
few scenes. The film also tries to fit into the overall X-Men
continuity, while trying to stand up on its own.A great film for a pop-corn viewing with your friends, but a sub-par
X-Men film in general... It is sad that the most substantial
superheroes of our age, that really have something to say about the
world we live in, are treated as badly as this...Mutant and proud? Unfortunately there is nothing to be proud of except
the money the film is about to make.
