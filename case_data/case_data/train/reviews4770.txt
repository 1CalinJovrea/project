An all round sweet film filled with romance. Zac is all man.

Whenever there is a new adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel is
released, there's always a mass amount of haters and so be it because
some of them are extremely cheesy and bad, however I think that the
hate towards The Lucky One is unwarranted, I personally thought it was
a very enjoyable romantic drama. The Lucky One is quite different to
other Sparks movies, I found the storyline to be a lot more serious and
mature than normal, and the story being told from the male perspective
is also a nice change.The acting from Zac Efron is top form, as he gets older his roles get
better and his acting improves with each movie, Taylor Schilling is
also nice, if not being a little too old for Efron, but she brings some
niceness to the character, and Blythe Danner is a bit of a scene
stealer in her small role.Yes parts of this film are a little clich√©, particularly towards the
end, but it's no biggie, the lack of chemistry between the two leads is
a bit annoying at first but soon it changes and gets better, even
though Taylor Schilling is nice in the role I do think that she is
miscast, I think Abbie Cornish may have suited the role a little more.
But even still the few flaws that this movie does have doesn't distract
from the overall niceness of the film.Zefron is all man now and he is definitely an actor to watch. Fans of
the book will love it, Zac fans will love it too, generally a nice
romance to enjoy with friends.
