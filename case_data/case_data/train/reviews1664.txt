Too long and predictable, but no flop

Of course, similar events - revenge after double-crossing - have been
depicted several times and will definitely be depicted in the future as
well - but it is the direction and choice of actors that counts. As for
Parker, everything is at least okay with those: the director Taylor
Hackford is an accredited creator and names like Jason Statham, Nick
Nolte, Jennifer Lopez are certain signs of quality and non-boredom.
They are pleasant to follow even in less interesting and less veracious
scenes.Well, the script is probably the weakest part of the movie: too much
predictability, excessive sections (e.g. Parker-Claire, prolonging the
duration to almost 2 hour 15 minutes) and trivial ending (unlike in
movies by Guy Ritchie, for example). Nevertheless, Parker is still an above-average A-movie, qualifying well
for a sociable entertainment.
