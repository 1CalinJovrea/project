Sequel, remake, or whatever. It feels like the same movie.

A lot has been discussed about whether this movie is really a sequel to
the 1990 version or if it's a remake. Whatever it is, it feels an awful
lot like the same movie. The one thing that could distinguish between
the two are the presence of Keifer Sutherland. After having seen the
movie, I don't even know if he's playing the same character from the
original or not. Having him appear here felt pretty pointless. There's
also no references or mentions of the previous experiment from the
first film, further proving that this is in fact more of a remake. The
characters and the things they do felt a lot like the ones in the
original. One positive I will say is, I was glad to see the movie had
the guts to kill off a character. In the first one, other than
Sutherland's character, you never feel like any of them are in any real
physical danger from their post-flatlining experiences. Here it feels
like the stakes are upped a little more.All in all, it just felt like a really unnecessary sequel/remake that
just didn't do a whole lot to set itself apart.
