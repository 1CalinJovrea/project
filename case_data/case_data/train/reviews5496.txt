Something New for the horror genre

I have to say this movie reminded me of plenty other films such as
Sorority Row, Tamara, Cry Wolf or the most recent remake of Carrie and
yet Unfriended held its' own pretty damn good. When I heard how the
film was going to be shot I was a little skeptical as to whether or not
it would work or just be really boring.Typically in these type of supernatural films there's a lot of
wandering slowly down dark halls with figures appearing in the shadows
so I was skeptical but this was really creative. I think the storyline
was a pretty basic ghost revenge story and yet with a modern twist. The
internet offers a new form of bullying that unfortunately is all too
real and this movie shows the consequences of such actions to the
extent of driving someone to commit suicide.I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on this the characters were interesting
but it really got annoying listening to them argue like little
elementary kids. Some of it was okay for humorous reasons but after
awhile it was annoying. I do also think it would've been better with
adults instead of teenagers simply because if this Laura ghost had gone
after them years later they would have had more reason to have
forgotten the details of "the video" and the "incident".Which in that case I think the incident would've had to have been
something more serious than it was such as her being raped and being
shamed for it and made fun of afterward. That really would've given the
story more depth but it was a good scary movie that for me would've
been more intense if I hadn't seen it in theaters. The audience I guess
found the character's fighting hilarious and couldn't take the movie
seriously after awhile which made it hard to enjoy the scares. My
advice see it alone to really see how you feel about it.
