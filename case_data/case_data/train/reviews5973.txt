An amazing film that captures a time and a complex relationship

Although shot in Canada, and although it is about a Canadian, I don't
like affixing the term Canadiana to it. It is a Universal movie about
the indomitable spirit that some people possess even when faced with
horrendous turns of fate. Sally Hawkins is incredibly good as Maud and
Ethan Hawke does a superb job of playing Everett Lewis. Hawkins has the
accents , the movements, the wry smile and the light that just won't
stop shining. Hawke's performance is very nuanced: his character was an
emotional cripple and he was violent, but we also know how much he
loved and admired his wife. It was a time when dirt poor men asked for
nothing, did whatever they must to survive and didn't allow expression
of feelings in their lives. Many reviewers have called him "vile", but
he could have been a miner, for example, anywhere in the world as
easily as a fish seller in Nova Scotia in 1930. I think Ethan Hawke did
an amazing job of capturing that man. It has great cinematography,
excellent score and a minimalist script that allows, through actual
superb acting, to get to know a pair of characters in a movie like
never before. Don't miss this one!!
