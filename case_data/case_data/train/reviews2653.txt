"Yep, zombie." Ben (Sheridan) and Carter (Miller) are about to graduate
high school and are ready to leave the scouts. When they decide to skip
their final camp out and go to a senior party instead they think they
are in for the night of their lives. What they find when they head back
to town is something neither of them could have imagined. It is now up
to them to save the town from zombies. This movie is just a ridiculous
and fun as it sounds. The movie is mindless but entertaining. That is
what makes this one so fun to watch. Gory, comedy, a pretty funny idea
and great timing make this one of the better horror comedies to come
out in a while. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie
other than if you are renting this for your teenager I would preview it
first. Overall, if you like movies like Tucker and Dale vs. Evil and
Cooties you will love this one as well. A movie you can easily watch
over and over. I give this a B+.
