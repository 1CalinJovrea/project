Prison...Indeed

Okay - lets be honest here. Its not extremely difficult to make a film
portraying a psychological experiment that was well documented and
captured on film.This film as more of a reenactment - just so you are aware.Ezra Miller continues to shine as a prison subject in this movie. With
the upcoming Justice League Films, and Miller portraying The Flash, its
nice to see his work outside that to get more comfortable with his
upcoming performance.So - as the film title states, this a recalling of a social experiment
gone a little too far, and had to be stopped early for reason I will
not spoil.The true nature of human empowerment is truly devastating to witness.If you have time, see this tense thriller. It will however, raise as
many questions as it answers.A great thinking movie. Please don't forget to check out the source
material on this study during, or after the movie.Very interesting, very disturbing, and very enlightening.
