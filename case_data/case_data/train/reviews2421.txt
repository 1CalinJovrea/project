Firstly i would like to ask "What come's at night" and to answer my own
question Nothing!!!. The film go's nowhere the story's boring and the
characters are nothing special you really don't care if they live or
die. quoting the movie description. " Secure within a desolate home as
an unnatural threat terrorizes the world, the tenuous domestic order he
has established with his wife and son is put to the ultimate test with
the arrival of a desperate young family seeking refuge. Despite the
best intentions of both families, paranoia and mistrust boil over as
the horrors outside creep ever- closer, awakening something hidden and
monstrous within him as he learns that the protection of his family
comes at the cost of his soul. sounds good but it's very
misleading,would not recommend this
