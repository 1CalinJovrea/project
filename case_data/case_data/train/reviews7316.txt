A great film, yet filled with a few noticeable flaws. Still a MUST SEE...

I'm 15 years old, and I can honestly say that this was a good movie.
Although some sections of the movie were definitely a bit dry, the
fight sequences and voice talent surely made up for it. I've been a
Lego Ninjago fan for a long time and this was a good refresher to the
brand. Compared to the previous Lego movies, this might not have been
the best, however when you compare to other kids movies- this is a
pretty nice film. I do feel however that the other ninjas should have
been given more of a story and much more character development.
