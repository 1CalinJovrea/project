Unmovie

First I wish I could give this a lower rating 1 simply does not reflect
how bad this film is, I wish I could use another word as it is simply
not a movie or film. Ten minutes in and the only horror involved was my
realisation that the whole film was teenagers screaming as they skyped
each other. Laughable plot, girl gets s### faced at party and then
s#### herself which is filmed. Girl kills herself, girl haunts their
skype chat and each one dies, film over. 82 minutes of watching what at
times appears to be an instruction video that appear on the web of how
to use a piece of software, other times you are simply reading what
someone types, how this cost a million is a bigger mystery than who
shot JFK, it could have been shot over a day. There are films were I
have got up and walked out only to find I am watching at home and I am
standing in the garden in the cold pouring rain which is more
preferable than watching the rest of the movie. This film makes them
look like Citizen Kane, this by quite a distance is the worst I have
ever endured.
