If You Can Get Through The First 75%, You May Enjoy The Last 25%

Be warned - if you weren't brought up with your own cell phone and a
Twitter account, this movie will probably make you sick. I literally
had to FORCE myself to watch it all the way through. It should be a
wake-up call to how selfish, egotistical and banal society has become.
In many cases, people don't bother to actually raise their children any
more. They just sit them in front of tech and expect them to come into
adulthood perfectly balanced. The main character is SOOO coarse and it takes WAY too long to get to
the message (if they intended one). It's almost like Jonas Hill &
Company were trying to emulate Kevin Smith's formula of quirky basic
human goodness and failed miserably. Honestly, I can't recommend anyone watch this movie. The only people
who will enjoy it are the tech babies who can understand the
cursing/stupidity/sexual idiocy. The ending makes it's point, but far
too late for anyone to care (except the tech babies who most likely
won't even "get" it). Save your money.
