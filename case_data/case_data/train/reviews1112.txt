Mums are funnier than this

Dear oh dear where to start with this monstrosity? These days it is oh so easy to get away with not bothering to write
jokes, and hoping the swearing and sex references are enough to make
the audience laugh. At some point this became acceptable with comedy
films, and judging by this film's page even the critics have bought
into it! These are worrying times...Bar one amusing reference to a certain recent sci-fi film, this film
fails to land any laughs.On to storyline. Half way through the film they decided to try and
shoehorn in a moral to the story. Unfortunately every time a point was
made, it was duly undermined/contradicted around 10 minutes later. Awful stuff. The 2nd star is given on the strength of the fact that
stuff happens constantly, so at least the film manages to be
entertaining on some level. But for laughs? Please look elsewhere.
