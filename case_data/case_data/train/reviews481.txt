Groovy

So I've read here and there that this remake lacks the camp of the
original. And I look back over 20 years ago, watching The Evil Dead on
a crummy rental VHS, in the dark of my teenage bedroom one night. The
camp? The original Evil Dead was a terrifying experience, even with
Bruce Campbell's over the top performance, the film was a scare-fest, a
terrifying trip even nearly ten years after its release. The camp was
in Evil Dead 2, an horror comedy remaking the original already,
technically. This remake finds many way to bow to the original, aside the obligatory
visual quotes. The use of practical effects, notably, in an era of CGI-
filled movies, is extremely refreshing. The gore feels painful, makes
you cringe, churned my stomach. It successfully palliates a somewhat
shallow characterization that makes it difficult to root for the
characters (with the exception of Mia, who owes a lot to a really
visceral performance by Jane Levy.)And this is where Evil Dead 2013 took me by surprise. After roughly a
first half of the movie taking Evil Dead fans by the hand towards
hashed and rehashed territories, making them doubt that this was a good
idea at all, the movie lets go of your hand and you're alone, in the
middle of the woods, and it's dark and there's strange noises all
about... and then limbs start flying. I won't get into conjectures that the highly conventional and overly
familiar first half was made that way with the sole purpose of placing
the audience in their comfort zone, only to give more impact to the
second half... but I would surely ask Fede Alvarez if I was to
interview him. Evil Dead 2013 is a treat for the fans of gore and horror, in any case.
Another reminder that out of ten awful remakes, sometimes one rises to
the top and delivers. Not for the faint of heart, for sure, but if
you're a true horror fan, and even more, if you miss your old school,
gruesome gore rides, this one is for you.
