Great movie, forgot the trollers here.

This movie lacks what it takes to take an Oscar Award, lacks the
sensitivity and depth....blah blah blah, forget all that noise...go see
the movie with your kids they would love it.This movie is for Kids, and parents who have kids. I took my daughter
to see it today in 3D. Excellent visual effects, entire movie had
effects, you did not take your glasses off at all or you'd miss the
next 3d effect that is right around the corner. The cast was good, The
Rock was great and jokes were funny, this movie was child safe and had
everything that your young one would want, lots of effects, action,
above and underwater. I would definitely recommend it in 3D. The pace
of movie is fast and if you have kids ....you can appreciate this.I rated this movie for what it is...a kids movie. Are you going to
leave the theater discussing the virtues of Plato? NO! but your kids
will be going on about this and that in the movie. Worth Admission?
Absolutely. Asked my daughter what she rated it....9.5 she said. Was it
worth it? When your child says 9.5 what the heck else matters?????
