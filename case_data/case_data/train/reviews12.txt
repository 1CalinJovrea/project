Well made

I went for this movie since my wife likes watching movies with this
theme. The Day after tomorrow or Apocalypse themed movies where nature
is destroying everything. This movie surprisingly had more to offer. It
has a fantastic suspenseful plot. The two main protagonists Gerard
Butler and Jim Strugess are brothers. They have fantastic chemistry and
the story unfolds brilliantly. The special effects are awe-inspiring. A
great effort. Loved it.
