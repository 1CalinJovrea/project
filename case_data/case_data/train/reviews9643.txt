One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Acting, writing and directing
were just horrid. I actually watched this today, came home, signed up
for IMDb just to say how awful this movie was. Stupid diarrhea scene
for no reason. They just witnessed their friend hacked to pieces and
eaten, then a girl explodes her bowels in the corner of their cage.
What is their reaction? Total disgust and act like they cant get far
enough away from her, really? They acted as if it was the worst thing
that had happened on their trip. Then the random masturbation scene?
Served no purpose. After everything that was done to the lead actress;
beating, raped, almost had her genitals mutilated and she doesn't tell
anyone out in the world that these monsters are running around the
woods? SO DUMB I CANT FATHOM IT!!! While watching this movie I felt as
though I would rather be on the cannibals table then in the movie seat.
Don't waste your time or money on this mindless drivel.
