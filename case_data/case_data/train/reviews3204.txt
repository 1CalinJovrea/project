No good guys, no bad guys, just the facts as they are known

I always find my viewing experience of the retelling of historical
events ruined when I come across scenes which I know have been added
for dramatic effect or when someone is played as a bad guy just to let
us know who to root for.The King's Speech was particularly guilty of the former, the portrayal
of other teams in Glory Road had the latter, and The Imitation Game was
shamelessly guilty of both. I'm not saying this made them bad films,
but it certainly made me feel like the experience had strayed away from
a retelling of the facts as known.Everest is everything that is good in such a film. There is no needless
good v evil addition and no leading the viewer to conclusions. It tells
the story and I have since spent three or four days thinking about the
hows, whys and wherefores... whilst knowing I will never find an
answer.The other touch that really elevates this film is that there are no
added action sequences that have been added to make Everest more of an
action move. The film makers have been intelligent enough to realise
that climbing Everest does not need any exaggeration, the characters
involved were three dimensional people, and the story was interesting
enough not to need embellishment.I expected an action film but left pleasantly surprised by a biopic
with a light touch.The one mark deduction is for the totally unnecessary 3D. The film
absolutely didn't need me wearing dumb glasses to be three dimensional.
