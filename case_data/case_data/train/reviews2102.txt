Some brilliant moments but overall not rewarding

There is some great singing and a number of fantastic scenes in Into
the Woods. However, overall, this movie is a real downer. Not a movie
for kids or romantics.Into the Woods takes a number of fairy tales, mixes them up, and spits
out a very muddled and confusing film. Unlike most fairy tales, there
is no happy ending for any of the characters.For example, the baker's wife (played by Emily Brunt) and childless
because of a magic spell, learns the lesson that she can have a
husband, a child, and make out with Cinderella's prince before she
falls off a cliff.At some point, Into the Woods began to seem endless. I found myself
wondering if the movie would provide any kind of emotional reward for
watching it. It didn't. Don't say you weren't warned.
