Hillariously Cheesy Slasher Comedy

This is exactly what a good Halloween prank should look like. A little
bit of gore, a little bit of T&A, outrageously stereotypical high
school kids, and nothing in the way of a plot to worry about.That's not to say it's not extremely successful at what it aspires to:
good, silly fun for Halloween.Completely self-aware of all the slasher films it mimics, and more than
able to mine the comedy in those memes, this film is just a hoot. Not
anywhere near as serious as the Scream franchise tries to be with the
horror/slasher genre, this film takes the opposite tact: remember that
these films are for fun and a bit of escapism.A soft PG-13 would be the MPAA rating for this if it wasn't Netflix,
and it's appropriate for your tweens. But if you're in your 30s or 40s,
it's gonna be a lot more enjoyable, since you know and recognize all
the tropes at play, but know that the filmmakers know and are just
letting you have fun watching them play out.I hope the three leads get more good work out of this, because they all
do a fabulous job with the material - there's not a lot to work with,
but each of the three (the babysitter, boy kid, and his bestie girl)
give you a good show and don't fall into the trap that this film could
easily have done: there's not a scenery chewer among them, and they all
do a great job of keeping their eye on the prize: a silly, fun, bit
nostalgic, Halloween slasher.
