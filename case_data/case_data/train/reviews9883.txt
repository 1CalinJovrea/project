3
Didn't feel like watching a movie. I don't know what it is.

Now I'm okay with movies that didn't follow exactly like the original
plot from games, books, etc like the first Silent Hill movie, I think
it is still fine. But this one is just BAD. I'm not sure what I was
watching but I didn't feel like I was watching a full movie. It just
lack of many things. Maybe it's too short, maybe Silent Hill 3 is just
not suitable to be made into a movie because the story is all about
Heather trying to find the truth about herself, and since we already
knew that at the beginning, what is there to tell anymore? And we as an
audience already knew how her father is doing, only Heather didn't
know, again there's nothing to look forward too. We just merely
watching Heather going from point A to B and nothing else. It is that
dull and plain. And the horror? the movie is trying too hard to be creepy. What's with
all the pointless close up of meat cutting and bloody mouthful eating.
I don't know it just didn't work for me.
