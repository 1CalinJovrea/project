Boring

It may be my age (60+), but I, and my friends, found this remake very
boring except for the few parts that were laughable (note I did NOT say
funny). So much so that, at the end when the book closed, I said
"Jumanji." I was surprised to see an abandoned cabin with intact
windows and working electrics, especially since I didn't see a line to
the cabin or hear a generator going whenever they were outside or in
the shed. How the friends managed to survive all the carnage (before
they were possessed) without dying from shock (of blood loss) is beyond
me. Guess I have reached the age where I want a horror story to be at
least believable on some level before it tries to get scary.
