At least the public knew to stay away from this

A bunch of very good actors, all wasted in an indulgent pretentious
script, and even more indulgent and pretentious directing. the pseudo
arts use of a drum soundtrack, the long boring hand held tracking shot,
oh look i am doing all this in one take. the absolutely stupid plot,
that takes ages to go nowhere, a film where the film maker is saying
very loudly and in a very boring way, look how clever i am, why this
has been praised by critics is beyond me. Actually to be honest i have
now long given up on what critics say and write about a film. Virtually
critic on both sides of the Atlantic seem to have lost any sense of
what is good or bad. The amount of critically endorsed films that i
have thought to be not bad but very bad seems to be growing each year.
i have been a serious movie goer for some time now. i also have noticed
that after a year or so these lauded films seem to get reconsidered ,
where the original praise is vastly reduced.
