Dear Adam Sandler... Please Give up...

The basic storyline is this Adam Sandler gets his teacher pregnant, now
he's mooching off his much more successful son. done. Thats it. No deep
storyline, no meaning behind it just done. But this is a comedy so the storyline doesn't really matter. So lets
look at the jokes... uh... okay... so there are no jokes. There are a
lot of crewed and stupid moments, particularly regarding sex, that are
simply discussing, not funny. Thats the closest they get to a joke is
making the audience puke their guts out until eyes bleed. The acting is crap, the storyline is stupid, the is an unnecessary
number of sexual "puns" (I put puns for lack of a better word but don't
let that confuse you They don't make you laugh), and a ball rolling
randomly across a keyboard could write a better script.I'm sorry to say I was forced to watch this abomination at the drive
in. I voted to go home but my brothers voted to stay so I was force
feed this garbage after seeing Ted with Seth McFarlane (Funny movie)
The good mood Ted put me in was beaten to death by this piece of
garbage.
