Watch Midnight Run and Grosse Point Blank instead

This is so derivative of other, sooo much better films, that I turned
it off half way in. The action scenes are OK but the foul language is
so forced and unbelievable that it was like a teenager shouting "I can
swear, ain't it cool?" It's not half as cute or witty or fun as it thinks it is so it wore out
its welcome long before the end.
