full metal drumming

this is played out as if the young musicians are in boot camp. the head
teacher is more vicious drill sergeant than music teacher. anyone who
has played an instrument will tell you, yes that practise is hard and
you have to be committed, but it is always enjoyable and fulfilling. no
one in this film seems to take pleasure in playing music. it is so
ludicrous, over the top and ultimately just plain corny. they spell out
what the film is about in very childish dialogue as if an audience
cannot pick up on what the teacher is trying to do. scene after scene
of bombastic emotional and physical brutality. any teacher teaching as
this sadist does would not last a week, let alone manage to impart any
kind of knowledge into his pupils. then we have the ending the kid
races against time, survives a head on car collision and still makes it
to the gig, (whereupon the teacher has change what they are going to
play just for spite, this is the kind of character he has been
throughout this one note film,) and then still manages that old clich√©
of killing them dead with his boring drum solo. drumming is not about
speed its about making melody from skins. Overrated by critics who by
now really don't know what makes a good film
