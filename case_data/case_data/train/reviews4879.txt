Not for Everyone, but a Great Comedy With Depth

As stated in the Summary this is not a film for everyone. First off, be
prepared if you are going to watch this to see a lot of nudity of both
male and females. To me, I did not believe the nudity to be gratuitous,
only real to the stories being told in the movie and to real life (we
are all naked underneath our clothes, right?). If you are the type of person that will be able to look past the nudity
you may be able to relate, in ways, to the main character in the movie.
Yes, much of the movie's comedy is driven by the characters philosophy
toward sexual hygiene...or lack thereof. BUT, if you can be truthful to
yourself while watching the movie, you may find that at points during
the film you are able to relate and commiserate with the main character
(sometimes embarrassingly), as she narrates her sexual fetishes
seamlessly alongside her narration of the state of her broken family. This film is not for the faint, or those that have a hard time with
bodily fluids... BUT it is for those that want to live freely through
an open minded main character. As society and norms have made people question their sanity, and the
"normal-ness" of what they choose to do behind closed doors, it is
refreshing, exciting, and comedic to watch a film where the main
character is unforgiving, open, and truthful about her sexuality and
views toward life and the world.
