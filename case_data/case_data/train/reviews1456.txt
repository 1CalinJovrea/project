Romance movie pretending to be sci-fi

The trailers made this out as serious science fiction, but it was
basically a glorified "boy meets girl" movie in space. Apart from a sleep inducing middle act where nothing happens apart from
the two leads courting each other, the suspension of disbelief needed
here, is staggering, mainly in the form of seemingly superhuman
protagonists. Some spoilers ahead:1. A woman passes out while in a bubble of water, effectively drowning,
then miraculously "wakes up", while still in the water a few minutes
later just because the bubble splashes down into a pool. 2. On multiple occasions people slipping on something and crash landing
on their back leaves no damage other than them simply getting up and
saying "ouch" as if it's a cartoon. 3. Male lead withstands thermonuclear blast at the end without as much
as a heat rash, then runs out of oxygen due to a cracked helmet and
drifts into space, but instead of freezing and suffocating when the air
runs out gets rescued by his girlfriend who simply jumps off the star-
ship in his general direction and miraculously catches him.4. Out of 5000 pods, the one of the guy they really need malfunctions,
who wakes up, explains how they can save the ship (which he's
completely unqualified for given his job), and then being the token
black guy, dies pretty much straight away.6. Woman suffers major upper body trauma but carries on as if nothing
happens.With a bit of care to some details and without the totally artificial
and forced happy ending this could have been really good. As it is, it
came across as desperate to not challenge its target audience too much
and suffered for it.
