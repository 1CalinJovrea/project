A thing of beauty

Does the third act feel unfocused and scattered? Holy hell, does it!Overall, does the film push a little too hard on the sentimentality? It
sure does, shamelessly at times.Does it suffer from minor inconsistencies and a couple of narrative
plateaus the omission of which would have resulted in a shorter, more
taut outcome? That would be another resounding "YES!".Do any of the above shortcomings ultimately matter? Hell, no, Rust and
Bone is freaking stunning!And this coming from me, the person who dislikes both emotional
manipulation AND Matthias Schoenaerts. Double whammy yet it still
manages a very worthy 4 stars.Cheers for this Audiard, you're a good 'un, mate.
