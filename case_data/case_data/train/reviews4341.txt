An Epiphany!

This was without exaggeration the most impressive movie I've ever seen.
It's the stuff cinema and 3-D are made for. I experienced it as a
partly breathtaking parade of impressive landscapes, panorama shots,
aliens, costumes and sets connected by a complex story about power,
resistance and of course love that culminates in a clever ending.The only reason I give not all 10 stars is because I have to confess
that I found the story sometimes a little too complex and therefore
hard to follow.But this feast for the eye is by any means the money for the ticket
worth. I've never seen such a spectacular movie. My dream fulfilled: A
new overwhelming sf- spectacular which isn't part of the Star Wars or
Star Trek franchise but opens a new rich and fantastic world and which
has- in opposite to the SW prequels- a logical and intricate story.All my hopes that it won't bomb but allow new adventures with John
Carter on the Mars to be filmed.
