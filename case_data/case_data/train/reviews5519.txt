Total garbage

Yet another movie where the reviews are obviously populated by the
films creators. Do not be fooled. This movie is terrible. It's one of
the worst "found footage" films ever made because of the way it's
filmed. They over use the shaky cam I am sure thinking it adds realism.
The only thing it adds is an incomprehensible viewing experience. Avoid
this movie at all costs. This has been done much better many times. I
realize that's not saying much since this one is the absolute bottom of
the cesspool. Horror? Hardly. It's so choppy and poorly filmed that no
one in our crowd even cared what was happening. This would be terrible
even for a fan film. The amazing thing is that the makers HAD to have
screened this and said to themselves, "Yes this is good!". They may
have had no talent for film making whatsoever. Their skills at self
delusion are truly astounding however. I had no problem with the
actors/acting, what little of it you can actually see. I would guess
that at least HALF of the running time of this movie is take up by
static, incomprehensible images and flashing strobe like effects.
Imagine how enjoyable it would be to sit through that for an hour or
more. Acting was fine. Directing and virtually everything else was
complete garbage. STAY AWAY!
