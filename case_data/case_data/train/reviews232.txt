Feast for the Eyes, not the mind

What we have here is a imaginative, visually stunning feast for the
eyes overlayed upon a rather boiler-plate story. The Mexican imagery is
lush, detailed, colorful and while that is enough for a time, it does
fatigue when there is nothing compelling behind it. The music is,
strangely and sadly, American pop tunes spiced up with a little
accordian or guitar to remind us this is supposed to be Mexico. Why not
have the characters sing some really beautiful Mexican ballads? As for
that story, it's a weak re-hash of pretty much every animated and
super-hero film you've seen in the last few years. Good guy must
triumph against all odds and achieve the goal, in this case, winning
the girl, and is thwarted along the way by the super-evil character.
You could actually watch this with the sound off and just enjoy the
visuals and still understand the story.
