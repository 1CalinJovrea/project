Nothing special

Many reviewers' sense of imagination must be really weak to find this
film so good. It's the story of a mediocre man in a mediocre world
whose fantasies instead of taking us to another world just depict the
clich√© "action" or "romance" flick he saw last year. And as drama comes
in destroying his mediocre existence (consisting of his job) he finally
finds that experiences out of the ordinary may be more appealing than
his stereotyped mental adventures. Wow... There're some nice comedy
moments and a nice photography but also some poor goofs. If poetry can
still be found in some (few) Hollywood products this is definitely not
the case.
