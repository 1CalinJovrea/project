Hands down Halloween fun

Saw this by myself and I have to say that I had the absolute time of my
life with this movie it had me laughing at something nonstop had a good
message to it too the time spent with good ol madeia and uncle Joe and
the whole gang is priceless and the new friends of madieas only make
the movie funnier than the way it would have been without them I am a
proud white 27 year old man who is not afraid to admit that I loved
this movie and think everyone of any age color or background should see
it most enjoyable movie I have seen in awhile won't say best of the
year but it was a good one no doubt it is a good date movie or just see
it alone somehow just see the movie and enjoy it
