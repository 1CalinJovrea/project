Mindfuck at its finest.

Anyone who loves mindfuck movies and movies incredibly hard to
understand at the end, will love this one. The beginning seems kinda
weird, and what the director does with the beginning is planting a seed
of thought into the minds of the viewers, i bet you 10 people will have
10 different outcomes thought through while watching the movie from the
start. The plot twists and the originality of the movie were fantastic,
haven't seen anything quite like that in a movie. The fact that all the
movies main characters, except Robinson is the same person is hard to
believe and extremely well thougth through and displayed for the
viewers. Were else have you seen a movie which can lead to you having
sex with you, giving birth to you, then bringing yourself back to 1963
to break up the relationship between yourself and yourself and taking
yourself as a baby back in time and toping it all by killing yourself?
Awesome plot, great idea and something very original and amusing.
