Don't Believe The Negative Reviews

I can't believe how many reviews are so ridiculously negative. And I
also can't believe that no one has drawn a comparison between this film
and "The Age Of Adaline".So it makes me think that these negative reviews are by people who
don't watch many films.Both this film and "Adaline" have the same male lead, have similar
haunting theme music and deal with a relationship that spans decades.
But that is not a bad thing - Adaline is at least a 9 in my estimation
and I've given this an 8. In fact, since the overall rating is
currently 5.7, there must be a lot of ratings greater than the
miserable low ones given by the negative reviewers.So I say "Watch the film, it's good, it's touching and it made perfect
sense to me". Perhaps the reviewers who didn't understand it weren't
paying attention.And if you like this film, watch "The Age Of Adaline".
