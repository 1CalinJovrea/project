Could have been so much more

I would like to start off with the positives. There are a few: the
acting was done well by all involved, the story and some of visuals.
Anything Kyra Sedgwick is involved in is generally pretty good. Jeffrey
Dean Morgan was good as the struggling dad after a divorce. However, I
think the star of the movie was Natasha Calis. Reminded me of a young
Linda Blair. The story was very good and well explained so I understood what was
coming up next. I also appreciated the integration of the Jewish faith
into the movie as this is critical to the original story. The visuals
is where I felt this movie could have shocked more. There were a number
of good scenes (the one with the dentist) and the final scene. But the
bumps and jumps could have been more integrated into the story earlier.
It was one hour into the movie before anything exciting happened. The
time was spent on character development which is good but I like a few
more "scares". There were too many unanswered questions at the end of the movie. This
is why I rated it the way I did. This is not a bad movie at all. It did
make you think and it did spark discussions on the way home from the
theater.
