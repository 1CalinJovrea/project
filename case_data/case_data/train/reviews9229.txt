Best of Melissa McCarthy films

Wasn't sure about this film at first as I am not a big of Melissa
McCarthy but glad I watched it! Haven't laughed so much watching comedy
compared to this one. Melissa is a good actor and rather funny too.
Jason Statham, Jude Law and Rose Byrne being in it was also an added
bonus! Don't understand why others were giving this film a 1 rating as it
isn't bad at all. Give it a go of you have nothing else to watch.
