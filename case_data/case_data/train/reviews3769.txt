One of the best movies I've seen in a while.

I discovered this movie while watching another. The preview of The
Iceman was screened on a DVD that I had rented and the preview
certainly made me sit up and pay attention. I thought to myself "I must
see this" so a week later I rented The Iceman and was certainly
impressed. This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. I'd never heard of Richard Kuklinski before, but his story was very
intriguing. Michael Shannon's performance of Kuklinski is Oscar worthy.
The cold, icy demeanour that he displays when around his victims and
criminal associates makes you forget that he is an actor just playing a
role. Shannon steals pretty much every scene that he is in even when he
is in the presence of veterans like Liotta. Winona Ryder's performance
is also very good and could possibly earn her an Oscar nod.This movie had me riveted from start to finish. If you are looking for
a good drama to sink your teeth into, I can definitely recommend "The
Iceman".
