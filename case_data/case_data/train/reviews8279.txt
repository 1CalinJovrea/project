Grief manifests in many forms.

Choppy editing issues, But superb.For starters the film has some incredible acting...Jake is utterly
convincing in his role as a selfish and seemingly heartless individual
devoid of emotion until tragedy entails. The pick up in his thought
process is a slow but necessary approach as his mental health issues
pick up subtle but convincing time frames and the viewer is left a
50/50 decision on whether you actually like him or not. This is no mean
feat for an actor with such a tragic story line and he pulls it off
brilliantly.I would however of liked the mental health issues that surround the
process of grief further explored and a stronger message to go out to
the audience that grief manifests in so many individual ways that you
are never wrong with the way you feel...Its a very precious and
intimate individual process.Naomi Watts character is a little bizarre and almost unnecessary in my
view but I will not spoil anything here.A good just under two hours spent in my opinion with a a lot of
thinking to continue for the rest of the evening. A solid 7/10 from me.
