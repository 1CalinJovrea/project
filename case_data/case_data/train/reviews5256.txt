bored to death

What people may find in this movie I can not understand;you experience
endless closeups of Mr. Phoenix talking with his supposed OS, and
saying things so banal and so boring that you want to just close your
eyes or , even better, leave the theater.I suppose it was meant to be
clever, sentimental, atmospheric, beautiful, but I found it
unbearable.I really wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad with all
the prizes and the reviews it receives, and the director whom I never
considered great but promising yes.It just makes me wonder how people
liked the film.I'm not raging against it;it was just an experience I
would very much like to have avoided.
