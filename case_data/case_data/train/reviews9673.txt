Struggle to Survive

Alex is an engaged woman and a photographer and Ben is a doctor who is
a neurosurgeon who is in a troubled marriage.Both are on their destination and how that when the pilot played by
Beau Bridges has a fatal stroke and crash landsAs both have to deal and lean on one another. Despite hardly knowing
each other but they form a bond despite differences. As they bond with
a dog also on board While with injuries with Ben helping himself and
Alex in the patching them upBut with little food, hardly any rest, and fearing they may not make
it. Both discover each other and themselves in ways that they never
could have.Kate Winslet and Idris Elba in the lead roles do well and they are in
the only two that are in the film for about 90% of the time. They do
well with the elements against them and handle it with both grace and
being gutsy.Great film ans really it is a struggle to survive.
