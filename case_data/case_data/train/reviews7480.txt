Brilliant movie.. worth a watch!

I went in to the cinema with no expectations with this movie. I watched
the trailer and assumed it will be some average movie but I was totally
mistaken. The film is very fast paced with surprisingly some humor
throughout. There was a lot of gruesome fight scenes (I personally jump
watching violent scenes) but I get the reasons why they were there. Dan
Stevens was a complete shocker with his performance. If you remember
him from Downtown Abbey, his performance here is amazing! He portrays a
brilliant character and he does an amazing American accent. All the
actors were perfectly cast for this movie. I loved Maika Monroe, she
reminded me a lot of Brittany Murphy and Gwen Stefani. The ending was
totally not expected and I loved every bit. The music played reminded
me a bit of Drive soundtrack but worked brilliant with this movie. I
truly recommend the movie!!
