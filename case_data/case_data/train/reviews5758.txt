Life is a high stakes game. This is how to play it.

Yesterday evening watched this movie and loved it, couldn't take my
eyes off. This is not a gambling movie, this is a movie on pain. Existential
pain. The character, Jim, played amazingly by Mark Wahlberg is the
essence of it.Grown up in a rich family. Intelligent. Always been told he's the
smartest & talented person in the room. But deep inside he feels
mediocrity. Be is bored to the hilt. He doesn't f***ing care about
cars, money, his looks and even women anymore. This is a movie about feeling alive, taking risks in life, because
without a risk you're a mediocre bum, you are essentially dead. And
this is exactly how Jim is feeling. Everything he does is to escape
that, his flamboyant teaching, his gambling, his f*** you mentality.Deep inside he feels he has to put it all on the line, everything, his
family, all his money, his life even. Doing this is the only thing that
can essentially set him free.He's s stubborn and cocky f*** knowing that his only release is giving
everything up, be humiliated, be on the ground and that's the basis of
becoming a new and free man.Coming down to the existential reason for self destruction, first we
need to burn everything down, before me can build a new city on top of
it.This is his escape from his addiction, his ego & his depression. Life
is a high stakes game.Perfectly done in a grim & tense setting. Loved it, very inspiring.
Thanks for making this movie!
