Innovatively clich√©.

Hot babysitter turns out to be part of a satanic cult that kills people
as sacrifice. Pretty standard stuff, right?It turns out that the movie starts with a "boom": funny, well paced,
well edited and actually smart for once. Cinematography, lightening
and, again, editing were innovative and riveting (somewhat remembered
me of Nicolas Winding Refn) but the cutting-edge aspects died down as
the movie stalled through the common route taken by many other horror
movies. Along that path, absurdity grew as the originality diminished,
resulting in a predictability, but once again showed improvement in the
last few minutes of the film.Still, it's worth remembering the whole experience was very enjoyable
and funny. Sometimes even edge-of-your-seat tense. The few jumpscares
weren't effective in the least, even though a shame, it was to be
expected and did not affect my entertainment (and should not affect
yours either). This is the definition of late night flick. It's not bad enough to make
you cringe, not complicated enough to give you headaches, but rather
gory and funny enough to make you relax and enjoy your evening.
