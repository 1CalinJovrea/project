Fascinating ! - A masterpiece

Don't expect to see Drive's sequel, it would make no sense ! If you
don't know Refn's movie you've got to know 3 important things : - He
makes contemplative movies. With a lot of silence and a minimalist
screenplay. - He said "Art is an act of violence" so don't expect to
see a peaceful movie. - Drive is the least representative movie of his
style.You'll need to create yourself a part of the story because it's a movie
between reality and nightmare. It's a philosophical and metaphysical
movie. A true experimental & artistic movie.This movie is fascinating ! Cinemathography is beautifully worked, use
of the red light is perfect, framing also. Production design and the
places make us perfectly return in the dark side of the film. We remain
completely speechless front of the pictures that are beautiful,
surprising and deeply disturbing. Violence becomes poetry.The story speaks about the male impotence, revenge is put on side,
there is no real hero. Just the story of a lost man who seeks his way,
other side a cop who thinks he is God. It's to the spectator to find
the morals of the story.The music (electro-pop) and Vithaya's interpretations are in total
agreement with the progression of the story and the pictures.The actors succeed in transmitting the feelings and impressions of the
characters with simple glances.We leave the room completely disturbed, while being posed full with
questions, trying to assimilate all the asked questions by the artist,
but completely fascinated and excited !It is simple either one loves, or one hates this film. I loved it !Refn signs one of his best movies, he assumes completely his style and
(in my opinion) proposes to us a real masterpiece.
