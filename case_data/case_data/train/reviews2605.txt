Numerous plot holes in a sad uneven premise.

I wasn't sure if it was better to write a spoiler-free review, but
ultimately this movie is a waste of time so I will spoil it for you in
an effort to keep you away from it.In a nutshell, both Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis can control with
their movements 2 giant Godzilla-ish entities, a monster and a robot,
which are mysteriously appeared in S. Korea, creating havoc!The reason for that goes 25 years back, when their characters were kids
and have their school projects (a miniature "city" each with the
monster and the robot respectively) destroyed because of a freaky
storm-like event on their way to school.In the end **Ending Spoiler ahead** Anne Hathaway KILLS Jason Sudeikis,
to stop him for destroying Seoul, something he wanted to do because
...he hated himself!!!OK. There are countless plot-holes in this that I won't bother you
with. However from the beginning you have the feeling that this movie
must (?) have a deeper meaning, like, both characters are alcoholic-ish
and disappointed from their lives, so the monsters might have something
to do with that. Maybe a hidden moral for the way you treat others and
feeling sorry for yourself.Unfortunately this is NOT the case. No moral or even a bottom line
here. And the, plain and simple, MURDER of Sudeikis's character
pollutes and destroys any virtues Hathaway's character might have tried
to show.Overall: Because of the weird premise (2 people to control 2 monsters
on the other corner of the planet) you might want to watch it for an
explanation. Believe me, it's not worth the trouble. As a movie it's
not entertaining either, despite its 2 well known stars. The ending is
dressed as a "happy ending" but in reality it is a sad one..
