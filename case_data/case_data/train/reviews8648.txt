Absurd and Ostentatious

The captions on the poster on Pompeii, reads "No Warning, No Escape" -
a fair warning for audiences entering this mega-turd. A shiny Hollywood
steamer, "Pompeii" is comically absurd. It is amongst the turkeys of
movies for 2014. Director Paul W.S. Anderson is certainly more focused
on look than substance, and the direction is egregiously poor - which
follows in kind with poor acting. It is a shameless money-grab hardly
worth the free library check-out. The storyline and look steals a good
deal from the markedly better "Gladiator"; the other side of the story
is a big, dumb D- quality effects disaster flick with the Mt Vesuvius
volcano. The fact that characters are ignoring the pending doom is
chief among it's inadequacies. Logic is thrown away in favor gloss. The
music only added to the aburdity, blaring and grand amplifying the
ridiculousness. I had heard from a co- worker that it was bad, and it
was completely that. Not Recommended.
