Such high hopes

This review has spoilers pretty early on.I can't believe so many people gave this movie such a high rating. The
Best Offer starts off great but then quickly fizzles into an abyss of
dullness. It went from moderately paced to a snails crawl after Virgil
discovered Claire's secret apartment. If it weren't for the description of the film as a crime drama mystery
I wouldn't of known where to expect the movie to go. The main question
rolling around in my brain was why would Virgil choose Robert as his
confidant when he and Billy were friends for years? Secondly, why would
Sarah discuss Robert's affairs with Virgil? Lastly, why was Billy so
intent on convincing Virgil of his love and friendship?The whole time I kept wondering when the big climax was going to
happen. At the end when all was revealed it wasn't a big surprise that
Claire, Robert, Billy, Fred, and Sarah con Virgil out of his art
collection. Thankfully Sylvia Hoeks shows great skill in playing the crazy Claire.
Listening to her hysterics gave me anxiety. She was amazing and
annoying at the same time. Geoffrey Rush gave a solid performance. I
also like the fact Virgil is a con artist and has OCD. If the producers
had cut out the unnecessary scenes they could have developed their
characters more.If you are looking for a movie that builds excitement as it progresses
then this movie isn't for you. It's a pretty predictable plot with zero
surprises.
