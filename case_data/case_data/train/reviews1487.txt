A must see...

Personally I found nothing wrong with this movie which is something I
rarely say when I go to the theaters now days. The cast was great and
really got you interested in the characters. It stayed mostly true to
the actual story of these brave men whilst throwing in a little bit
more drama and action to "Hollywood" it. The ending will have you
shedding a tear even though we all knew what happens going into it. Was
well worth the money spent and deserves a higher rating than critics
have given it.
