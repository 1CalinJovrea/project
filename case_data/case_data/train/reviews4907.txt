Outrageously awful

This is my first review of a movie ever. I feel like it's my duty to
warn people of this non-sense, incoherent, IQ-lowering, completely
utter dogshit of a movie. I'm not even exaggerating, it is THAT bad. I
went in with great expectations, as the sky-high reviews presents the
movie as one of 2016's finest. Oh man, was I wrong to trust these
reviews.After half an hour in, the amount of cringe was unbearable, but I was
determined to finish it, it had to get better, right? Oh man, was I
wrong once again. I gave up after an hour, I felt like the movie
drained me of all will to live, I was on the edge of depression when I
had to close my laptop and take a deep breath to prevent myself from
crying. How this is rated one of 2016's best movies, is beyond me. I
NEVER bail out halfway through a movie, this was the first time, and I
don't feel guilty. I should've turned it off an hour earlier.Mark my words: This is a complete waste of time. Sitting in a tree for
a week straight is more beneficial than watching this. I feel scammed,
and cheated of my time. After 1 hour I had no idea WTF the plot was,
and it did not interest me the slightest to find out.ROCK BOTTOM: Crowe's performance 0,00000/10 - Halfway
wannabe-witty/badass (but comes out as a tired, uninterested fatass
with a complete absence of charm) One just wishes for his scenes to be
over, for the movie to be over really. Makes you wanna cram your ears
and eyes full of dirt.BEST MOMENT: Ryan Goslings scream when Crowe snaps his arm.
