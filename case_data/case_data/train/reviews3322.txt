The Future Is Here

Technology, a useful resource that has contributed to mankind and
evolution for many years. With time man and machine start to become one
with unlimited possibilities to create and evolve.Sometimes fiction is not that far apart from reality.This is what Ghost
in the Shell brings us with this live action adaptation that explores
the meaning of being human.As a big fan of the Ghost in the Shell universe I have to say this was
my most expected film of the year, counting the days for its release
and finally it is here, but did it leave up to the hype? The Story: For those unfamiliar with the 1995 anime film Ghost in the
Shell fear not, the story is well paced and easy to understand for
newcomers and for fans this was a very special experience as the story
has a new but at the same time familiar feeling that makes you say This
is Ghost in the Shell.Art: The futuristic world portrayed in this film is absolutely
beautiful to look at, the CGI is so good that sometimes I forgot it was
CGI, in my opinion they represented the world of Ghost in the Shell
perfectly.I was very happy with Scarlett Johansson performance in this film, she
became the major and did an amazing job at it, not only is she
beautiful but very talented to make one of the most well known
characters in the history of the anime industry her own.If you still have doubts about going to the movie theater to see this
movie, please do yourself a favor and go watch it now you will not
regret it. It is definitely an experience not to be missed.
