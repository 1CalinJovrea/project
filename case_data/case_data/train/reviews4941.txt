Uneven Story Telling is Boosted by Spectacular Visuals

Adapted from Pierre Christin and Jean-Claude Mézières long-running
French sci-fi comics series Valérian And Laureline. Luc Besson creates
a stunning visual feast. Besson's attention to detail is immaculate.
And that along side the quirky dialog's between Laureline and Valerian
are what keep this film afloat. I might be in the minority, but I
prefer my films to be lengthy. However in this case, Valerian feels
overstuffed trying to add more depth to the story at every turn. This
film might have benefited from a shorter run time. The biggest surprise
was Laureline(Delevingne), her character is what kept my interest
throughout the film and her acting was actually on point. As someone
who was skeptical about her casting, I'm glad to be proved wrong. Not
saying it's her breakout performance, Just saying she's improving and
perhaps she might have a future as an actress. Everyone deserves a
second chance.Grade: B-
