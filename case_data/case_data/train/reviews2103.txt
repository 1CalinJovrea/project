Childhood Awesomeness

I was the only adult who didn't bring kids to the theater and all I can
say is that I was leading the clapping when the credits rolled."The Lego Movie" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely
satisfying film for all ages- that is, if you have ever played with
Legos. Even people that have never bought a Lego set will this enjoy
this awesomely humorous and in the end, heartfelt movie.(Notice I am using the word awesome a lot, because one cannot stop
singing the "Everything is awesome" song played in the movie. Too
catchy!)The creators did a wonderful job putting all the classic things about
Legos and making a new movie packed with humor.The voice actors were outstanding. You can tell they really enjoyed
doing the movie and put in a lot of effort. Liam Neeson was fantastic
as the Good Cop/Bad Cop. But the most credit to the success of this
movie goes to Will Farrell who played the villain, President Business.
He gives such a great effort in this movie which allows you to laugh,
smile, and want more Lego awesomeness.I give the Lego movie a big two thumbs up and is by far the best
picture I've seen in a few months. Highly recommend this movie to all
Lego lovers who have a passion to build and create something awesome,
just like the movie makers created this amazingly, AWESOME, film.
