Mind Blown

This movie was a total mind bleep. Allow me to take you through my
emotional time line of the movie.Phase 1--Excited. Electric beginning. Action right away with some good
special effects. Immediately drawn in.Phase 2--A tad bored. Story time. Nice story but not what I came for. I
came for a good time travel sci-fi not a tragic life story, however
unique.Phase 3--Layers begin to be peeled back. Start to see what's really
going on. Mind starts to melt.Phase 4--The end. The brain has exploded trying to comprehend it all.It was a crazy series of events, an insane temporal loop, it was
fantastic.
