Nothing to like

Got to give Michael Bay credit for this, he has completely outdone
himself on this occasion. He has made some pretty terrible films, and I
didn't think he could do worse that what he done before, but this is a
truly terrible film. That takes skill.But seriously, there is nothing at all to like about this film. The
plot, what there is, is basic and predictable. Its an attack on the
senses, the action sequences, which is pretty much the whole film, are
so idiotic that its almost impossible to keep track. The end scene left
me dizzy, as well as giving me a headache. The acting is appalling, and
the speaking parts make very little sense with the Turtles talking
gibberish and contributing nothing to the story.
