From the Grindhouse to the Art House.

Watching a film show on TV a few years ago,I caught a clip of what
looked to be an ultra-stylised Horror film whose appearance was
inspired by Nicolas Winding Refn's Neo-Noir Drive. (which despite being
a fan of the soundtrack,I've still not seen!)After the title appeared
to quickly disappear,I was pleased to finally stumble on the film,which
led to me getting ready to find out how maniac this maniac could be.The plot:Going on a date with Lucie, Frank Zito discovers that he has forgotten
to bring his meds with him,which help to keep dangerous impulses at
bay.Going back Lucie's flat,Zito tries to quickly leave due to taking a
fancy to Lucie and his dangerous side becoming a struggle to restrain.
Believing that he wants to leave due to not giving him any
"action",Lucie tries to have sex with Zito.As he gets caught up in
Lucie's lust,Zito's homicidal rage becomes unleashed,which leads to
Zito killing Lucie and cutting her scalp off (!)Returning to the mannequin business (which must have made them
millionaires!) that his mum used to run,Zito brings Lucie "home" by
stapling her scalp onto a mannequin,so that she can join all the other
women in Zito's bedroom,who he hides away from the haunting memory of
his mother.Just as Zito is closing up the shop one day,avant-garde
artist Anna D'Antoni walks pasts and spots the mannequins in the
window. Admiring the hair-raising level of detail that Zito has put
into his designs, D'Antoni decides that her next exhibition will have
the Zito's mannequin as the centrepiece.Falling in love for the first
time ever,Zito finds himself trying to keep his bloodthirsty maniac
side at bay.View on the film:Being (almost) entirely filmed in first person,director Franck Khalfoun
& cinematographer Maxime Alexandre run the risk of turning the movie
into a Slasher First Person Shooter,as the viewer gets to see Zito kill
the next "dumb" women like an end of level challenge. Smartly avoiding
the voyeurism opportunity, Khalfoun & Alexandre place the title between
the burnt-up Grindhouse and the elegant Neo- Noir Art House.Backed by a superb Industrial grind and foggy synch score from Robin
Coudert, Khalfoun & Alexandre pull the titles Grindhouse Slasher roots
up with extreme, confrontational violence,as each of the vicious
set-pieces is focused on the harrowing reaction of the victim,which
cleverly makes sure that the audience always side with the victim,and
not with Zito. Stepping out of the brittle Grindhouse backdrop of the
original, Khalfoun places his Slasher killer in the middle of a
dazzling Neo-Noir world. Displaying the full location with the (near)
full use of first person pov, Khalfoun & Alexandre deliver brilliantly
handled,ultra-stylised tracking shots with bright pinks and neon reds
and yellows dashing across the screen,which light up the elegant art
world,as the mind of loner Frank Zito rots away in the shadows.Keeping the body count down to single figures,the screenplay by
Alexandre Aja & Gr√©gory Levasseur keeps away from making any of the
victims (none of whom own a mobile phone!) cardboard cut-outs,with
Zito's attempts to stay sane allowing it to be shown that those most
affected (from Rock chick Lucie to warm-hearted Anna) are victims who
did not do anything wrong at all.Whilst Zito's Slasher killer is
allowed to shine in the set pieces,the writers peel away Zito's horror
side to reveal a Neo-Noir loner,with Zito's grasping of his meds
allowing it to slowly sink in for Frank that he will never be able to
escape the darkness.Limited to his voice and hands being the lone features to appear for
most of the movie, Elijah Wood gives an excellent performance as
Zito,thanks to Wood keeping Zito's foaming at the mouth rage pinned
down by a Film Noir isolation,with Wood revealing in desperate screams
Zito's attempts to stay away from getting another victim.Joining
Wood,the stunning Nora Arnezeder gives a great performance as Anna
D'Antoni,who is given a sweet,care-free soulfulness by Arnezeder,as
Zito tries to kill the maniac within for Anna.
