Nasty Elijah

MANIAC is an unwanted remake of the classic Joe Spinell video nasty of
the same name from 1980, a film about a psychopath with a habit of
scalping women. This new version follows exactly the same story (right
down to the horrific nightmare climax) with 'improved' CGI gore effects
over the original, although I have to say they're nowhere near the
quality of the much-remembered Tom Savini prosthetic effects work.In any case, this is an incredibly dark odyssey of murder and madness.
I thought the material would have been watered down but this is just as
grisly and depressing as the original. There's plenty of reason to
watch, not least Elijah Wood who makes a good psychopath (as he did in
SIN CITY); the whole film is shot through the killer's point of view
which gives things an edgy, fresh feel. I loved the use of music and
cinematography throughout, which reminded me of Refn's style in DRIVE,
so it's a little bit of a shame that the story is so unrelentingly dark
and miserable. I'd love to see an action or martial arts film done in
this same POV style, though.
