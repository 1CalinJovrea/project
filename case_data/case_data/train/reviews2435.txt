The hype surrounding this movie made we want to go see a fantastic
action drama with awesome camera work.I didn't get any of it.Characters were shallow and the chance to show us a 3D spectacle were
hopelessley missed.I felt I didn't care about the rich people wanting to do something real
and felt as if there wasn't enough in the story about the local people
or way of life.Not so much a disaster movie as a disaster.So much potential wasted .
