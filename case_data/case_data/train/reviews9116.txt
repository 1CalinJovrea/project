Not overly fresh or witty, but enjoyable all the same.

Disregarding the countless straight-to-DVD duds that tenuously hailed
themselves as "sequels", Reunion is the fourth instalment into the
ultra-crude and hugely popular American Pie franchise. The cast are all
13 years older, but that adolescent giddiness they possessed back in
1999 when making the original (and by far the best) Pie thankfully
hasn't been lost. It's a shame then that the material they're working
with is half-baked. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg's screenplay is
lacklustre and derivative, relying on rehashed gags and goodwill toward
the familiar characters to tickle the funny bone, rather than anything
fresh or witty. Still, it's a major bonus to have basically everyone
from the first movie return, including MILF guy #2 and the Sherminator,
and veteran comedians Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge are fantastic
as Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mum (their end credits gag is the funniest
of the film), so I couldn't help but watch this with a smile on my
face.
