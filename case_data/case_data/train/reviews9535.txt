It's just really, really bad

So this movie is a sequel to the Divergent, pretty likable movie.The movie kinda starts where the last one left us, but the story turns
very boring quickly.When it comes to some action, it's just plain horrible. So many
clich√©s, but even worse. For example, a group of trained professionals
shoots at people running towards the train. Shooters are basically
hidden in the woods and shooting the runners, they don't hit anyone,
but the runners shoot back (with no aim basically) and manage to shoot
some. Facepalm #1.Later there is another scene where these "runners" are attacked by
armed professionals. They appear in groups and descend on the roof of a
building by some ropes, as they are shooting at these runners. They
can't hit a single person out of three, although they are running away
from them in a straight line. When they reach the roof, they keep
shooting but miss every time.At this point I started laughing at the stupidity of it and left the
cinema. Yes, it is THAT bad.
