The Alamo for a younger generation

Pulsating, riveting, terrifying and explosive are the words read as
reviews of the Michael Bay action film recreating the siege on the
American Embassy and the secret U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. The
experience is palatable every moment under attack, whether on the
foreign city streets or awaiting each attack. Panic with each time
asked are we expecting friendlies or wondering if the heavily armed
local militia will be taking American lives in a matter of minutes. The words you won't hear are drama, spirit, reason or sympathy. This
story has been retold in brilliant colorful explosion and bombastic
sound. You feel like you are under attack every time, which is the draw
of war movies. Repeat viewing comes from the experience our the
cinematic event. I'm not sure what that is, other than of the six
contracted security agents who did what they've been trained to do with
honor and GI Joe bravado.Reducing the Benghazi story to 13 hours doesn't tell the whole story,
as we all know and not taking a stand on the issue reduces 13 hours to
an experience devoid of meaning for this viewer.
