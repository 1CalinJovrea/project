Let the child in you enjoy this adventure

Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about
prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of
laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages:
Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a
person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for
the ride and let yourself enjoy life.I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation.
There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the
right thing for their children if given the chance.While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the
childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed.Well done!
