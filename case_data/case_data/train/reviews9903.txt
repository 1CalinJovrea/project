Highlander meets Constantine

Vin Diesel plays Witch hunter who is cursed with immortality, he goes
there the centuries preventing any supernatural disasters from
happening. Until a mysterious figure appears that may have a connection
to his past. It's up to him to uncover the secret before a disaster may
come afoot? The film is not bad, but not great either. It spots they could have
done better that what they have done. I do admire that it does not try
to be over the top with camp. Vin Diesel does give quite a
sophisticated performance, at no point I fell he never tries to over do
it. Elijah Wood is also memorable in his role. And the effects are
alright, an entertaining movie to pass the time.
