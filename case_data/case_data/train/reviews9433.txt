this movie is nothing but a beggar in box office

this movie sux on so many levels , first of all by reading Herodotus
history you will see that this movie is a poor effort to manipulate
viewers' minds by telling lies about Persian empire.1.darius died due to poor health not killed by some coward made up
archer.2.athen was burned as an accident when the residents were escaping.3.arthemis was not killed in the battle !!! 4.Artemisia's father was
the king of Halicarnassus and parents were not killed and raped by
Greeks.5.she was a respected,brave and the first women in history to be a
naval commander (being a mastermind in battles),she was not a cold
blood killer.6.the first human right rules were written by Achaemenid dynasty,how
could they be this cruel?? when women in Greece were nothing but slaves
in Persia they could become army commanders! 7.Persia had the greatest
and most powerful army in that period (owning 40% of all the
world),they had a permanent army named Persian immortals which was
unique ( those times there was no permanent army, they were raised
whenever there was a war).how could they be slain like melon?? i can go
on and on about the lies this movie is trying to publish to replace the
true history by making false heroes ,showing some goofy farmers (as
they themselves announce) with six packs and incredible fighting skills
.beside all these negative points, the movie itself was so boring i
wanted to leave the theater.all the scenes are dark and i couldn't see
the action moves most of the time.at least the first movie(beside being
another fake historical movie)one was entertaining special effect wise.
please don't pay for this pile of nonsense and spend your money to by
the history books and read about the real events if you are interested
in such historical events.
