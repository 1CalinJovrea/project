Not for everyone

I came into this movie expecting to be laughing almost the whole time,
but I sat through the movie almost bored out of my mind! I was on the
verge of getting up and leaving but that would of been rude. So instead
I sat through the almost unbearable part of the movie where Ted and
John (Mark Wahlberg)have a big fight (surprise surprise) and John's
girlfriend dumps him (another surprise -_-) it's just a barrage of
clich√©s to be honest. The humour of the film was well below mediocre. I
didn't understand some the jokes because they were referencing a
celebrity that I have never heard about. The other jokes are about
drugs, swearing and getting drunk. The only time I managed a laugh was
when Ted was pretending to be a retard . All in all If you're American
you'd probably understand and enjoy this movie more than I did. If not,
stay away!
