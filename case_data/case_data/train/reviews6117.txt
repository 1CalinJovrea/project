You Need To Sit On Great Ideas

A game of cricket assembles a mixed bag of English elites. A sport that
mirrors the social tango that the players must navigate to find their
partners. High priority is given to sportsmanship and aggression can
lead to total interpersonal suicide. On this day, Robin wishes to risk
it by thwacking the ball over his target.Diana feels the breeze from the sphere, and suddenly her eyes become
centered on the brash young man that sent the projectile her way. They
fall asleep on the fast-forward button as their romance spirals into a
subcontinent birth. The ambition of the pair make for an everlasting
honeymoon.A pathogen demon invades Robin's spinal column and his limbs are eaten
from the inside. The intruder attacks the mind and heart as well. A
dark blanket descends over Robin's bed as he communicates through
pitiful blinks and gurgles. Trapped in the instrument that gave him a
wife and son, he wallows in self-deprivation. With her husband conceding the fight, Diana becomes a foot soldier and
mobilizes a legendary assembly of peers. Ladies and gentlemen who have
a knack for excavating laughter from mires, these colleagues put
impossible smiles on Robin's stagnant face.The expression exuding from Robin's cheeks and brows stir an
unfathomable determination in his friends. Talking them into suicidal
missions, they are reluctant at first, then exuberant supporters of his
cause. Living truly becomes an obsession of Robin's and those around
him catch the bug as well.Quality of life standards vary tremendously dependent on where you
travel. Some places limit this arbitrary concept, and others exploit
it. Whether you live in excess or are trapped in institutions or class
prisons, there are doors to fulfillment. Robin Cavendish was merely a
spoken person for the idea of "better".
