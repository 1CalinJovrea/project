Box of Wishes

To begin, this is definitely not a very good film. What's on screen
views as a promising second draft that needed a bit of story expansion
and nuance by the screenwriter. It not helpful the script is directed
just as written, meaning no atmosphere, mood or imagination. Young Joey
King plays Claire, a high school student who comes into possession of a
Chinese Wish box and granted seven wishes which are paid for by the
death of those closest to her. Claire's vapid wishes lead to several
deaths that take place in a vacuum. If you have seen a "Final
Destination" film you've seen how this goes, The redeeming feature of
the story is the writer has set up a rather interesting twist at the
end, however, it mostly just sits at the beginning and end, ignored ,
almost like a draft. It's so underdeveloped, I was halfway home before
I realized how clever it might have been. Watch the dog's scenes at the
beginning.
