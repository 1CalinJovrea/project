fun silly movie

yes, this is a movie for young viewers, but it is fun. silliness and a
simple story. but frankly we don't have enough of them in this movie
era. the colors are great, the animation is fun and frankly as an
adult, i did enjoy it. this movie is pure escape. it is fun to hear the
voices of such esteemed actors playing such fun characters. Sometimes i
think so many reviewers feel they must pan movies as they don't relay
various critical standards.. However, this one isn't one. i like many
types of movies and this is one of them. a purely fun and colorful take
on things. enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it! not all
movies need that. it is great for kids and adults if you look at it as
being simply fun! i am well over 21 and liked it very much!
