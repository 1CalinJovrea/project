Stylish and fun, however Margot Robbie ruined the second half.

I would of rated the film a 9 if it just continued in the first half as
a good, flashy, stylish and intelligent film but the second half then
turned the film into another horrible Mr And Mrs Smith all because of
Margot Robbie and Will Smith's romance. I was cautious about rating
this film as high as I did at first, but then I decided that I would
because the first half was so good, but the second half was a real
stinker and deserved a 5. The film had so much potential at the start
but then just slipped off the rails, I guess, and I never actually
thought that I could of felt this way for a movie before. The
cinematography could of also been a lot better, but because the editing
is so good, the humour is funny and the fact that the first half was
genius I think I will say that I enjoyed this. Watch the first half of
the film, then imagine up a second half, no need for a long review.
