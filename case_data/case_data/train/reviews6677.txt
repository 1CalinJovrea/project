Watch-able?

I didn't expect much from this movie. In fact, the only reason why I
went to watch it was because of Vin Diesel. It's another one of those Hollywood clich√© filled movies. Don't expect
much of a storyline other than bad things happened to my family, I
became a witch hunter, defied death and killed witches. It's just
filled with moments you know exactly how they're going to turn out if
you've seen any other movie from Hollywood. The visual effects were good enough. And the actors played their role.
The plot has so much potential. Something like knights of the round
table dedicated to incarcerating witches for using black magic. It's a
nice idea but poorly executed since the idea is crushed half way into
the movie. Go see it if you like 21st century shotgun + sword action and Vin
Diesel. Otherwise stay way from it.
