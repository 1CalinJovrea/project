worst time for picturizing the Kipling story

In the age of tigers getting extinct, it was not the time for a simple
picturizing of the Kipling story. Too bad for all the effort Disney put
in the animation but, unlike many old stories out there, this one
needed badly a re-editing.The movie? - the animation is very good, considering other movies so
far - the high level story is unchanged - Disney funny "flowers"
present: jokes, songs, lines, characters, etc. - drama present, tooIf the first three points prepare a stage for kids, the last one
brutally denies it.Coming back to reality, Mowgli will probably not have to worry about
Sharekan anymore soon.
