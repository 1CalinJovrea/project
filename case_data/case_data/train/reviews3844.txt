The incredible Saiorse Ronan.

Saiorse Ronan needs to be in more movies. She's an absolute delight,
whatever she's in. Brooklyn is Ronan's finest 111 minutes to date. All
the anguish, all the emotion she portrays, is seen through her eyes.
Eilis (Ronan), is torn between two worlds: Ireland and America, missing
her family back home and starting afresh halfway across the world in
Brooklyn, New York. Events that occur only make it harder for Eilis.
Emory Cohen's Tony sparks confidence in our out-of-sorts protagonist.
Ronan's acting is so brazenly from the heart that I can't help but feel
everything she feels, even during her hardest times. Special mention
goes to Julie Walters who oversees the girls in the boarding house that
Eilis resides. Brooklyn is an extraordinary watch due to class acting
from all round. It's funny, clever and charming.
