Boring, Slow and seriously terrible musical score

Admittedly I have never been much of a Natalie Portman fan. That being
said, I think it was pretty ballsy of her taking on an American icon,
and her work, particularly in trying to get Jackie's "breathless"
voice, is commendable though NOT Oscar-worthy.Just too many long camera shots - five minutes to watch her from behind
walking through rooms of the White House...several times I caught
myself yawning. The expressionless face of Billy Crudup as the
interviewer - yawn again - and absolutely abysmal minor chords
pretending to be a movie musical score, more jarring than anything on
screen.Having just watched The American Experience's terrific RFK documentary
a week or so ago, I was struck by why the director would chose a
fifty-something, tall, heavy-set actor to play a 34 or 35 year old
slim-ish, not very tall Bobby Kennedy - the actor showing almost no
emotion at all when Bobby was known to flair up, shout, and when moved,
express his emotions.The reason I give this a 3 instead of a 2 is the lovely performance by
John Hurt as the priest. I did not recognize him until the last scene.
