Much Closer to the TMNT we love!

I remember being very excited for the first TMNT reboot. The CGI models
for the turtles looked great, It was made by Nickelodeon, and the
trailer brought back nostalgia. Then i went to see it and i was like,
"Ehhh." It was by no means terrible, it just wasn't GREAT. The plot was
recycled from The Amazing Spiderman, the shredder wasn't a compelling
enemy, and.. well, Meagan Fox. I did enjoy the turtle's characters and
was hoping for a sequel with a better story. And, more or less, that's
what i got.It was by no means perfect, as it was still Michael Bayed to the max,
but it provided enough nostalgia, good story, good action, and great
characters to keep you entertained the entire movie. Megan Fox's
performance was improved over the last film and so was Will Arnet's.
The character of Casey Jones was well done and was my favorite
character in the movie. The CGI was improved from the last movie and
the turtles were even more lovable. The best improvement by far was the villains. Unlike the first movie
the villains were fun, cool, and compelling. Shredder's character was
greatly improved with a cooler and more original outfit. Also
Rocksteady and Bebop were well done and were very funny. It was nice to
see the Foot Clan using swords instead of guns. And Finally, the
surprise appearance from Krang was excellent as he was my favorite
enemy in the original cartoon. His design was great and he looked
awesome. Then, Just as the movie ends, you get a rock and roll version of the
original theme song during the credits that was so epic! It was a
nostalgia trip! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. Keep up the good work
Michael Bay, this may be your best work yet.
