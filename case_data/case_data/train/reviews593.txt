The first one wasn't good but this one really sucks

I remember not liking the first one, but still spending an okay- time.
I remember thinking it was "too much" but still, I managed to find some
things to appreciate. So after hesitating a little, I decided to try
this one, because I wanted to watch the kind of movie where you can
disconnect your brain and enjoy. Even though my expectations were very low.. it was awful.I watched the movie with a friend... we laughed a lot. But only once or
twice because of the dialogues and numerous jokes... the rest was us
mocking... well everything. The plot, the "twists", the "jokes"...
Mainly, the problem is the scenario... nothing is coherent, and the
worse is that the film wants to give the impression that it's really
smart. Directing is chaotic and messy in order to make you feel lost
and to make you think it's so intelligent that you can't follow
everything. But the truth is everything is stupid and lacks
credibility. Some movies are doing too much on purpose and it's okay as
long as they are not taking themselves too seriously. But here it's the
opposite, and I feel like the director is insulting my intelligence.I could also comment one some scenes but I don't want to "spoil",
especially one that last 10 minutes and brings nothing. It just
highlights how stupid is the script. The scene is supposed to be
impressive with special effects but makes no sense. It's just an excuse
to put as much special effects and "magic" as possible.I'm stopping now because criticizing this movie can take hours. The
three stars left? I think it's for Morgan Freeman (you have to love him
even in dumb movies), the musics and the laugh I had mocking it.
