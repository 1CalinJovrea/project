A world of fantasy from a timeless story

I loved this film! I loved the creative twists and turns, the
unexpected friendships and the ability to lose myself in a story from
my childhood. Rejuvenated to allow my imagination to explore a timeless
plot running down a new path. The acting was good enough for me to
believe in the characters and want to see what will happen next. (I'm
hoping for a sequel!) For me it's not about the special effect or the
perfect screenplay. it's about wanting to immerse myself in the story
and keep watching! I liked that it resembled other story lines (Hook
was another of my favorites!) That made it comforting and familiar, yet
new and exciting! I'm just a person....a grandmother that likes to
share an experience with my grandchildren....a mother that still wants
to phone my kids and say wow you have to watch this!.....A professional
who likes to write in our company newsletter a "not to be missed"
review....For whatever reason technical or otherwise that you didn't like this
film. I don't pretend to understand why? But if like me you just want
to sit with a bucket of popcorn and get lost in the fantasy...Then go
watch this.....and just lose yourself for a little while!
