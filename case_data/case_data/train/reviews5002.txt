Big name Characters doing Low Budget films for a paycheck..

Another one of those big name Hollywood actors does budget film movie.
It was what I expected.. Something to put on in the background. Highly
unbelievable. The kids walkie talkie that's used can only get like 30ft
in real life.. I know, I have used one.. let alone work in a built up
mall... and speaking of mall, it looked nothing of a nth American Mall.
More like a set for a stage production. I think they said "built in the
80s and never upgraded" to explain the dire look of the mall. could have been better,.. .then again, it could have been worse..
