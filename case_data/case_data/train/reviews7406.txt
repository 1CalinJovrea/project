Good until a certain point

What I thought I was watching was a puzzling cross section of the
modern roman social and political panorama, a glimpse into the
luxuriant local fauna made of creepy characters, politicians, religious
men and criminals that fill everyday's Italian commentaries. Until a
certain point it was sadly authentic even if I personally found the
overall stile a little redundant with an overwhelming and intrusive
soundtrack that, together with an accurate cinematography gave me that
"MTV videoclip" sensation. Then the ultimate "pop" turning point, with
the last "revenge of the nerds" 15 minutes. There was no need to it,
the movie already told us everything it needed to and that was good,
why ruining it all with that comics style ending..?
