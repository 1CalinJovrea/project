funny

Definitely a film which belongs under the must watch section. so funny
had me in stitches its witty,clever, funny, excitable. if you love
comedy films then this is just the film for you. A well matched /
unmatched family forced to do something to keep their heads a float.
Great name for a great film. Seen this so many times now.Just cant stop
watching it. It has just become one of my favourite films of all time.
Perfect for any audience over the age of say 15 due to the drug nature
in this film. anything with Jennifer Aniston is worth a watch in my
eyes even if it was rubbish which it wasn't. 10 out of 10 from me. as
previously described 'so dumb yet so funny' i agree completely. you
will be surprised about how much you will laugh at this real film. its
a bit like real life in so many ways but so funnier.
