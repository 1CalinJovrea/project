7
Classic case of book > film

I think a rating of 7 is slightly clutching at straws however I did
enjoy the film so I want to reflect that. I think that it helps that
I've read the book enough times for me to have the complete story in my
head, things that didn't seem significant to the story until they were
missing... I saw this film with friends who hadn't read the book and
they didn't enjoy the film as much as me. For me, reading the book first meant that the film was like adding
extra bonus content.. being able to put images in my head although I do
think some may watch it and just notice that it wasn't as good in
comparison. I think it's worth a watch if this is your genre of film and if you're
a reader.. John Green is a fantastic author!
