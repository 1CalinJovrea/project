Supposed to be bad; actually excels at it.

I started watching this shortly before midnight. I can't emphasize
enough how bad I feel for wasting 90 minutes of quality bed time with
this movie. It had a powerful potential, a few nice actors, and the
right characters. But halfway through the movie, everything goes south.
Sasha Grey, in this particular movie, is an astoundingly horrible
actress. She shouldn't be casted at all. And furthermore, the best
characters are treated like sh*t. Travis, the Iraq vet, is by far the
most charismatic character in the movie - yet, he is the first to get
screwed over. The old lady, the one I luckily can't remember the name,
also gets an amazingly badly- written ending. And, to add it all up,
the main character proves herself to be a full compilation of curse
words. She can't be described in a single review. Fortunately, she gets
something that probably sends her to her own personal green mile. I
hope there's a sequel dedicated to the moment she probably commits
suicide. Overall, this is the first movie I ever thought I'd say it's
so bad, that it is actually bad. A solid one-starrer.
