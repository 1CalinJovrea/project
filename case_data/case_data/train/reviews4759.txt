The do'er, the ex-con, the geek and the Latin-millionaire

From the director, Michael Bay, who gave many mega blockbusters. Like
the movie 'Bernie' it was also based on the true story which
cinematically presented as a crime-comedy. 'Pain & Gain' centers around
the three Miami bodybuilders who commits a series of crimes.Like everybody else, these three bodybuilder wants to live the American
dream. Since they are poor, they plan together to abduct a rich man and
fetch some money. But it won't go according to their plan, somehow they
pull the incident back into their control. Now they are rich, but past
begins to haunt their happy and what happens then after to them is the
rest.I liked Dwayne Johnson's role, kinda cool, made all the difference to
the story. Mark Wahlberg role as well, which was aggressive and
energetic. But the third character was quite moderate other than in
romance related scenes. There are few errors on technical aspects like
crews are clearly visible in many scenes through the glass. Overall a
good movie with a racy pace and very much enjoyable.7.5/10
