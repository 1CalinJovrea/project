Terrible, Awful Film...and I am a Will Farrell fan!

Don't believe the positive reviews about "The House", they are bought
and paid for reviews.The House is a god awful, terrible film. It has absolutely nothing
going for it. The acting is bad, the plot is terrible. Nobody laughed during the entire film....nobody.I am a Will Ferrell fan and I like Amy Poehler, I like them both but I
just cannot lie to you about this film.It is so bad that it may ruin both of their acting careers.....it is
that bad.Whew....it stinks.
