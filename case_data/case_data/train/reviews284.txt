One of the Best, Feel Good films of 2016!

I got a chance to view "Sing" at a early Pre-Screening and it was an
absolute blast. Starring the film was an all star cast, too many to
name and they all did a spectacular job singing and acting, the main
star that gave me goosebumps singing was Tori Kelly, she can sing the
house down. The movie was a feel good movie and it had things for both
Kids and the Adults to enjoy. Me and the audience laughed throughout
and enjoyed the film, we even clapped when the end credits rolled. This
by far to me beats "Secret Life of Pets", I thought "Secret Life of
Pets" was an okay film but I was so disappointed. I Highly recommend
everyone to see "Sing" when it releases in theaters December 21st.
