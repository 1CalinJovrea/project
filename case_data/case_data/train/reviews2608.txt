Life in Perspective

People have complained that this is a horror movie filled with horror
movie clich√©s. But how could it not be? I mean is it suppose to be a
horror movie at the local shopping mall? No, of course it is in a
haunted house, were else would it be? As much as this movie drew on the
horror standards, I found it refreshingly different from most horror
movies. Part of what I want from a movie is something different, not
more of the same, and I think in that respect, all things considered,
this movie delivered.While it did make use of the standards like jump scares, I really felt
the suspense of this movie. I mean, at least for me, this movie was
wound very tight. The suspense was ratcheted to the limit.While I'm still not past Daniel Radcliffe's voice, I still hear Harry
or Daniel, his face and body language were spot on, and greatly added
to the tension of the movie.In the end, it is what it is, a suspenseful horror movie that gets the
job done. This isn't a genre noted for 'Academy Award' performances.
But as suspenseful horror movies go, I was very satisfied with this
one, and thought they did have a new approach to an old genre.Steve B
