This is punk!

This is probably the most raunchy picture I've seen all year. Maybe
ever. It disgusted me more than, say, The Human Centipede II. No
kidding. It might be 'cause I'm gay and have no affinity whatsoever
with the female body, its smells, its peculiarities and its specific
organic functions. If you think you've seen it all, then I suggest you
watch this movie. An atmosphere that'll amuse the punk in every one of
us, but nauseate our affinity with common decency. We not only get to
hear a lot about intuitively nasty stuff (feces, sperm, urine, sweat,
vaginal discharge, snot, anal blood,...), we also see a lot of it. Yes.
See. This movie is very visceral. Some might say too visceral. I'm
inclined to say the same. On the other hand, I'm just too fascinated
with the (sick) way David Wnendt dares to confront us with what we all
know and have. Stuff that we usually accept as extremely private and
even embarrassing is brought to the center of the stage. While doing
this, the movie tells the story of a girl in puberty and her desperate
need for attention since her parents don't give her any. This movie
transcends its mere shock value to an authentic subversive work that
will claim a cult status rather sooner than later. Add some sleazy
garage music from Thee Headcoatees, Joan Jett and Peaches and you've
got yourself a movie like nothing you've ever seen before!
