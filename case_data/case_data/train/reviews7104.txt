An insult to all those who paid money to see it

Be aware, plausible spoilers I do not know where to start. I thought
that I'm used to the cheesiness of the FF movies, but this
is......overwhelming. Its like they are making movies for people under
18 only. Whole movie is a load of random c***. Its so senseless,
cheesy, unbelievably unrealistic, clich√©- ish.....total disaster. They
ruined good characters, like deck shaw. In ff7, he was terrifying
hit-man. Here, they turned him into a clown who is afraid of his
mother. Its ridiculous. Next, is it a bird, is it a plane? No,
its......Luke HOBBS!!! My Lord, he is the perfect example of everything
wrong in modern Hollywood. Awful acting, cringe lines, superhuman
strength (they literally took it to the superman level in ff8) Cipher-
theron is a brilliant actor in normal movies, but here they made her a
joke. I would compare it to the thurman's poison ivy from 1997. Tbh,
roman is the only lightspot. He really is funny, natural funny, not bad
humour like others. He is the reason why I made it to the end.
