not a movie for children of any age

Interesting concept, but the adult theme is way too much for children.
A fertility doctor, process to get sample from prospective dad,
discussion of male genitalia is completely inappropriate for children
and who, above child age, would be interested in this level of detail?
Since when did age 13 become mature enough to delve into such an adult
theme? Never, that's when. I would have been embarrassed if I'd taken
my son to see this and would have left the theatre immediately and
demanded my money back.
