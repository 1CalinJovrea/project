An Audio and Visual Tour de Force

Reviewers Notes, humbly submitted: 1. One of those must-see films that contains images, performances, set
pieces and snippets of dialog that will haunt you long after you have
left the theatre. My favorite is a throwaway line by Harvey Keitel's
character casually explaining why for 60 years he has been gullible in
his relationship with Caine's character: "I invent stories ... I have
to believe everything in order to make things up." (Keitel) That is
what reviewers like to call dialog within dialog.2. Caine is superb, but then again he is always superb.3. This is an affectation that this reviewer wants to add: since
Sorrentino is very direct about wanting this film to be about age, the
experience would be enhanced if you watch 1966's Alfie before seeing
Youth. To see Caine (at the time) portraying one of the sexiest men
alive will take you to a new level of appreciation for what age is
about.4. Some of the images, clearly surreal, could well set the standard for
the medium for years to come. They are not only extraordinary but
plentiful. Contrast these for example to TV's American Horror Story
which pretends to be leading edge in this regard but in fact is merely
recycling stuff from 1970s horror films. This is the real deal.5. Weisz comes full circle. She started her career doing serious roles
in indies, temporarily became a saucy sex goddess, and is now a serious
actress once again.6. Only criticism is a problem I have noticed with other films by
strong directors like Woody Allen -- the director, doing double duty as
the writer, is virtually God in this production and subconsciously the
viewer understands that he or she may as well be watching a film made
on Mars, because the energy and the characters are so far removed from
reality.
