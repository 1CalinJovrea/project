Easy watching, a good laugh if it's your sort of thing. Generally misunderstood

Personally find it entertaining. Easy to watch. If you take out the
crappy base storyline with the 3 twits it's OK. I don't think people
realise the point of this film. It's just a sketch movie. It's not
meant to be a masterpiece. Millions of people watch sketches like this
on YouTube everyday but may a movie well that's just ridiculous, calm
down. It's way better than south park which is just swearing angry kids
and sex.
