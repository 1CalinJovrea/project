For the younger young ones

I watched this with the whole family, ages ranging from 11-41... And to
be honest there wasn't much laughing going on. I'll tell you what I did like: the animation was great, and what I
found most appealing as a grown up watching this was the nice little
musical references, like Hair and The Beatles, and the soundtrack
throughout the whole movie. A few minor laughs here and there but
unfortunately that was it.I would think a kid from 0-10 would like it, just the way it likes most
any cartoon. Slapstick comedy, funny talk and cute pet-like beings...
The main target is probably this age and there it can't go wrong.But for older and adults I think it is way too childish.
