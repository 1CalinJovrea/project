a must watch !

i really loved this movie i enjoyed every second of it ! it actually
has a meaning ! its more than just a movie about family and love and
relationships ! its not like any other romantic drama ...I'm in love
with this movie ! very recommended i wish there was a book for this
movie.. i think that the reason i loved this so much is that it is so
realistic ! the characters are so rounded ! the actors are so well
picked they really look like a family to me the work together so well!
one of the best movies i have watched in a long time !I always enjoy that kind of deep meaningful realistic type of movies
that give you a good cry in the end ! I even had goosebumps 90% of the
movie ! its so touching!
