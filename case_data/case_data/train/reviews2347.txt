Not Interesting At All

I never really heard of this movie until I saw it a Redbox. With the
reviews I read online, I was led to believe that it would be a good
movie, but honestly, I wasn't even close to hooked. The story is about
a punk rock band simply trying to find a good paying gig but end up
being trapped with murderous skinheads after seeing a dead body.
Honestly, from the concept alone, it scores points in being more
original than other horror movies, assuming we're all tired of
stereotypical teenagers fleeing from a murderous psychopath, but that's
about the most good I can find out of this movie.The story was just too boring, and the voice acting is hard to love.
Not saying it's mostly bad acting, Patrick Stewart done a decent job as
the owner of a skinhead bar, but the others just sound so monotone to
me that sometimes I wonder if they're just not high throughout the
whole movie. What also hurts the movie is that there wasn't much of a
reason to care about these characters, and there was hardly any
character development. Heck, I couldn't remember which of the
characters were in the movie in the beginning, so that tells you how
badly written the characters are. All this is also bundled with a story
that turns out to be a drag. Other than the ways some of the characters
were killed, I can hardly remember anything of it.Overall, it's just flat out forgettable and was not even worth the
rental. I didn't see why this movie had so much praise, and I SURELY
don't recommend it.
