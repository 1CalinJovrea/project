It wasn't the first but it was still OK

I loved the first one and have been waiting for this with great
anticipation! When I saw it on Comcast On-Demand I immediately rented
it. Like most sequels, this wasn't as good as the first and it's hard
not to make comparisons to the first movie. The first thing I noticed was the lack of a good soundtrack that went
with the first movie. Scenes like Hit-Girl whooping ass to Joan Jett's
"Bad Reputation", or the old Banana Splits song "Tra La La" Song
totally made the first one awesome for me. The soundtrack was as
important as the characters. As the movie was unfolding I kept waiting for some funny/rocking music
to play. Unfortunately, I was pretty let down that they didn't spend
the money to acquire some interesting/funny/rocking songs for this
movie. Then the plot was sort of handicapped by the fact the characters had
matured. I felt the actors all did a good job, but the built in humor
that came along with an innocent naive Kick-Ass character getting his
butt beat, or the irony of a 10 year old foul mouthed girl killing
someone with the same zeal she would pursue a boy band with was gone. I think they spent a little to much time developing the idea of a group
of super hero's and and not enough time developing Kick-Ass & Hit-Girl
characters. Overall, I liked it, and I'm sure most will... It just
wasn't as fresh and new as the original.
