Most Unrealistic Film Eva

Wasn't the Tiger VS Sherman kill ratio 14:1? Fury should have been over
in the first tank battle scene that lasted a total of a few minutes.Would never think that 300 SS soldiers would not have the common sense
to fire a couple RPG's at the disabled sherman in the final battle
scene .Of course, Brad Pitt survives three large rounds from a sniper, and
miraculously lay in one piece after the two potato masher grenades are
thrown inside the tank right next to him.Very unrealistic film. very disappointed with the effort. ill-
conceived story that insulted my intelligence.The scene in the apartment with the 2 woman, intended to show the
damaged psyches of these men, was awkwardly executed and fell flat as
the day is long. I sat impatiently waiting for it to end.Brad Pitt should be embarrassed to have ever uttered the words "Ideas
are peaceful, history is violent," which is not profound or true. This
is the sort of intellectually sluggish claptrap that should be avoided
at all costs.If you haven't seen it yet, please do not.
