"Don't Be Such A Pessimist" (Cool Dialog)

Let's review.(Quoting from my IMDb reviews of the first two) Taken 1 was one of
those unexpected surprises that keeps the wheels in Tinseltown turning.
It turned Neeson, a very competent actor, into filmdom's oldest and
newest action hero. A neat trick. It was actually a very well made
product and even with all the attention, still under-rated. It was
better than people thought.OK, to be clear. Neeson was not getting any younger and when offered
Taken 2, he took it. Sorry for the pun. Taken 2 was not so much a film
as an IQ test. If you thought it was in the same class as Taken 1, you
failed the test. Sorry. The truth hurts.To atone for Taken 2, Neeson did the Tombstone flic. It was great and
showed the world he was still an A-list actor. Apology accepted.Hollywood never ever leaves money on the table. Which brings us to
Taken 3. Not really a Taken movie, more of what you would expect if
they wanted to do a TV series on the Neeson character and they started
with a long pilot.It is much better than Taken 2 but then again so is footage of your
dog's birthday party.It is not bad. Depends on your expectations.High expectations, you will not be happy.Bored and want to spend time with Liam?You could do worse.
