Twisted, misandrist feminist tale

If you like fairy tales and believe in love then you'll hate this film.
It's beautifully filmed and well acted by Angelina Jolie, but the story
is so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous.By the end of the film I just started laughing at how insane it was.
Made me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have
suffered the worst break up in history, or else she just really hated
men.I was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in
theaters. Now I wish I had my money back.Some may say this film is like Frozen. That's only if we discovered
Christoff was actually in league with the evil Prince and Olaf was
their spy.
