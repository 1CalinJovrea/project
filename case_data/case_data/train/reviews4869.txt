The Darkest Most Funny Movie I Have Ever Seen

I don't even know how to begin with describing this masterpiece. This
movie is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen, I am
more than serious. I don't think words can describe the love I have for
this amazingly funny masterpiece, I can't remember the last time I saw
a movie that both made me laugh and cry so much.The way this movie portrays humans and their behavior, and how this
world is is just incredible. The whole way this movie is put together
is just brilliant and I have personally never seen anything like it.
The darkness the humor and the love in this movie is just huge, and you
keep wondering if you should be laughing or crying.There are 6 different stories, and they just keep getting better. They
are all very different but very emotionally connected. I am not going
to tell you what they are about, only because i think going in ignorant
to what is about to happen make the movie so much better. All I can say
is some of the stories are sweet, some of the stories are very dark,
and some of the stories are both, and all the stories are amazing
breath-taking hilarious, and the are all amazingly beautiful. The directing is beautifully done, and really shows the stories the
best way possible. Not knowing any of the actors I was more than
pleasantly surprised by how amazing many of them were. I just wanna
finish by saying I hope you will watch this movie after reading this,
and I really hope you are going to love it just as much as I did. 10/10
