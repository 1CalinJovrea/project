... shame

I'm going to be short. I liked all of the previous movies of this franchise. All of them kind
of connected to each other.This one doesn't care about the former movies and what was in them. It
literally makes the previous movies a non sense! W.S. Anderson really
said that no matter what I wrote before, that's all bu....it. It has no connection with Washington neither... I thought they will
make something with that cool looking ending in D.C. but now.. They said she got tricked there and that's all. And the names.. When they first said the girl's name I knew everything
from that moment and how it's going to end.........I would never give a penny to Anderson to write a single Word and
direct anything. He is worth nothing now.
