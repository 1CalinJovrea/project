Good, but only just.

NERVE is a romantic(ish) thriller about a girl who plays the truth-or-
dare version of that Blue Whale game that was a thing back in 2016.
Sound exciting? If you said yes, then you're probably not sober.All snark aside, this isn't actually THAT bad of a movie. The plot
itself is okay, the actors did a superbly passable job for being a
bunch of teenagers, and the premise, while outrageous, is acceptable by
Hollywood standards. But there's not much that goes on for about the
first half of the movie, the main characters are pretty much
unmemorable, and it's pretty difficult to not see the INCREDIBLE amount
of product placement. In short, it's basically the YA action version of
Unfriended. But there are a lot worse ways you could kill an hour and a
half with.
