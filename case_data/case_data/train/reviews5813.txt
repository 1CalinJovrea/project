I have no idea why this got such a low IMDb rating. Both my fiancé and
I loved this. The writing was clever, fresh, and hilarious. We couldn't
stop laughing and it wasn't the typical cheesy Hollywood humor. It was
very smart. It got a little cheesy toward the end as they were tying up
loose ends, but I would honestly watch this over and over again. I have
a masters in creative writing so I'm no easy audience. Honestly, what a
bummer that I almost passed it by as a result of the poor reviews! My
fiancé is also quite the critic and he was calling me every 15 minutes
or so, laughing, telling me about the last scene that he watched. It
was so good that we paid for it on Amazon Prime twice--once for me to
watch and again when I told him, "You HAVE to see this."
