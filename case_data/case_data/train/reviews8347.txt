Real vs. VFX

Although this film is being compared to "Revenant" it can stand on its
own merits. Call me old fashioned but, I love the fact they used a real
grizzly. This not only added to the realism of the film but created
film viewer anxiety. The aerial cinematography is outstanding and is
not overdone. As with many movies where the editing around footprints
in the snow falls short, this did not. The director took special care
to work in the fresh snow. Several times I thought of the real danger
the actors could be walking into. Bottom line, the film had one shortcoming, the score. Even though the
music blends into the scenes beautifully, it doesn't fit the wilds of
Montana.
