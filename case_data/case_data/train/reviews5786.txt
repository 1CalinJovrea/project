Don't suspend your judgment, kill it and throw it away

I get it, it's not a reboot of the Brendan Fraser Mummy of 1999 onward.
It's an attempt to create a whole new cinematic world, or rather
cinematic universe. Populated with super beings, over which none will
claim rights from Universal Studios. Beings that Universal own already.
It's an interesting idea with some financial wisdom behind it. It
could've been a real stroke of genius if it was done with the right
amount of levity. The Brendan Fraser style of humor is badly needed
here, but he's not here, neither is anybody else who can take himself
lightly. So instead we get a dark, pompous serious attitude debating
which way is it we should use to triumph over evil altogether.Cinematically it means tons of CGI, and every kind of monster the
script writer could find in the archives of Universal St. and some from
other cinematic archives too. It was a bit much when they tried it on
2004 with Van Helsing. And Hugh Jackman never repeated that mistake. So
Tom Cruise is here to take his place. Truth is, we should've seen it
coming. Tom Cruise must've wanted to be Superman all these years, but
even he knew he wasn't physically suitable so he relented into an
endless list of action heroes that were borderline super beings but not
actually super. Thing is, he's not getting younger, and the idea of
doing his own stunts is getting less and less practical, so Tom Cruise
found the ultimate solution, he went in and made himself a god.Yes if you do want to watch it, you need to do more than just suspend
your judgment. You'll have to kill it and make sure it doesn't come
back to haunt you.
