Dazzling Visually, But Lacking in Content

Star Trek Beyond has gone beyond with a dazzling array of amazing
visual images and a multitude of fascinating new designs and exciting
sites that bedazzle including a few reminiscent of Tomorrowland (2015)
and much more. Unfortunately the beginning of the movie is pretty
corny, the jokes and the attempt to conform to the old Star Trek lines
and characters seemingly out of place and awkwardly presented. The rest
of the storyline had potential, but it was directed in such a way that
it became more good guys versus bad guys, with one fight scene after
another. Pretty mindless stuff in comparison to the mindful themes of
the original television series and Star Trek: The Next Generation.
