Touching and destabilizing

I honestly found this movie very touching and delicate. It is delicate
in the way it treats difficult subjects as sexuality and the discovery
of one's identity in an hostile period. The fact that it is a true
story makes the whole movie even more involving.I don't think the film is perfect - but the acting, cinematography, the
screenplay are absolutely amazing. I especially loved the middle part -
where all the characters try to find a way out of the problem and when
for the first time they seem to be facing a fracture between them.I thought it had a great power on people even though it doesn't seem to
have had the effect I was expecting (at least during the premiere in
Venice).Eddie Redmayne hasn't had enough of his Oscar and I wish him all the
best for 2016!
