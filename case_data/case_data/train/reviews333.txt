Good but not great

Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I
enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as
a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps
between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience
is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a
Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite
the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx
don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of
the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro.
Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is
the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at
time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of
soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something
bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it
will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200
million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie
makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions
should not be any infeasible to approve.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/
