"Turn that thing off..."

Found footage is now a business model exclusively and this horrible
thing makes it extremely obvious. Whole plot devices are crafted merely
as an alibi for cameras being around in the most implausible situations
to accidentally set up a perfect OTS shot. Being limited in telling a
story, when everything needs to fit into a situation with some kind of
camera around, the directors elegant solution of course is to convert
85% of the unimaginative dialog into exposition, spoon-feeding you the
two dimensional, infantile melodrama, leaving 10% to explain the camera
presence in some way and adding 5% of irritating bull crap that I guess
the writers thought modern teenagers would say when behaving naturally.
They wouldn't. For action there is no time.
