The Wolf of Boredom (Not Engaging and Pretty Dull)

Very loosely based on a true story of a gold miner in the pursuit of
striking gold in Indonesia. This film is set in 1988 and stars Matthew
McConaughey as the protagonist Kenny Wells, whose driving ambition is
to strike gold in a big way. He has a dream, but not just in terms of determination, he actually has
a dream and decides 'I must follow that dream at any cost!' He
discovered the largest gold find of the decade, his wealth is
unimaginable. Then it all starts going wrong. It turns out that his geologist partner was 'salting' the extracted
rock samples to give the impression of a great gold find. The rock
analysis results could not be recreated, and so the FBI is called in. The FBI extensively question Kenny for fraud over several days, but
eventually release him due to lack of evidence. However, you're left
wondering whether he was always in on it, especially when he gets a
cheque for half the $164,000,000 swindled money. But then you can't
help wondering how he's ever going to cash in the enormous cheque with
the FBI closely watching his every move! McConaughey is a great method actor, and for this character he puts on
47lbs around his belly, he's seen constantly drinking, chain smoking,
and has very thinning hair. The furthest from his normal superstar
heartthrob self that you could imagine.This film looks like another made for TV drama, I didn't care about the
character's or their eventual outcome. Many scenes frequently involve
painful episodes of over-acting. Unfortunately this film looks like any
other rags to riches and back to rags type of film, think of The Wolf
of Wallstreet but nowhere near as good. Would not watch again and would not recommend.
