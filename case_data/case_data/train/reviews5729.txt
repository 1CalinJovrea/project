Completely Fictional

Well,The creator of Macintosh, Jef Raskin, had about 5 minutes in the movie
and was portrayed as a silly person. In reality, Jef is visionary, and
reinvented (or stole, in Jobs' words) the concept of integrating
Graphic Interface, and Mouse (his original design was made in reality
in 2005 as "Mighty Mouse" when the technology became mature) into
personal computing.When Jobs took over Macintosh project, because of "political" reason,
and his own pride, he took what Jef had and gave it to IDEO and had
them redesign it so Jobs can claim to the ownership of the project.
Because of all these "bullshit" Jobs took three years to establish a
commercial product when Apple products are outdated in the market.
Jobs' unrealistic (and the reason being he didn't understand
technology) approach is like if say today I took over Apple and say,
no, let's do all these functions but we are going to not sell any of
our products, but just sell a super iPhone that has the power of
today's macbook pro (so maybe we won't have it until 3 years later) and
sell it for a cheap price, because I don't have to make money off it.Yeah, of course I will get kicked out from Apple.No, Steve Jobs was just a good looking dude who had the ability to get
money to start a company in Silicon Valley when there were only nerds
around. Much like Ashton Kutcher, Jobs was just a pretty face actor.
