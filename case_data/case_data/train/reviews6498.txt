absolutely lame

Absolutely horrible.Terrible plot. Attempt at humor: someone farting in
the car and the others characters' reactions.Their hot air balloon
falls on a kids birthday cake.Kate Upton is a terrible actress-she f
bombs her way through the plot on one emotionless level. An absolute
waste of time.
