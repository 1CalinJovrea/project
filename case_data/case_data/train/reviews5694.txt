Cry Wolf

The Underworld movies are not classics, but if you enjoy hammy acting,
vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather kicking
ass then they can be a lot of fun.Blood Wars is an end game of sorts, although it still leaves room for
more films if the money men think it worthwhile. It would be a decent
ending if they decide to close the chapter on this franchise now.The plot is quite straightforward, there's some decent action and fight
scenes and a few new characters and creatures introduced, and it
doesn't drag on too long and outstay its welcome. Charles Dance lends
some gravitas to the cast, and Lara Pulver has a lot of fun as the
power crazed Semira, while Kate Beckinsale is as youthful and badass as
ever.If you enjoy the Underworld series then I'm sure you'll find this a
decent addition.
