Entertaining trifle

Judged as a comedy, Frankenweenie isn't really that great. The humor is
rarely more than mild. But the movie actually did a pretty good job
with the story, which is well paced and has moments of genuine - if
mild - suspense. It's also - and this is to be expected from any Tim Burton movie -
really good looking, with stylish black and white animation and a cast
of creepy looking kids.As someone familiar with the original movies, I appreciate the way it
pays tribute to its source material. It is also wonderfully
imaginative, most notably in the first resuscitation scene.One criticism; even by the standards of kids cartoons or old horror
movies, this thing makes zero sense. The lack of any sort of logic is,
however, so in-your-face that I accept it as purposeful and thus just
accept that this is a movie that's not supposed to make any sense.
