Awesome

This movie is probably one of the best movies I have watched all year!
Just when you think you know what's going on you get hit with another
twist. The movie takes place in 3 different places and that's all they
really needed. At first it takes a minute to see what's going on but
when it finally clicks the movie gets so good. Pay attention to the
details and the movie is ten times better. Also ask yourself why things
are happening. It help! Great movie! Deserves 10/10
