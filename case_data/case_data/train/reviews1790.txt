Whoever fights monsters should see that he doesn't become a monster himself: Frriedrich Nietzsche

This experiment took place at Standford University's Jordan Hall in the
summer of 1971 by psychology professor Dr Philip Zimbardo, Billy
Crudup, who didn't seem to quit realize what he was getting into. That
in order to see the effect on both inmates and prison guards that being
locked up behind bars could do to them. Given $15.00 a day to
participate in this study and those in it divided by lot between the
inmates and guards it at first looked like a harmless experiment and
easy money until those in charge-the prison guards-started to throw
their weight around at the expense of the helpless prisoners. It wasn't
long that a number of the inmates cracked up under the pressure with
the prison guards acting far worse then any of the crimes that the
inmates, who in fact were innocent collage students, were accused or
involved in the study.It was the captain of the guards Chris "John Wayne" Archer,Michael
Angarano, who really went overboard in his actions against the helpless
inmates treating them worse then inmates are treated in any major or
minor US prison.That in fact had Dr. Zimbardo, in order to prevent
himself and the collage from being sued into bankruptcy,halt the
experiment after just five days of torture. As for the inmates they
were left traumatized to the point where they had to seek out
professional, at the collage's expense, help to overcome what they were
forced to go through.It was in fact the captain of the guards "John Wayne" Archer who
suffered the most damage to himself in how he acted toward his fellow
human beings. A decent and likable fellow at first Archer when given
total authority over his "Victims" that showed just how anyone under
the same circumstances can act when given the chance. Which explains
the actions of many of those in power, in law enforcement and in
politics, that we see on TV and read about in the newspapers every day.
It's not just the power but the destine for their victims, whom they
feel are and treat like dirt or even worse, that leads those like "John
Wayne" Archer to act they way that they do: Not in meeting out justice
but in satisfying their own deep and dark feeling and emotions about
how their brand of justice should be carried out against those that
they feel so justly deserves it!
