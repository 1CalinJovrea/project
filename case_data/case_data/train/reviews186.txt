A decent X men film

X Men apocalypse adds nothing new to a landscape filled with superhero
films and lots of X Men films of old, but just cause it doesn't add
anything new doesn't make it a bad film. \From Xavier going bald to Magneto becoming one of the four horseman
this film is standard from beginning to end, but I can't say I didn't
enjoy it. It was fun to see Magento completely wrecking the X Men. And all of the
end of the world stuff wasn't too bad either. I enjoyed Apocalypse as a villain even if he was clich√©.The movie doesn't develop the 4 horsemen enough, but that not a bad
thing at all. They didn't need to much development. What they were
given was good enough for the story that was trying to be told.Quicksilver steals this movie though. He really is the best part of
this franchise
