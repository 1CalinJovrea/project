Awful movie!

If you're angry on your intellect, go see it. Otherwise it's just an
awful waste of time, and if you spent money on watching it in movies,
then also your money.HB2 is meant for people who like 'kick in the nuts' jokes. I mean you
really don't find any more stupid main characters than in this movie.
There is 'funny stupid' as for example in Hangover-Galifianakis-type,
but Sudeikis and Day in HB2 are over the edge stupid.I would rather recommend going to the mall and watching the crazy
shoppers fighting over a hair trimmer than wasting any minute watching
this movie.
