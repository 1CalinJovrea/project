A million ways to ruin a film

The problem with this film is that it didn't actually appear to
understand what it wanted to be.In places it is romantic comedy, in others it is action drama, in
others it is part Adam Sandler comedy, but mostly it's just a
collection of crude and unfunny frat boy jokes.I am amazed the movie failed the way it did, because it has a lot of
star power, and a decent budget behind it - but then I guess it just
goes to show that just because you can succeed in one medium, that
doesn't always mean you are automatically capable of doing the same in
every medium.Probably one of the biggest flaws in this film is that not only does
the main character's frame of reference make absolutely no sense, but
it's also inconsistent throughout the film.MacFarlane plays a character who spends the entire movie showing how
enlightened he is by complaining about how terrible life in the West is
- but he could only know this if he had experienced life AFTER that
period, and therefore had something to compare it with. For someone
living in that actual period, things would have actually seemed quite
advanced, compared to what had gone before, and with all the
technological developments and political innovations taking place
during that actual period.And then later in the film, MacFarlene's supposedly enlightened and
modern-thinking character suddenly reverts back to making jokes about
the American Indian people (something someone of his period is likely
to do), but then later still he actually gets adopted by an Indian
tribe because of his enlightened approach to Indian/American relations.I would also suggest that his jokes about "Black men" and their body
preferences in women, and the Islamic "death chant" were grossly
demeaning, if not racist.And don't get me started on the montage towards the end of the film,
which largely felt like a series of skits that didn't fit anywhere else
in the movie, so they jammed them pointlessly into the montage because
they didn't have the good sense to know they weren't actually that
funny.All in all it was a confused effort that just wasn't that good.
