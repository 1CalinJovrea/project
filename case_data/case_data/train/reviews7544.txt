The Witch Hunter and the Witch Queen

In the Middle Ages, the witch hunter Kaulder (Vin Diesel) hunts down
the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) with the inhabitants of towns
devastated by the black plague that she had spread.. The Witch Queen
curses Kaulder with eternal life to make him suffer the loss of his
wife and daughter for the eternity.Eight hundred years later, there is a balance in the world and the
witches live peacefully among humans. The witch hunter Kauder and The
Axe and Cross that judges and imprisons witches in the darkness are the
responsible for keeping the world in peace. The priest Dolan 36th
(Michael Caine) is the liaison between The Axe and Cross and Kauder,
giving support and keeping the record of his life. On the same day of
his retirement, Dolan 36th dies alone in his apartment. Kauder goes to
his apartment with Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood) to investigate his death
and finds black magic in the spot. Further, he finds that Dolan 36th is
still alive under a powerful spell. Now Kauder visits the witch Chloe
(Rose Leslie), who owns a witch bar, to seek her help to recall his own
death following clues left by Dolan 36th. However the bar is attacked
and destroyed by the witch Beliel (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) and Kauder
leaves Chloe under his protection. When she uses her abilities to help
Kauder, he learns a dreadful secret about his immortality. "The Last Witch Hunter" is an entertaining fantasy with lots of action
and special effects. The excellent cast with Michael Caine, Vin Diesel,
Rose Leslie and Elijah Wood give pedigree to the adventure. The
conclusion is prepared for a sequel with Kauder's discovery. My vote is
seven.Title (Brazil): "O Último Caçador de Bruxas" ("The Last Witch Hunter")
