Revival of a Masterpiece

A great drama film with a bunch of talented actors. Just everyone fits
in their roles. Meryl Streep has got the lovely moderated theatricality
that defines those who bring cinematic rendering of theater plays to
completion, reminding me of the mastery of Vivian Leigh at realizing
Blanche of A Streetcar Named Desire and of Elizabeth Taylor at
capturing Martha of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.Julia Roberts is really wonderful. Look at the long scene of the family
lunch with the well plotted dramatic development culminating in the
ravishingly natural Roberts' angry jumping over her mother/ Meryl
Streep. This is what I call finesse.Chris Cooper is a fine example of genius with his overwhelming
performance through a limited role. He reminds me only of himself as
the homosexual overprotective father in American Beauty.Benedict Cumberbatch is also noteworthy with his ability to give flesh
to that awkward son flowing with negative emotions. I liked the guy
indeed!Individual shots are great most of the time. Beautifully carved cadres.Finally, I find the plot reminiscent of William Faulkner's The Sound
And The Fury. The family about to utterly fall, the young man of the
limited capabilities (Little Charles) versus the mentally retarded
Benjy of Faulkner's masterpiece, both epitomizing the probably divine
punishment of a family with deranged Christian morals, and even the
sympathetic Black servant and caregiver who takes Benjy there in her
refuge is revived here in the Native American servant/ Cook who offers
the fallen protagonist Violet/ Streep the last obvious token of
sympathy by the end of the film, plus her heroic defense of the little
Jean. I don't know if the playwright/ screenwriter Tracy Letts was
influenced by Faulkner, but who can escape the great Faulkner anyhow?!It's an excellent movie, and worth watching.
