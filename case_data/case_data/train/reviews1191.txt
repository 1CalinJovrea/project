Hustle in to see...

'American Hustle'. A amazingly entertaining and engaging experience. A
successful (in my opinion) juxtaposition of art and entertainment. A
wonderfully acted and directed film.Full disclosure: I loved both 'The Fighter' and 'Silver Linings Play',
plus the cast are some of my favourite actors working in motion
pictures today. So, I went in with a bias and a high level of
anticipation for this film. This can sometimes work against you as a
viewer as your expectations are too higher and you are disappointed
with the results.I can say that I was not disappointed and absolutely loved the film.
People take different experiences and sensibilities with them when they
see movies, and mine led me to be engaged and empathetic towards the
characters. Their story interested me and I came out of the cinema
thoroughly enjoying myself.My only criticism is that it felt it lacked a little something with
story. After seeing the film I did read that a lot of the film was
improvised and Christian Bale commented to David O'Russell that this
would change the story. His response was that he cared about the
characters more than the story (paraphrasing). On reflection this is
evident as the characters and acting are first class.I by no means acclaim this to be a perfect movie or the best movie ever
made, but it worked for me. I loved it!
