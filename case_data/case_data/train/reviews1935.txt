disappointing

I was stuck with this movie because it was the only one that fit my
schedule. I knew nothing of the plot. The beginning credits run. Amy
Adams! Always a great actress. Tim Burton the director. This could be
good! A good beginning to the movie. The time period is portrayed in
realistic fashion. The heroine, a painter, has a difficult life. She
leaves her husband. A courageous move for the time period.She has to start from scratch in a new city. She meets a fellow
painter. He appears to be her soul mate. He is an interesting
character. He promotes her career. They get married. Interesting
process. Colorful supporting characters, including Terrance Stamp.The story stalls along the way. The punch to the story is the heroine's
resentment that her husband takes credit for her paintings. She creates
the paintings for him. He claims them as his own. Although he is
presented as a strong-willed character, she does not have the guts to
tell him to stop. She hides the secret for years. Even from her
daughter! (yawn ...) Will she get the guts to stop the fraud? I could
not have cared less by the time the issue was resolved. Near the end,
there is a big court scene with her husband suddenly acting like he is
in "Trial and Error," the comedy with Jeff Daniels and Michael
Richards. Although I am sure the writers thought the court scene was
clever and funny, the audience I was with sat in stunned silence. When
she outs her husband in the national news, her daughter is proud. We
are supposed to be emotionally invested. I was bored beyond all belief.
I felt manipulated. In the end, the heroine is not a sympathetic
character. The supporting actors are more interesting. Would never want
to see this movie again. Good style. Good characters. No plot for the
characters to shine.
