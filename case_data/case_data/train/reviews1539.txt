Bland, lazy and arrogant

We all know Scott can bring a vision to the screen with ease, create a
sweeping vista and bring a dream to life. In part he does that here; a
version of ancient Egypt is brought to life, superficially it seems
right, until you realise this is all this movie has going for it.Its empty, like a chocolate cake with sawdust inside. I feel cheated,
extremely disappointed, and unenlightened.Apart from the incredibly distracting casting choices, we know ancient
Egyptians were brown to dark brown, the costumes and setting just
didn't ring true and continuously brought me out of the movie and into
the increasingly monotonous script that lacked any originality, spark
or wit.Yes, this is straight by the numbers; even including a more
'scientific' approach to the story that I think was supposed to be
clever or original, but just fell flat and drained even more life from
the movie.Performances I felt were very ordinary; Bale played his usual character
role, serious faced throughout, as did Edgerton, although yet again and
again I found distracting his manicured eyebrows and shaven head,
clearly a poor attempt to look 'other', when his role should have
clearly gone to another. The so called must have big names Scott whined
of, such as Weaver, had hardly a word to say.Its also overlong, or seems it. Large segments between set pieces drag
on and on, you check your watch and instead of 30 minutes gone, you
realise only 4 minutes have. This is nothing like gladiator. Scott has
gotten old. Hes not going to get better.Only watch if you like a biblical epic with no originality and dour
presentation. Everyone else, save your cash and if you are tempted,
don't bother with 3D.
