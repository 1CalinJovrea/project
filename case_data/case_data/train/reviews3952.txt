Delicately woven story

I was struggling with the "old age" references in some reviews,
especially euphemisms such as "octogenarians" or "elderly citizens"
that make it all sound detached and condescending. Our Souls at Night
is about two lonely souls who found a true emotional connection with no
age tags attached. Addie Moore and Louis Waters are two emotionally
evolved personalities, who find solace in the presence of one another.Loneliness does not choose any life stage in particular, as we see it
with Addie's grandson, Jemie, who has already been introduced to this
hollow feeling at the age of ten. The active phase of life provides multiple tasks to distract us from
having a glimpse beyond that daily micromanagement process. At a young
age, we can't imagine any relationships developing without an edge. We
find them lacking if it's not a white knuckled-ride. It's refreshing how naturally and smoothly Addie and Louis' connection
was growing with no need for any obvious signs or loud words, drama, or
declarations. Their story is an enviable example of how much tact and
respect two people could radiate towards each other and people around
them and how strong and accepting we could be in our relationships.I love how delicately the warmth of the newly revived intimacy is
pictured with no emotional manipulations or clich√©s to ruin it. This
soul fulfilling story is definitely a pleasure to watch.
