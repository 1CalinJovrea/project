Wish I could travel back in time and watch this movie again for the first time

I love horror movies. I like fun movies. But I am not really into
romantic movies. Except this one. I think it is well paced and has a lot of heart and warmth, and I swore
profoundly when I read the reviews in the Danish media. As I see it, it
is not just another "boy meets girl" love story. It is first and
foremost a story about appreciating life - even the everyday routine.
But also a film about the bond between a young man and his father.Suffice it to say this: The plot is great and the story is well paced;
The casting and acting is very good by all the main characters; Bill
Nighy is really a joy to watch; The music/sound track is
"spitzenklasse" throughout; I would not have to think twice if Rachel
McAdams were to ask me to have a third child(sic!); The father/son
farewell scene brought me the rare sensation of tears in my eyes (thank
you for that)
