A goofy, witless film. Sheer waste of time.

Seth Rogen has developed a reputation for dishing out decent comedies.
I essentially saw this movie because of Seth Rogen and his pedigree. I
agree, as an Indian, I'm not supposed to enjoy all the cultural jokes.
For example, I don't know the pop-significance of Miley Cyrus in US or
the humour value of 'Hanna' associated with her name. But leaving these
apart, I found the humour to be either banal or straightaway foolish. I didn't even have one good laugh in this film. Puking in a church,
images of male genitalia, half-baked cameo of James Franco, statements
about male and female private parts, nosebleed in a drink, cussing a
baby, drugs, having sex with a girls' parents - this pretty much sums
up the cumulative humour in the film. There was not a single act of
decent situational humour. And I'm surprised how so many critics
glossed over this banality and showered it with high ratings. I think,
money of the production house did the magic via publicity. A cheeky
trailer also did the trick. I wasted my 2 hours on this goofy, witless film. It is highly over-
rated and straightaway rotten.
