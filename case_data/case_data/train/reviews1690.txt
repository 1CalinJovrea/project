Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful,
thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the
choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst
things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how
far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the
likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us,
blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn
pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the
dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will
keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense,
Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their
characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief,
empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter
managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary
and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the
characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of
time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the
various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances
from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and
believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama
thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented
casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html
