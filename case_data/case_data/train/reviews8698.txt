I have to tell you guys honestly I was really nervous about seeing this
movie because it is a sequel and not too many sequels do too good but
some do good and this one actually surprised me and did really good
because I took my brother and my dad to see it and we laughed a lot in
the movie and there was some twists that you and I expect so it is a
really funny movie to watch and it's a lot better than the original
hotel Transylvania movie plus it had a lot of guest stars in it. I
highly recommend that you get Hotel Transylvania two on DVD it has a
lot of Halloween we were a lot of monsters to her it would be very
funny to watch with your kids on Halloween so it is just very very
funny it's just it!!!
