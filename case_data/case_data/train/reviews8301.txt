This is what Comic Book Movies are supposed to be like

For starters, let me say that this is not a perfect movie. The first
act is rushed, and the plot loosens as the movie progresses. But this
is what comic book movies should be like. Fun, action-packed, and
believable performances are what make this movie good. It is not trying
to be The Dark Knight, which I enjoyed. There are a few darker moments,
but the overall feel of the movie is light and fun. That tone is
perfect for Spidey movies, and that is where I think Sam Raimi went
wrong with his Spider-Man trilogy. He wanted to make a good film, not a
good Spider-Man film. Mark Webb is making good Spider-Man films, so
critics are not liking it because they view it the same as they would
Shawshank Redemption. And fans aren't on board because they want all
superhero movies to be "darker". Ask Man Of Steel how that worked out.
So just sit back and enjoy a fun ride with beautiful visuals and
outstanding acting.
