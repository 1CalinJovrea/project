Utter Garbage

I never have high hopes from M. Night, ever. This is the reason why.
Where is the police investigations.. wouldn't one of the personalities
turn on the other?? Oh, sure they send e-mails to the doctor..but why
not to the local police department ratting one or the other out? I wish
I could go negative on the review. Anyone who likes this has taste for
complete garbage. Probably enjoyed Windows Me, Vista, 8 and 10 as well.
Nice reviews on such utter piles of trash is the reason why we can't
get a good movie. They had a birthday party at a mall..where security
cameras exist, not only inside the mall but outside as well. Someone
'stalking' another human being would surely turn up on multiple
security cameras at some point in time. Oh, right, we aren't suppose to
think too much in this. I'm glad I wasn't the one paying for the movie.
