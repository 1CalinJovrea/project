Like watching white paint dry to black

This film follows the lovely, naive Mary's descent into darkness.
Unfortuanlty this is literally what it does. Mary has a hell of a few
bad days, then descends into darkness; roll credits.Watching her journey is a bit like watching a sex education film.
Interesting stuff is going on but you are not part of it and you just
have to sit watching uncomfortably until it is over.The acting, script, lighting etc. is all good. Katharine gives a stella
performance, easily pulling off sweet, sexy and sinister, but it is not
enough.There is initially an intriguing insight into a sub culture of people
who want to express themselves through physical modification. But all
the members of this culture turn out to be stupid, weak or cruel.Not much gore but there are some disturbing scenes.This has all the right ingredient but is non-engaging and dull.
