absolutely entertaining and clever!

Sadly I had to travel to an old and tiny cinema to see this movie as it
didn't play in the major cinemas on the Gold Coast...after watching
this movie i have absolutely no clue why.I truly enjoyed every minute of this film, all of the actors did a
great job, especially Ethan Hawk. I did see some of the plot lines
coming and still got a bit of a surprise in how they delivered those
plot lines...if you get a chance and like a sci-fi with brains then go
and watch this!!!I would definitely not compare it to looper (just to add to the end)
yes looper and predestination are about time travel, but thats were it
ends... :)
