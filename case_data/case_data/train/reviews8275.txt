Typical Australian movie; in other words, watch it!

I really love Australian movies, they are so often quirky, entertaining
and thought provoking all at the same time. Boys in the Trees is all of
those things and then some. Sure, there was a thing that happened close
to the end which I guessed beforehand (perhaps a slight spoiler, so
I've ticked the spoiler box just in case as I would hate to ruin this
film for anybody who has not yet seen it but intends to do so), but it
still did not detract from the movie any way. IMHO, this movie didn't
put a foot wrong.If you like complex, many layered films with a heart then just watch
it. If you're the target audience you will not be disappointed.
