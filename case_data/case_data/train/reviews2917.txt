The worst movie I've seen in years

"The greatest manhunt in history". Well, Dark Zero Thirty movie clearly
does not show this! I had way more thrills following the manhunt of the
fake Abu Nazir in the TV show Homeland than in this propaganda- movie.And first, seriously, make a movie out of the death of Bin Laden not
even two years after the events? If there's a world war III someday, at
the end of it there will be a Hollywood movie about it the year after.If I would like to tell spoilers about the plot I could not. It is
easier to follow by reading some Wikipedia articles about it.Everything is boring, from the start to the last scene where special
forces shoot down unarmed people in Bin Laden's safe-house.I really don't understand the official critics. No plot, no character
building, no suspense - it's actually the first movie I stopped
watching before the end in a while. (I later watched the "killing"
final scene, just to see).(Actual spoiler)Even if I didn't know about the camp attack, I wasn't surprised at all
by the suicide bombing. I mean, CIA agents trusted the double agent
like hell, and I could not even feel like them in a movie?
That's...that's just bad.
