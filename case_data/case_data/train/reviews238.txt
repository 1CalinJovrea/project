A tense thriller that is enjoyable enough for a rainy day.

I think Gone is a film that is pretty much destined for bad reviews,
which is a shame because I actually found it quite good, the story is
about a girl who was abducted a year ago, but escaped her captor, she
goes on living day to day life with the help of mess to deal with the
trauma, that is until her captor comes back for her and takes her
sister instead, a game of cat and mouse ensues and the viewer is taken
on a fast paced cracking thrill ride. Yes there are problems with Gone,
for starters the script is slightly underwritten and some story lines
are totally forgotten about, particularly some of the story lines
surrounding the supporting characters, and it has a bit of a 90's
b-grade thriller vibe to it, but for what it's worth it also has a lot
of good things about it too. The central performance by Amanda Seyfried
is a good one, she is very convincing as the determined heroine of the
story, the cinematography is very fitting to the story, the cold and
damp setting of Portland is wonderfully captured by the camera, the
pace is fast as a bullet, each scene is quick and doesn't drag on and
it has some genuinely scary and tense scenes, particularly towards the
end.Some reviews I have read say that Ananda Seyfried deserves better
roles, yes she deserves great roles because she is a supremely talented
young actress but I really don't see what's so bad about this role,
it's a strong female character, I think people may only want to see her
in romantic comedies and that's it. Speaking of Ms Seyfried, she gets
better and better in every film I see her in, she has a very natural
acting style, she never seems forced, everything seems very natural for
her, I look forward to seeing where her career goes. Gone is a real middle ground kind of thriller, it's not a teen slasher
and it's not a more mature adult thriller either, it kind of takes
what's great about both types and combines them into a highly
entertaining movie that will have you guessing tight until the very
end. My only criticism is just the abandoned story lines of the
supporting characters, I dint know if it's lazy writing or what but for
me I felt I was steered in a direction only to be left thinking, but
all in all the movie is great, I would definitely watch it again.Give it a go, I hope you enjoy, Amanda Seyfried is wonderful. :)
excellent.
