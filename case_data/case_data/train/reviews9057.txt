A Film to Kill For

Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, much like its predecessor, should really
be considered a bad film. Yet its bizarre mixture of cartoonish
ultra-violence, cheesy dialogue, and noire aesthetic come together to
create something incredibly unique. It is also a film that makes good
use of 3D, as at times it looks like you are staring at a three
dimensional diorama of a comic book frame, and it is beautiful.The cast is strong, although with so many big names a lot of them only
end up getting a few minutes of screen time. Mickey Rourke returns as
Marv, and is clearly the heart of the movie, featuring in three of the
four stories in major roles. Josh Brolin takes over for Clive Owen as
Dwight, which works well given the darker tone in A Dame to Kill For.
As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnnie, a newcomer to the franchise,
Gordon-Levitt does well enough with the role, but Johnnie's story
itself is rather forgettable. Jessica Alba returns as Nancy, and is
both appropriately sexy and scary at the same time. The casting
couldn't have been better.The plot itself consists of four loosely connected stories featuring
the four lead protagonists respectively, it does feel a little rougher
during the transitions between them compared to the original Sin City.
The titular story, A Dame to Kill For, certainly stands out among the
four, and fans will be more than pleased with this adaptation of one of
the most beloved Sin City comics.Sin City: A Dame to Kill For may not be as innovative or as seamless as
the original, but it is still a great, unique piece of cinema.Now I hope you don't mind me saying this... But this here is a film to
kill for.
