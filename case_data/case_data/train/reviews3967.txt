utter, UTTER garbage

I can only assume a the the majority of this movies budget, has been
spent on paying for reviews?! what annoys me more than wasting the 90
minutes watching this film, is feeling the need to waste more time
reviewing it. I did, however, hate this film so much that I felt the
need to warn you all about it, and I hope then you take my advice and
save yourselves! The only thing worse than catching this virus from
this movie, would be having to watch this movie again. There was a
moment towards then end, where I actually wished I had the virus, just
to kill me before the credits rolled. Sadly I do not have the virus and
so, survived the entire diabolical 90 minutes desperately hoping for
the AHA moment which would have made it all worth it.... The moment did
not come.
