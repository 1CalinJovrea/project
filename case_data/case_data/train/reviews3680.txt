If I could rate this 0 stars, I would.

This movie is an absolute, total, pitiful, dismal, ridiculous waste of
time. I cannot possibly believe that anyone enjoys this movie. There is
nothing meaningful and important, and the only reaction I have after
watching this is the reaction to punch the face of the person nearest
to me. I cannot relate to the characters whatsoever, and the story is
maybe the weakest thing since my mother's homemade teriyaki sauce. If
someone forced me to watch this again, I would gouge my eyeballs out
with a spoon to avoid seeing it. Seriously, it's that bad. Never watch
this movie. Ever. I cannot believe that there are people who view this
as the best movie of all time. I know someone who has watched it at
least 12 times and claims that it is her favorite movie. She thinks it
is impacting and wonderful. The only impact that was associated with
this movie to me was the impact of my fist smashing the disk into
several bite sized pieces. I will never watch this movie again as long
as I live.
