Really creepy !

There is life after Hogwarts. I went in expecting it would be more
thriller like (like Sleepy Hollow of Depp) and Radcliffe will not able
to throw off the shadow of Harry Potter and when I saw him, I thought
of Potter and if this would somehow be a continuation of the same
character acting but I was quite wrong. Its a really good horror movie
of the old-fashioned kind (i.e. all good suspense, no effects and
nonsense). Radcliffe has done an amazing job and he has been successful
is losing Potter ! If you are in the mood of a true old-style, spooky,
thrills and chills kind of movie, which builds on pure suspense and the
protagonist's acting, then this is it. Its really gripping and creepy !
