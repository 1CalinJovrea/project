Terrible film!!!

Amateurish direction! Court scene really bad!! Swearing to cover lack
of jokes! 'Ted' good film. 'Ted 2' absolute rubbish. Will win lots of
'Raspberries'! Wanted to leave early. Two girls left halfway through!
Money wasted! Felt cheated that I paid to see this sequel!! Seth
McFarlane should have taken more time over the script! Will not go to
see 'Ted 3' if it is made? The film I badly made. The acting is
dreadful! The scene where Walberg kisses Seyfried is not good! As a
whole this film is a turkey. No good jokes and it is slow. No charm
unlike 'Ted'. Should never have went! Please don't go! Waste of money.
As I say I feel cheated!!!!
