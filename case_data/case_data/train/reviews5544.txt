Sad to say I wanted more for the wait

Nothing to write home about. Entertaining, but fell far short of what
it had the potential of being. A few new gags here and there, but
nothing enlightening, Ties the two previous movies together well, but
that is about as far as it goes. The story was predictable, and doesn't
answer any questions the viewer may have from the 1st two films. I
wanted more backstory, as did the rest of the people in the audience,
but no explanation of the Creepers origins are even hinted at. If this
franchise is going to continue it might be a good idea to give some
history, and fill in a few blanks about what the creeper actually is.
There were some good moments in the film that looked as though things
were going to be cleared up, but in the end stayed the course and left
us wanting more... anything more than watching the little hair piece
stay glued to the top of Brandon Smiths' head while we try to get past
the who, what, when, and why of the creeper. Not my favorite of the
three to say the least. I left the theater with a lot of disappointed
people. We all arrived early, and sat chatting about how excited we
were to finally see part 3, and agreed that if there is a part 4 after
this we would all wait for a review before buying a ticket for a one
night only special event showing that wasn't worth the price of
admission. It had such potential... but didn't deliver.
