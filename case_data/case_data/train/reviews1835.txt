WOW! Definitely an emotional roller coaster

Having fought wild land fires in Bastrop, TX and being in similar
situations as this movie depicted, it was definitely personally
emotional. I laughed, I cried, but at the end I but walked out speechless... The
last 45 minutes of this film had me on the edge of my seat. The way all
the characters have a special personal touch to them makes this film
all more special! I wont spoil the movie, but bring a tissue box, the
ending had me in all the feels!
