Looking Into the Mind- Socially/Internally/Psychologically

Though I was displeased at not finding out the stories of any of the
other characters (I think it would have made it a 9... the characters
really don't hold much "character" at all), I did enjoy this
suspense/horror film because it wasn't just another gore flick.This movie is, though sick, a very interesting look into the minds of
people socially/internally/psychologically. It even makes point of
letting the viewer understand what's truly behind each choice. Overall, I do think the lack of character did make for problems;
however, I would absolutely recommend this movie- more so, if you like
psychological movies and/or enjoy taking a step back to look at your
own mind and the choices you would have made.
