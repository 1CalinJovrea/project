Satire on Life

I can't help but think of Dennis Rodman when watching this movie. Our
main hero seems to mock Dennis's understanding of reality and basic
comprehension of the world. Our hero, aside from being horribly racist
and unsympathetic to Asian stereotypes, he is a pretty innocent guy who
get's fooled by the supreme ruler. Later he finds out the truth, but
will a jab at an old memory stop our reporter from completing his
mission? Not if Seth Rogan can help it! It's a fun movie along the line of Inglorious Bastards. There is a
weird running joke about honey potting, but it doesn't take much away
from the film. It's wonderfully cast, the cinematography is spot on,
and the overly glory, but brief special effects are not over the top,
but comfortably resting on the brim. There are funny lines, but it really take home the perspective that the
North wants people to see itself as. This movie is fairly mild for
Western audiences, but if the people of North Korea saw this film, they
might just start a revolt as the movie suggests.This movie deserves a ten and my money just for putting it out there
for net release. Merry Christmas Sony and everyone else. This is the best present I
could ever have...FreedomBegun, The Cyber war has.
