Soul Eroding Effect of Hypocrisy

Sophia Coppola addresses one of the most overlooked problems - a
ubiquitous issue of hypocrisy that is reigning in the political games
lately and remains an intrinsic part of our society. An isolated group of women in the movie represents a slice of society,
while Colin Farrell, an outsider, who is simply struggling to find his
place within it. The outsider is condemned for putting an act, but
nobody says or does anything that reflects true feelings. Nothing comes
from a genuine respect for another human being. False pretenses and
masquerading based on flattery is the only way the characters
communicate and stay together. And unfortunately, the only way we know.
The only time we see their true colors is during paroxysms of rage,
outbursts of lust, hatred and jealousy. But as long as the ugliness is
hidden under the veneer of a civilized decorum, it is considered all
right by the majority. Jealousy or repressed sexual desires is just what we see on the
surface. All the inner mechanics of their behavior are driven by the
fear of a misstep in the eyes of the polite society. The morality they
know teaches them to never question the rules and never step out of the
dogma-ruled world. Rules like 'keep your stitches even," shield them
from facing real moral dilemmas. The unfolding drama is depicting how morality, which it's just a set of
rules established by a self-proclaimed civilized society, has replaced
all spiritual concepts. Morality, as a set of standards, is bent and
stretched without mercy. Anything is possible for the sake of
appearances and propriety. Those who dare to break those pretensions
are ostracized, banished or simply discarded. Sofia Coppola showed the modern world slipping further down into the
abyss of hypocrisy, when almost everyone fails to stay true to oneself,
twists "morality" as one pleases and values what's proper over what's
right.
