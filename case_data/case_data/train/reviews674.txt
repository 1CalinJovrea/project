Now You See Me... kinda wish I hadn't...

This movie really leads you to believe that its going to be exciting,
intriguing and thrilling. Instead, you may come out of it feeling like
you yourself have had a magic trick played on you. The characters are cocky and annoying. Its hard to develop any sort of
connection with them. All the magic tricks and illusions are very
unrealistic. The "romantic" element of the story is incredibly forced;
almost thrown in at the last moment because the producers were like "oh
ya! we forgot to add the romance". There's nothing subtle about the tone of the movie. You're constantly
reminded that there is a mysterious element that you are not seeing.
And when it is finally revealed at the end, there is hardly any
surprise at all. Worst of all, there are too many things that happen in the movie
inexplicably. You find yourself waiting for information that never
comes. Questions are posed that leave you wondering why something
happened, but then they're just abandoned and never reexamined. This movie made me angry. I felt like it was condescending to me the
entire time. Fast talking "quick witted" characters using dialogue
spoken so fast with convoluted vocabulary, camera shots that were shaky
and always moving. It was trying to confuse me with smoke and mirrors
to make me think that it was exciting, intriguing and thrilling, but
realistically it was not.
