RagnaROCK!!!

Let's get rid of this ""Aw,but the Ragnarok event in mythology has
great battles, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number
of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, TÃ½r, Freyr, Heimdallr,
and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters"" nonsense.Cause
these movies don't have to stick to the myth or comic books,100%.They
should make changes for the sake of the movie.For instance,in NORSE
MYTH,fenrir(the giant dog) is the son of Loki and hela is also the
child of Loki. Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Hela
and Fenrir as Loki's children??Loki is already a well established and
grounded character.At this point,I don't think any director/writer
could change Loki's past and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Loki's kids
cause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.For the sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the Norse
Myth and in the comics.The performances of the main cast are impressive and exceptional.This
movie also showed us the real "God of Thunder".For the first time he
was extremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming all
over his body was pure awesomeness.This movie is mostly targeted for everybody except for
joyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have a
boring,dull life. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda
remind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics were
praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this
movie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which was
perfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all
big,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So
glad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The best
version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear some
people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't look
like Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I care
about is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU
movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track
record since 2008.Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel is
always using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if they
fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies for
the past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create the
highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players
like Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.
