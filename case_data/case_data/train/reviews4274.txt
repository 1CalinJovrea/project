Creepy and Fascinatingly Intriguing

When I stumbled upon 'The Houses October Built' on Netflix, I was
hesitant, yet intrigued by both the trailer and the poster. Not many
movies give us the glimpse of haunted houses on Halloween Night,
especially to the found footage extent. Within the first twenty
minutes, I was utterly bored, but did not want to stop without
finishing. I'm glad I didn't stop, because it got creepier by the
minute. The movie does explain well what to expect in haunted houses
and the scary nature of the unknown when stepping inside. However, the
movie does not do a good job (as many are) of explaining what the hell
happened at the end to the characters and why were they being chased
after. The doll girl... CREEPY! My advice, don't go in with high
expectations and you'll be quite satisfied.
