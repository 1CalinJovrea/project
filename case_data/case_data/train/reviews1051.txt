I gave it one point as I expected it to be bad and it delivered, so I
was satisfied there. Cliché, corny, carp. A carp is a fish (in case any
kids are reading) and it doesn't taste great. Luis Guzman provides the
ethnic idiocy, the Rock provides the unneeded Braun to compensate for
the much needed brains (a priority miraculously confused), And the
young girl and young boy kiss. I didn't mark that as a spoiler because
you'll know well before it happens that it eventually will.Oh oh, the ethnic character steering the underwater craft does the
cliché "welcome aboard the something-or-other under water cgi-mobile"
that a Robin Williams character would usually do in a Disney animation.
Have fun
