Seen it all before

I'm a fan of Tom Cruise and really like the last movie in the franchise
but I couldn't get over the feeling that I'd seen it all before. Every
hair raising stunt, every corner Ethan Hunt is backed into you just
know he's going to win. The movie itself was good but for me it seemed
a little stale. The action sequences were huge and impressive but it
just seems that Hunt is indestructible. He can ride one of the fastest
super-bikes in the world and crash without a helmet and the guy doesn't
even get a gravel rash! I know other people are loving it so don't let
my lack of enthusiasm put you off going to the cinema to see it. It's
certainly worth the ticked price.
