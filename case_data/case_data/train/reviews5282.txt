A complete hoot

As a Brit, my knowledge of Abraham Lincoln is limited to stovepipe hat
and beard, the Civil War, abolition of slavery, and assassination at
the theatre by John Wilkes Booth. I had absolutely no idea that he had
enjoyed a career (prior to his entry into politics) as a vampire
slayer, nor that there had been a large contingent of vampires within
the Confederate army. Thank heavens Lincoln left behind his notebook,
or we'd never have known.Benjamin Walker, an actor I have never heard of, but who looks very
much like a young Liam Neeson, plays young Lincoln (and, with old
makeup and a sticky-on beard, old Lincoln) in a batch of preposterous
nonsense in which our hero become expert at whirling around a
silver-bladed axe, surviving horrific physical trauma, decapitating
vampires, chatting up Mary Elizabeth Winstead, starting the Civil War,
and melting down everyone's silver into musket balls in order to defeat
the 1st Confederate Vampire Infantry Regiment. In this he is assisted
by a decent roster of support including Dominic Cooper, Rupert Sewell,
the afore-mentioned Miss Winstead, Anthony Machie and Jimmi Speed.All those involved play this nonsense with an absolutely straight face
- indeed, it would not work if they played it tongue in cheek - but,
notwithstanding the seriousness with which the characters are
portrayed, and the slow motion decapitations and vampiric (black) blood
sprays, this film is a romp. Like director Timur Bekmambetov's earlier
Wanted, it is an unexpected and exuberant batch of utter twaddle, made
with an almost palpable glee. And, also like Wanted, it features some
beautifully choreographed and eye-boggling action.This movie is hugely enjoyable and absolutely daft. And the 3D is often
very effective.
