Greatly disappointed in the language

Not a family movie. The amount of bad language makes this movie
unwatchable by most normal families. There was no need for it. Words
which little kids need to be protected from a while longer until they
are teenagers.The premise for the movie was a great idea but it was poorly executed.
It was also extremely predictable. I was bored enough to walk out of
the room about the 1/3rd mark. I watched the rest of it from a distance
catching some funny scenes but then ended up turning it off because of
the language.Will Ferrell plays his typical part and Mark Wahlburger does his
typical part. The kids are annoying little brats who would have been
four when their daddy left them, so the idea that they know any thing
about their dad and "how cool he is" isn't logical.Complete failure.
