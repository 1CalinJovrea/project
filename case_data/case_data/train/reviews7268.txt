Aaron Marks His cross In Bourne Legacy

I really love theses kind of films where you have the agent running
around like he's a fugitive wanted by the government so I was really
excited going into this movieWhen I saw Bourne Legacy last month, I have to say a great film. Aaron
Cross is much better than Jason Bourne in my opinion. The casting were
also good. Jeremy Renner fitted the main role verywell and Rachel Weisz
was also great as a female supporting role. I hope that they both will
star again in the next sequel and the franchise in my opinion has
finally found their right replacement for Matt DamonLets hope that in the future, both Renner and Damon agree to team up
and put a stop to the program once and for all
