Horrible

Really one of the top ten worst films I've seen in my life. The plot
was paper thin, if there was a plot at all. I knew going into this that
it was going to be mostly about the digital gorillas, the babe, and the
hunk. What I didn't expect was the flimsy dialogue, scenes unconnected
to the "plot" and such miserable drivel coming out of the mouths of the
actors. I was also surprised by the pseudo environmentalist doctrine
they weave into the plot. The babe is being taken away by the bad guys
to her death and the only thing she can say is, "Promise me you wont
hurt the animals." Really? The best line in the movie is when the black
guy says, "Can we just stop this?" My sentiments exactly. The overly
sensitive, crying, cannibal warlord was a bit too much.
