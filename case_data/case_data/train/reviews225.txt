Movie deserves 7/10, but the director does not even deserve 0...

The movie was very good and Liam Neeson is one my favourite actors. it
is great that Liam Neeson visited Turkey. I am sure that he impressed
very much while he was there. However I just hated director's point of
view about Istanbul, and Turkey. In some scenes you see some women
wearing pitch black clothes as if they live in a country governed by
Islamic rules . No!!! Turkey is not like that!!! Its constitution is
more democratic than many 'democratic' countries in the world. And
especially women had their rights before many 'democratic' countries in
the world. For example Turkish women can vote or can be elected since
1934! Just check the history. You will see Turkish women had such
rights before millions of others women living in other countries. But,
I do not understand why there is not any Turkish women seen in the
movie. All the movie was taken in very weird and suburban areas, and
you do not see any women, but the guys. This is not Iran, this is
Istanbul! I am very sorry about the director's attitude and I did not
like it at all. Turkey is a secular, democratic and modern country. You can see the
people with very modern looking all over the city, not ninjas! The
people of Turkey do not wear such a pitch black clothes like the people
living in an Islamic country. Not only the appearance, but also the
thoughts are modern and contemporary in Turkey! Why did director say a
big lie to the world? Is there a political reason? Should a director
act like a horrible politician? I am fed up with seeing such horrible movies hiding the truth! Make
movie of what you see, not hide the truth! Movie certainly deserves 7 out of 10, but the director does not deserve
even 0! I hope my review was useful to correct some mistakes/lies about
Istanbul...
