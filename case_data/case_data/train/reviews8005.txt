Statham Makes a Great Parker

As a fan of Donald Westlake's writing -- he did the Parker books under
the pseudonym of Richard Stark -- I have long been bemused by the
inability of film makers to adapt his work for the screen. Westlake
wrote for the screen himself, and the Parker books are nothing but
action and plot. Yes, there's character, but you figure it out from
what Parker and his associates do.With this, the fourth attempt to film a Parker novel, the film makers
have found a practical if surprising choice for the title role. Jason
Statham is not an actor of great oratorical powers, but he is a great
physical actor, and he moves constantly like an angry tiger in a cage.
The choice of a caper which is set largely in Palm Beach, with its
artificial, pointless display of wealth and no other reason for
existence is the perfect backdrop for the ferocity of Parker in his
battle with Michael Chiklis' Melander; Jennifer Lopez' clueless Leslie,
who gets caught up without understanding what is going on, gives the
audience a good point of view.Director Taylor Hackford is not a great director, but he is a highly
competent one. Sixty years ago he would have been a major director for
a studio, setting and working in the house style. Give him a story he
can work with and he will hit all the notes, efficiently and
effectively, and he has done so here. If the Parker of this movie is
different from the Parker of the books, a bit more philosophical
(although it comes down, in the end, to the tigerish "Do what I tell
you and I will devour you last") we need to remember that a movie is
not a book. This is not Donald Westlake's Parker, nor even the Parker I
see when I read the books. However, it's still a very good one and
worth your attention.
