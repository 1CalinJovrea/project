Dreadful - 180 degrees from the first one

Me and my boy were thinking wtf is going on in the cinema. Everyone in
GOTG has gone emotional & sentimental, looking for sister touch, father
touch. Action is sporadic and childish. No cool moments, musics have
lost the spirits. Way less funny than the first one. I hardly laughed,
like watching paint dry. My 13 years son ends up playing on his mobile,
not bother watching.How other people love this move is beyond me. Obviously they have very
different standard, easily entertained.
