a good lesson in teens relationships

First of all i wanna tell you that i liked this movie very much,i was
caught by the beginning of it , there was a lot of intrigue ,it shows
us the real teen's problems in a different way not like the other teen
movies which are all similar . this movie had also the other awkward
side between new couples and the issues that we don't want to talk
about much .and for the actors they were just perfect for their roles especially
Dylan O'Brien who was just perfect in acting weird .. you may have seen
him playing in the teen wolf,he did a decent acting.also , i liked how everything in this movie was so unpredictable, the
writers knew exactly what to do.although i must precise that this is not a comedic movie and it won't
make you laugh hard , this is just an awkward romance movie which will
make you feel good and not feel like you are wasting your time and
money.
