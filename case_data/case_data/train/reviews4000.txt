Overkill of the kill

This movie started out slow but had a typical, predictable story-line
until......Colin Firth's character went on a psychotic killing spree
and literally killed an entire church full of people single-handedly.
The violence was beyond gruesome (poles being shoved up underneath
people's chins into their heads, stabbings, shootings, anything you can
think of). I haven't wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this
one but I stuck it out because I was with someone else and figured it
couldn't get any worse. WRONG! Next thing you know, there are
microchips overheating and making HUNDREDS of people's heads explode,
all to music. It was horrendous. But wait! There's more! Let's not
forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to
thank the teenager for saving the day and let him MOUNT HER! Sexist
much? Are you effing kidding me? I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
