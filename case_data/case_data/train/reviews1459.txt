Loved it

As a 42 year-old, lifelong Dredd fan, I can only say that, as far as I
was concerned, it was a near perfect adaptation. It felt very true to
the source material, but also contemporary and relevant. And please, I
am not talking about that terrible Stallone version from the '90s, but
the original comic book series.On the surface it's pretty much a straightforward action thriller, but
there's really a lot more to it than that and it definitely merits
several viewings. Excellent production design and effects, but not
overdone. It has a 'District 9' Pedigree, so if you saw that little
gem, you know what I'm talking about. It's a hard 'R' rating, and it
revels in the violence, this isn't some soppy summer superhero special
for the kiddies... Or at least it's only for those ready to graduate to
something a little stronger, if you know what I mean.I liked that it was just another ordinary day in the life of Dredd, but
for us fans, it was an epic day because it was Anderson's rookie test -
nice work from writer Alex Garland! Lots of sweet little Easter Eggs
like that in the film to really make it shine for a fan.Like all good comic book heroes, Dredd is simple on one level: he is
the law. He's an unstoppable force, he never waivers and he never
fails. But he's complex because in one story he is the hero who saves
the day, in another he is an extremely mean cop and pretty much the
villain. This picture gets the tone dead right and makes great choices
throughout. It's lean and mean and exceedingly bad-ass!!!
