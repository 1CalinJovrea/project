Creepy B-Movie

I'm a horror movie fan - I'm a fan of the original evil dead trilogy to
Romero to Poltergeist, korean horror, french horror etc... I'm also a
fan of the new wave of horror. I'm a fan of the Conjuring as it was a
film that made me think the art of a horror movie is back. First off... this isn't made by James Wan... it's made by it's
filmographer so off of the bat you're probably going to get some cool
scenes but perhaps lack of character development. The budget of
Annabelle is $5 million (that's 1/4 of what the Conjuring cost). Let me
tell you the script is the weakest part of this film.The movie starts off slow... this is where the film should really get
you into the characters but there isn't much here, it's generic. It's
the weakest part of the film. You have your standard couple... man goes
to work, woman stays home and experiences weird stuff. The problem with
this is that it's hard for you to bother to relate to the characters.
This kind of kills the film for me. There were actually a lot that
could have been explored but they didn't touch like the kids in the
apartment.Now the good. There is very little CGI - perhaps none. It's all old
school. This is something that anyone could actually film.... chair
moving, oven is on, someone standing there. It's good. It works.
There's a great scene here with a baby. Are there enough scares? Not
really. The pay off for the film felt like they might have fixed the
movie for censors but even though the film is Rated R.There's a lot missing in this film. It's not horrible. It's worth a
rental. It's your average horror movie.
