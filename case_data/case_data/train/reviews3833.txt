Here son, let's spoon...gonna make a man outta you!

Just because some dude knows a lot about hunting and seemingly has only
that singular specialty to pass along to sonny-boy, I struggle to
understand why the young newbie with buck fever gives absentee daddy
three ticks off the clock. From the moment the dad all but threatens
the boy with physical violence if he didn't put away his iPhone tells
me he is quite possibly less mature than his teenage son. It seems that
everything has to be on the father's terms even though the grandfather
(now deceased) was a far more accommodating individual. As another
reviewer complained, the story was shallow, vapid, and lacked any depth
of character development and sympathy. I didn't really care if they
both died of frostbite on the mountain. The dad was one of those aging
Abercrombie & Fitch underwear models with the perfect teeth, perfect 4
day macho stubble, and just enough hair product to pull off that Cabela
catalog wardrobe. He almost had me believing he stepped right out of
the pages of The Von Hoffman Brother's BIG DAMN BOOK OF SHEER
MANLINESS. Excuse me for being suspicious that Dad's relationship with
mom ended because she found out ol' Cal was fishing for trouser trout
through a glory hole in the Bass Outlet's dressing rooms.
