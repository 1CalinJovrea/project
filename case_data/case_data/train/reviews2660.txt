They've gotta learn sooner or later...

If anywhere there was a braver ending needed, it's here. Kids could
have learned that life is but fleeting, we all suffer heartbreak sooner
or later, say goodbye to the ones we love... This is an important
lesson indeed. But, no. In the interest of a few mums and dads having
to tolerate some waterworks on the way home from the cinema, Burton
decides to go for what is essentially a cop out. Rather cowardly, if
you ask me.The whole film has the feel of an old B movie (but is set in the
present day) as it is shot entirely in black and white and contains
more than one horror reference. Spookiness pervades the atmosphere, as
Danny Elfman's Gothic score meanders in the background like a funeral
march. Poor Victor loses his dog, and his mourning and subsequent
resurrection of his pet carries real emotion weight.This doesn't last though, as the plot stretches to Victor's classmates
experimenting on other deceased creatures, turning them into freaks of
nature that invade the town. This is an arresting spectacle, but a
betrayal of what transpired before... turning the movie from a personal
tale about a boy and his half-dead canine, into an OTT monster movie.
It feels like a different film, and not one that matched up to the
poignant first half.Not for one minute would I suggest I could tell Mr Burton how to do his
job. But I think less action, and more storytelling would have improved
the final reel no end... As well as a more courageous conclusion. Oh
well, everyone's a critic (Most don't enunciate their thoughts as well
as I do, though)... ;) 6/10
