The funniest movie of 2013

"The Wolf of Wall Street" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably
the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the
top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen.
Between all the fun however,Â  there is also a story about addiction and
how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs,
money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this
movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's
energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There
are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you
are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more
serious situations.The cast brings their "A" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo
DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film
really showcases his diverse range.Overall "The Wolf of Wall Street" is a full on adrenaline ride that
never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and
has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of
laughs. The cast is fantastic and DiCaprio gives his best and most fun
filled performance to date. I really enjoyed this movie and think it's
the funniest movie of the year 4.5/5
