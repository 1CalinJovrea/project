A good story well executed

For some reason I had low expectations of this movie. I was wrong. I
enjoyed every moment of it. It is well acted and well executed. A
simple yet gripping story-line that kept my attention right to the end.
The pace is good. It has a elegant rhythm to it that builds and builds,
never losing you. After reading some review I expected a "Groundhog
Day" movie. Not at all. Michiel Huisman (Game of Thrones, Orphan Black)
gives a solid performance, as does Teresa Palmer (Hacksaw Ridge). I
also think that Paul Currie is both a good director and producer
(Producer Hacksaw Ridge). Some fresh Aussie talent that we can expect
much of. Give it a bash and rate truly. It deserves far more than a mid
5's on IMDb!
