Self Indulgent disappointment ..

It's just a pretentious main stream approach to putting a female thru
torture and horror for no reason and with no happy ending, like so many
B movies accomplish on a regular basis these days.. Jennifer's
character really has no chance, no choices and only has a personality
of just another on screen screaming damsel in distress. Regardless of what anyone says, it's just a Rosemary's Baby clone, just
with a different finale that suppose to make the audience believe
otherwise. All the secrecy leading up to it's debut was just to hide
the fact it was always just that.I'm sure it'll get high marks from those who enjoy films with
supposedly no boundaries etc,, but just because it can, doesn't make it
good.. It just becomes "Oh look at what we can do", with little meaning
other that to give a quick silly shock effect..
