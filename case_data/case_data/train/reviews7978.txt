Perfect reminder

It isn't very often that you can go see a movie at the theater and not
have the slightest idea of where it'll take you. Even more rare is when
a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more
satisfying than you ever thought it would be.'10 Clover-field Lane' is a perfect reminder that films can still
surprise us, delight us, and horrify us in a way that's never been done
before. Mark my words, Dan Trachtenberg will be a force to be reckoned
with in the future. His feature length directorial debut is a showcase
for his absolute confidence and strength as a storyteller and
filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what he does next.Of course, it always helps to have the likes of J. J. Abrams and Bad
Robot standing behind you, and their experience and talent absolutely
boosts this film into the stratosphere.As far as acting is concerned, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her best
performance yet, and shows us a strong lead character who's completely
believable in a situation that plays out like a horrible nightmare.
Speaking of bad dreams, John Goodman turns in a performance unlike
anything he's ever done before, and manages to be both strangely sweet
and unbearably creepy. And John Gallagher, Jr. nails his roll perfectly
and adds some much needed levity to a story that's almost
overwhelmingly claustrophobic.I've been thinking about what film I could use to compare '10
Clover-field Lane' to, and while I think even a comparison to a
specific film might give too much away, I feel safe in saying that it
is absolutely Hitchcock. It's a brilliant, brilliant movie that's told
in the best possible way: by showing, not telling.Go and see it as soon as you can.Source: http://www.megashare-viooz.net/10-cloverfield-lane-2016.html
