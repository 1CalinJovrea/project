Good depiction based on true events

Based on tragic events in which were not too long ago after this film's
release, Patriot's Day shows more inside of the events as it shows how
things leading up to the bombing happened. This film is more gritty and
intriguing with a lot more cursing than what was expected. They went
with a hard R rating which may have caused the film to perform weaker
than expected had they went with the typical PG-13 rating. Though, a
film like this, they do not hold back on the language.Featuring strong performances from its leads as well as the supporting
cast, Patriots Day delivers in what it's supposed to do. A better and
more interesting film than expected, highly recommend if wanted more
insight on the tragic bombing events.
