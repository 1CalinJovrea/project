Showed promised failed to deliver 3/10

I really thought I'd like this , it started off well but tailed off mid
film and ended poorly . A British film set in the UK and Sweden but filmed in Romania . The mysterious creature was such a let down and unbelievable that it
ruined the film , M Knight Shylams ( spelled wrong I know ) The Village
it was not . On the whole it nothing to add to any genre and is hardly likely to be
a cult classic . Pad.A 3/10'
