Disappointing

Sucked. Nearly walked out half way through. Dull. Lead male and female
miscast. Poorly written. I went based on this is a "Guy Ritchie" film.
Unfortunately it falls flat with weak dialogue and a innocuous, cliché
premise. Yes, there are a few good action scenes, but they are
distractingly pasted to the first and third act in a way that really
begs for a more sophisticated plot. I feel sorry for the talent...
thinking they were in a "Guy Ritchie" movie. In a way, Hugh Grant
nearly steals the movie because he's the only one with a bit of
character. The rest are too shallow to care whether they return for
another scene in the simple-minded, hardly funny, plot (?)The anti-hero, a blonde automaton should have been developed further,
instead is given no real character at all. I did like the attention to
wardrobe and make-up. Having grown up in the 60's I recognized a lot of
the wardrobe. Still, too many useless scenes, like when the American
sits in the truck and finds a glass of wine and a sandwich. So what? It
may have been more interesting if they just let the Russian spy die
"George Gently," the 1960's British detective makes UNCLE look like the
work of someone without much sleep trying to cram for the next day's
test. Lee Inglesby and Martin Shaw please.Perhaps this is the effect Ritchie was going for. The three teen boys
sitting behind me may have said it best, "not very interesting." This
poster child homage to the 60s and 70s TV shows just didn't register
much, especially without a well-written plot. Story still leads. We've
all seen James Bond getting it done over and over. Yes, the Bond are
good action, some funny lines and some gripping twists with true hunky
guys and bomb-shell gals. This didn't really have any eye-candy or
amazing characters to grab a hold of. Certainly, no compelling twists
or dialogue.Yawn...
