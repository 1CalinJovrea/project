Youth

Once again, Paolo Sorrentino proves to be a master of cinema and
doesn't disappoint. The story is set in an apparently isolated place: a
luxury hotel in the mountains of Switzerland inhabited mainly by
artists and people from the show business (curious the reference to
Maradona, thanked by Sorrentino during his Oscar acceptance speech).Youth is a tender film in both the characters and the themes: growing
old and the fears related to it are common to all men. Fred (Michael
Caine) is an old man who still has a lot going on in his life: he has
to deal with friendship, love, family and his career. The only thing
that makes him different from the younger people surrounding him is
that he is aware of memory. It is through memory that he has lost and
that he tries to regain his identity. Everyone in the film is in search
for identity: the contrast between how people see them and what they
want to be seen as.The screenplay is complex and intense and for this reason sometimes
hard to follow. I loved the irony Sorrentino always puts in his movies:
through surrealism he is capable of expressing humanity in a simple but
yet beautiful way. All the cast delivers great performances and
cinematography is absorbing as always. Sorrentino is a director of
places: no matter if it is the Eternal City of Rome or an hotel
immersed in nature - he is able to capture all the beauty of it.What the film teaches us, in the end, is that we are what we do - so,
I'd add, it's better if we do what we are - but we are nothing without
love, which is the driving force of humanity.
