Crap Clone of Bad Neighbors Movie

It's exactly the same as Bad Neighbours except EVEN LESS FUNNY. They're
in a suburb full of idiots smoking lots of weed and getting drunk and
breaking the law.I blame this disgrace of a movie on director Andrew Jay Cohen, the same
douche bag that wrote and directed Bad Neighbours 1 and 2. He's brain
dead. The extent of his experience is obviously partying and smoking
weed all day. Why would I watch a movie about that? Why is he allowed
to write or direct the same thing over and over? It's not even funny,
it's sad.Will Ferrell should take responsibility too. He's supposed to be a good
actor, he should have said "NO" to this pile of crap. His only funny
lines are when he says "B*tch", and that's it, two times, everything
else is total crap except possibly the part where the guy catches on
fire. Just watch the clip on youtube, there's nothing of value in this
storyline whatsoever.Just thinking about this movie makes me want to vomit.This movie isn't funny, it's just a promotion of drugs and
criminal/amoral activity, basically a reflection and confirmation of
our perception of the idiocracy of Hollywood.
