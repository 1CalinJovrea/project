Absolute Captain Crud

OK, where to begin. This film had no creativity at all to it. I guess
they ran out of ideas in the avengers, which was a great film. Who ever
wrote this and got paid for it should have their head read. How much
can and should you change the laws of physics to make something
'believable'.Plot holes as follows : Captain America has a shield the size of a
large pizza and no one ever shoots at his legs or feet, only directly
into the shield; Hundreds of what would be green berets equivalent,
highly trained killers can not hit any human moving or non moving
targets with rifles and machine guns; Nick Furys car that is getting
attacked seems to have no external defence at all, not a single gun or
weapon, instead, let's put a gun inside that has to shoot through
bullet proof material, so we will wait till all that bullet proof
material is gone and then try to shoot through an obstacle at highly
trained professionals who can't hit nick when he is stationary and in
complete view (fwoh); gigantic million ton airships fall slowly to the
ground after all thrusters are gone; apparently reducing your heart
beat to one pulse per minute can keep you alive; head of organisation
is bad guy, shock horror shock (sarcasm) and so on, couldn't be
bothered typing more.So see this if you are brainless, but if you actually like plot and
good acting, see something else. I gave it 2 for the Apple Store scene.
