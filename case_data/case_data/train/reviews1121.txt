Great popcorn movie!

I actually held off from watching this film, I guess because I have a
thing against PG or PG 13 films, especially when is comes to horror, or
thrillers. But guess what...'Gone' was really a good thriller as well
as being a cool little mystery. I never heard of the Director (Heitor
Dhalia) until this film and I must say I was quite impressed by the
look and style of the film. Dhalia has a great eye, because the scenery
in this film was simply breathtaking. A good pace was set and at times
I found myself catching my breath due to some tense moments spread
throughout the film. I was also impressed by Amanda Seyfried's
performance, she held her own and delivered on all aspects of what her
character was suppose to give in telling this story. My only grip was
Wes Bentley's cop character. Bently's character wasn't really needed
and didn't serve no actual purpose, although the film makers lead you
to believe his character has some relevance to the story. 'Gone' is not
a blockbuster type film, but holds it's own in the tradition of 'Kiss
the girls' and other such film thrillers. So when you get a chance to
see this film, get yourself, your date, or family a big bowl of popcorn
and sit back, because you'll have a nice little viewing experience.
