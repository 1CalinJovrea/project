Vincent Van Gogh was one of the world's most controversial painters,
both during his life, and after his death... This film is an
examination of the death of this famed artist. It questions the cause
of his death. Did he really commit suicide? Or was it something
else?... The movie asks the questions, but does not give answers,
letting the viewer have the final say...The visual experience is intensely mesmerizing. A team of 100 artists
created the 65,000 hand-painted frames in the style of Van Gogh's
paintings, giving us a view inside Van Gogh's head, and enabling us to
see the world through his eyes...The memorable film score is by the great composer Clint Mansell.Â As a
perfect companion to the story of suspicion and grief, the score
enriches the viewing experience while also succeeding as it's own
distinct, artistic composition...The only stumble I see comes from the script. The plot is a retelling
of what we already know. The story-line is limited to the time of Van
Gogh's death, and it does not tell us that much about his work or his
life...However, the film is a must-see for Van Gogh fanatics and all art
lovers...
