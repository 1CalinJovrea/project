7
Alert to mumbled dialogue you must hear to understand ending

I give this a rating of 7 because the film held me spellbound
throughout and the acting was great. But the flaw of it is a common one
in American films these days. There is one scene where you have to stay
alert for, as it's crucial to understanding the ending, and the common
flaw comes into play here: the dialogue becomes breathlessly mumbled
and incredibly fast. The spoiler alert is me playing it safe, as I want
to let you know the scene to listen hard to. It's when Colin Farrell's
character enters his child's hospital room and finds young Martin at
the bedside. Listen carefully to what Martin says before leaving. I've
docked the rating of three points because of this frustrating thing,
but if you're hearing's good, it's a very spellbinding film.
