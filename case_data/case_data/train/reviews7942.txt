Worse Than Vampire Academy

Why did they make another Stephanie Meyer movie? 1. The romance in this movie is terrible. I know nothing about these
shallow teenagers and certainly don't care about what happens to them.
What's even worse is when the human girl who's body has been taken over
by the alien she starts talking to her and complains which gets very
annoying. All we hear is her saying 'Yuck! Gross! Stop kissing him!
That's my boyfriend!' That made me want to mute my TV. The other
characters are lame and unoriginal. 2. For a movie about an alien invasion it's terribly lame. the aliens
are some of the most nonthreatening aliens I've ever seen in any movie.
They don't carry any weapons and all they want is a clean environment.
I know in the movie we would have to give up our free will but this
movie does a terrible job at showing the downfall to all of this. Which
is frustrating because this has been done before. (Watch Equilibrium
with Christian Bale)3. Why does the alien Wanda agree to rebel? Is it because she wants to
kiss cute guys? That's it? Also don't get me started on the ending.If you want a good romance movie check through some the movies on IMDb.
Same if you wanted an alien invasion movie. Skip this movie because it
has nothing to offer you.
