What a sad joke ..

Really childish movie, this planet is going dumber by the minute.
Obviously the dudes well-connected enough to write for Hollywood can't
 umm  write. Just a few points: (1) not one intelligent (or at least funny) line of
dialog in over 140 minutes; (2) The "Games" started after 81 worthless
minutes; can't they afford to hire some reasonably intelligent dude to
do some editing?; (3) The characters were one-dimensional (like in some
fourth grader first attempt at writing): the big bro and the peace
keepers-- ALL-EVIL, while Jennifer and her buddies were ALL-WONDERFUL;
(4) The "Games" were ridiculously uncreative: poisonous fog that can be
treated with water, really?!; (5) Not one twist during 146 min, except
for the lame one (cuz it was overly expected, since it has to be at
least some twist in any movie, right?) with the games director in the
end. If you're not part of the ridiculous tribe of low IQed 11-yo
schoolgirls worshiping Bieber: RUN! My rating: 3/10
