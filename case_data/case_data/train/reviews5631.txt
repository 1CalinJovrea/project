Burn the Damn Thing

If you thought that Eight Crazy Nights was awful, it still is. While I
was able to get through that, I turned That's My Boy off. Adam Sandler
plays an irresponsible man child who is the father of Andy Samberg.
Samberg was conceived through a 12 year old student and teacher
relationship. Yeah. Sandler has sunk down to the statutory rape level.
Sandler is broke and seeks Samberg for help or I don't know because I
stopped caring after the first half of the first frame of the opening
logo and that has to be a record. The movie is filled with gross out
aka lazy humor along with offensive humor and from what I hear child
molestation. This movie does not even deserve a one out of ten. Adam
Sandler does not seem to realize that stuff like what a character says,
does, or their background can be funnier than gross out humor.
