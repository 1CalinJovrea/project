Waste of 2 hours

The whole thing is far fetched, the girls barely speak let alone try to
help themselves, the main character (girl) sees the man get in the car
and does nothing, the ending is ridiculous. James Mcavoy was great in
this movie, it's a shame the plot was so horrible. No good twist and
not scary or creepy at all...just plain strange. Especially the whole
Bruce Willis ending. Don't waste your time!!
