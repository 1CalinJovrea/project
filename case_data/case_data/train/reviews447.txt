Trainwreck is an apt title for this film

I must admit I had high hopes for this film. Having seen portions of
Amy Schumer's show and other clips of her stand-up I thought this
should be really good. Wrong all the way. The film starts with promise
but rapidly goes down from there. How many ways can you make
promiscuity funny....well too many. Very few things in this film were
funny. It began to become uncomfortable and very repetitive. Ms Schumer
is good in small doses, but is no Bullock or McCarthy. Towards the end
it picks up just a very small amount but goes back into the toilet. All
in all, I could have spent the 2 hours doing something more productive,
such as contemplating my navel or cleaning the toilet. Oh well, the
next film I see will, fingers crossed, be much better.
