More than just about Winnie the Pooh

I watched this wondering if it was going to be a dull, forgettable
period piece or a tedious biopic and was very surprised just how good
it actually was.This is a really solid film with good performances and nicely directed.
The plot concerns the true story of the life of the young Christopher
Robin and the changing relationship he has with his parents in the
1920s.It blends the mental trauma his father has been living with since his
WW1 experience, and Christopher Robin's own traumatic childhood, both
of witnessing his own parent's fractious relationship and then the deep
unhappiness of having his life turned upside down when his fathers
book, Winnie the Pooh, becomes an enormous and unexpected worldwide hit
and inadvertently makes a celebrity of Christopher Robin.This is a film primarily about family relationships and it is extremely
well written too. Will Tilston, who plays Christopher Robin at 8 years
old, puts in an exceptionally competent and sweet performance that
makes you genuinely feel for the character.He finds the only person who
actually understands and shares his anguish is his nanny, Olive (Kelly
MacDonald). Olive too notices how unhappy Christopher Robin becomes but
her pleas fall on deaf ears.The only real flaw in any of the characterizations is Margot Robbie's
turn as Daphne, Christopher Robin's mother. Whilst Domnhall Gleeson's
AA Milne at least has some back story to explain why his mentally
tortured writer is struggling to shake off his demons and thus
oblivious to his son's reluctant celebrity status, Daphne comes across
as somebody who is a bit cold and shallow and has no problems with
watching her son get exploited to make the book a success. This may of
course be what she was really like but the film doesn't dig very deep
into her character. However this is a minor quibble in an otherwise
well made film.There are moments of humour in the script and no bad language so I
expect this film will appeal to older audiences as well as families.
The film is also just about the right length too if you like a good old
fashioned biopic/drama. There is also a moral at the heart of this tale
about the need to let children have a normal childhood, which is very
much applicable even now.
