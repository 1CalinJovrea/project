You look ten thousand years younger.....

Perseus is attempting to live a quieter life as a fisherman and parent
to his son, Helius.Dangerously weakened by humanity's lack of devotion, the gods are
losing control of the imprisoned Titans and their ferocious leader,
Kronos, father of the long-ruling brothers Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.The trio had overthrown their father long ago, leaving him to rot.
Perseus cannot ignore his true calling when Hades make a deal with
Kronos to capture Zeus.Enlisting the help of the warrior Queen Andromeda and Poseidon's son,
Perseus bravely embarks on a treacherous quest into the underworld to
rescue Zeus, and save mankind.....Like he did last year, Liebbesmann or however you spell his name,
starts the blockbuster year off with an almighty whimper. Battle: Los
Angeles was awful, and this is just as bad.The cast are mostly back, but some just look embarrassed, and the main
character is played by someone who is devoid of any talent, but has
starred in some of the biggest films in the last three years.The man cannot carry a movie, and whenever he isn't on screen with
Neeson, Fiennes or Kebbel, the film just falters and becomes boring.I was hoping for a film that would just consist of walking, fighting
monsters, walking, fighting monsters and so on, but nothing could
prepare me for the awful script and the lack of plot.People should know now that no , matter how good the effects are, or
what seasoned British actors are in it (Nighy does an excellent Davy
Jones again), it doesn't make up for the lack of interest the story or
narrative has.On the plus side, the 3D is better than the first.....And you just know that wooden sword will be included in the finale.A waste of time.
