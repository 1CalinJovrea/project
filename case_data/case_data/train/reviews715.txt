Great as a sci fi actioner -- perfect as a love story

Took 3 viewings before this review because I wanted to get it right.On its face this seems to be Groundhog Day with a sci fi twist but in
fact it is much more.It is nuanced, and I give the stars credit for making those nuances
work.The way Cruise's character changes and matures during the film is
something you don't see too often.The riffs on time travel set against the "trope" of being sent to a
battle with no preparation is also rare -- you literally would have to
go to Groundhog Day to to even come close.The big difference of course is that Murray in GD never really knew
what he wanted to do -- except wake up.Here there is a "mission" and that gives this actioner a real shot of
adrenalin. The viewer is hooked like a trout.Three viewings so far and I expect to revisit it again.Blount's possibly best role, she doesn't have a lot of dialog but her
face is like a watermark on the various scenes, making them
unforgettable.As a sci-fi actioner, it's a "9." As possibly the most existentialist
love story ever filmed it is a 10 - in the course of the entire film,
he propositions her and gets turned down, he tries to chat her up in a
car and gets turned down, and then she kisses him just before she dies.
All the elements of BOY MEETS GIRL are there. They are just really
really really compressed.
