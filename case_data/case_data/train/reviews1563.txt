There are no words...

To describe just how incredibly bad this movie is. Seriously...what was
Netflix thinking when they gave the green light to this horrible piece
of dreck? You know the kind of movie you start watching and about half
an hour in you realize just how incredibly bad it is but you figure
you're this far in so you might as well see it through? Yeah that is
this movie.From horrible dialogue to incredibly offensive stereotypes (and this is
coming from someone who loathes being pc) this movie has just about
everything you can think of to dislike in a movie.Sandler brings along his usual companions in this one (Buscemi,
Schneider...Vanilla Ice(???)) but even that (formerly) funny bunch
cannot save...this.
