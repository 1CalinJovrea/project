simply wow!!!

I don't have the eloquence needed to describe this film!!! From the
first scene it grabbed me and gobbled me up. Some of the scenes were so
intensely beautiful that my skin was like a live wire just waiting to
spark at the touch. I will say that some of the sex scenes made me
squirm a bit and that doesn't happen to me...like NEVER!!! But what
captivated me were the scenes that didn't appear sexual in nature, but
the aching and longing between Lady Hideko and Sook-Hee elicited
feelings as close to sexual as they come. The story is well played out.
The three parts were brilliant and I was pleasantly surprised to find
out that the two women came together to not only burn Count Fujiwara
but also Lady Hideko's captor, abuser, tormentor (is that enough??)
Uncle Kouzuki. What I like about "Asian" films is that they aren't
afraid to make criminals the heroes or make them win in the end.
