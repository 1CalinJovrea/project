Painfully unoriginal

Took the kids to see this early after release, figuring I'd enjoy
myself as well since the original was pretty well done. Sadly, I was
mistaken.The premise of technology evolving makes sense as a core story element
and had potential to be interesting, but was used for nothing beyond
playing into the franchise's nostalgia for the good ol' days of racing,
on which the first Cars movie hung its hat.Lightning's various training methods were all obvious setups for a
montage of critical moments in the big race, and for a movie which
often embraces reality regarding what real cars can *actually* do, Cruz
Ramirez' big finish with a literal 360 flip seemed forced and
unoriginal (didn't Lightning do one in the first movie?)Speaking of Cruz, her switch into the race came completely out of left
field, and seemed like another brutally forced story element. Imho, it
would have been better to end the movie with "Well, Lightning lost but
hey kids, here's why it's going to be OK" rather than "Look how these
guys can exploit a loophole in the rules! Yay, winning is all that
matters!"At least the kids enjoyed their popcorn.
