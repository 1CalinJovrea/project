Atmospheric but dreadfully slow vampire update with virtually no plot

I'm not a big fan of most vampire flicks since the subject has not only
been done to death (no pun intended) but also because the idea of a
human vampire is strictly a fictional construct and hence not a
character that one can take very seriously at all. Director Jim
Jarmusch has decided to debunk the genre by updating and treating it
somewhat as a black comedy. His protagonist is "Adam," a depressed
vampire hipster, who enjoys listening to his own dirge-like rock
compositions and is proud of his collection of vintage guitars,
supplied by his human gofer, Ian, who is part of the local rock scene.
Adam asks Ian to obtain a wooden bullet, which he may or may not use to
eventually kill himself.Soon enough, his wife Eve (they've been married for centuries), has
just left 400 year old playwright Christopher Marlowe (also a vampire)
in Tangier and comes to Detroit hoping that she can cheer Adam up. Over
half the film features little conflict between Adam and Eve and aside
from engaging in some rather dull conversation, they occasionally leave
Adam's home and drive around in a mostly deserted and abandoned
Detroit.Finally something happens past the midpoint; Eve's sister, Ava, pays a
visit to the couple from Los Angeles. She ends up killing Ian by biting
his neck and drinking his blood. Adam and Eve are appalled by her
behavior (since modern vampires don't do that sort of thing) and kick
her out of the house. They then dispose of Ian's body and head to
Tangier after a bunch of Adam's fans appear outside the house.When they discover that Marlowe is dying from contaminated blood, they
realize they have no choice but to whip their fangs out and kill an
unsuspecting couple they meet on the streets. That's basically itÂ—
virtually no plot, with a narrative that proceeds at a snail's pace.
Score some points for atmosphere, but Jarmusch's tale is as bankrupt as
Adam's blood supply. In short, proceed at your own peril!
