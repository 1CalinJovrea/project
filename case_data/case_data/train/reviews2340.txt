The Hero of the Hudson River

On January 15th 2009, after a bird strike with the loss of two
turbines, Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and First
Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) land an Airbus A320 with 155
passengers on the Hudson River saving their lives. Sully is claimed a
hero by the press and public; however the official investigation
reports that one of the left engines was running at idle and not
damaged. And the flight simulator indicates that it would be possible
to land at LaGuardia or Teterboro. Sully has to defend himself to the
commission; otherwise Sully has to defend his reputation and career
showing new evidences of the incident. Will he succeed?"Sully" is another great film directed by Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks
in the lead role. These two names would be enough to show the quality
of this movie. But the story is excellent, based on the biography of
Sully and the screenplay keeps the attention of the viewer until the
credits. In addition, there are Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney in a
support role. In the end, "Sully" is a great tribute to the hero of the
Hudson River. Mt vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Sully: O Her√≥i do Rio Hudson" ("Sully: the Hero of the
