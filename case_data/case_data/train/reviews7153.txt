Wonderful

This is one of the best movies I've watched this year. Breath taking
and such a beautiful story. The cast is wonderfully chosen and you keep
having goosebumps all through the movie. Watched it twice in a row.
Wonderful. Seeing the title being classified under sci-fi I was not
expecting such a love story behind it. The feeling of insecurity
throughout the movie and passion. The constant battle between science
and religion shown in a beautiful way. The scenery is perfect well
chosen locations. Michael Pitt did a wonderful job in showing a
constant battle between his emotions and radical thinking. I love
writing reviews but this movie left me into a dark abyss where I don't
know what happens next.
