meh

i know, lots and lots have been said about Michael Bay Movies already.
Let me add a little more to it.There is a certain empty feeling that only a Michael Bay "Masterpiece"
is able to produce. An empty feeling that is completely void of any
pleasure or pain or happiness or sadness or any other emotion
whatsoever. All that you are left with after watching a MB Movie is
"Meh".He does not disappoint this time either.Story is Meh, acting is Meh, Character Development is Meh and so on.
With the only notable exception of the action of course. However since
everything around the action is Meh, the action becomes Meh too.Bad Guys have super powers, they are super Generic run of the Mill. The
good Guys also have super Powers...no really, they are Bullet Proof.
Hell even the Movie has super Powers, it super Sucks.I was going to give it 3 Stars for the Action but thinking about it, I
change my mind. For practically raping a beloved childhood franchise, 0
Stars (if possible) would have been a compliment.Don't even get me started on Megan Fox by the way.
