Hokey, manipulative and overdone

Don't get me wrong. I like a weepy, romantic chick-flick as much as the
next guy. But this one is so manipulative and over-the-top that I felt
myself getting hostile about a third the way through. It took
self-control not to make rude comments at the screen.Part of the problem is Emilia Clarke. He character is modeled after the
Brigit Jones style of self-consciously, klutzy, heart on her sleeve
heroine that holds appeal to many viewers. Clarke's acting is filled
with so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic. If
you shaved Ms. Clarke's eyebrows, she'd convey no emotional range. But
with them, she'd be a natural silent movie actress. Her eyebrows
literally stole every scene they were in.The music, especially the segments used between scenes goes beyond
intrusive. It is downright offensive. If a character is about to die
and is falling in love, do we really need an overwrought vocalist
singing "Oh poor me, I'm falling in love, yet I'm about to die." This
is like a Greek chorus with one eye on the AM playlist. I'm
exaggerating here, but the point is real. We don't need treacly vocal
music to mimic what we've just seen. Most of us got it the first time.
You need a break between scenes? Instrumental segues would work just
fine, thank you.I've given this a "2" out of 10. In every way this big budget film
deserves a rock bottom "1" for its manipulative and overdone approach.
I've given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting. At
least the castles don't have eyebrows.
