Different is sometimes bads

I know that a lot of people like this movie, but there are good reasons
why it flopped.The concept comes from the TV series where an American CIA agent and a
KGB agent work together to do some vaguely defined task (there is a
nuclear bomb or something, but I am not exactly sure what they plan to
do with it).Most of the movie involves people sitting around talking. engaging in
pointless dull banter and petty pathetic bantering. Pretty much nothing
that happens in the movie is movie the plot forward. The action is dull and also does little to advance the plot, which is
why they made it so stylish. Overall a great 30 minute TV show stretched to the length of a feature
movie and it suffers for this. While there are lovely subtleties in
this movie, none of them really pay off. To put it another way, here is a movie that tries to be different,
fails to entertain most people, and blows away a small group of people.
