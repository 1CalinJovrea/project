Worst movie I've seen in a long time

After reading the reviews I think I watched a different movie. This
movie was so bad that I had to join IMDb to leave this review. I know
the home invasion movies require the characters to make stupid
decisions but there has to be a limit to the stupidity. Also, crossbows
aren't that hard to load, but if she can't load it she could always
just stab the guy with a bolt during any one of the many opportunities
she was given. Her boyfriend believed some guy with no badge and no
uniform with a neck tattoo was a cop? Give me a break! She finally
stabs him in the leg and runs away because why not leave the crazed
maniac alive to come after you some more? She made so many bad
decisions I was rooting for the douchiest home invading killer in movie
history. I couldn't let other people get fooled by these reviews into
thinking this was a good movie the way that I did.Avoid at all cost.
