The Peanuts Movie did it better.

It's not the clich√©s. It's not the fumbling, thoroughly unfunny
dialogue. It's not the one-dimensional characters (besides Woody
Harrelson's character). It's not the excruciatingly painful awkwardness
of every social encounter. It's not even the completely unlikable
protagonist (quote: "They're all mouth=breathers... I am an old soul"). What really bothers me about this movie was that after all the cringe,
after all the "realness," that it lacked the balls to reach a real
conclusion. You feel helpless because you hate so many things about
yourself but you'll never be able to change any of them? A hug can fix
that. You're ugly but also too superficial to settle for less than
perfection? Don't worry, some kind, rich, handsome guy (who's even less
socially adept than you) will come along and settle for you, even if
you friendzone him. Twice. There is a certain group of people who will absolutely adore this
movie. They enjoy wallowing in self-pity, because it makes them feel
special. If you're not this type of person, don't waste your time.
