Uninventive with strong hints of political preaching (MINOR SPOILER)

Do we really need to see another movie in which Stallone plays the
victim vs some big bad brutal machine? And in which the warden is a
sadist who never raises his voice but speaks in near whispers (to show
contained rage I guess--but it's a clich√©).I like action pictures a lot--but not when there are plot holes the
size of Arnold's neck every 10 minutes, and an ending that doubles the
size of those holes.There's nothing original here and you feel like you are participating
in an exercise in making others wealthier--producers and actors who
don't care at all about what they are creating. Even Arnold's natural
charm rarely shows through here.The filmmakers seem to want to draw comparisons to Gitmo or other
detention facilities that are related to anti terrorism--thus the quasi
waterboarding, the presence of Moslems, etc. Note to filmmakers--please
keep your simplistic political opinions to yourself. And make better
movies.Particularly irritating is the use of a Moslem character (and I do mean
use) to illustrate the writer's/director's political leanings. When at
one point in the movie a character (MINOR SPOILER HERE) who is clearly
Moslem kills prison guards while yelling God is Great (in Arabic), you
must be tone deaf and lost in a sea of irrational political
correctness. This is what is chanted when terrorists crash planes in
sky scrapers or blow themselves up on buses. There's nothing heroic
about it and such scenes in movies not only don't belong but are
irritating and make you feel cheated.
