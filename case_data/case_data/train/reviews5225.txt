Incredibly annoying

I enjoyed the first movie, it was fresh, it was funny! But then they
made a second, with a poor storyline, and a so annoying Charlie Day, it
literally made me want to rip my face off. His voice was so squeaky,
and forever on-going, I finished that film with a god awful headache. I
know the three of them are meant to make bad decisions constantly
because it's part of the humor of the show, but for me, all it was, was
extremely exhausting, and it was mainly to do with Charlie Cox being
the squeaky, childish idiot, who can't keep his mouth shut. Seriously,
if you want a headache after watching a movie, watch this, but if not,
steer way clear because this movie stinks.
