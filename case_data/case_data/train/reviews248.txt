X:Men Apocalypse---THE MADE FOR TV MOVIE

I loved the Apocalypse storyline of the 90s animated series so I was
pretty stoked about the idea of a movie centering around the Apocalypse
character, it's a shame I have to live with it now.The new cast can't seem to hold up a movie on their own, McAvoy is a
huge miscast 3 movies later, Fassbender struggles to hold up the movie.
It seems like their veteran counterparts did most of the work these
past couple of films.Apocalypse is terrible, I had reservations about him before, but you
can tell they didn't know where to go with him or how to handle him so
they kinda just piggybacked off of stargate. There's this strange
pedo-like relationship he has with his younger horsemen. The wolverine cameo was so forced and out of place you'd think this
were a superhero spoof movie.There's a random scene where the new gang of mutants goes to the movies
and jean literally says "At least we can agree on one thing: the third
movie is always the worst" and it cuts back to the movie. The scene
literally has nothing to do with the rest of the story its just spliced
in there for some reason.Which begs me to question whether the cast knew how terrible it was and
just did not care.
