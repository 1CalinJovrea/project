Mediocre and overbudgeted !

Despite an initial action scene full of CGI that you can also
experience in the trailer, this movie hasn't got too much to offer.The main problem is the bad script and dialogs and the pretentious
style which tries to keep the tradition of older Bond films
incorporating some not-so-witty and clich√© humor and ludicrous action
sequences with nothing new to offer. Planes, helicopters, cars...Well
we've seen it all before and in much better executions.Also Blofeld (or should I say BLOWfeld), despite the fact he is the
King of all previous villains, seems quite harmless.Casino Royale (2006) is far more entertaining (I've watched it again
recently) and engaging. Spectre is "Meh!" in almost every department
including (unfortunately) the ladies.Thomas Newman who serves as the composer of the film, is proved to be a
bad decision too. At the beginning he tries to revive the good-old 007
theme in almost every scene and the outcome is sub-par to say the
least. Later he replaces the music with the same note again and again
(da-da-da-da-da-da-da). David Arnold did a great job in C.R. and should
have been the composer in this too (although I doubt that he could save
this movie).And what's the deal with this lame song? Unsuitable for a Bond movie or
any movie out there. Same goes for the same-o same-o intro sequence.
The combination of these 2 makes it look like it was made by Liberace.Overall: The whole movie is pale like the Pale King it mentions.
