10
I thought it would be good....it was GREAT!

I know, I know 10 out of 10 is A LOT. However I'm not sure how they
could top what they have here. Perhaps make it a little longer?? I
NEVER leave reviews but I just laughed so hard I started snorting and
couldn't stop for a bit! So did a few others in my row! I think that
means something. There were so many times were I was laughing hard
enough to cry and where I was smiling from the joy on the screen. Don't
get me wrong, it's not all roses and whiskey....but it's def a movie I
think everyone should see for a myriad of reasons. I'm so glad this
movie was made and that my friend suggested we see it yesterday! I know
you'll enjoy it so...You're welcome!
