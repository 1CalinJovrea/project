I swear that old bear whispered "Boy, welcome home."

Goodbye Christopher Robin certainly tugged at heartstrings, unfolding a
somewhat cold narrative, sprinkled with its share of warm joyous
moments of family banter and the creation of something we have all
adored for the entirety of our lives. Although only rated PG, it was
thematically mature in speaking to the audience as much as the
characters spoke to themselves. Its power grew strongest when it
beckoned the nostalgia of my childhood, telling a story as
astonishingly real as I imagined Winnie the Pooh himself to beÂ—whether
it was from the books I read to the show I watched (plus the recent
animated film), or my late father playing the Kenny Loggins song on
guitar to my delight.The plot may have moved somewhat slowly, but the flow of the film
certainly did not. The pace of the scenes moved very fast, keeping
strong engagement throughout. I'll say that it helped I am very
familiar with the content material (as we all are), which kind of made
it funny when you see the "origin" of a toy animal's name comes from,
almost feeling contrived because we already know it... but even if this
was a fictional tale with an unfamiliar background you couldn't help
but be emotionally riveted. It was well acted all the way around, and
we have a breakout performance by the adorable young Will Tilston. As I said before, this film is not completely sunshine and rainbows. It
does play on the idea of "in the darkness comes the light," to shine
optimism on our main characters who have dealt with internal conflicts
and the pains of the world wars, and to also let viewers leave not too
distressed over what could have easily been told as a tale of tragedy.
I think most of the right buttons were pressed for myself as I watched
it, but I can't say that this is totally a children's movie where they
will be riveted with joy and delight (not to mention I don't know how
much influence Pooh has on children today compared to that of, say,
Dora). Director Simon Curtis did this cool thing when Milne's books
were being created that sometimes showed moments between young
Christopher Robin and his stuffed bear literally jump off the page.
Again, anything that could hearken back to my days 25 years ago were
great brownie points for me.There were only three things I did not much care for about this film.
The first is the color timing. Skin tones were muddled in a red-pink
hue as the entire palette had desaturated any oranges, and the only
green that would appear was on the grass in the woods. Even Margot
Robbie's irises lost their vivacity with every closeup of her, occurred
was quite often (EDIT: after watching the trailer I see my projector
may have been uncalibrated, though it still wasn't my favorite timing).
The second was the way PTSD was portrayed, although this is only
speaking second-hand. The certain triggers, actions, and overall
attachment to the story did not really latch onto the same track as the
rest of the film, even if it was authentic. Finally, the timeline jumps
would be obtrusive when we have to reestablish where we are at and
where we are headed. I want to say it only happened twice, but both
times threw me out for a good bit.There are enough quips in this film to provide moments of laughter, and
long-drawn sequences where I notice that I was smiling the entire time.
However you may be evoked throughout, by the time the credits roll the
only time you couldn't hear others' waterworks was when they were
overshadowed by your own. Fantastic film, and if you get a chance you
owe it to yourself to see it.
