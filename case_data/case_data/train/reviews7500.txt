Fantastic chapter

I absolutely loved it. I've waited so many years to see Roland the
Gunslinger on the movie screen, and he didn't disappoint. This movie was marketed incorrectly; it is not The Dark Tower, it is
The Dark Tower Chapter 8 (an optional chapter). You can watch this
chapter of the story without reading the others as it stands alone
outside of the saga detailed in the books.You should watch it even just for the fact that it is the only movie so
far set in the universe outside of ours that links all of Stephen
King's works together. My brother and father have never read any of the
books, and we just got back from the cinema - we all enjoyed it.Good fun. I'm not surprised to see this film has suffered from harsh
criticism, mainly revolving around the fact it is not faithful to the
original story, but the creators of this film are very clear in their
intentions and deliberately presented a message to the existing readers
and fans within the trailers of what to expect. Anyone who read all of
the books in order will understand why this film is different, and how
it fits in to the saga.I thoroughly enjoyed this slightly absurd and visually awesome Stephen
King horror/adventure movie, it was great.
