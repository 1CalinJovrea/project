$100 dollar movie with a 5 cent script

My only guide to this movie was IMDb ratings which I'm sorry to say but
are either being used ONLY by people with very low standards for movies
or are somehow rigged.I'm giving it 3 stars for whatever little entertainment value it had.Movie begins by showing a regular guy spending good time with his girl
friend. But he is not really a regular guy, he is a legendary baddie
who criminals tell each other about as their bed time horror stories.
Mafia is so scared of him, they call him the "boogeyman". Yet, armed
burglars get inside his house and take him by surprise without any
resistance from him.But wait, he is a ghost, a shadow-man ... yet when he doesn't have a
gun, he might as well put on a t-shirt that says 'pi√±ata' because even
lamers are beating the crap out of him all the time.But wait, he is fast, he is ruthless and he is on a revenge mission ...
yet rivals keep slipping out of his hands, he can't shoot anything
unless the target somehow presents itself two feet from his pistol and
he needs to be continually rescued by his only true friend who "our
hero" doesn't give a damn about.I think what failed this movie, for me, was the script. Period.
