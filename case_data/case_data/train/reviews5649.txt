I can't help feeling that this movie is not only about a chef finding
himself, but it's also about lead actor/director Jon Favreau trying to
get back in touch with the kind of films he used to make -- small ones
without guys wearing super-suits or cowboys drawing down on aliens.
Here, Favreau's Carl Casper quits his big Iron Restaurant job and
rediscovers himself, and his passion for food and family, by running a
Chef-sized food truck. Results: excellent.Films like this can be lost if the wrong kid is cast. Emjay Anthony is
the right kid. He's great as Percy. I particularly enjoyed the way the
film handled Percy's internet-savviness, and how he used it. John
Leguizamo is a great fit as Carl's friend and sous-chef. Sofia Vergara
as Carl's ex- wife is, as usual, capable and stunning.See Chef, and bear witness as a good filmmaker continues his journey to
becoming a great one.
