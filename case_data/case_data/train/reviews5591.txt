Women are Useless and Terrorism is Okay

The extreme sports sequences in this movie are beautiful to watch.
Wonderfully shot and performed. Really well done.As a movie, it's offensive for two reasons. Yes the story is ridiculous
and the characters are paper cutouts but that's not my beef.Reason 1: The only female characters in the movie are babes in bikinis
populating the raging parties, or one huge-jugged space-eyed girl who
utters a few lines, has sex with the main character, and is never heard
from again. Out of all the significant FBI characters, and the four
members of the extreme athlete group, not one is female. This is
America. It's 2016. Give me a break. This movie perpetuates the message
to its young viewers that men are the great athletes while women are
peripheral, staying home to party and make salad and screw the men.Reason 2: The athlete group follows an extremist ideology that they
will wantonly end innocent human lives to advance... hmmm sound
familiar? In the present day with ISIS at large and abortion clinics
getting blown up, it is totally outrageous to make us root for
characters who are basically terrorists. And of course we root for them
because they are hot and have awesome powers and we all vaguely agree
with their goal of "giving back to mother earth".Media shapes people's opinions; this movie has two main messages for
the American public: Men do great things and women shake their asses.
And, it's OK to kill innocent people who are associated with an
institution you oppose, as long as you have a sexy accent and rippling
muscles.Totally, completely offensive and anger-making.
