Shorn of the irrelevant, this is beautiful, touching, real

Frances Ha (2012)I liked this film in a kind of interested, warm way as it got going.
Its black and white simplicity and its regular people both appeal on
the most normal level. The more I watched, however, and the more I absorbed the brilliance of
the performance by leading actress playing Frances (Greta Gerwig), I
became entranced and stunned. This is a great film. A great independent
film, without production pretensions, but held together perfectly
within its means.This is worth making clearÂ—the film makes a virtue of its simple
approach. You'll never feel like it's technically compromised. The
photography is a subtle, smart black and white. There's even one scene
near the end where two people are talking in bed and they chose to use
the very minimum of light, so you just barely see their faces. For a
long deep conversation. Gorgeous, and effective.It's Gerwig who steals the movie, for sure. And she helped write the
really sparkling, believable, clever but never too-clever script. It's
brilliant stuff. Brilliant. She hits a note of fast transparency, a
totally "right" dialog and delivery. Way harder than it seems.And the character she plays, Frances, is one of those lovable types
where things don't go quite right even with all the best intentions.
Most of us identify with that all too well. We have our better selves
and we have the reality of where those good intentions have gotten us.
And yet she perseveres. She puts up with strange but not unfriendly
people around her in one apartment after another, and we get a glimpse
of young New Yorkers with all their minor pretensions. Searing and
funny and touching.Don't be put off by the weird title (the one mistake in making the
film) or by the beginning and its slow, restrained monochrome. The film
makes the most of it all and is terrific.
