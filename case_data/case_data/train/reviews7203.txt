A nice experience for home theater

There was a lot of natural acting done in this movie, and by natural i
mean not over enhanced for viewing experience, by that i am saying that
Kate Upton and Alexandra Daddario are very good actors, the only
problem was that their acting was too real in a sort of way that puts
the viewing experience off at times, but i had a lot of laughs and
reactions to scenes so it was a good experience.With that being said ill have to say that yes the scripting was really
bad, they could have done a lot more to make this a good movie, the
camera shots were good most times, and there is a fair amount of fan
service as you may expect.So its not really a cinema worthy movie for everyone, but i would still
recommend it to be watched for the experience.
