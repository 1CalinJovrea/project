It's a good movie that should have been advertised more.

Based on a true story (That was first turned into a book) Stronger
almost feels like a section of the movie Patriot's Day which is also
about the bombing at the Boston marathon in 2013 (And I feel got the
same small amount of promotion for it). It's like Jeff Bauman (who
Gyllenhaal plays) was a subplot in Patriot's Day and they decided to
extended that subplot into a larger film that not only goes over his
experience that day, but tells his story about his year after the
bombing with him adjusting to the lost of his legsI though the picture painted a realistic picture of what it's like not
to have two legs. I have both my legs so it's hard to fully imagine
what this man went through. Even less now as I see Gyllenhaal
brilliantly showing us a life with no legs. It was a pretty good
performance.I'm still getting use to an age where something happens in recent
history barely four years ago and we make a movie about it, but it is
indeed a good movie. Just like Patriot's Day, I just wished both movies
were promoted better so everyone could had went to the theater to see
them.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=1679
