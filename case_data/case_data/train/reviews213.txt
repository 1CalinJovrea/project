Jackie Chan vs. IRA?

'The Foreigner' is quite formulaic action revenge thriller that doesn't
offer much new or fresh, but still somehow manages to stay away from
the path of dull clich√©s. Dedicated and masterful performances by its
two leads, Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan, who both are little bit in a
different water than most of us are used to see them. For me (I think
I'm not the only one), the two actors were the only reason I watched
that film, and I felt not a second of time wasted. It was nice breath
of fresh air to see Jackie Chan's darker, and more serious side. Also,
it seemed that writer had put some effort into plotting the 'cloak and
dagger' situation between government officials with hazing the clear
borders between good and evil.Quite OK action piece that is enlivened by great performances.
