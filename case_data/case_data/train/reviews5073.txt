Review\Rant

I will not give away any spoilers or anything, just will give my
impression of the movie. The movie is definitely entertaining, the main
and supporting cast are doing well. Tone wise movie is far too light
for what Ragnarok stands for. And you never really worry for any of the
main cast, at least I did not. The feeling was similar to watching a
cartoon - colors, action, dialogues not too heavy on the words, moments
of build up and joy, moments of emptiness. Movie earns a 7/10 and a
solid one. Now for the rant: Can IMDb stop letting accounts with less than 1 week
after registration period post reviews? First review I've read, prior
to writing my own, was a Bulgarian guy giving movie a 10/10 (movie has
flaws). Guy has no other ratings, review or anything. Accounts is 2
days old. So I decided to check other 10/10 reviews - all fresh
accounts, made on the day of the premier or just now. Isn't this
suspicious? The ratings can also go both ways. Just I don't want any of
fake publicity shadow other people's opinions, including my own. I am
more than sure no one watched this movie and said to himself/herself
"Hey, I must go on IMDb, make an account and review this!". This is not
that kind of movie, you will get same emotions as you've received from
the trailer, to put it short. Nothing special :D
