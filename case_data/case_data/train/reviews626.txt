The impossible has happened... it's an M. Night Scamilan film and it didn't completely suck

Well, OK, it had some sucky components.As usual - * Overblown characters with excessive dwelling on them doing cartoony,
cute, 'stuff', as a substitute for actual development. And them doing
ridiculous things that nobody would actually do.* Speechy-preachy dialogue.* Long, drawn-out scenes, over and over - except that this time most of
them - MOST of them - actually *contribute* to the overall effect
rather than just boring the viewer.* Focus on the completely wrong targets: the guy always makes the film
he thinks he's making, rather than the one the viewers actually end up
seeing, so you end up with these completely non-sequitur, irrelevant
'development' scenes. In this case there is a completely tacked-on
pre-ending that leaves the viewer going 'Why is this here? Why are we
supposed to care?'-Amazingly, NONE of which destroys it:-The intro is attention-grabbing.The build-up is stately and involving.The Weird piles-on quite disturbingly.And the twist is a GOOD one instead of something DUMB!-This is the first thing I've seen since The 6th Sense that wasn't
write-off rubbish.Maybe he's got on, or off, the right medication?? - -- ---
