Not what I expected

OK Wonder Woman review time ***Spoilers ahead***The first half of the movie was sooooo slow I had to literally hold my
eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep so im not gonna talk about
it. Now correct me if im wrong but this was billed as a "summer action
movie" correct? Well when its 2:10 mins and only about 15-20 mins is
actual action I have a problem with that. Don't get me wrong when she
was all kickin ass and whatnot it was awesome and I dug that part a
lot, thats why its saddening to me there was so little. Also on the
plus side the chemistry with her and Steve was good ... so of course he
dies lol. (sidenote he would have made a good Green Lantern with the
chemistry they showed) On the down side, once again a very slow movie
till the bunker scene (which was bad ass) and then nothing again till
the final fight which again there was no real Villain presence till the
last 10 mins and even then she spent half of that time fighting
mustache man Ares and not God of war Ares and as we all know for me the
villain makes the movie. I give it a 3/10 its not bad like Ghost
Rider/Fantastic Four bad its just not what I expected or hoped for at
all.
