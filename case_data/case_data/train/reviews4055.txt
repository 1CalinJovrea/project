You Fill In The Blanks With Your Own Fears

This is a very creepy film. How wonderful the Director uses what's not
said instead of what's said. The use of sound as others have noted:
masterful. All that said I'm not sure what I just saw. While others say
it implores a second viewing, I think otherwise. Our writer and
director want us to think about this for a while. Like Momento, a movie
talked about and puzzled over days after. Perhaps there is no
definitive story line, and they want us to fill in our own gaps. Take
an egg, crack it, and let the viewer decide what we have here: fried or
scrambled? Fill in the blanks with your own fears. Pop some corn.
Enjoy.
