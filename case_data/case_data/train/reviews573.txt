Love Hale Berry but this movie is really insignificantly bad!!!!

Typical of an American movie where the most important emphasis is put
on car chasing and people who have at least, like a cat, SEVEN lives.
Come on!......please.... I fail to understand why Hale would accept
playing in such a movie. She definitely has the talent to play in a
much better and significant movie. Sorry!!!
