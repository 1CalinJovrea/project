I have to be honest, I never expected to like this movie, but boy was it good.

Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all
the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to
comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie
you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network
between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of
youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in
high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie
adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and
Peter DeLuise play a minor role.Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits
a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance
was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing
Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his
persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice Â– Cube talking
to the duo.The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a
Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't
have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film
made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb
it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we
kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps
coming in from every corner making you laugh although.The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the
low moment was when they were apart.The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko
(respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to
bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't.
That's the fun of the movie.All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it.
