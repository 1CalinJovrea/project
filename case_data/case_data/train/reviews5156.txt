Couldn't see the last minuets

Must say, even in the first part I did anticipate this ending, but
wanted to believe he will not be as predictable and quit frankly bad
tasted. SPOILER!!! When he opened the door I just didn't, and couldn't continue watching.
On a personal level, I find it hard to believe that all of a sudden an
a-sexual, will become interested in sex, never the less with someone
like Jo, especially in her state of hopelessness and new goal of life
without sexuality. Overall the story is not very believable, as the character states too
much coincidences... It is very graphic, and in my opinion not in a
sexy way, but a disturbing way. I am giving this movie a low rate because the storyline does not hold
the movie, or justifies two whole movies, and especially because of the
poor poor choice of ending...
