Didn't like it.

Was hoping for a good superhero animation movie, But i was disappointed
measurably, The movie is weak from every aspect, The voices are bad,
the music doesn't make sense most of the time, And most important there
is no story at all, The foundation of the word is childish, nothing
happens that relate to anything, it's just random stuff to make a
movie, And god the animation was hideous, if it was better i could have
take the bad story and the nonsense world, There was a farting symphony
scene, I stopped my suffering there. Dreamworks, go back to Rise of the
guardians, and give us a second part of great voice acting and touching
story, stop making movies about underpants and evil babies.
