Keeps you wanting to guess the murder

THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM won't change the world, but it's definitely worth
watching if you're the kind of person who likes to watch a movie with a
bit of mystery. Set in old London, this movie follows a detective who
is trying to solve a series of murder cases that somehow seem to
connect to the local playhouse theater of the district. There's a host
of suspects, and time is running out as an innocent may be executed
soon.Here's the one thing that matters for a movie like this: I definitely
found myself trying to guess who the murderer was. And I really didn't
know for most of the movie who it would be! So in that sense, THE
LIMEHOUSE GOLEM clearly succeeded for me. There was some pretty good
acting and there were interesting themes of revenge and jealousy being
explored... all in all an interesting, although not world-changing,
crime thriller.
