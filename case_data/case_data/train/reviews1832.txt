Unbearable

The film is so bad it's not worth reviewing honestly. The only
redeeming quality was the CGI, but every other aspect was just so
predictable and boring. From the very beginning of the film you know
its going to be bad. One clich√© after another with that generic Top Gun
feel, with the lead male character a maverick in the navy. Rihanna is
acceptable but appears in parts of the film where you wouldn't expect
her to be. The inclusion of the real WW2 veterans was touching, but
exposed the poor story line and plot even more. The highlight of
absurdity came with the revival of the old battleship from a museum
piece to all of a sudden being fully laden with ammo and able to fire
up the engines at a moments notice. The adverts for the film gave you
an entirely different idea of what was to come. In other words false
advertising. This is yet another example of Hollywood relying on CGI
and that feeling of being on a roller-coaster at an amusement park.
Finally, if it wasn't for the fact that I had to write 10 lines I
wouldn't have. As for the film don't bother.
