If people didn't like this movie they are kidding themselves.

This is certainly one of the spookiest movies I've seen in some time.
It had the same jump factor as paranormal activity, and I was on the
edge of my seat for the most part of the film! Unlike a lot of horror
movies it stayed reasonably believable throughout the entire film and
didn't not end with some insane half wit ending. This is not the conjuring, I'm not sure why people are comparing the
two? But I think the comparisons are reflecting the poor reviews which
would explain the lower scores! They are two different movies that tie
in together but I don't feel they should compete but should be in
harmony with each other. If you are a fan of horror movies, especially
demons or just want to get your heart racing I 100% recommend this
movie!
