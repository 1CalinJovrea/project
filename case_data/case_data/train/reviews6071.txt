Did you guys not get it?

I just don't understand how people don't get what this movie is trying
to accomplish. This movie has a lot to say, but I think that people are
thrown off because it's a horror film. People have got to stop cyberbullying. People really do kill themselves
because of it. This movie shows the effects that it has on the people
that pushed others to kill themselves. I would like to say that this
movie pertains to high schoolers and young adults the most, but I
believe nowadays everyone needs to see this movie. Nearly everyone is
on Facebook or some social media. I have seen grown adults online
saying awful things to each other. Social media has ruined people's
lives yet people continue posting terrible things about each other. I feel this movie is attempting to show people that we all need to grow
up and realize the dangers of social media. *Possible Spoiler* This movie uses the fact that the person from the
dead can come back and get people to kill themselves. While this is a
little ridiculous, it actually makes sense, because the thought of
knowing that you made someone kill themselves would definitely make you
question whether you really deserve to be alive. Being responsible for
someone's death would definitely affect a person's mental health. I think people should see this movie as a lesson about social media
rather than a horror/thriller.
