Great Cast and Performances in an Average Family Drama

In Chicago, the successful and unethical defense attorney Hank Palmer
(Robert Downey Jr.) defends scumbags since his only interest is getting
money. Hank is divorcing and when his mother dies, his brother Glen
(Vincent D'Onofrio) calls him for the funeral and he leaves his
daughter with his wife. He travels to his hometown, Carlinville,
Indiana, and meets Glen, his estranged father, Judge Joseph Palmer
(Robert Duvall) and his slowed brother Dale (Jeremy Strong) that is
obsessed for making films. He also meets his former sweetheart Samantha
Powell (Vera Farmiga).On the next morning, Hank and his brothers note that their father's car
is damaged and Hank goes to the airport to fly back to Chicago. When
Hank is in the plane ready to fly, he receives a phone call from Glen
telling that their father has been accused of hit and run and the
victim is Mark Blackwell, a despicable man that was sentenced by Joseph
Palmer after killing a teenager. Hank returns but his father does not
have any recollection from the accident. Soon their unresolved issues
interfere in Hank's line of defense and the Prosecutor Dwight Dickham
(Billy Bob Thornton) wants to see Judge Palmer behind bars to revenge
Hank's victory in a trial in the past. Along the judgment, secrets are
disclosed. "The Judge" is a movie with great cast and performances in an average
family drama. The characters and situations are not well developed,
such as Hank's wife that vanishes; few information about Glen and Dale;
and the problem between the Judge and Hank. The stubborn Judge Joseph
Palmer knows the laws probably better than Hank, but he does everything
to compromise his testimony. Samantha's daughter vanishes and the
writer is coward and does not let Carla be Hank's daughter. My vote is
six.Title (Brazil): "O Juiz" ("The Judge")
