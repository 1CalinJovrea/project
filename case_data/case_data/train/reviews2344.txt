What happened to good writing?

This film is extremely dull! The director needs to go back and learn
what constitutes a good plot and remember that style over substances
leaves, in the end, a muddy mess of movie clich√©s: fly over shots, one
minute passionate sex (there seems to be a problem with modern males in
film and sexual stamina), weepy close-ups, 1930s melodramatic acting,
teenage hormones and mysteries that aren't mysteries at all. By the
middle of this film Nicole Kidman becomes a massive irritation as she
wonders what is wrong with her that men don't want to have sex with her
- a you've got to be kidding me moment - and bland Fiennes accusing her
for their teenage daughter's raging hormones. He blames Nic who
evidently was a wild girl that he eventually married because he didn't
want a wild women????? There is so much nonsense here that you come
away wondering how they got the money for this one, although that can
be asked of a lot of movies. Finally, the ending is no ending at all.
The one line- "she got in a car" - is related to the redundant "It was
only a dream" plot device.
