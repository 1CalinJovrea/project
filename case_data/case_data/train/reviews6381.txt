there is something deeply wrong with so many IMDb user

I am astonished, truly, that a hollow movie like spider-man; homecoming
that is instantly forgettable and fixated on lame themes of stupid
first-world teenage angst scored better user reviews than this
masterpiece. it really says a lot about the mindlessness of modern
cinema audiences, especially when the main argument is that ' there
isn't enough war'. that said, user reviews are moronic. Planet of the
apes is a triumph, really touching and thought, provoking on so many
levels. i saw it days ago and the emotion of the film is still very
fresh in my mind. in fact the more it occurs to me, the richer the
movie becomes. if this is not nominated in the best film Oscars
category, then the Academy is as daft as so many IMDb users.
