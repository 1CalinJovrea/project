Why would it be this

The twists are predictable, the scenes are unlogic, 5.5/10, can't be
any higher.But...wait, why would it be this? Sure those are the thoughts in my
mind, but why hands are shaking, why there are jellyfishes swimming in
my eyes? Although there is the most clich√©d routine, and the most
nonsensical plots, but with the earnest production and the performance
with the true heart of every filmmaker, animator and voice actor behind
the scene, there is a film provided to us, beyond compare. As a
foreigner, I think those maybe the one reason why the US is great, the
children in the auditorium are cheered for the roles, with the audience
in the film together, when the film about ends, and then the adults are
cheered with children, too. I think after years, when those children
grew up, there must be someone who will always remember the night
he/she had been planted a seed in the heart, named DREAM. This film is
similar to La La Land, but still different. On is the love story for
adults, but another one is the modern fairy tale for young and old. The
only thing there are same is Dream, the eternal topic of human being. 1
point for Dream, and 1 point for cheering audience in the auditorium.
7.5/10 highly recommended.
