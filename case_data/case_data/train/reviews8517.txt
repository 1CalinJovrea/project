This was a awful movie

Predictable, unimaginative, boring, and just dumb. It was very
difficult to sit through this film, and even the kids hated it. High
production values and good 3D animation don't count for anything with a
story as dull as this one.There are a lot of 'jokes' in the movie that feel like they came out of
one of those 1970s Hannah-Babara cartoons.The "action" sequencesand there are many of themare long, loud, and
still very dull because they are entirely predictable, even down to the
final, predictable and forced 'joke' at the end. One follows upon the
other with a very thin sheen of story to connect them.
