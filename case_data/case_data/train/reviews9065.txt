Enjoyable

I was discouraged when I saw the low ratings for this film, but
thankfully I had already started watching it. It is definitely not
comparable laughter-wise to movies such as This Is The End or 21 & 22
Jump Street, but it is very good. The type of humor may not be for
everyone, but I found it to be very relatable. The way the jokes were
delivered is how my friends and I joke most often. The actors in it
were great and the story moved at a nice pace. Miles Teller was great
and I now look forward to his work in the future, Imogen Poots was
lovely and Zac Efron was great as always. I don't think Efron gets as
much credit as he deserves. It portrays a few different likely dating
situations that people could find themselves In these days. I would say
it's more for twenty-something's than any other age group. If you are
at all curious about this movie I say you should give it a shot!
