Too predictable

So there are lots of squealing tires and shooting. The storyline has
the usual components: double cross, ex-wife/custody of child conflict,
child is a 13 year old daughter "going on 18" who just happens to have
some experience at the wheel. There's just not enough imagination and I
can't recommend.
