I would rather spend time at the DMV...

Please do not waste your time with this film. I had very low
expectations for this movie and I was still underwhelmed. None of the
characters are likable because there is no backstory at all except for
one character who's brief history is touched upon . All you know is
that they are here to win money in a game which was not described to
them before the night began. This movie is also filled with characters
that have zero meaning to the film like the sadistic hosts son and a
black vigilante that comes to try to save the day. Characters seem to
die immediately from relatively minor injuries as well. Even the core
gimmick of this film confuses me. If it was merely a gore film then why
does the camera shy away from the action? And if it was meant to be
something more why hasn't any motive been established to illicit
empathy for the characters?. It didn't matter at all who lived or died
to me because no one was likable. Even the actors themselves seemed
bored and indifferent. At the end of the day here we have a meaningless
film who's hook failed to deliver any shock value. It was thoroughly
disappointing from start to finish.
