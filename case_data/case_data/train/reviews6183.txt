Slice of life

I was very impressed by Britt in this film. The storyline is typical
but the truthfulness that the characters bring is why this movie is so
good. Teenage sex for the first time is a big deal and that is explored
throughout the movie. Also the realization that sex is not such a big
deal is also explored very true to life. Aubrey is so willing to loose
her virginity to a typical jerk because she knows that sex is not going
to be good at this point anyway. Dave thinks it should be special and
mean something. The relationship between teenager and parents is
briefly shown and rather funny. The chemistry between Aubrey and Dave
is unmistakable and i really enjoyed watching them together.
