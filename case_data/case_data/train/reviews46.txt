Couple of monsters.

Great movie about horrific stuff. There ya go. Evelyn and John cruise
Perth school yards, fishing for teenage girls with friendly Aussie
banter and car ride offers. The pleasantries end right there.As the secret predator couple in the neighbourhood, Emma Booth and
Stephen Curry are spectacular in their complicated performances.
Charming and congenial, slick and methodical, brutal and sadistic,
vulnerable and suspicious; all bases are covered. "Hounds of Love" is
about serial sexual homicide, and it is as brutal as that sounds. Not
in an exploitative manner (most of the cruelty is off screen), but in
its believable depiction of perversion, and the matter of fact
execution by the monsters.Sporting a cheesy mustache, Curry presents a tiny, unassuming wimp - he
is humiliated and berated about money owing. Yet deep inside he is a
tight wound ball of explosion, and the creepy manipulator of all
crimes. Evelyn is a more than wiling accomplice, but she has a wounded
past, shows some semblance of sympathy, and is thus the weak link in
the monster couple. How all this plays out in the most recent triangle
is expertly framed by newbie filmmaker Ben Young. "Hounds of Love" is a difficult watch, but it's also difficult to
ignore.
