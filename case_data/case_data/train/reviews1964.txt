Taylor Sheridan depicts another dilapidated region of America

If you've seen any of Taylor Sheridan's previous work, you probably
noted that he has a certain style. He tells stories about ways of life
in dilapidated regions of the country. He blurs the lines between "good
guys" and "bad guys," instead framing the status of the selected region
as the truest villain. What's right and wrong, considering all the
unique variables of each story, is not always clear. At least, that was
case in Sicario and Hell or High Water. In Wind River, the region is still presented with all the strain that
is causes on the lives of its residents, but a much more obvious
villain is revealed before the movie is over. Hell of High Water frames the crumbling economy of a certain Texas
region as the real source of evil, rather than any characters. Whereas
in Wind River the source of evil is definitely the rapist. I mean, the
rapist attempts to blame the cold and silence, but his actions were
clearly much worse than bad weather. Sheridan's previous films also left doubt about who were the heroes,
who the audience should be rooting for. This time it was much less
ambiguousÂ—they were the people searching for the rapist.An emerging theme in Sheridan's movies appears to be Tarantinoesque
eruptions of violence, sometimes near the conclusion. They don't always
reach the levels of the Django Unchained shootout, but Sheridan clearly
isn't shy about showcasing the unforgiving damage that can be inflicted
by firearms. Complaints, I have a few. On more than one occasion, I legitimately
could not understand what a character had said, so I was left wondering
if I missed something important. I'm not sure if this manner of
speaking was a choice made by the actors or if this was a decision made
by Sheridan to establish a certain tone. Either way, I could have used
less mumbling. The other complaint that I have, and this is more serious, the middle
third of the movie felt like it contained a lot of empty moments. This
may or may not have been related to the times that I couldn't
understand what a character said. Still, the movie could have used a
bit of its fat trimmed. It wasn't as crisp and clean as Hell or High
Water and Sicario. And I know I keep comparing this movie to Sheridan's
others, but that's bound to happen when a writer sets the bar so high
with two gems.On the whole, I consider this a success for Sheridan in his directorial
debut. I'd happily watch another story of his about justice and an
overlooked culture.
