Snowden was a Patriot

I don't understand people that complain about this movie. There is zero to complain about in this movie. You got to wonder if the
low reviews are government paid employees or just Oliver Stone haters.I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I was mesmerized from the
beginning of the film until the end. I honestly had no idea it ran two
hours and 20 minutes. A movie is never too long if you don't look at
your phone and check the time. Myself, nor did anyone in the theater
once look down at their phone. The movie had great cinematography,
excellent pacing, strong emotional dialogue, and solid
character/relationship arcs. You can't ask for much more of a drama
based on a true story. Excellent job Oliver. Welcome back! The truth is people don't want to hear it. If it doesn't directly
affect their cozy iPhone streaming lives, than they don't want to hear
about it. They don't want to hear that they are wage slaves. They don't
want to hear that there is no such thing as privacy in this country.
They don't want to hear that the government isn't a democracy. People
don't want to hear that the American government isn't a government at
all, and that it's been replaced by a multi-national fortunate 100
corporate conglomeration funded by the international banking cartel.
People don't want to know the truth.I'd venture a guess that most of the people that rated this movie
poorly didn't even see the movie. These are the same people that can't
handle the truth. Open your eyes people. Don't be another corporate
wage slave.
