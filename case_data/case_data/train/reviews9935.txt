Directed like a 12 year old

Obviously Jeff Baena must be well connected in Hollywood to be able to
get funding and backing for this awful production. Aside from the poor
directing, the acting was horrible. I was very tempted to walk out
after the first 20 minutes, but I kept on hoping for something good to
happen--and it did: after 90 minutes, it was all over! I was the first
one out!
