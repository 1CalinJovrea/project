Intelligent and thrilling storytelling with amazing CGI  Science-Fiction of the best possible kind

Among Hollywood's recent output of mediocre (and in some cases:
downright abysmal) remakes of Sci-Fi classics, 'Rise of the Planet of
the Apes' was the rare movie which stood out, for it had as much of a
brain as it had a heart  plus an original approach to the well-known
material and great visuals. Having said that, 'Rise' practically pales
in comparison to Matt Reeves' sequel: the upcoming 'Dawn of the Planet
of the Apes' is as close to a Science-Fiction masterpiece as a 170
million PG-13 Hollywood summer blockbuster can possibly get.The storyline picks up ten years after we saw Ceasar and his fellow
simian escapees seek refuge in the woods near San Francisco, and
although the film's trailers already gave away pretty much everything
that happened during that time (and alas, way too much of what will
happen), I'm not going to spoil anything for those who carefully
avoided watching said trailers. As with all my reviews, instead of
giving away any details about the story, I'll elaborate on all other
aspects of the movie.What needs to be mentioned first is what an astonishing achievement
'Dawn' is when it comes to the use of CGI. I'm normally very critical
towards the (over-)use of CGI  but the level of craftsmanship
displayed here simply has to be admired. It only took me seconds to
forget I was watching digital characters (brought to life through the
outstanding motion-capture performances by Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell
and Judy Grier  to name but a few), and I can't begin to imagine what
a task it must have been for the artists and wizards in the animation
department to work on every background and every tiny little detail of
every character until this level of seamlessness and reality could be
achieved.But nearly every other aspect of the movie has been realized equally
well: Michael Giacchino's haunting musical score fits and reflects the
drama on screen perfectly, while the  often terrifying  beauty of the
images on screen had me immediately wondering who the DoP was (now I
know: Michael Seresin, the genius veteran DoP of such classics as
'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'). When it comes to the action;
well, 'Dawn' is not your usual summer blockbuster. This is no
light-hearted, comic-book-style fantasy film with fun, over-the-top
action scenes. What we have here is a gritty, realistic portrayal of a
slowly escalating conflict, and when we do get to the battle scenes in
the third act, those scenes are a spectacular, mesmerizing visual feast
(and ultimately heart breaking).But the core of this film  and also the reason why the action scenes
in the third act really do have an impact and all the mayhem really
gets to you  is the intelligent, skilfully told story with its
well-drawn, believable characters (portrayed by equally believable
actors). The tragic simian/human conflict mirrors our real  and very
human  past and present day wars and social frictions in a very
credible way and thus makes this film resonate far beyond what any mere
Sci-Fi premise would let you expect. So my verdict: With its beautiful imagery, highly relevant story and
breath-taking effects, 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' is as close to
a Science-Fiction masterpiece as its mass-audience orientated
constrictions allowed it to be (which  in this case  is very close);
an astonishing achievement and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/
