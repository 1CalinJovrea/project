A film of zombies, by zombies and for zombies

More like the Scouts Guide to Crappy Filmmaking. Look, nobody's going
into this film with high expectations, but is it too much ask for at
least a handful of well-deserved laughs? Scouts Guide could only have
been made today. Zombies are all the rage these days (for reasons I
can't explain) and there's always room for teen comedies with lots of
gross-out humor and sex jokes. You'd think combining both genres into
one movie would make sense, but--despite the actors' efforts--Scouts
Guide just stumbles from one scene to the next, begging you to care.Do I even need to explain the story? Three scouts and a stripper, I
mean cocktail waitress, join forces to survive the zombie apocalypse.
One of them, Ben, is in love with some girl named Kendall and I'm sure
they will absolutely not end up together in the end... Honestly, need I
say more? Zombie apocalypse, lame jokes, running zombies, running from
zombies; the list goes on.Also, is it too much to ask for the film to stick to its own rules? I
know what kind of film we're dealing with here, but the lack of
consistency is just annoying, especially when the film tries to
generate some actual tension in its action scenes. One moment, the
zombies unleash their inner Usain Bolt and in the next, they're
standing quietly behind someone, waiting to unleash a cheap jump-scare.
And how did this apocalypse even get started to begin with? There's
something cool about a zombie movie not wasting time with pointless
techno-babble and just trying to be funny, but there was an opportunity
here for some ridiculously funny explanation.And that's Scouts Guide in a nutshell: wasted potential. It's a parody
that fails at being a parody. There were countless opportunities for
the film to really take apart the zombie genre, to embrace it and mock
it simultaneously, but it never rises to the occasion.
