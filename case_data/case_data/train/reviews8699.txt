I didn't really rate this movie as it just was not scary at all. Usual
"creepy" characters, acting was mediocre and just the whole silliness
of it all just killed it for me. The whole crux of the story is very bizarre; A bunch of wealthy white
people duping, seducing and hypnotising black men so that they can
force a brain-swap to gain the physical attributes of black men and
make them servile to white people?! I didn't know if I was supposed to
be watching a horror film or a comedy but it definitely didn't hit the
mark on either. I couldn't help notice the racial digs in this film
too. Actually the whole film is one big racial dig come to think of it,
and it's a dig toward BOTH black and white people. Silly film in my
opinion which was neither scary nor funny.
