One of the worst movies I have seen in my life!

Well, I am not an average American teenager who giggles and laughs when
I see giant monsters with a tree size dick dangling around their body.I lost 2 hours of my life that I can never get back and I feel very
stupid about it.I chose the movie after I saw the list of actors, many of them I really
like, but I can't believe they actually worked in this total piece of
crap.Rapture seems to be the "thing" in Hollywood these days, the nonsense
from fanatic religious crazies is coming to our home like a blessing
while it tells us that we can be saved if we are truly "good".And for gods sake, who wants to be in a heaven where people dance with
the used-to-be-cool back street boys!
