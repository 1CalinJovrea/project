Songs an adult can enjoy...finally

This movie is the definition of today's POP culture including the
songs, colors, animation and plot. It's a simple plot and it sticks the
landing. Like good kids animation does, both motion or book form, it
does not attempt to be realistic. It's a cute story that is fast paced
and as an adult, it mixes new and old songs that were perfect for the
movie and very good remixes, to the point I could actually listen to
these songs in the car with my children verses "Let it Snow" or "Do you
want to build a snowman" which make me want to jam ice-picks in my
ears. I'm not a fan of the most recent Disney movies (i.e. Frozen) plots or
songs. This movie does not try to cram complex concepts like the death
of parents or falling in love in 5 minutes which leaves gaping plot
holes, from an adult perspective. It's not trying to be grandiose. It's
a kid movie told on kid level with enough nostalgia to rope parents in
who are in their 30's and 40's. Think old school cartoons Smurfs and
Gummy Bears crammed into one told with modern animation and songs.
