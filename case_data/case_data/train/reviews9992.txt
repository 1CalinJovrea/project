Unreal... seriously... Why?

OK, first let me say I am a fan off off beat cult type artistic movies.
No matter who rates what I will still see it for myself and come up
with my own opinion. (I wish I could suggest you do the same here)That all said, this movie is one long drawn out, slow, Lost show style
plot (if that), striving to be artistic and moving and... just...
doesn't get there... ever... not even close.A friend said I should watch this movie. I want to slap him and never
trust anything he says ever again. Usually I would say, a movie has some redeeming qualities some place...
this one is totally void of any.So, you probably already read the layout of what happens, so I wont
rehash that here. Let me say that I can 100% agree with their reviews.
Entirely agree. Someone said there was drama, and murder and all that... yeah... murder
yes. Painfully so... but the drama...? And the person who filmed this movie seemed to love focusing the camera
needlessly on the rear end of Suki Waterhouse. Not that it's a bad rear
end. However, just about every scene is focused there and I almost half
waited for the missing dialogue in the film to come out of it... Cast
Away was better at limited dialogue than this film by a long shot, say
Galaxy wide long shot.Just save yourself the time. If you really want to see it for the train
wreck it is, be my guest, but consider yourself warned. It's really
really... REALLY boring, slow, pointless and VERY Bad. Seriously bad.
