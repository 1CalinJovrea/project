One of the Scariest Horror Movies I Ever Saw

This particular flick restored my lost faith in horror movies. Creepy
elements galore from start to finish. The idea of an animated corpse
with a bell attached to its foot particularly was so hair-raising.There are no cheap scares in The Autopsy of Jane Doe. No cheap effects
either. What's so nice about it is it scares the viewer from various
angles -- from the claustrophobic basement setting to the fact that not
much info on Jane Doe is revealed, which further fuels the mystery that
pervaded the movie from start to finish.Both Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox gave stellar performances! Needless to
say, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is one of the scariest, scariest horror
movies I saw, and it's worth watching!
