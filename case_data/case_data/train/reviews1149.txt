Great serve for entertainment and equality

Battle of the Sexes is an old fashioned, sensitive, crowd pleasing film
that never feels outdated. The only downside is how fact & fiction
portrayed in Battle of the Sexes almost feels like a documentary.As I was watching Battle of the Sexes, a part of me felt ashamed that
attitudes towards women sports, equal pay and rights haven't made giant
steps since 1973.From the opening frames, Billy Jean King (beautifully played by Emma
Stone) is fighting against US Lawn Tennis Association for equal pay;
men's single prize money is $12,000 and women's single prize money is
$1,200. Billy is asking for equal pay but the male bosses reject her
plea; they believe the men's tennis has bigger names, higher quality
and draws bigger crowds  despite woman's tennis games drawing the same
crowds. Battle of the Sexes isn't about tennis but the universal fight to be
freed from the shackles of outdated societal values. Directors Valerie Faris & Johnathan Dayton and screenwriter Simon
Beaufoy use the well-worn underdog, sports template to winning effect;
repellent villains, training montages, back room deals and typical
last-minute setbacks are knowingly included (although this did happen
in real life). Despite the sport movie clichés, the filmmakers manage
to find space for moments of real sensitivity; Billy Jean's
self-exploration or Bobby consoling his wife, the tension is felt on
both sides.Considering how many high-profile male politicians and public figures
have been rightly criticised for their attitude towards women, the film
could've taken the easy step to make bobby Riggs a real chauvinistic
monster. Credit to Carell and Beaufoy for not descending Riggs into a
caricature; he's clown, showman and compulsive gambler who you may
perversely believe that he helped Women's Tennis Association in
stature.From the 16mm film stock, the sun-dried visuals and music choices; this
is a wonderfully romantic film, embracing love in every form and
wearing its modern-day parable with pride. Despite BOTS relevant
themes, this never feels preachy or one-note while becoming an
incredibly entertaining movie.Whether you are voting yes or no in the current plebiscite, I have no
doubt anyone watching Battle of the Sexes will be air punching their
way to the end and hopefully feel the need to change the world. That's
what great entertainment can do; make people unaware they're embracing
an disagreeable ideal without realizing it.
