The world is a computer simulation and this @ 8.3 is a FAULT

This thing is getting similar ratings on IMDb and Rotten to HEAT for
Christ's sake. HEAT? This movie was deeply flawed. I only stayed to the
end to see how bad it could get - its MST3K riffable bad. Its got a ton of plot holes. I almost want to pick it apart like I did
Ghostbusters 2016. But I cant. Its not worth the energy. Please before
going to pay for this in the theater think about if you would like a
version of the already bad Furious type movies with even more plot
holes, choreographing gun fights to music added in and fairly bad
acting.Music is fair. I mean, its just not that great. Foxx and Spacey don't
lift and acting finger. The "villain" changes like 4 times. And the best getaway driver is the one who never has to exceed the
speed limit. This driver and his idiot crews get screwed every time
into driving like maniacs from the police.I don't want to pee on Ansel Elgort's parade. Its not his fault. But to
be 95%/90% on rotten, and 8.3 here, and in the mid 80s on meta? Come
ON. Movie tix are far too expensive to dupe people into seeing this. It
does seem like the rating system is being rigged for this.I wish Ansel well, and hope Ed Wright and the crew can put together
better stuff but man, either this is the sign of the times or there is
a fault in our reality simulator. Heat and Ronin destroy a movie like this. If you think this movie
deserves even half what say a movie like Heat or Ronin get you are
mentally ill.
