Well, the one sheet looks good.....

Chris Faraday once smuggled illegal items or contraband into the
country on freighters.He left that life behind, got married has a family and went legit. But
when his brother-in-law gets involved with Briggs, a drug dealer and
when blows a deal, Briggs demands restitution which he can't deliver.So Chris offers to find a way to pay him but the he threatens Chris'
family if he doesn't deliver.So he gets on a freighter destined for Panama and he sets out to bring
back some counterfeit currency. Briggs "goes to see" Chris' family.When Chris learns of this he asks his friend Sebastian to take care of
them which he does. He tells Chris that it would be better to bring
drugs instead of the cash.....The one rule that film makers should know now is that if you hire Ben
Foster, everyone will know his character will turn out to be a bad
apple come the end, no matter what. This has been evident since X-Men:
The Last Stand.But thats not the problem with he film, the problem with he film is the
lack of flow with he story, and the worst narrative I have ever
endured. The film is bad on many levels, and it just gets the extra
star for one confrontation between Marky Mark and Ribisi.The cast seem really out of place, and Farraday never really seems to
feel any urgency throughout the movie, despite his wife and kids being
in danger, and Ribisis continuing threats.All in all it's a very badly made movie, not knowing whether to be Heat
one minute, or the Italian job the next.
