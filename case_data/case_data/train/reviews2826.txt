Prohibition time: the most interesting battles are not just in the cities...

Hold it everyone! Don't be put off because this has Shia Le Beouf in
it. Yes, some of you loath him for the Transformers movies, Indy 4 and
plenty of other stuff. However, in this one he manages to find a good
vehicle to change his tact.We are in prohibition time, in the countryside in Virginia. The men are
tough and they enforce their own law protecting their moonshine
businesses. However they aren't the cringing redneck clich√© of many
other films; this isn't Deliverance. This is a dark movie where it
seems those outwith of the religious community live and survive by
force. In comes law enforcers from outside led by a sadistic sergeant,
and we have an explosive mix.Again, don't get the wrong impression. This film isn't about gung-ho
good v evil. This is a lot more. Based on a true story (albeit likely
taking big liberties with the truth), this is about the relationship of
three brothers: two are ruthless whilst the third (Le Beouf) is weak.
They look out for each other and that's the real nub.Action comes generally in short sharp moments, but thankfully doesn't
detract from the rest of the movie. Surprisingly some great acting and
great camera work.Personally, I enjoyed this very much. Ending was the only bit I was
disappointed with but rest was very good. Give it a try, you may be
surprised with what you find.
