Disappointment

I watched this because I enjoyed the first two. The third was a decline
from the Hunger Games 1 and 2 but so much time invested compelled the
watching Mocking Jay 2. I was hoping for a great ending for such an
anticipated movie and was greatly disappointed.The plot was almost non existent and just rode on the waves of the
other movies. The story line was disjointed and herky jerky. The
development of the love story was terrible and did not evoke the
emotion displayed in the first two. Very let down...I did not read the books, but I'm sure that those true fans were
greatly let down. I wish they just took out Hoffman altogether than the
way they pieced him in with 60 seconds of total airtime.
