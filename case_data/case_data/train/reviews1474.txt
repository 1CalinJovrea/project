Entertaining Mystery

(Big Spoilers) Directed smoothly by Tate Taylor, mystery/suspense movie
"The Girl on the Train" doesn't break any originality margins, but it
nicely entertains. In the jig-saw puzzle style, Taylor has Emily Blunt,
Haley Bennett, and Rebecca Ferguson in a trio of decent performances.
The story could be a bit overlong, and somewhat far-fetched in some
character reactions and scenes, but I enjoyed the old-school mystery.
You have to swallow disbelief in the idea that Blunt's character
juxtaposes her recollections of how she acts. Alcohol is a ready-made
explanation for this, but anyway, if you're looking to poke holes in
the story, you could. And sometimes movies don't deserve the benefit of
the doubt, but I found it more fun to just watch this one. 7/10
