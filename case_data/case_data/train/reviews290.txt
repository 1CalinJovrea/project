No Bueno... SMH

I love the Resident Evil films. Sure, they are campy, but they are
always fun and are usually a great action flick.Retribution is absolutely not the case. Does it have lots of action?
Yes, but when you have such a weak plot line as is showcased here not
even GOOD action can save it. Even the action scenes themselves are
horrendous, with mediocre at best special effects in most parts and
ludicrous scenarios that never play well off of one another, not to
mention the 20 page script for the entire film. The only lines
delivered all seem like they were a Jr. High film project, and add
nothing to the story except one liners and catchphrases.All in all, this film is easily on my top 10 worst films of all time
list, and I doubt many things will surpass it in the future.
