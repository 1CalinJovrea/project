Tired old remakes

I always found the original quite a depressing movie and not
particularly interesting but it shines in comparison to this funeral
dirge of a movie.Why do they keep remaking old classics if they aren't going to make a
better job , or at least make the effort to try. There are so many
great ideas in old Comics like 2000AD, Tornado and Starlord amongst the
gems of comics from the 80's they could make into movies. More to the
point, where are the writers with ideas these days? It seems its just
easier to remake an old classic they think can make some money - how
sad for the movie industry.There isn't much I can say about this movie A. Because I cant be
bothered as it isn't worth my time and B. There are just 3 words
necessary SLOW, BORING, UNWORTHY.
