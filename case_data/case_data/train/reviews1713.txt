nothing new.

I totally agree with reviewer amrelsherif. this is a slice of "real"
life movie, where your heart is supposed to pour out to the little
charming tyke and her life with her mother. I really don't know any
parent who lets their child roam around totally without parental
guidance. this is a little girl and her friends, after all. this seems
like child abuse to me. nothing rings true and you don't feel
compassion for the predicament these characters find themselves in.
there is a lot of buzz for willem Dafoe's performance. honestly, for an
actor with his ability, this could not have been much of a challenge.
peace.
