As a Reader...

I read all of the books because of how curious I was to see if the
movies matched up. What I really enjoy in an adaptation movie is how it
brings a story to life; Allegiant takes the story which was quite
interesting, and throws the story line in pieces. The suspense and
anticipation that I experienced with the previous two films and stories
is not the same as with Allegiant. Besides the story line taking a
tangent from its original story, the revised story line is bland and
predictable. I do not have high expectations for the sequel if they
continue to deviate from the original story so drastically. I really
hope that I will be proved wrong, but I am thoroughly disappointed.
