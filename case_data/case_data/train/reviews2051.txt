Offers nothing good

'Bleed for This' is about as "by the book" as movies come sadly. It's
based on a true story, but in a lot of ways it does a disservice to the
real story. First of all, the main character Vinny Pazienza is
portrayed in a very unbelievable way. The movie goes out of its way to
make him seem like an absolute saint, for no reason other than that we
are supposed to root for him. I would've preferred his character
actually had some realistic outbursts and we weren't necessarily
rooting for him. It would have made the whole experience feel more
authentic.The first half hour of the film, the set-up phase, is pretty dull and
uninteresting and is going to lose a lot of people right there and
then. The middle third of the film is certainly the most interesting.
His dealing with the accident and the recovery side of things is far
more interesting than the parts that should have been the most exciting
at the beginning and end (go figure).'Bleed for This' does nothing to stand out from the crowds of movies
being put forward today. The only people I can see getting any
enjoyment out of this film are people who have a love for boxing or a
particular interest in this story. For everyone else though, give it a
miss.
