Oh DEAR LORD.  A Most Awful Ghost Bore

I LIKE 'pretentious' movies and films that speak to you on a different
level. THIS however was pure torture and while I feel that the creators
truly wanted to say something, it was MORE THAN APPARENT that they
didn't have ENOUGH to say and so they filled it with
mind-bogglingly-SLOW scenes. SPOILERS!I see that many have already covered the scene with the pie, but I feel
that they didn't quite get the point across correctly: You have a FULL
FIVE MINUTES (although they feel like ten) of the main female lead
doing nothing but EATING A PIE! And yes, she does do well, in that it
is meant to make you uncomfortable, but no film EVER, in the history of
films, needs a scene where for five minutes someone does nothing but
eat a pie. Beyond that, it is not counting the ten minutes it took her
to walk in the house, put her mail down, walk around, stand at the
sink, find the pie ... OR for that matter, the five minutes earlier in
the film (I could be exaggerating about the time in this particular
scene, but again, it felt like forever) where she drags a chest or box
of some kind to the curbside - and I must bring your attention to the
use of the words DRAGS. The scene is shot in painstaking detail and
SLOWNESS as she does this, across her long front yard, THEN she goes
back into her house. Honestly, it is just too much. This film should have been a short of some kind, or else it needed more
work before it was released. Again, I applaud the creators in wanting
to bring this film to the screen, BUT if you KNOW a project is not
ready or not worthy, WHY do it and insult your viewers with such trash?
