Dull and boring.

This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy,
and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension
should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is
already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that
Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes
and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary
Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker.
For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and
Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains
no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock
characters and situations usually employed to give a story some
substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone
conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy
of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an
American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to
detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is
the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned.
Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the
actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out,
there's no story.
