In danger of not caring...

I usually love Steven Soderbergh films. And this one starts off with
his usual brilliance and had me hooked for the first half of the film.The first of the film is well-acted, well-crafted, smart and involving.Then comes the crunch: without spoiling, the second half of the film is
quite different. In a sense the "smart" of the film just becomes an
exercise in how "clever" the plot can be at the expense of any
emotional truth to the characters. I stopped caring for the ensemble as
they started to feel like lifeless pawns following the whims of a "how
clever am I?" plot-line. You'll enjoy it if you like a Sunday Afternoon
TV Detective movie and like solving the puzzle, but this is not great
theatre.It is better than most films, but only just. Certainly one of
Soderbergh's most disappointing. Rooney Mara makes it still watchable -
an actress to keep following.
