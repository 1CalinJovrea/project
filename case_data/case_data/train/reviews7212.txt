Same as the first movie (but with robots)

It's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done
to all involved.Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control
of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the
planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together
where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds
controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat
the alien threat.Well.... This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which
then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army
trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues
involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &/or beating each
other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be
intelligent but comes across as dull. Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in
the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a
weekend retreat to go to).But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War
it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as
possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then
this is enough to keep an audience happy.Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!
