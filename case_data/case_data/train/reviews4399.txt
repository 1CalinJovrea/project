Authentic Enough, Sweet Portrayal of a family's true story

"Goodbye Christopher Robin" conveys the real life story of author A A
Milne ( played by D. Gleeson ) and his son Christopher Robin Milne (
played by Will Tilston ), and how the junior Milne's toys inspired his
father to create the iconic children's character "Winnie the Pooh ".The movie shows the Milne family's life after A A Milne returned home
post World War 1. A A Milne develops post-war trauma and this creates a
lot of problems for his family members ; it mostly damages his
relationship with his wife. However, Milne does begin to heal, greatly
influenced by the "playing time" he spends with his son. The movie
impressively displays the creation of Winnie the Pooh, which was
developed by Milne through inspiration from his son Christopher's toys.The performances are very impressive. D. Gleeson gives a restrained but
effective performance as the famous author A A Milne. Will Tilston, who
plays Milne's son Christopher Robin, gives a very fine and sweet
performance ; he portrays the innocence and angst of his character with
equal ease, which is a very rare feat for a young child-actor. Kelly
McDonald shines in her role as Christopher's nanny.The movie explores a number of themes - post war trauma, troubled
relationships, the innocence of childhood and its inevitable
destruction, the effects of fame and a busy life. "Goodbye Christopher
Robin" succeeds in tackling and portraying most of these themes.
However, the movie's best moments are when Milne (Gleeson) and
Christopher (Tilston) play with each other, and in this process, Milne
heals and also develops the legendary character of Winnie the Pooh. The
direction is good. I would love to become a story-screenplay writer for
movies because intriguing stories keep developing in my mind all the
time (Yes, I really mean it). Employers / Movie Studios can contact me
