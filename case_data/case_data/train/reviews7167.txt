Never so happy to see the credits.

I didn't think it could get worse than the original Silent Hill. It is
a shame, considering the games where so good. But this was another dull
movie that couldn't end quick enough. By the end of this tragedy, I had
felt like I had been hit in the head with a sledge hammer. The worse
part about it is that I will never get the time back that I spent
watching this mess. I just hope and pray that this ends here. A third
installment would be a very cruel thing to impose on the public. The
poor acting carried over from the first movie. The lack of any horror
also carried over. There are very few movies that I have seen that I
can find nothing positive about from the beginning to end. But Silent
Hill and Silent Hill Revelation are two movies that were awful from the
opening credits to the end credits. Please save yourself and miss this
one.
