VERY funny -- a very pleasant surprise!

I was talked into seeing this, and I have to shout it out, because it
is a RIOT! I don't write many reviews, but when I love a film, I have
to. If I have any complaint on this one, it's the title. I expected
gross-out humor ("crude"). There isn't any, really. It's actually
extremely unpredictable, subtle and extremely smart humor.It has a story arc that you begin to somewhat anticipate, but you don't
feel you're being patronized. Instead, you're left feeling that very
intelligent people put this thing together in hopes that everyone would
find something to love about it.The cast is great, the animation is fun, and it's non-dizzying 3-D.When I saw it, the entire audience clapped at the end, because we were
entertained throughout, and found the ending really satisfying.What else? Sweet emotions crop up because we can all relate to the
family dynamics. Every family has the screw-up, the salt of the earth,
the rebel, and the stubborn one. And it has one of the funniest babies
ever put on film. A baby unlike any baby you'll ever see anywhere.Very, very funny. Definitely recommend.
