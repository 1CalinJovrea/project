Bland story that leads nowhere

The good thing about Green's teenage stories are that the teenagers are
kind of nice people, the bad thing is that it's just not very
interesting. He loves her does silly things for her chases her she
doesn't love him and it's over. What was the point of it? Don't bother
to be whipped? Nat Wolff isn't quite leading man material. There are
dorky types who are can carry off romance and passion but he just looks
disinterested. Cara Delevigne the it girl from London pulls off a good
accent. Her character isn't that interesting.The Fault in our Stars" wasn't totally original but it was involving.
This one is just nothing.
