The German Amélie

This movie is certainly not for everyone. If thinking of a oozing zit
makes you gag, if you get queasy at the sight of blood, if you suffer
from nosocomephobia, or tomophobia, or if any mention of bodily fluids
instantly offends your sensitivity, i'm sorry to say you'll never get
to enjoy this beautiful little movie.If, on the other hand, you're one of those people who, like me, see
Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings as a bittersweet shift from a
brilliant career in gore (Braindead, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles); if
you share a morbid fascination for human anatomy (in all its
scatological glory), or simply find the cultural taboos surrounding it
ridiculously irrational; you'll absolutely love this movie.Trying to describe Wetlands, to me, instantly evokes Jeunet's Amélie
(as weird as that may sound). They are of course two very different
movies, but in the same way, i think, as the modern tale of Sleeping
Beauty is so prudishly different from the original Grimm's tale. Both
movies essentially revolve around a quirky and naive young woman with
family issues striving to find love and meaning in her life through the
weirdest and most hare-brained schemes imaginable. And, in that regard,
Carla Juni's prodigious embodiment of her character perfectly rivals
Audrey Tatou's equally spectacular performance.If you can only find the same charm in Helen's quirkiness as you did in
Amélie's, and get past all the visceral lewdness, you'll find Wetlands
doesn't really aim to offend or disgust, as some critics would claim.
The fact is, those who could only point at that aspect of this movie,
were just sadly incapable of braking through that moral wall and seeing
beyond it. Some people, of course, will never be able to appreciate the
beauty of a garden, because they're too repulsed by the smell of
manure...
