Deeply disappointing.

It is difficult to include spoilers, which presume a plot. There is no
proper plot, just a series of loosely connected episodes. There are far
too many noisy special effects at contrast with the quiet subtlety of
such items in Potter as 'Fluffy' or Quiddiitch. What was even worse was
the acting. There wasn't any except for Johnny Depp''s small moment at
the end and Eddie Redmayne's ever pleasant charm. But it is Eddie who
is charming us, not some unconvincing character called Newt Scamander.
If there is to be a series of Newt Scamander films, PLEASE spend the
money on the cast and not the effects and PLEASE return to the humanity
which were hallmark of the Harry Potter books and also a fundamental
reason for their greatly deserved success.
