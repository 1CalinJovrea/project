Recipe for a mediocre sequel:

1) A much smaller budget than the original (20 mil vs 50 mil).2) Jump scares. The original had none because of the great story/plot
which gave the entire film a terrifying & unnerving feel. This sequel
is so cheesy and pretentious that in order to call itself a horror film
there needs to be long quiet pauses followed by doors slamming or
monsters making loud noises causing the audience jump.3) "3D"... throw in some scenes where swords thrust out toward the
audience even though this kind of gimmicky nonsense breaks any feel of
authenticity the movie might have had, even when watching it without
the 3D glasses.4) Flavor of the week actor(s)... Kit Harrington from the popular HBO
series "Game of Thrones" is supposedly a high school student along with
the main character, but unfortunately he looks (and is) 26 years old...
he just feels out of place throughout the film.I really enjoyed the original (as well as the games) and wanted this
one to be good as well. Unfortunately Silent Hill: Revelation sets out
to do two things: A) Continue the story SOMEWHAT from the first film to
satisfy Silent Hill fans while having characters reveal story lines
piece by piece in "plot dumps" that seem forced and out of place. B)
Try to make as much money as the original, but with a terrible script,
less money, and MUCH less passion.
