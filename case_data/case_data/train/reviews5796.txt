A story you'd expect from Douglas Adams

8.25 of 10. Amusing, alien-based soft-science fiction. Not as intricate
as Douglas Adams' classic Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or its 2005
adaptation, but delivers in almost every other way. It's too bad it
wasn't developed a little more and made into a longer film.Besides Simon Pegg being the ideal pick for the lead character, Robin
Williams doing another post-death cameo as the voice of a dog character
- speaking, thinking animals being another favorite of Adams - adds a
lot of fun and post-film credits enjoyment to a story about humans
getting in the way of our alien overlords.More than just comedy or sci-fi-light, there's some excellent satire,
subtexts, and recursive comprehension built into the film, making it
one of the rare alien, animal-speaking films that are almost
believable.
