Lazy and boring filmmaking

I want to thank Kate B for adding to my knowledge. Really. I had no
idea that Abbottabad was an Arabic-speaking city where most of the
world's camels come to take a nap as the dunes of the desert silhouette
them against the setting sun.After about the fifteenth person yells "Yalla! Aimshee!" you begin to
wonder: couldn't they just have Wikipedia'd this stuff? It's written on
that website that the national language of Pakistan is Urdu, right?
Especially if one is to make a movie about an event a couple of years
after it transpired, surely a little Googling would help? It's an error
so enormous that it made me think, "If they got that wrong, why should
I believe they got anything right?" It's grossly insulting and reminds
me that one should never rely on others to represent oneself."You don't understand Pakistan!" White Chick screams at her supervisor
at one point. And you do? I wanted to ask. You, who just said "shukran"
at a "bar" at the Marriot Hotel after you were served wine in a
margarita glass? Overall disappointed with Kate B's lack of effort in
representing such recent events in a realistic manner. Another edifice
to lazy filmmaking and needless hype.
