Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Movie

One of the first things taught in film school is if you can show the
audience, don't tell them. That is why most voice overs are not
necessary and exposition scenes bring most films to a screeching halt.
47 Meters Down commits the sin of not only showing us things, but
having characters make sure we know what we are seeing by repeating
what is being shown. Case in point: One character is swimming along the
ocean floor and spots a spear gun. It is obviously a spear gun. Only an
idiot would not know this is a spear gun. The character then feels the
need to say, "There is a spear gun." This happens throughout the film.
The air tank reads low, "I am almost out of air." A giant shark swims
by, "Look there is a shark." When this film comes out on video, it
would make a great drinking game. Whenever someone repeats what is
shown on screen, take a shot. No one will be conscious by the end of
the film. Skip this movie. It is awful.
