One of the worst movies I've seen

I've never yelled at a movie more than this. I literally made an
account to tell anyone how bad this film is. No one acts like this if
their kid is taken, she doesn't hit the car, she doesn't hit the people
that took her kid. She had multiple chances to do so. Whoever wrote
this script and directed this movie should never be able to work on a
set ever again.
