Stop comparing this to the original! Great horror flick!

Wow you wannabe critics can't be pleased. If it was or wasn't similar
to the original, you would all still complain. How about trying to rate
a movie on it's own merits?I rather enjoyed this horror flick and one of the better and more
sensible ones I've seen in a while.Great story, directing and acting.I would see this again for sure. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.
