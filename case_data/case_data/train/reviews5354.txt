Not bad for a comedy sequel

I watched both 'Horrible Bosses' films back to back and it's clear that
the first movie is the better of the two. 'Horrible Bosses 2' has its
moments but lacks ideas and the originality of the first film. The guys
are a lot more stupid in the sequel, they reminded me a lot of the
Hangover trio. Whether that was deliberate or not I don't know, but
they weren't that dumb in the first film.By the standards of the average comedy movie, it's not bad. I laughed a
few times, which is more than can be said about a lot of comedy
sequels. Like in the first film, Aniston and Sudeikis are the highlight
for me. Both are brilliant in their roles. 'Horrible Bosses 2' isn't as
bad as some would have you believe, but there's a clear lack of ideas
here.
