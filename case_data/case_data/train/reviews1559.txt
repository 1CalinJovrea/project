Didn't work for me

This film had all the right ingredients to be a good movie but it
lacked solid substance. The cinematography, cast and characterisation
was all excellent but the story wasn't strong enough, it was slow and
didn't give enough information at any one time to be interesting. I
think the idea was to allow the imagery, sound track and mood to carry
the film but for me that just wasn't enough. For me it just became
boring, I lost interest and gave up. It's an Australian movie focusing on a kid who is not popular, he's
pursued and bullied. An old friend of his is in the group who pursue
and bully him and initially he doesn't do anything to help his old
friend. On Halloween night they come together to review memories of the
past.
