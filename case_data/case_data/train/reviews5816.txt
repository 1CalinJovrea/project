l am really disillusioned

I watched it cause of your hyper-critics, and deeply disagree with
them.The acting is stereotypical, insisted, and uninteresting. Characters
are all obvious, and repeat themselves one generation after another.
The camera doesn't dig beyond surface, and photography is shallow and
uninteresting. Dialogues!? A little drama, so far the protagonist is
aphasic. If l were black, l'd consider it a bad racial movie, so far
those (all black) characters are depicted in polarised, mechanical way.
No hope, no change. The shooting is lengthy and misses suspense. A few
lyrical moments, when old time friends meet up again, are reasonably,
yet obviously, good. I wasted time and money, TV has much more on offer
daily
