Google Infomercial.....I would rather watch Vince Offer slap chop....

These guys just keep doing the same characters while changing the
backdrops.This one was terrible....Clich√©s throughout the whole thing.I wonder how much Google paid for this Infomercial.....it appears to
have been a loss and rightly so.Getting so tired of hearing Vince Vaughn babble on like he does in all
these movies.Wedding Crashers, funny. This one awful.Pass on it.One guy said he would have gone jogging instead of finishing the movie,
but he was on a plane! Maybe that is the way they are going to get
people to watch this, show it on planes....captive audiences!
