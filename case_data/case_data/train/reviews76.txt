Gratuitous graphic violence

Kick-Ass was a pleasant surprise; Kick-Ass 2 is a big disappointment.
Definitely not as good as the first movie... this time the jokes are
not as funny, there are zero surprises in the plot. Creativity was left
behind. Apparently the producers thought that the lack of intelligent
jokes could be compensated by adding gross "humour": people throwing up
and shitting all over the place. That's supposed to be funny?? I found
the violence unnecessarily graphic: dismemberments abound, blood is
shed as if it was nothing. And this is supposed to be a teen action
comedy? There is no need to show all that gore... Showing it as
"casual" makes it more consumable and that is actually a very
questionable proposition!
