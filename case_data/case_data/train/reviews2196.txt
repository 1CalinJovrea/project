Worst of the Bourne series

I am a big fan of the Bourne trilogy and was really looking forward to
this one. Disappointment would be an understatement. Bad story and bad
direction along with a really shaky camera to make it worse. Not sure
what Paul Greengrass was thinking when this movie was being made. I
guess this movie was made with just one thing in mind i.e. make as much
money as possible on the back of one of the most successful trilogies
ever made. Matt Damon was no where close to the Bourne we are used to
see. Tommy Lee Jones (one of my favourites by the way) did not really
put in much into his role. Alicia was OK'ish but I felt like she could
have done a lot better and she seemed too young for the role she was
playing. For the lack of a zero, I am giving this a 1 rating.
