Not bad at all

Reading all the bad comments, I was expecting something in style of
Borat or Dumb and dumberer to. Or some sort of embarrassing Ben Stiller
humor. Those are uncomfortable to watch. But not this, not by a long
shot.This was actually pretty okey. It wasn't some crappy humor at all, but
a comedy trying to be realistic, as much as it can be for a satirical
comedy. I've had quiet a few loud laughs. And I was surprised it was
actually very entertaining from the beginning to the end.I'm thinking these bad reviews either come from the North Koreans, the
Chinese or people who were expecting something on a Lord Of The Rings
level masterpiece.Watch and enjoy!
