I Could Be Drunk or Something

Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse lacks any sort of novelty and it
doesn't quite flourish its ultimate conceit. But isn't this the most
enjoyable zombie movie I've seen in a while? There hasn't been much
zombie movie in a while that's as brutal and deliciously violent as
this one. And zombie cats! Why not? Maybe it's just my hangover from
last Halloween. Either way, it's somewhat like a relic from the 80's,
specifically from its tropes to its aesthetics (albeit some lens flares
and digital blood.) It won't change your life or anything, but if you
seek for some dumb adventurous schlock (with some teen comedy
vulgarity,) then this movie knows how to deliver that kind of pleasure.
