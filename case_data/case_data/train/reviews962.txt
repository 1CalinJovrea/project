this movie should never have been made

The first movie (which should have stayed the only movie) is a
masterpiece of sci fi. I was hooked from the start great story and for
the time great FX also cannot beat the soundtrack by Vangelis.Not sure what is going on with Ridley Scott first with is Alien
Convenant he destroyed the series there and now with the new addition
of blade runner.I feel that all the positive reviews for this movie are fake, because
the movie is a sad excuse to make money and makes no sense at all, no
surprised it failed this weekend at the box office.The acting is good so are the special effects, but the story is weak
and none existent, Tyrell corporation is gone and there is a new
company that makes the replicans, and tyrell had found a way for them
to reproduce and have babies.This is where the story gets weird, Deckard is brought back into the
mix because he had a child with Rachel.The movie also lack action and in the end does not explain anything. I
felt like a huge waste of 2h and a half.35y in the making for this wow just wow.
