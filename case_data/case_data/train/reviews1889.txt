Wannabe-teen comedy below threshold

Not even a few funny scenes justify my time spent on watching this.
This movie is insult for the brain. Don't get me wrong, I like my brain
to be insulted, but this movie remains to float in awkward space
between acknowledged trash movie (like "The Room") and
around-the-threshold teen comedy like "American Pie" or similar.It's full of forcing frayed jokes. Combined with unpolished story this
is more similar to a comedy series like "A Bit of Fry & Laurie" except
that later series has high quality jokes, and not something pulled out
from bag-of-teen-movie-jokes. This movies "story" is more like
collection of fragments from several stories glued with a bad jokes.
