Marvellous movie!

Of the various movies you see, there are those very few ones which
linger in your mind for quite sometime & keeps you enthralled. Well,this movie is one of them. A truly sublime thriller in every
sense. The story which is the spine of the movie is very good & the actors
justify the role of characters brilliantly. Never mind the language, as
Spanish is not my mother tongue but this movie really exemplifies that
true cinema is beyond regions & boundaries. The direction is top notch
& the movie grips you from the very beginning itself & won't let you
go. As the story builds up & the viewer tries to decipher the next
sequence,believe me it gives you unexpected twists & turns every time.
I know I sound like I'm extolling the movie but it really deserves it.
Overall,a very intelligent script, excellent direction & a true
masterpiece movie indeed. See it to believe it.
