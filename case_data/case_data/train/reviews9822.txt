A movie that's been done 100 times, but passes the time adequately.

Eighty American workers in Bogota get locked inside their office
building and an announcement over the intercom gives them half an hour
to kill any two of the employees. When they don't comply, the rules are
amped up, and an American Battle Royale (down to the 'collars') ensues. The Belko Experiment managed to accomplish the difficult feat of never
being boring, not even for a minute. It takes almost no time getting
going, and at any given moment it is either action packed, or taking a
break from action and descending into dark humour. Both of these were
well-executed, with one particularly memorable action piece (the end of
round 2, so pretty), and a spattering of interesting side characters, a
lot of them hilarious in either attitude or demeanor. With that, it
managed to entertain throughout, making it worth seeing. However, where it fails is originality. The Battle Royale formula has
been done time and time again, and here we get the straightest form of
it, with zero deviation from the norm and zero unique perspective.
Where a movie like Circle tries to infuse some kind of basic
examinations of social themes, here there is no higher level to the
killings. And for this, the movie never once surprises with a thought
or an event. The characters are just shells of people; the bad guys are
caricatures of evil, the protagonists of good. There is never ambiguity
of character, in a movie where so much moral ambiguity should be
present due to the situation. So from minute one you know exactly who
will be a villain and who will be a hero, and the end game is obvious
from the start. It's a waiting game for the movie to arrive where you
know it is going, which makes it very unsatisfying once the action is
over.
