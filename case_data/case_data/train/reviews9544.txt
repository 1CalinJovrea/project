Complete and utter garbage.  Kubrick would roll over in his grave.

Haven't seen a worse movie in years. A lot of people say that plot
ideas were left out so that the viewer could make their own theories
about it, and I love when a movie does that. This is not one of those
movies, main plot points weren't just left out, there isn't any. An
hour and forty minutes of Scarlett Johanson getting naked, seducing
guys, and killing them in some weird vortex pool inside a house. And...
that's the whole movie, I wish I was joking about that but I'm not.Every time I thought something significant was going to happen to move
the story along, it was just more of the same. Kubrick would roll over
in his grave for this movie being compared to anything he wrote. 2001
was one of the best movies ever, it was abstract, beautiful, and
thought provoking. This movie was none of those things, it was boring
and the same from start to finish.
