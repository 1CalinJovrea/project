Boring at first but Interesting at ending

When I saw the trailer, I was excited but mad that I had to wait a
whole year for us just to rent the movie. I was happy when I rented it,
sat down immediately and watched it. There were some things that I
didn't know would be in the movie but I blindly went in without reading
the book so...yeah. You can tell that there are some people who just
started out acting because it shows. All I'm gonna say is that it is
kind of boring and bland at the beginning but as the movie progresses,
it becomes more interesting and pretty good. The characters do talk low
to the point where you need to turn up the volume a lot in order to
hear but when the intense scenes come in, it explodes in your eardrums
so....just wanted to warn you.I do, however, find it as a good movie. It was kind of worth the year
of waiting. I actually watched it twice and hoped that it would later
be released on DVD so I can watch it whenever I please. It was bland at
first but it gets juicy later on.
