Capolavoro!!!

I still can not describe my state of mind at the end of the film, a
mixture of devastating feelings that left me breathless, a state of
mind that only the greatest movies are able to leave, and this is one
of those movies ! Inside there is so much stuff to talk about that in a
comment like this is highly simplistic! If you love art, psychology,
suspense, love stories, in short, if you love life, this movie will
surprise you. A great cast of characters and works of art (TONS!)
complete the work and make it an unmissable, different from all the
other great movies of Tornatore. Beware then by those who want to
associate this film with a film of Hitchcock because it means dismantle
and destroy the film, this film is much more! Thrilling is only one
small part of a masterpiece of international cinema! Absolutely a must
see!
