An Abomination

It's hard to believe one of the screen's fine talents, William H.Macy,
directed this abomination of a movie. I don't care if it's raunchy and
crude which it certainly is, but it's also horribly unfunny and that's
a deadly combination in my book. To add insult to injury, I found the
film to be terribly demeaning of women.All in all, save yourself the pain and run far far away from this
stinker!
