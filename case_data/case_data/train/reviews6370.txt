Yet another terrible video game movie.

No character development or world building of any kind. No explanation
for why anything is happening, and zero originality. Just terribly
directed CGI battles and laughably generic fantasy tropes with one of
the the most anti-climatic endings I have ever seen. Nothing gets
resolved, and the entire movie is just a pointless waste of time. I
find it both hilarious and sad that so many fanboys and little kids are
rating this awful production so high. If it didn't have the 'Warcraft'
label attached to it, no one would be rating this garbage anything
above 2 stars, let alone even bother seeing it. This movie completely
bombed in the US. Unfortunately, enough fanboys flocked to it's theater
showings in China to warrant a sequel.
