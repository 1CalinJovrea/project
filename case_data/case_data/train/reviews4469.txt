one point is missing in other reviews

The point was - a clear agenda, hard-coded into the movie, and probably
one of the reason why it is so bad. The message was what Muslims, even
evil imams are not so bad because it is all conspiracy of "other bad
guys" .These happen to be a bunch of ugly blonde white people plus some
Chinese, some remote traces of Russians. They are real roots of
terrorism, but not Muslims, these naive boys and wisdom imams, who only
has a noble verses from Koran. They some how slowly became "no-no" to
be a real bad guys in modern cinema. There been a few more movie made
just like this - about bombing in Paris, all done by corrupt police
squad and another one with Harry Potter guy, same idea. I would call
this approach of cinema makers as racial profiling actually.
