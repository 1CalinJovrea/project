Two thumbs down

Yeah Channing Tatum is hot, but the storyline of this movie sucked..
Mike ruined the other guys life by getting him into sleeping around,
hard core drugs, etc and he is oh so thankful in the end to be where he
is? Like no your life went down the drain why are you happy. Is that
what happiness is these days? And I didn't like the girl they used for
Brooke as the main girl. This movie was extremely unsatisfying to me. I
think they just wanted to make a movie about strippers so everyone
would come see it and then realized they had to come up with a plot so
they just tried to throw together 3 separate crappy plots. Overall
unsatisfying.
