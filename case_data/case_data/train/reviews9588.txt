bad acting

I'm love all Madea films But this was entirely bad Tyler Perry makes me
laugh. Just because you are a YouTube Star doesn't make you an
Actress,Liza Koshy thumbs Down I love you but You disappointed me
completely As soon as I learnt you Were gonna be in this film I was so
excited then I Saw the film you character wasn't All convincing but you
know That's just my opinion Other than that it was alright I guess I
kinda liked it Not as much as other madea films
