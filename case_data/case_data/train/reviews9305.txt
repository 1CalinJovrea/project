Full of bull"soul"

First off, this is not a movie for you if you really like the book.
That said, this is also not the movie for you if you like good acting.
I am a major fan of Saoirse Ronan, i think she is wonderful, but I
struggled to watch this, even with her in it. The script was cheesy and
the whole voice in the head thing was portrayed really weird. It felt
to me like she had Dissociative identity disorder and I'm a fan of the
books!! I dunno how else they could have done it, but i just found it a
bit strange.. The whole love story felt really weak to me, maybe, as in the twilight
films, because so much of the novel is inner dialogue, it's hard to
show on film, as so make it really weak to see. I felt nothing for her
liking of either characters. The souls were wrong, I can understand the want for more action, but i
hated it. They are too suspicious of everyone in the film, and there is
a scene at the beginning of the book that was cut out of the film,
where it's sort of explained about how the Souls work as a community,
and it makes sense that Wanda can just walk in and take the groceries. I fell bad for Meyer, the movie versions of all her books have been
butchered. Yeah, i liked the twilight novels, and The host is one of my
favorite novels at the moment, It's so well done!So yeah, I'm not a fan of the film. Huge let down and just boring
really. Sorry if this is a badly done review, i don't write many
