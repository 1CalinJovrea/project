Where did this awesome film come from??

I am so glad I chose to watch this at the cinema...I usually don't go
to cinemas but it was a night out and we chose Chronicle.I was expecting a "Sky High" type of film and thank god it wasn't
(although that film was brilliant too!) - I actually wouldn't recommend
kids watch this.I didn't know it was a "hand-held camera aspect" type of film and that
probably would have put me off but honestly, it really doesn't matter
at all and I thought it helped with building a believable story from
the kids' perspectives.It has the usual groan-inducing moments of explaining why the camera is
constantly on but that's to be expected.Story-wise, I can't really fault it. It's realistic and the effects are
superb; probably some of the best super power sequences I have seen in
a while.Couple of downsides: I would have liked the "abusive father" stuff to
have been less restrained and/or the mother and son scenes to be more
poignant because I personally didn't "quite" believe one of the kids'
motivation for the things he did; it was also weird that the cousin
didn't really spend time with his aunt...I don't want to give too much
away though.I also wasn't happy with the final scene. The ending itself was
absolutely superb - I wasn't expecting it to be as massive as it was
thinking their budget might prevent that but it was amazing. The very
final scene though left me feeling like it wasn't necessary - but it
didn't detract from anything that had gone before, it just meant I
looked at my friend afterwards and said "why?" instead of "wow!".But we were both animatedly talking about how brilliant the film was
for hours after and how glad we were that we watched it.One final thing; something happens in the film that I'm not going to
spoil...but it was totally unnecessary and harsh - you will know when
it happens.Best and most satisfying film I've seen in ages, 10/10
