Weak, incoherent, boring.

I can't believe this movie has an 8.1 IMDb rating at the time of my
review! The characters are weak and the plot is nonexistent. This isn't
a movie - it's a collections of scenes that do not quite mesh together
to make it even remotely interesting. Despite all the action scenes, I
was quickly bored. And it never got better - there was no plot twist,
no interesting character development, nothing! Save your money and go
be bored somewhere else, for free!
