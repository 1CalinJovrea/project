Simply wonderful

An extraordinary cinematic confection and probably Wes Anderson's
greatest film. Ralph Fiennes plays the concierge at the Grand Budapest
Hotel in the 1930s, which exists in a fictional European country in the
Alpine range. He has a habit of keeping some of the old women who stay
at the hotel company. When one (Tilda Swinton) leaves him the valuable
painting Boy with Apple, Swinton's evil son (Adrien Brody) frames
Fiennes for the murder. Fiennes' closest companion, the hotel lobby boy
Zero (Tony Revolori), and his girlfriend (Saorsie Ronan) conspire to
free Fiennes from prison and sell the painting for loads of money,
hopefully enabling them to leave the country, which is being overtaken
by fascists. The story isn't much more than fluff (though there is a
nice tinge of poignancy), but it's enormously amusing fluff. The highly
amusing trailer did give away many of the film's best gags, but this is
a laugh a minute movie. The visuals are absolutely delightful. Sure,
it's all nothing you haven't seen before from Anderson, but I found it
his most perfect accomplishment. The film is loaded with great cameos
and little roles (the woman behind me almost had an orgasm when Bill
Murray appeared), but my favorite was Willem Dafoe as a toothless
heavy.
