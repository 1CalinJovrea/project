Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.

From the director of Casino Royale comes the movie starring Jackie Chan
and Pierce Brosnan The Foreigner! Humble businessman with a buried past
seeks Justice when his daughter is killed in an act of terrorism. His
name is Quan Ngoc Minh (Jackie Chan). He will stop at nothing until
everyone that was responsible is killed or brought down!Jackie Chan real life is now 63 years old and for someone who is 63
years old he is still doing his own stunts and is able to carry the
entire movie without any need of pointless CGI or stunt people. I know
a lot of people will be disappointed due to the fact that the film
relies heavily on it being a thriller and drama rather than an action
film. There are still very many fight scenes in there the Jackie Chan
fans will love but the whole point of the movie was Jackie Chan's loss
of his daughter. Pierce Brosnan also gets a lot of screen time and his
scenes are quite powerful. Not everyone will love it but it definitely
just goes to prove the Jackie Chan still has enough juice left in him
to do his own stunts! 3/5 stars
