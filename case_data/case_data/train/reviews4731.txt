Excellent espionage thriller

I came to this movie cold, just knowing it starred Noomi Rapace who is
always watchable. Playing an interrogator who has stepped away from the
front line following an incident in her pasta, she is drawn back in
when a young courier is seized by the intelligence services. She adopts
a different approach to her colleagues and just when you think you know
how the film will play out, we learn that not all is as it seems and
the film moves up a level.To say more would be to ruin an interesting journey with a stellar cast
on good form including Toni Collette, Michael Douglas & John Malkovich
as well as a supporting turn from a recently underused Orlando Bloom.
Former Bond director Michael Apted does a good job shooting London in a
fresh light.Don't let the negative reviews put you off seeing this film and you
will be in for a twisty-turny treat
