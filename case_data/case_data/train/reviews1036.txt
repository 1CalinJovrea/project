Finally a really good movie for a change. A movie that isn't "figured
out" within the first 15 minutes. It holds the viewers attention for
more than just the actors in it. The storyline is a grab and as the
details roll out, twist after ohmygod twist, it holds you. I had no
idea how this was going to end. Not a big fan of Nicole Kidman but she
was decent in this role. I don't think of her on the caliber as Julia
Roberts or Chiwetel Ejliofor are but she was decent at best. Glad to
hear that Gwen Paltrow didn't get it, she would have ruined the role
completely. I never thought in a million years Julia Roberts could look
bad but she looked terrible in this film, and it was explained why from
several different directions. She was amazing as always. Chiwetel
Ejilofor carried this thriller from start to finish. He was really well
casted and well played. I'll have to call this movie the sleeper of the
year. Never heard a thing about it in the theaters. So much garbage is
being made into movies these days, a shining star like this should have
been talked up. A well known secret full of twists and yes...secrets.
