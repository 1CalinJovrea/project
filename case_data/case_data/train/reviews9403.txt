Utterly forgettable

In 2002 the underwhelming The Sum of All Fears - with Ben Affleck in
the lead role - put the Ryan franchise in the morgue. 12 years on and
the famous CIA analyst is back on the big screen with a brand new story
and a fresh face. Perhaps they should've waited another dozen years, as
this reboot is utterly forgettable and offers nothing in the way of
originality or inventiveness. The action has no pulse, the plot is
straight out of 1980 and there's no thriller element to keep you
guessing as the "Trust No One" tagline on the poster would suggest;
which is all a shock when you consider Kenneth Branagh was at the helm
and his last effort Thor, was such a gleefully entertaining motion
picture. It also doesn't help that the latest incarnation of Jack Ryan,
as portrayed by Chris Pine, has about as much charisma as a tree. Keira
Knightley, Kevin Costner and Branagh are serviceable as love interest,
mentor and villain respectively, however there's little any of them can
do to boost the excitement levels. It's not a bad movie per se, just a
run- of-the-mill affair you'll struggle to remember after the end
credits.
