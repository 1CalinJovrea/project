Forgettable!  I hope I don't accidentally watch it again.

This is one of those moves that seems like it will be good. Because the
cinematography, staging, etc is very good I THOUGHT this movie would
eventually real me in. And because I, in general, have a thing about
seeing a movie or book thru, I stayed with this movie to the end. But
it did neither. The plot was pointless; it was as if the writer(s) had
a basket full of potentially good ideas and just randomly sewed some of
them together for a movie. A good movie just never panned out.In the end, "Boys in the Trees" is very forgettable. So forgettable, in
fact, that I could envision myself forgetting I've already seen it and
watch it again. I need to red flag this one!
