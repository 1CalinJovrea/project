Yawn !!!

How many times can they hash out the same old tripe. I struggle to
class this as a spoiler as...If you have ever seen a film where a
family move into a detached old house with a cobwebbed filled
attic/cellar, where the dog won't come in and the someone first catches
a glimpse in the mirror, the father tries to rationalise when all his
family are screaming monster in the
cupboard/wardrobe/cellar/attic/under the bed...yada yada yada. well
this is yet another one of those films, nothing to see here, move
along. The only credit I can give to this unimaginative template of a
horror film, just change character names and some dialogue..and bingo a
new Hollywood horror film right out of the scripts of the
seventies...anyway the credit, a sterling (if a bit stereotypical of
the girl who sees the monster as her imaginary friend...yes it has that
old chestnut too) performance from Mackenzie Foy, the little girl who
seems to have 20 years acting experience over that of Ron Livingston
who's about as wooden as an oak tree's morning glory.
