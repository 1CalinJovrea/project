Disappointing...

I'll start with the good. Brad Pitt +1 star, zombies +1 star, decent
special effects +1, and a reluctant +1 star for the story.My first big issue with this film is the lack of a War. I mean come on,
World War Z, I expected a war of epic proportion. Instead I got total
zombie domination while "living" people retreated to whatever safety
could be found. The "War" scenes were nothing but regurgitated zombie
attacks while people flee screaming for their lives. The next big issue is the narrow scope of people capable of countering
the threat. We have a UN something something that has the authority to
command helicopters and navy vessels and apparently can convince anyone
in the world that Gerry (Brad Pitt) is a good guy that shouldn't be
delayed in his efforts by simply stating his name into a satellite
phone. This person later lacks the power to keep Gerry's family safe on
the boat, and demonstrates utter humility considering his rank when
offers bed service to Gerry's family.As the story develops the audience becomes aware that Gerry is some
kind of super duper ex military dude that is apparently the best in the
world at all things. We're all hosed if Gerry doesn't deliver. He hooks
up with another Rambo type girl in Israel I think. Point being all
these elite military characters fail miserably at avoiding the one
thing that attracts every zombie withing 100 miles, making NOISE!! They
literally bump, kick, fall, shoot, yell at every opportunity given,
attracting hoards of zombies in the process. I suppose this was
necessary mechanic to zombie conflict, but it certainly didn't
compliment their supposed elite skills.The story is weak, and the solution and family reunion are visible long
before they should be, which only strengthens the disappointment in the
movie. Where's my refund?
