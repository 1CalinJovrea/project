More than a history lesson

You could dismiss this film as a Danish history lesson but it is more
than that. It is a love story with an improbable background in a rather
gloomy setting, the Danish Court of the late 18th century. Mad (or at
least seriously disturbed) King Christian VII (Mikkel Folsgaard -
superbe) marries 16 year old English princess Caroline (Alicia
Vikander) who happens to be George III's sister). He prefers the
company of his dog and mistress to her. It is not surprising that
Caroline falls for Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen) who becomes the
king's personal physician on the strength of his knowledge of
Shakespeare (especially Hamlet). The king is, as they say, easily led,
and for a year or so Sturensee, despite being German, has a fine time
as de facto ruler enacting liberal measures such as the abolition of
serfdom and the repeal of censorship laws, not to mention free smallpox
inoculations. But the forces of reaction led by the king's stepmother
gather. It was surprising to learn that 18th century Denmark was such a
backward society.Mads Mikkelsen gives a nuanced performance Â– 'quiet intensity' in fact,
and Alicia Vikander is equally intense. They are a serious couple
imbued with the ideals of the 18th century Enlightenment but their
passion is physical as well as intellectual. Unfortunately their ideals
are a little advanced for Denmark of the 1770s despite support from
writers such as Voltaire. The local book-burners led by Hoegh-Guldberg
(David Dencik) are not swayed by argument of course.The production is full of atmosphere. The castles are suitably gloomy
and there's plenty of medieval squalor beyond the castle gate. Much of
the action takes place in winter which adds to the chilly atmosphere.
The aristocracy are suitably heartless and the peasants downtrodden.
The king provides some zany (if not quite authentic) moments,
appointing his Great Dane to his council and ordering Struensee to make
Caroline a "fun queen".This is quite a long movie at 140 minutes yet is enthralling from start
to finish. Even though you can guess the ending you are swept along by
the story and the performances. You can see why the audiences at Cannes
loved it.
