Nihilistic Extremism

An allegory of our depressed, mostly materialistic, youth culture and
it's mutation into a self destructive acid wave. This is an underrated film. I'm guessing, mostly because it uses a
contemporary directing/aesthetic approach which can lead to the
misconception that this movie is actually superficially entertaining.Just the right casting, the 4 girls are the consequences of MTV and
celebrity culture gone wrong. I couldn't tell which one of them was
more depressed. I'm guessing Ashley Bensons character who seemed
playing around the idea of death at any given time. Plus, it contains one of the best scenes in years. At the very least,
you will enjoy it.
