It's smart, intense, well acted and superbly done. AMAZING FILM!

I'd have to rate Captain America The Winter Soldier as one of the best
comic book movies ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you
can get. Superman has generally held the title as most fondly
remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy
flaws. Spider- Man has generally held the title as most beloved
superhero film because of the character. Iron Man has generally held
the most grounded and well liked superhero film. The Avengers has
generally held the title as most highly rated and best film the genre
has seen. Well, Captain America TWS can compete with them all in every
category. It is IMO near perfect on every level. It's smart, intense,
well acted, fun and superbly done.The first film delivers a lot of action, a tantalizing and beautiful
love interest, many humorous moments, powerful messages about internal
fortitude and courage, a classic villain, fine acting and many of the
basic essentials of any good action movie. This sequel adds an
intriguing plot and does everything the first film did but does it
BETTER. Including, incredible stunts, unbelievable feats and, not to be
rude, but a climax that plays out like a multiple orgasm. The finish
features one wave after another of edge of your seat moments. As
fantastic of a movie that's ever been made in the genre and I'm not
exaggerating one bit.
