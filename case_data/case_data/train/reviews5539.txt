Syfy wouldn't touch this one...

To make this as short as possible, this movie is not as good as the
first one. Now considering the first one was nothing shy of terrible it
speaks worlds about how much money was wasted on making this movie look
like a low-budget Sci-fi film you'd see late night on Syfy, you know,
the ones with no big names and the graphics are lousy, but they make
you laugh a bit because of it... I certainly hope the books of this
series were not even close to as bad as the portrayal of them in these
films. I understand the Twilight series was mentioned in some viewers
comparisons, but clearly these movies have trouble measuring up to
those atrocities. To get such a great rating I'm seeing on several
sites I was hoping would be for a well put together film...
unfortunately it is quite the opposite. The money loyal fans spent to
ruin their Friday night is why this movie wasn't wisely cast out from
all theaters worldwide. I mean casting an unattractive lead who should
have used her parents money to buy some emotions instead of acting
positions ruined everything about both films. The one spoiler I'll give
is you have to look at her face searching for the right emotion to use
in the closing seconds, ultimately depressing venture. The filmmakers
should be ashamed, I know I am. If you are looking for a good book to
movie setup... Fight Club.
