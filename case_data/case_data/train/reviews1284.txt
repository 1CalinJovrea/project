Hottest sex scenes in a film I've seen

Contains some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed, thanks to the
combination of plausible courtship scenes, character development, and
graphic (at least partially non-simulated) sex. Many of the sex scenes
are beautiful to the point you become aware of the cinematography,
though I did not feel aware of the acting at any point. A lot of the melodrama could have been edited out without impacting the
plot whatsoever, not to mention some parts that are downright abusive
to the viewer with blinding flashing lights, and, I suspect, some cheap
abuse of 3D effects (I saw it in 2D), but then again this movie
probably couldn't exist without giving the director a ton of editorial
freedom. IMHO this is a must-see if you care at all about eroticism in film.
