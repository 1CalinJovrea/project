A WICKED DARK COMEDY (ignore the bad reviews)

***It's too bad that this movie came out in the same year as
"Bridesmaids." That coincidence contributes to shallow thinkers
erroneously setting these two films against each other. Both share a
basic scenario: a bridal party in the days before a wedding. Aside from
that, they are completely different movies. Pick two "Civil War" films. "Gone with the Wind" and "Gettysburg."
There's room in the world for both. "Bridesmaids" was a hilarious film.***So now... THIS movie, called "Bachelorette." This is a dark, edgy, uncomfortable comedy. The characters are
realistically flawed. They do ugly things and treat each other badly.
They also obviously care for each other and make some astute
observations about life. There are too many weirdly, subversively funny
moments to list.If you watch it expecting a light, breezy "chick flick" you will be
disappointed. If you watch it expecting a gritty, grimly hilarious
portrait of three very human women trying to overcome their own flaws
and self-inflicted disasters, you'll have a damn good time.Notes: 1) Kirsten Dunst is awesome playing a tightly-wound, abrasive
control freak. I love the hard edge she has here. And the way her face
betrays the fact she's always on the verge of coming apart at the
seams.2) Lizzy Caplan. FINALLY in a movie and role worthy of her comedic
talents.3) Rebel Wilson. Naturally hilarious. Too bad her role necessitates
under-utilizing her gifts.4) James Marsden. I've only ever seen him in good-guy roles (at which
he is excellent). It's a confirmation of his skill that he's equally
great at playing a sleazeball manipulator.5) June Diane Raphael. The uniquely nutty, endlessly comical Raphael's
cameo in the bathroom with Lizzy Caplan is easily the funniest scene in
the movie.
