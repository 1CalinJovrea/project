The Dangers of Hype

I came into this movie not knowing anything about it, besides the fact
that it was an adaption. I avoided trailers, news, and even the IMDb
page, which is usually my bible and helps me decide on what movies I
see. I was absolutely blow away. The look, the story, the acting, all
spectacular. I enjoyed every second. I felt every emotion. I was amazed
by every visual. I walked out of the cinema in awe. Then, I checked the
IMDb page and was absolutely shocked to see it had a score of 6.9. This
is a excellent example of why hype is a dangerous weapon, especially
against adaptions or remakes. This really opened my eyes towards movie
criticism and reviews. I urge everyone to do as I did more often, not
give movies unrealistic expectations, and rip it to pieces when it
disappoints you. Instead, put your preconceived notions behind you,
appreciate the countless hours of work and incredible effort the
filmmakers put in, and remember why we watch movies: to enjoy.
