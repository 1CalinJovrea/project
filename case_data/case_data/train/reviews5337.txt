Slimy, poorly made movie

This was a horrible movie. i felt dirty and slimy after watching it.
anyone who thinks this movie is well-made is an idiot. many plot-holes,
acting sucks, main character is despicable and you hope he dies at the
end, no redeeming qualities for this character. disgusting sex scenes
between fathers and daughters. it seemed like some goth, sex and
violence-obsessed teenage boy wrote and directed this movie. F! the
only good part was the cute little pet mouse in about 30 seconds of the
movie. at one point, Spike lee has his characters allude to the revenge
of the classic tale Count of Monte Cristo and its protagonist Edmond
Dantes... at that point, i wished I were watching Count of Monte Cristo
instead. If you want a tale of murder, seduction, revenge, battles, and
a mysterious plot, don't watch this movie. watch monte cristo instead.
Oldboy sucked. not a good movie at all.
