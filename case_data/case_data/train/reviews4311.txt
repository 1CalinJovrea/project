When Harry-ish met Sally-ish...

Let me start by saying, the title is misleading.You might think that this is about a married couple (or couples) who
have a "free" relationship and it is allowed to sleep with other
people, have one night stands and so on.Far from it and far from original, this is the story of 2 students (a
"boy" and a "girl") who had a fling back in the days and meet again
after 15 years but they are reluctant to begin a relationship between
them. They try to stay friends and keep their relationship platonic
while they keep denying the physical attraction they have to one
another.So, it is basically a "When Harry met Sally" rip off which tries to
implement a more raw "sexual" and comedic style.Despite the fact that this is rated "R" there is no nudity or vulgarity
which makes it a bad decision to rated like that. If nothing else they
lose tickets without a cause.The 2 leads are somehow likable but I wouldn't say that they have a
strong chemistry together. The rest of the cast is mostly unsympathetic
especially Adam Scott who plays the man-trophy in this.It is not funny per se. Near the end the things might even be
considered dramatic with a scene that seems pointless and out of the
blue, just before the obvious (from the start), forced conclusion.There are some technical problems too. The direction and especially the
editing are amateurish especially at the beginning of the movie.Overall: I understand that there is some hype about this movie and some
people are excited to see it (maybe they misunderstood the premise
too). But this is overall a sub-par movie, trying to wear the shoes of
a rom-com classic.
