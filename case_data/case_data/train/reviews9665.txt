Worst Alien movie and an insult so its fans. -Spoilers-

This movie is not worth the money. Its the worst Alien movie i have
seen and i have seen all Alien (xenomorphs) movies.You don't care about the characters and they are so god damn stupid all
the time! My god its an insult to watch and they flushed all the lore
down the drain. This movie is about droids and not aliens or the engineers. It does not
explain anything at all and it totally kills Prometheus handling.Im happy Sigourney Weaver did not sign up for this crap.
