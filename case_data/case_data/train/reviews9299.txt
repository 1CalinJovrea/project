Moderately Entertaining

This movie left me a little underwhelmed. It was watchable but nothing
exciting or amazing. The second half of the movie seems to drag on for
far too long. Additionally, I thought the characters weren't developed
all that much. Who are these pirates and why do they do what they do?
Money, yeah I get that. But I would have liked to see more development.
Same goes for the Cap's crew. Who are they? Why should we care if they
get captured or killed? The movie doesn't really do a good job of
drawing me into the characters or their backgrounds. It plays more like
a dramatized news story, or a rescue 911 extended episode. Interesting,
but quickly forgettable.I will, however, commend the actors on their fine acting. Especially
the final scene in which Tom Hanks really gives a great performance in
the one moment the movie actually made me care about anything that was
happening on the screen.
