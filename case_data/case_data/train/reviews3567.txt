lost hope after reading reviews, Michael Bay did not let me down

"I am Bumblebee, your oldest friend. Optimus, I would lay down my life
for you"the movie to some might not be perfect, but for those who can relate to
the feeling i felt inside after hearing those words ... man... it might sound a little rusty, and old school but i guess this is what
it feels like to hear a "true" friendTHE MOVIE IS Amazing
