Not Old Boy, but that's OK

Sex. One of the most overused element in cinema and often mis-used and
unnecessary. I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used
sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. This movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual
attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all
other elements that were done well in the movie.Thematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a
western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are
perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple
elegant design.The story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split
into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only
disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as
interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.The music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than
other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a
modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable.
The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes
with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the
period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and
their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add
everything together.It isn't a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved
here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for
myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.
