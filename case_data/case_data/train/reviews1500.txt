They'll All Laugh At... What Exactly?

Take away the telekinetic powers, the hyper-religious mother and a
bucket of pig's blood on the noggin, the original CARRIE, a suspenseful
Stephen King adaptation directed by Brian De Palma, is really about a
high school girl who doesn't fit in. That fact is obvious just by
looking at Sissy Spacek's Carrie White, who seems as though she's never
belonged to any campus clique judging by her distant, dazed expression.While Spacek was a natural beauty in earlier films like BADLANDS and
PRIME CUT, she was turned into a homely outcast But Chloë Grace Moretz
doesn't have any problem whatsoever: Lose the permanent scowl and she's
cuter than most of the girls, even the popular bullies So it doesn't quite work when sympathetic Sue Snell, played by an elfin
Gabriella Wilde, talks boyfriend Tommy Ross into escorting Carrie to
the prom. Sappy scenes bordering on awkward TWILIGHT romance gives the
impression he's one lucky guy with two lovely girlfriends But Carrie
has a load of trouble at home in the form of crazy mom Margaret
White....Without further comparing this to the original, Julianne Moore, filling
the famous Piper Laurie role, tries her over-the-top best with spooky
long hair and an icy disposition, but acts more like a kooky soccer mom
in dire need of xanax than the main ingredient for her daughter's deep
rooted problemsEnter Carrie's freewheeling use of telekinesis Her ability to easily
manipulate elements, like a young Jedi or a Hogwarts pupil, makes you
forget she's a troubled girl who can't control ominous powers. In one
scene, as her schoolbooks float jovially around the bedroom, you'd
think she discovered a quick way of finishing chores or perhaps a
time-filling substitute for not having a Facebook or Twitter account. And then, once we arrive at the inevitable doomsday prom, when Carrie
goes to town with hellishly lethal vengeance, you'll wonder if this
entire remake occurred just to witness a group of young people being
slaughtered care-of computer-generated effects...If that's the case, the maligned 90's sequel THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 covered
this unnecessary ground already.
