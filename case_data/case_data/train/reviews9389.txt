Well Done!! Two thumbs up from this guy!

I loved this movie! I generally love most World War II movies simply
because I enjoy the culture during that time in history. However, this
movie really did take me by surprise. I thought just by viewing the
thumbnail and the quick Bio that it could have potential, so I decided
to watch it. Not only did it meet the potential that I thought it had,
it surpassed it! I don't want to give any spoilers away, but there was something that
happened during the movie that I simply didn't agree with, thus giving
it only 9 out of 10 stars.But I still highly recommend this movie!
