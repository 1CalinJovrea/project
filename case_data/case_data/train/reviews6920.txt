Quit comparing it to other movies...

And just appreciate it for what it was...an underrated comedy. I keep
reading everyone comparing it to "She's All That". While I understand
the comparison, if you want to get technical (and I'm not trying to),
"She's All That" had traces of "Angus" in it. Everyone thinks they're
Gene Siskel and wants to trash a movie, so they can feed their elitist
mentality and convince themselves that they should be a critic for
their neighborhood paper. Truth be told, I'm angry I didn't pay to see
this...it was highly entertaining. My wife asked me to watch it, and I
didn't know what to expect at all...I never even seen a trailer for it.
I thought it would be more of a "girly" movie, but it was a lot funnier
than I expect. If any fellas are on the fence about this movie, I
assure you that you'll enjoy it more than you think.
