Stands on it's Own, but very Raunchy

I'm a HUGE Vacation fan...and went to see this new one fresh except for
the trailers. Let me say this upfront....It's very funny, BUT, it's
also very raunchy. I have a high tolerance for that, and still found
myself cringing a few times. Funny that there was an "older" couple
behind me in the theater, with their teen "kids/grand-kids". They were
laughing HARD the first few minutes, then the lady says "this is too
much" and they almost left...but she said "no, it's funny". They stayed
all the way and we're laughing most of the whole way. BUT it is
uncomfortable at times. Still, it was VERY funny.So, I went home and re-watched the original. It was pretty dark, and
filthy at times too. Just a little more "inside joke" than in your face
like the new one. But anyone that says the original was not cutting
edge...watch it again. Plenty of cursing, animal abuse, sex, and
shenanigans. It actually holds fairly true, given the 30 years. Oh, and
Chevy Rocks in his part. Still great comedic timing.
