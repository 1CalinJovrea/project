Lousy, American propaganda with a smattering of racism

I actually enjoyed the first two Purge films. But this was a really
poor attempt at what could have been an interesting plot.What irritated me most about this film was the casual use of racism to
get a cheap laugh. The cinema was packed and about 70% of the audience
laughed, so apparently using black people as the basis for most of the
jokes in this film should be hilarious. For me, it completely ruined
sections of this film.The lead characters are all generic. None of them you want to succeed.
Even when it comes to the final 10 minutes, I couldn't care less about
the senator or her security guard. I was quite happy when it was all
over.The one liners are absolute comedy. Everything is 'I'm back' or 'we can
do this!'. It's script writing at it's finest.Another thing. Michael Bay is producer. A man who has a reputation for
making big money but ruining franchises. Once this film is over you can
instantly see his influence throughout. He's an awful director and just
as bad as a producer.I wouldn't recommend seeing this film. It's a TV film if that.
