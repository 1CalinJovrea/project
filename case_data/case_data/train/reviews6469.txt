Terrible movie to watch, just a Captain America ripoff.

Warning! Slight spoiler alert if you are going to watch the movie.
Personally, i thought this movie was ridiculous. The entire movie was
only tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for the
three fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to me
just a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, the
shield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she can
just dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from Captain
America. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad they
finally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles.
However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings.
Don't waste your time and money with this movie.
