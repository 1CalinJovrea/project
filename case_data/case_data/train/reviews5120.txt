Shame on Hollywood for endorsing this movie as a 'Great musical"

This film will disappoint you. Here are the reasons why:1. Its apparently supposed to be a movie musical, yet BOTH RYAN GOSLING
AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE SINGERS. I couldn't quite get past
this point. It is astonishing that two below par singers could be
casted in a movie musical? It is a heavy contradiction to the genre of
film it attempts to portray.2. Both RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE DANCERS. Similar
to the singing complaint, i was unable to be captivated and fully
immerse myself in the movie/musical 'magic' because i was too busy
cringing at their dance performance.3. The STORYLINE WAS NOT CAPTIVATING. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy,
because of respective careers they don't end up together? Fin4. THE STORYLINE WENT FLAT IN THE MIDDLE. The middle of the film
dragged, for obvious reasons which is that the story line was to weak
to maintain the intensity.5. RYAN GOSLING'S CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY VERY ANNOYING A jazz fanatic
that forces it down everybody's throat, including the girl he is
dating. He was superior to others because of his love for jazz. He
thrust jazz upon her, and because of that i never really for once
believed in the film that she had organically grown to love jazz as her
love for him also developed. Instead it seemed as if she had to pretend
to like jazz as a pre- condition to their relationship.6. The HYPE AROUND THIS FILM DOES NOT MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FILM The
expectations were simply way to high for this average film. I mean, it
has 8.6 on IMDb for goodness sake!!Although it is subjective, in my opinion, this film comes nowhere close
to a great film or musical. In conclusion, shame on 'Hollywood' and so
many once respected critics endorsing this film as one of, if not the
'greatest musicals' of all time. Furthermore, shame on movie lovers and
society in general not having the balls to suggest the clear truth
which is that this is clearly a very average film at best. Big Shame!
