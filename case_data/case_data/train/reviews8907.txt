Would you make Withnail & i 2?

Like everyone else, I loved the original, who didn't? Maybe my mum.
Which is exactly the idea of rock n roll. It was a cultural master
piece, the music, fashion, the poster. Being a film poster designer at
the time we were all in ore or how ground breaking & cool that poster
was.This is by no means a bad film. I just think it shouldn't have been
made.The constant nostalgia references are tedious. Begbie's character is a
total parody, so much so that I cringed when ever he was on screen. The soundtrack was easily forgettable too. And why oh why did they have
to keep playing remixes of the old tracks? Again, tedious.As for the choose speech, a total cringe festival.They should have made more of the brothel idea.Some films are best left as master pieces. This should have been left
to the one film
