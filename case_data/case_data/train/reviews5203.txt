Crap!

This is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back--don't
do it! McAvoy is a terrific actor; why he wasted his talent on this
piece of shite is beyond me. How anyone can call it comedy is beyond
me. How anyone can call it entertainment is beyond me. Sick, sad, and
pathetic are the descriptors that come to mind. I have a good ear for
languages and accents, and I lived in the U.K. for years, so a Scottish
brogue is not unfamiliar to me. But the spoken words in this movie are
sometimes unintelligible. Not that you miss any great dialogue, mind
you! Based on the cast I decided to slog through it, ever hopeful it
would have some redeeming aspect. Nope. Forget it. You'll be as sorry
as this movie is.
