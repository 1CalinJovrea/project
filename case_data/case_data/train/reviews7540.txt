I loved the first part. It was fun. So, naturally my expectations for
the second movie was high. That, and a metascore of 88 on the first
day, naturally, I expected a masterpiece. But what i saw was just
awful. The first few scenes have no dialogues, it's all sign language, with a
bit of monkey sound here and there(60% of the film, actually). That
puts you to sleep right away. There are no awe inspiring scenes, not
one frame of amazing graphics. The "emotions", well, didn't work for
me.Story? Okay. Humans want to repair a dam nearby so that they can get
electricity, Caesar allows them to work, and asks other monkeys to
help. Meanwhile, mean monkey Koba goes to Human place and sees a bunch
of weapons. So, it comes back, attempts to kill Caesar and then starts
a war with the humans. Climax? Meh.Sincere advice, don't watch this. Franco and the cute little monkey, in
the first part entertained me. This one put me to sleep.
