The whole film takes place in a car, but

don't let that put you off! I had the privilege of seeing this movie at
a festival, along with another British indie (the Apostate - more on
that in another review) and was amazed at how a film that takes place
in a car, while a man speaks on the phone, could keep my interest for
80+ minutes. But it can. And it does. Locke, played brilliantly by Tom
Hardy, is a Welsh man who works as a manager of some sort on a building
site - after work one night, he climbs into his car and drives south,
heading for London. Along the way, he makes and receives a number of
phone-calls that turn his life 'upside-down'. Everything from personal
and relationship issues, to work issues. The action never moves from
the car. In honesty, the issues he deals with are important in HIS
world, but there isn't a shock or a twist ending. They are his issues
and we take a moment in his life and live it through him. Don't look
for your 'three act' structure or your special FX. This is one man, a
car and a phone. And it's great.
