Dragging out unfunny comedy with rude characters

The supporting characters of "Knocked Up" (2007) have matured. Married
couple Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) are turning 40. This
does not mean that writer, director Judd Apatow has matured. It's a bit
more of a dramedy than some of his other comedic adventures but it's
still his typical low-brow humour spread out for over two hours. The
characters are older, more assured in who they are, but their responses
to life are less cultured.Pete eats too many cupcakes, makes poor business decisions and doesn't
tell his wife that they have to sell their house. Debbie obsesses over
younger and hotter bodies, nags her husband about their sex life, and
takes extreme reactions to every little, or big, thing. Debbie is rude,
selfish, inconsiderate, immature and so disconnected from every
reasonable woman that there is no humanly possible way to make her
likable let alone funny. Pete was slightly better; still selfish,
inconsiderate and immature but at least his jokes were just unfunny
rather than rude.The plot, in the loosest sense of that word, has Pete turning 40 and
Debbie is going to throw his birthday party, but Pete is pre-occupied
with his failing business and Debbie is pre-occupied with hating him.
She is also obsessed with getting a tighter body and ogling them on
younger women Â— this involves feeling up her young employee (Megan Fox)
and hiring a fitness trainer. The main cameo of many returning Apatow
players is Jason Segel as the fitness trainer. Why? Because it's
supposed to be funny. Everything in the first two hours or so was done solely for the comedy.
Some of it was funny (Pete is played by Paul Rudd after all and there's
a small role for Melissa McCarthy), but a lot of it was in the trailer,
and most of it was just stupid. It was also at this point, the two-hour
mark, that Debbie declares, "All of a sudden, we're a magnet of
negativity. What did we do?" Maybe she wasn't watching the movie, but
this has been two hours, it's not all of a sudden, and secondly, she is
the source of the negativity. This should be the turning point for the
film but Debbie still hasn't figured out how horrible of a person she
is. That comes later.Very similar to "The Five-Year Engagement" (2012), another romantic
comedy that took way too long to come to its inevitable conclusion,
"This is 40" only gets emotionally resonant when the characters finally
make the change for the better. Too bad that in this case the
characters were too far from redeemable in the first place.
