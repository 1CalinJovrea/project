I enjoyed this movie and I don't play video games

I watched this movie with apprehension because of the bad reviews by
critics. But I did enjoy the movie and I don't even play video games.
And the reasons why I liked this movie is because: 1. Action scenes and
chase scenes are very good and fast paced. 2. Acting by the cast was
superb - Fassbender, Cotillard and co. 3. Visual effects are good.Now, for the critic's beef - 1. The story line was bad? No, it is not.
It is comprehensible and with intelligent ideas and uses characters
from history. 2. It is boring? This coming from people who think
"Manchester by the Sea" is exciting.Assassins Creed is not comparable to and way better than Warcraft. But
it looks like the critics have just lumped all video game adaptations
as bad, perhaps because they don't like this genre.
