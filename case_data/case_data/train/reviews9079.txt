This was better than the 1st film which I saw and enjoyed. This is fast
paced and funny because I laughed throughout. There are loads of
potentially funny situations and they exploited them all instead of the
disappointment of not taking things that little bit further. I'll be
seeing it again and again as there is so much to catch the 2nd and 3rd
time around too. The new characters, bad guy and gal spy, the spicy
Latin flavor all enhance the storyline and enjoyment of the film.
Minions are all throughout the film so if you wanted more you got more.
I saw the 2D version which was brilliant. 3D would be quite a ride with
all the action scenes. Check it out !!!
