a confused romantic comedy

Apart from the eternal clich√© of "love changes everything and family is
sacred", my main problem with this movie is the lead character. She is
unbearable, you do not get why the Doctor loves her, you do not see
anything good beneath the bad surface, she is unlikable. So at the end,
her "transformation" doesn't convince you at all, not that you really
care about it.I am not even sure if the writer wants to talk about how people can be
bad and selfish and mean and that can change with love (ha!) or if she
tries to justify this "ugliness". What begins as an intriguing comedy (the first few minutes anyway) ends
up as something unpleasant. 4 stars for Tilda and Lebron James.
