I found this movie the worst movie ever over half of the movie was not
even true. I have read all the Percy Jackson books and onto hero's of
Olympus.If you enjoyed the book please don't even look at the cover of
the DVD. The trailer fools people into watching it. Watching the movie
was my biggest mistake I have ever made. I could go past a hundred
negatives. Negatives 1. Kronus does not come back 2. Dionysus's does not like his
job. Zeus punished him, making him camp director 3. They don't get
eaten by Charybdis. 4. Dionysus does not cheer he sulks. 5. Kronsus
does not get his Scythe. 6. Kronusus's coffin does not even touch the
golden fleece. 7. Where was the Scylla he was nowhere in sight. 8. What
happened to the start. In the book he starts at a school not the camp
and he meets Tyson there.Positives 1. The information about the CSS Birmingham.
