Terrifyingly funny!

I was fortunate to view this film at an independent theater in Miami
during their horror weekend and this was the best movie over the three
days. Some great surprises and a unique way of telling a terrifying
story. A real joy to watch a smart thriller. The cast was awesome too!
A must watch for thriller - horror fans. And Puddy was in it! Can't go
wrong with that, or can it?
