please no more Alien films from Ridley Scott

a crew responsible for thousands should contain only the smartest
people. here nobody ever heard of quarantine or security protocols. the
plot is boring and predictable (last 10 minutes of the film make you:
"facepalm"). you also have two class quality visuals fx that range from
poor to really good. sry as hard as i think, there is absolutely
nothing good about this film.
