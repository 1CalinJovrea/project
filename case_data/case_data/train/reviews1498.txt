Plenty of great visuals and action but not much story.

This second G.I JOE film doesn't have much in terms of a well thought
out plot but it does have some great visuals and is packed with loads
of well staged action sequences so action movie buffs should have a
blast. For those also seeking more of a character story it's still best
to look somewhere else.The acting is however surprisingly good given the film's plot. Dwayne
Johnson and Channing Tatum both bring a certain likability to their
characters and I enjoyed watching them the most and of course Adrianne
Palicki who was very friendly on the eyes.Overall, The film might not have much of a plot but the great visuals
and the well made action sequences keep it from becoming a total bore.
Those who want more of a character driven plot might not think very
much of it.
