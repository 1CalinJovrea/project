I wanted to like this film.

Warning this review does contain spoilers! I really wanted to like
"Frances Ha": after all it is an independent movie, right? Anymore, I
wonder what kind of weight the term "independent" carries at least in
the realm of movie-dom. This was the second movie that my friend and I
saw that evening so we chose "Frances" because it seemed like lighter
fair from the spy movie we saw earlier. My friend found the film
mediocre at best, my criticism was much more harsh.How about a real story here. Here we have Greta Gerwig in the guise of
Frances who meanders through life having aspirations of being a
professional dancer but doesn't really commit herself fully to making
that happen. She even turns down an office job at her dance company
when she didn't make the cut for the BIG Christmas production. So,
instead of keeping a job at a dance company that at least keeps her
"foot in the door" she goes off on an aimless vacation to France in
order to impress her more prosperous friends. Even Frances'
"conversations" are mindless. She makes outrageous statements to shock
her friends and acquaintances only to retract them seconds later.I could go on but in short this is a vanity movie for neophyte and
wanna-be actors. Replete with show-biz nepotism; Mickey Sumner, Grace
Gummer, and Charlotte D'Amboise are daughters of rock-star "Sting",
Meryl Streep, and ballet super-star Jacques D'Amboise. Not to be
outdone Greta Gerwig's own parents play her parents in the movie! There
is little to recommend in watching this movie. Gerwig does have a
certain ebullient charm and Mickey Sumner shows promise as Frances'
friend. They both no doubt will see future roles. But the fault of this
film rests with the poor directing and especially the bad writing. Like
most Hollywood movies there is no real story here, just a string of
gratuitous scenes by a director who at best has a lackluster track
record.
