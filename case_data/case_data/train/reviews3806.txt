One of the most boring films I've seen in a long time

Just got back from an early screening of the movie. As someone who like
Johnny Depp, I was excited to watch the movie, but nearly ended up
walking out of the screening halfway through the movie. There are
hardly any entertaining moments, an extremely weak plot, and some very
average acting. Sure, Johnny Depp may be a brilliant actor, but there's
only so much an actor can do to salvage an immensely boring film. The
weak development of the love story, limited exploitation of what could
have been some interesting time-travel anachronisms and absurd
additions to the plot (like ghosts and werewolves who remain mute
spectators throughout the movie only to appear at the very end) were
insulting to the intelligent movie-goer..
