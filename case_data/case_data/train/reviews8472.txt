7
Very decent movie

By 7, it really means a 7.5/10. Not sure what's with the negative
reviews, but I enjoyed the movie very much. It's well-executed and the
direction was clear and crisp. There's no distinct feel-good actions
scenes because the pacing is kept constant throughout and I don't see
why there's an issue with the pacing being that way. It's hardly flat,
it's just a very honest, straight- flushed story-telling, and it fits
the themes that are underscored by the movie. Alex Murphy is a
reluctant hero and he's ultimately a father and a husband whose
personal agenda serves as his existential core. I like how these themes
are teased out and zoomed in upon throughout the movie. Also, there are
some absolutely delicious production details and CGIs that are just
absolutely feasts to the eye. Not to mention the superb cast and the
wonderful performances. I think this is a honest and loyal reboot that
will appeal to fans of Robocop who fell in love with the story
precisely for the moralistic themes it explores.
