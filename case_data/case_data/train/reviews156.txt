Classy and Stylish Vampire Movie

In the present days, the lonely sixteen year-old Eleanor "Ella" Webb
(Saoirse Ronan) and his sexy and protective mother Clara (Gemma
Arterton) have been vampires for two hundred years. When a dangerous
stranger hunts Clara down, she kills him, burns her apartment and flees
with Ella to a coastal town. Clara meets the lonely Noel (Daniel Mays)
that is grieving the loss of his mother and is completely broken and he
lodges them in his derelict Byzantium, a former hotel and bed-and-
breakfast that belonged to his mother. Clara sees the chance to make
money with a brothel for Noel and for her. Eleanor befriends the
teenager Frank (Caleb Landry Jones), who has leukemia, and they fall in
love with each other. Meanwhile two strangers are tracking Clara
through the deaths of their victims. Eleanor is tired of living on the
run and decides to tell their secret to Frank, but there are parts in
Clara's past that she does not know. "Byzantium" is a classy and stylish vampire movie directed by Neil
Jordan. The story is disclosed in slow pace and the characters are very
well constructed. The performances are top-notch and Clara has an
amoral behavior while her daughter is the opposite, but there is
explanation along the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available
