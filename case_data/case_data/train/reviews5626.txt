Fast and clever

After putting off watching this film as I usually don't enjoy Tom
Cruise I was pleasantly surprised. The film has a good twisting plot
and Jack Reacher is a mix between James Bond and John McLane from Die
Hard. There are some memorable characters and the film draws you in and
makes you think. The plot is easy to follow but complex enough to keep
you interested without giving you brain ache. In short I liked Jack
Reacher and look forward to more films with Jack. The plot has plenty of fast action scenes which are thankfully not too
over the top and keep the pace of the film going. The ending was also
well thought out despite the slightly cheesy last few lines. But they
do leave the character ready for follow up films.
