Perfectly written and everything goes from there

I remember before 'The Social Network' came out people couldn't imagine
how you could make an interesting screenplay out of the creation of
Facebook. However they had underestimated Aaron Sorkin and soon after
its release realised their mistake. The dialogue he writes and the
pacing of his storytelling is second only to Christopher and Jonathan
Nolan in my opinion. 'Steve Jobs' is another fine example of his
talents. He tells the story in a unique way, dividing the story into
three parts, and it works. Simple as that. Danny Boyle's direction is
also excellent it has to be said but most of that stems from the great
script he had to work with.Michael Fassbender has been nominated for Best Actor in a Lead role at
the Academy awards. He is indeed excellent. His performance is snappy
and on point delivering the wonderfully written dialogue in convincing
fashion. Sadly for him this is DiCaprio's year and no one is taking
that award away from him. Kate WInslet has also been nominated for Best
Supporting Actress. I didn't think she was overly impressive. She did
her thing well enough but I was never blown away and there was no one
scene that made me stand up and take notice. I don't think she's done
enough to knock Alicia Vikander off her perch.The wonderful pacing makes the two hour runtime fly by. Even if you
don't have much of an interest in Steve Jobs and his story (like I
don't overly) you can still enjoy it and get an insight into what the
man was like. People can make up their own opinion on whether he was a
good man or not. No one could deny he had his issues but they also
couldn't deny there was a strong level of genius behind it all. Watch
the film and make up your mind for yourself. You won't regret it.
