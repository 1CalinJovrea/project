Pretty good. Much better than expected.

First of all, there aren't a ton of good Horrors out there that are
truly original. I'm not saying this movie is one of them, but that lack
of originality shouldn't be the reason to give any movie a lower score.
Bringing fresh ideas to the Horror genre is difficult, mostly because
it's difficult to find new ways to scare people. There aren't a ton of
moments that make you jump, but I think the genre isn't really about
making people jump anymore. Audiences have gotten good at predicting
when these moments happen.Where this movie does well, along with the rest of my favorite horror
movies, is atmosphere. For me, having a dark, creepy atmosphere is far
more important to success in this genre than getting people to leap out
of their seats. The shaky-cam, found-footage style isn't that much of
an issue for me either. Actually, I think still does a good job
portraying realism, despite being a bit disorienting and annoying.Story-wise, I'd say it's pretty unique. How many other horrors
involving descent into the earth to find historical relics can you
think of off the top of your head? One, two maybe... How many horrors
can you think of off the top of your head involving a haunted house, a
possessed child or doll, exorcism, a guy with a mask, or a cabin in the
woods? 100? Not to say this is bad, but I'll gladly welcome anything
outside traditional horror settings and scenarios. It does dip into the
realm of ridiculousness as some points, but nothing too over-the-top
and far-fetched for the situation. The acting is good and the
characters are believable for the most part. I would have cleaned up
the final act a little bit more, but it was good enough to keep me
satisfied.Not sure what the critics are bashing it for. If there is anything to
really complain about it's not this movie, but the genre itself. That
being said, lower your expectations and you might like it. I'd give it
a solid 7 out of 10.
