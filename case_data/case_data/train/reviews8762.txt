Great potential, greater disappointment

This movie has excellent cinematography and great camera work and
famous actors. that is it. I wish i could talk to the director and just
figure out what the hell he was thinking. The first story of Ryan
gosling as the bank robber was excellent.(the first 45 minutes) the
second story of Bradley Cooper exposing corruption within his police
department was decent, the idea certainly had potential. And the last
story of their two kids meeting had little potential but still could
have been an alright movie. When all three are combined, it is nothing
but irrelevant wasted potential. Ultimately this movie dies with Lives
and Dies by Ryan Gosling. I walked out of the theater angry that i was
so manipulated by a near perfect movie trailer. The idea of Ryan
Gosling as a bank robber is now wasted and Bradley cooper as a good cop
among bad cops is ruined. And for the record, there is no "Place Beyond
the Pines" it has nothing at all to do with the movie, its just a good
marketing title to manipulate people into wasting their money on this
disappointment of a movie.
