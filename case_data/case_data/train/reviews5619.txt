A crap soulless movie

This movie does not have a soul in the first place. Its a dumb
celluloid piece! There is no sensible story or acting but welded
celluloid pieces about some disoriented people wandering not knowing
who lead their own lives. There are worst scenes such as Elio's
intimate scene with a peach - so disgusting. What does the movie
director expect us to do with that miserable scene?? PC gone mad if you
criticized this cacophony. Total waste of time and money!
