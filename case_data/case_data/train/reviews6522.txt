I loved this movie

What a great movie to see as an escape from the mindless explosions in
so many "Hollywood" movies. The characters were great. It was very
funny! And it was touching. It would probably be in the "chick flick"
category, but that's an unfortunate way to pigeonhole this movie.
Spoiler alert!!! (I just want to be on the safe side.) I would classify
this movie as an updated version of When Harry Met Sally. Daniel
Radcliffe is excellent, as is the rest of the cast. We went to a sneak
preview a few days ago and I was kind of shocked to read that it was
made last year(2013) and "might have a Valentine 2014 release". What
the heck happened? I am glad it has a release date for next
month(8-2014) I am going to spread the word via Facebook and texts.
Great movie.
