Dumbed down thriller ripe for TV

I have to admit that there are two or three good jump sequences but
there was no real payoff in the end. Nickelodeon does Psycho, Sleepaway
Camp and maybe a touch of Kiss the Girls. It was not as bad nor as
comical as The Possession and with that, this one perhaps takes itself
too seriously. If this movie ever had an R rating then I assure you
that all the best bits are on the cutting room floor. The editing is
too quick and visually plays it much too safe. This one is up there
with My Soul To Take in the disappointment factor. Complete cheese on
toast for anyone not in High School. The acting was not terrible but
there was just nothing to act on.
