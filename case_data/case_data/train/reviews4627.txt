Terrible

This movie really is unbelievably terrible. It's basically a bunch of
extreme sport stunt shots glued together with nonsensical storyline,
bad acting and awful script.It's one of those movies that's so bad they can't even keep basic
details straight, such as they drive off a boat at night time for a
swim, but it's clearly daytime once they get underwater.There are some scenes that have literally no bearing on the story at
all...such as the scene at the pier when the FBI UK guy is randomly
pulling a boat out of the water.The time-line of just about every event makes no sense at all.The characters have nothing at all about them; they all seems to merge
into one hipster bearded blob on the screen and the only way i managed
to tell them apart was from their color coded outfits.
