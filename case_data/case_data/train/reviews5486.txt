Western meets Cannibal, a brilliant classic in modern times

In 2015 where we are used to seeing none stop CGI, thin plot, endless
action trash...here we have the opposite, a real movie gem. It's a
classically crafted western that ended up as a brutal cannibal
masterpiece.At first it does make the audience feel that theirs not much happening
compared to general modern cinema but what we do have is quality
acting, cinematography and script building up to the shocking and
unpredictable end I can't recommend this enough, unlike most films of today it's not made
for profit it's made for quality film making, something which I fear
today is few and far betweenGo watch it
