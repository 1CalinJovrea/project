One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen

There are few movies I walked out of the theater and wanted to go back
in. John Carter was definitely one of those movies. It was an easy
movie to quickly get in to. The characters felt real, John Carter was a
great protagonist with an incredibly sad back-story, and the dog was
surprisingly adorable. Also, I never thought I would feel human
emotions for big green aliens. Everything; action, special effects,
acting, writing, story, music; was seamed together seamlessly. I went
in expecting a good movie and received a masterpiece. Definitely made
it into my top ten movies of all time. Everyone should see this movie.
This is not a film to pass up.
