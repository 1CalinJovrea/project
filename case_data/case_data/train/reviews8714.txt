Set in a dystopian future, Max De Costa fights to survive and get to Elysium.

'Elysium' starring Matt Damon is the perfect summer popcorn movie. It
has everything you would want in a movie; a great cast that serves
their purpose and visceral special effects that might even land the
team an Oscar. Everything including all the fight scenes were executed
flawlessly. Coming out of this movie I had close to no complaints. The
writing was a bit dodgy in some areas, but the great acting and effects
quickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp, who dazzled
audiences with district nine 4 years prior, does a fantastic job once
again with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie
goers everywhere. Overall 'Elysium' is worth every penny to watch in
theater.
