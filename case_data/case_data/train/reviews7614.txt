Wouldn't Expect It To Be So Awesome!

Well when I saw the trailer for the NFS movie, I thought "No just no,
it's going to be terrible" - Then I saw the cast of Aaron Paul
(Breaking bad) and Dominic Cooper (The History Boys). I loved Dominic
in The History Boys and like most people enjoyed Breaking Bad.But alas, having some aspiring actors isn't going to make a movie. Then
I came here and found at the time a rating of 8.4 from people who had
viewed the NFS pre-release. So at that point I thought, OK I'll give it
a shot, worse case scenario it ends up being like a bad Fast and
Furious rip off.NOPE! Was amazing, never a dull moment, didn't have any scene that was
just utterly pointless (which almost every movie does), the acting was
fantastic, the action was intense, and the soundtrack and effects were
spot on! As a movie it is great, but for someone like myself who grew
up on NFS and loves car's it is EPIC. There's a great scene in the end,
that anyone who has played the NFS: Hot Pursuit series will instantly
go "Yep, this is really NFS!"The only reason I wont give it a 10/10 is because of some minor plot
holes - But nothing to bad, and most people wouldn't even notice.
Otherwise brilliant, wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the next F&F
Franchise.
