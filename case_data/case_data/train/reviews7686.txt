What a bloody joke!!

when I heard Bryan Singer was going to direct this movie I was hoping
an praying he was gonna do good job, after making a pigs ear of the
first two x-men movies. Clearly he still hasn't learnt his lesson, This
movie was crap, I JUST SPENT Â£25 at the cinema and it was a waste man!!
We have now had six x-men movies out and still no bloody good story
line, still no full x-men team, (which should be, Professor x, Cyclops,
Storm, Wolverine, Rouge, Gambit, Beast, and sweet little Jubilee)
there's not enough action through out the movie, and this one really
gets on my tits, NO DAM COSTUMES! I don't get it, all the other
characters in the marvel movies has there original costumes! but in
x-men there are dressed in black and look like bikers.If someone is going to make a good x-men movie they should start by
watching the 1990s x-men cartoons and use that as a base to build on.
I'm sorry to say but I will NOT going back to the cinema to watch
another x-men movie again an till someone can prove to me they know
what they are doing because at the moment this is a disgrace.
