deserves a higher rating in my opinion

Honestly, the reason for seeing this movie was nothing more and nothing
less than the desire to go to the cinema with a friend. With some other
movies not interesting her, it was between The Lucky Ones and this one,
both movies that have a low score on IMDb. I was pleasantly surprised,
however, with not just the actors in the movie but also with the
dialogue and chemistry on screen, which seemed very natural. I
definitely enjoyed watching it and will most likely end up buying it on
DVD; not even the fact that Chris Rock was in it bothered me, whereas I
usually can't stand him. I have to applaud Jennifer Lopez too, I never
thought much of her as an actress, but I found myself sympathizing with
her and liking her portrayal of the character. Over all, I find that
this movie deserves a higher score than it's currently got on IMDb.
