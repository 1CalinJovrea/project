Boy, this is Bad

It should be a telling indicator when a movie studio releases a movie
online the same time they release it in the theaters. It means the
studio knows it's a bomb, and is going to try and get the most money
they can out of it, through all mediums, before the negative reviews
take hold. Well, it worked, and they got my $5.99. Ugh.Movie has the potential to be something gripping, but instead it just
slugs along. In other films, showing scenes out of sequence is done for
specific impact or effect. Here it's done as a gimmick - "Hey, how
about we show this part here, and then just for the hell of it, show an
earlier part next, and then something from the middle after that..."
Give me a break. It serves absolutely no purpose, and only further
confuses, frustrates, and angers the audience.Some of the acting is well done, but it's not enough. The creepy child
abductor character is practically wearing a "creepy child abductor"
Halloween mask, and yet he shuffles through this entire movie with
nobody suspecting a thing. The relationship between the male/female
detective leads is awkward, and never fully explained. The secondary
members of the detective team are introduced with specific "gifts",
only to be essentially never seen again (never mind showing how their
"gifts" are relevant to the story).I've never written a review here before, but this is such a clunker, I
just couldn't help myself. I cringe as some others are comparing this
to Hitchcock. Lord, have ya seen Hitchcock? Cause this crap ain't even
close.
