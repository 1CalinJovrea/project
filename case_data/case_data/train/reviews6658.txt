Keeps getting better!

Obviously, the original can never be touched. That being said, people
tend to think that the sequels get worse. Nowadays, they aren't
stopping at three and Ice Age is no exception. Granted, the released
sequels aren't necessarily better, but they aren't bad! As long as you
don't take them too seriously, like most people on here do, you can
have fun with it and just enjoy the ride. Of the sequels, I enjoyed
this one the most. I thought the plot was reasonably realistic and I
enjoyed the characters, new and old. The thing that made me giddy with
excitement was realizing the captain was played by Peter Dinklage! I am
a huge fan of him, being a fan of Game of Thrones, and he played a
fantastic villain. In contrast, I am not a fan of Jennifer Lopez by any
means and I liked her character as well...that may or may not have
anything to do with the fact that I really like white tigers. It's got laughs, great characters, warm moments, life lessons, and even
some mythical creatures! And we get to see a bit more of Scrat...and
who doesn't love that silly little squirrel thing? I think this sequel
has topped 2 & 3 and is definitely worth watching!
