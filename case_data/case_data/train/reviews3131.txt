Waste of time - awful.

I quite recently discovered the underworld franchise. Generally not
that fond of the fantasy genre, I liked the first 3 movies because they
had something fantasy movies often lack; a good story.Watching this fourth episode I was very disappointed. No story, no
twists and turns, just fighting without purpose. The characters are not
developed and you feel totally emotionally disconnected to whats going
on. There's not even a connection to the previous episodes.My advice is: stay away from this movie. Watch the previous ones one
more time or do something else.This is completely waste of your time.
