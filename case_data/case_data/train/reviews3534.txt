A delight

The little yellow fellows who assist Despicable Me's Gru have, over the
centuries, always sought to help the biggest, baddest Boss around. And
so, in the 1960s, Stuart, Kevin and Bob, seeking out a new Boss, end up
working for villaness Scarlet Overkill as she seeks to usurp the
British throne for herself.The Minions find themselves in their own well-deserved feature, and
it's a hoot. The story concentrates on just 3 of the Minions  a smart
move, since we get to know them personally  although the full crew do
turn up when necessary. Scarlet Overkill is a very good baddie, and the
various scenarios are all colourfully realised (London is great, if
geographically inaccurate). It is daft, and great fun.For Beatles fans it is worth mentioning that there is a lovely
Beatles-related gag in it. And, while the voice talent is all
excellent, it is worth singling out Pierre Coffin, whose voice
characterisations in the Minions' almost-language is a huge part of
their charm.The 3D is good in places, but mostly forgettable.
