I loved it but then that happened.

Yes, I am a boy. And gosh, I loved this movie so much. The romance were
beautiful and oh-my so touching. But then, the directors had to screw
it all up. Why not go for a happy ending? Why did he have to get shot?
Why couldn't it just end with him beating up those two fellas and then
take them to jail, and then get the love of his life? Why would you
guys ruin such a nice movie with that ending? Well well. What can I
say. I would have given this a 10/10 if it had a happy ending, but OH man.
He died, she ended up alone and her son got his heart? What in the
world. They belonged together, she gave up an 18 year old marriage for
him, and then you took him away from her. Shame on you, shame on you..
Worst romance movie I've ever seen. Never do this again, thanks.
