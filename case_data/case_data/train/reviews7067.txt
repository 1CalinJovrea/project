This blew my mind

This movie blew my mind. It was way better than I expected. After
seeing Arnold in The last stand where he played a more mellow character
this was his bad ass role. This movie even begins with an adrenaline
rush of intense DEA raid scenes and quickly shows you this team's
character as they are not the most honest DEA agents. You quickly fall
into the team's world which is more party oriented and drug driven than
you'd expect for cops. After a heist from the cartel fails the team is
under suspicion and left wondering where the money went. Meanwhile
Arnold's character deals with the loss of his wife and son.As the movie progresses members of the team are being executed in
sometimes horrible and gory ways. The team begins to think the cartel
is killing them off but as Arnold's character befriends a female
detective and the two investigate deeper they both come to realize it's
much worse. I love the twists and the intensity of this movie was at
times unpredictable. I will say I'm a bit confused on a couple of parts
but this movie is definitely worth a sit down. Good cast, interesting
story, great action. See Sabotage.
