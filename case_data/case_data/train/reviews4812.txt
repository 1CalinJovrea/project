Parker delivers action-entertainment-fun

If you enjoy action movies, tough guys, an engaging plot, and decent
acting, this one more than fills the bill. Going into this one I was
somewhat apprehensive as Jason Statham movies miss more than they hit,
and when you throw Jennifer Lopez in, I was really quite leery and
afraid this one was going to be stupid and a typical Statham
slam-fest....WRONG!! I've got to give it to both Lopez and Statham for
pulling off not only a entertaining movie, but for also doing really
quit a good job of selling their respective roles. The storyline has
been done before, but there are enough twists and turns in this movie
to keep it fresh and not totally predictable. My suggestion for you is
if this type of movie is your thing, then don't miss this one.
