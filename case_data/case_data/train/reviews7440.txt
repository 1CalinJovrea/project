surprisingly funny

I came into this movie expecting not-too-good things about it, and
might I say I was surprised. It involves a drug smuggler who has to run
a job across the Mexican border for a dealer. Knowing he'd look
suspicious by himself, he puts together a makeshift "family" with three
people he's familiar with:his stripper neighbor, a teenage girl
runaway, and a horny teenage boy. They fly to Arizona and rent an RV.
Hilarious complications ensue. Despite their characters and
predicaments, they are shown to think fast on their feet with the bad
guys sometimes, and the bad guys manage to track them down after they
get the drugs, and some DEA agents find them and wind up accompanying
them on their trip.90s songs and allusions pop up during this movie. It was fairly funny
from start to finish, and the main cast works well together. I think
this was a great idea for a movie! *** out of ****
