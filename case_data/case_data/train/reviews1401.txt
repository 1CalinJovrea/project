This is just an awful film with just horrible writing (spoilers)

I saw this because I like Halley Berry movies and figured that this
would be another good movie. I was horribly wrong.The plot has too many holes and makes no sense whatsoever.After many miles of "chasing" the kidnappers she finally thinks to ram
into them once her van is almost out of gas? Did she think to do this
when they were stuck in traffic or while surrounded by cars on the
highway? Or maybe when there was a cop following her?Nope, she waits until they are on a deserted road.When the kidnapper comes after her with a shotgun, where does the
genius hide? In her mini van with wrap around windows. Good thing the
bad guy decides not to shoot out the glass and shoot her.Finally we get near the end of this horrible movie and the woman
kidnapper sicks a dog on the Halley Berry and her kid. Somehow after
killing the kidnapper the dog mysteriously disappears and never shows
up again.Possibly the dog was as board with this movie as the audience and
simply gave up to do something better.These are not the only horrible parts of the movie, but the most
glaring.It's an hour and half of my life that I wish that I could get back. Do
not be fooled by the positive reviews, this is a horrible movie and
should be skipped.
