one boring movie

I have to admit in watched this movie because Sophie Cookson was in it,
she is the super hot girl next door look and i loved her in kings men.This movie as nothing to offer, and we all seen it before, the not so
scary jumps, dead flies in the win, the rain, the dog that comes up to
the window will she is parked. Really deceived by this one.To say that i watched Annabel Creation before this one so i guess it
got over shadowed.Just another addition to the possession movies like another boring
zombie movie......
