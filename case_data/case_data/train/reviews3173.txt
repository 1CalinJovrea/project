A good take and historical informative film on how the woman with the golden lasso and bracelets became about thru trial and error.

Most who follow entertainment and history knew that psych professor
William Moulton Marston was the one who invented the lie detector test
and created the Wonder Women character. This film sheds light on the
history and the behind the scenes journey and struggles of how that
came about. William a professor began working and doing research on how
emotions can effect truth, health, and feeling and for many of these
test his duo to work with were his wife Elizabeth and mistress and
young student Olive. And along the way the work gave insight to women
and the gender roles and reactions of mixed pain, pleasure, and truth
seeking would make them out to be special. All of it would be tied to
dominance, compliance, and feel good free will and at the time most of
this shocked most of the culture. Yet still this would spark personal
freedom for not just women but all in the form of sexual freedom, and
outspoken rights as it was nice to see how these touch and go topics
became the background and under work that helped create a national
treasure and icon like "Wonder Woman". Really this is a great
informative historical film to see worth your time to explore topics
like sexual freedom, outspoken women's rights and hope and freedom for
all to open up to all generations.
