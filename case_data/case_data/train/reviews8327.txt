Didn't engage me.

12 Years A Slave is nominated for all the awards and talked about with
huge praise. Well sorry, but having just seen it, I have to disagree.
It's 2hrs 13mins of hardship.We have seen powerful films in the past that have dealt with injustice
and suffering, films like Schindler's List, The Color Purple, The
Killing Fields etc., but all these have managed to get across the
horror and suffering whilst keeping me engaged. Unfortunately, 12 Years
was just suffering.I felt the film really dragged. Much has been written about how Steve
McQueen is very brave to hold shots for a long time. The film is
littered with shots that linger for an age while little or nothing
happens and I say that if you notice that a shot is long then it's too
long and doesn't work. Surely if this was a good thing you wouldn't
notice it. I noticed it, and noticed it and noticed it.I was so pleased when Brad Pitt showed up, not just because he is
always good to watch but his role is that of a saviour and believe me,
at that point the film needed a saviour. He has a line that sums up the
film "Yours is an amazing story but not one point of it is good".The final scene really killed it for me. This man has been away 12
years and when he meets his family does he run crying into their arms?
No. Does he whoop, laugh and shout with joy? No. He sadly stands and
meekly asks their forgiveness for his shabby appearance. Arghhhhh! I cry at movies. I am an embarrassment as I cry that easily. Guess
what? Not a tear. For a movie that deals with the horror of slavery
that's a terrible thing.
