Annoyingly Confusing

This film was like walking down the street and someone walks up to you
and starts having a conversation but, they start the conversation in
the middle and you don't know what the hell they are talking about
because they never stop to explain what they are saying.This movie has no character or story development. Newcomers to the
story are left confused because the movie relies too much on assuming
the audience knows the video game lore that they take no time to
explain any of the concepts like the machine, Why going back in time
and killing people for an apple will stop violence?, or why did the
three team up at the end despite knowing nothing about each other?
There was no development between these characters and all of the sudden
they are a team now? The creed is barely explained as well.The action scenes are terrible. Due to the shaky cam, its hard to tell
what the hell is going on.
