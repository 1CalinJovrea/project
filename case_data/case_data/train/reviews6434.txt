I liked it.  Not like the original, but that's why I liked it.

Too many reviews comparing it to the 1990 film with Arnie. If the Arnie
version was never put out, then everyone would be saying how great this
adaptation really is in it's own merit. (And seriously can you really
say that you would have given the Arnie version a 10 if you saw it
today, come on now).The action sequences were great. The fighting choreography was good. In
all honesty I think Kate Beckinsale is one of the better female action
stars out there, I mean she can really kick ass. Well the CG was
awesome. The interpretation of the future was well though out. I
especially liked that there were cars hovering and not "flying" using a
magnetic levitation system (very realistic look into the future of
transportation). The plot was decent, and this is where it loses 1 star. I thought it
did a great job adapting Philip K. Dick's science fiction story into
it's own. However, I thought that it followed too similar in plot
sequence of the 1990 film. It would have been a 10 for me otherwise. I wished that they could have really gone another way making it a
complete mind f*** that would just blow our minds away. They could
really had more fun with the memory thing. Overall, great action film and worth seeing. Just don't compare it to
the 1990 film.
