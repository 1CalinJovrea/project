Beautiful, thoughtful, quiet, poignant, and true.

This film is excellent. Top-notch writing, entirely driven by strong
characterization without contrivances. The acting is excellent, and the
dialogue is believable, natural, and honest. This is not your average
romcom, and it might not even qualify as a romcom at all, because
although it asks many of the kinds of questions that romcoms try to
ask, it answers them with far more maturity than most do. This story
has themes that resonate and an ending that delivers. There are moments
of the transcendent alongside moments of the awkward, and that gives
the experience a ring of realism. The personal mysteries are revealed
at a good pace, and the story never becomes saccharine, boring, or
entirely predictable. I appreciated the good use of silence. I was
occasionally annoyed by the unnecessary shakiness of the hand-held
camera or the blurry focus of foreground objects, but that only
happened a couple of times. This is otherwise a beautiful, thoughtful,
quiet, poignant, and true character piece, and it's well worth the
watching.
