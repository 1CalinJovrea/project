Terrible Schlock

I went into this film with an open mind. I have enjoyed Ridley Scott
movies in the past, particularly Gladiator which is the same genre of
film as this. Unfortunately, I was left feeling extremely disappointed.
Although this is a classic, biblical story that most movie-goers are
likely already familiar with, the film-makers have decided to pad this
ancient tale with over-the-top action scenes, as well as one-note
characters that feel more like cardboard cut-outs as opposed to actual
human beings. The most shameful aspect of the film is the part that I
was most looking forward to : The Actual Plague. While I was hoping to
see harrowing images of Egypt being decimated in a genuinely
frightening tale, we are instead bombarded with fake looking CGI that
simply left me dry. The plague feels more like a computer montage than
an actual scary event.Terrible script. Weak performances. An
over-reliance on CGI instead of CHARACTERS and STORY! Overall, just a
bad film. Didn't help that they chose big named actors instead of
people that looked more like Ancient Egyptians. Pass.
