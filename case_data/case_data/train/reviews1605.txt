Emotional, Entertaining but not enough

Sorry for my bad English...I was the huge fans of Pirates Of The Caribbean Movies. And I'm going
to the cinema last night with the bad expectation because of the new
Director, Hans Zimmer leave the project & bunch of new character. But i
also excited of Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar are in the movie. and
in for the record it was fun. the Ending was Emotional & Scenes was
Entertaining. But it's not enough!This movie had a bad dialogue. And the jokes are seemed forced. The
fight scene need improvement which Gore Verbinski did better. And the
music aren't better then the previous installments. Therefore Visual
effect are great.Spoiler: What makes this movie good they went back to the character and
their legacies making a fresh start at the movie. The characters are
unique and vary. This movie also deserve better villain in story
perspective. What makes a villain fit in of our heroes...? it was like
Batman and Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Dead Men Tell
No Tales as lack of that aspect. but Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar
was stunning. This movie was not the best but better than the previous
installment. i think its the second best Pirates of The Caribbean
movies. It's not bad but not so great. Besides,it was satisfying
refreshing and still worth it
