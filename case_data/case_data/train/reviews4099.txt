Horrible

Left the theater I just could not take the pain. Many others left as
well Reading the reviews I am stunned at the number of positive
reviews. Perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen I want those
two hours of my life back. What am I missing, wonderful cast but the
movie just dragged on and on with most songs boring at best. I did
enjoy two princes singing - that was funny, but otherwise terrible
movie. Save your money!! Cast was great but unused talent. What were
folks thinking. Tried to nap during the movie but woken up by the the
notes off key. Movie was confusing and just wandered from song to song
without an much of a connection to a story. Again, I cannot get over
how many positive reviews are out there as so many left the theaters as
did I after about two-thirds of the movie and with no end in sight.
