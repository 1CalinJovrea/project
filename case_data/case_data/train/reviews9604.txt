Final Destination Mixed With The Monkey's Paw!!!

So far, this has been the best horror movie of 2017. I was intrigued by
the story, the characters are mostly likable and it was interesting to
see what Clare would wish for next and who would pay the price for it.
Joey King was great and adorable as Clare. I felt so sorry for her. She
was going through Hell and you can feel it. A lot of other main stars
in horror movies are so generic, that you don't care whether they live
or die or not. As a child, Clare Shannon witnessed her mother's suicide. Since then,
she's been haunted by the memory. Her dad is eccentric and goes
dumpster diving as a hobby. One day, he finds a mysterious Chinese
music box as a gift. It says that it grants seven wishes, so she wishes
her school bully would rot away. Sure enough, the bully's skin begins
to decompose. She wishes her crush will fall madly in love with her.
She wishes to be the most popular girl in school. All this begins to
come true, but at a terrible price; someone that Clare loves dies
whenever a wish is made. Will she be able to stop the madness? I highly
recommend WISH UPON!!!
