A great twist on a classic story...and the rock!

"Hercules" starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson absolutely delivers on
its promise to be entertaining. I went into this film with half-hearted
expectations, thinking that Dwayne Johnson wouldn't fit the part well,
I fully expected this to be an entire film of blood and fighting. This
is far from correct. The writers of this film are fantastic going for
almost "A knight's tale" vibe to it with a ton of comedy. I honestly
found myself laughing out loud much more than I found myself getting
drilled with constant WWE style fighting like there was in "The legend
of hercules", mind you this is a very good thing. The laid back style
of this film is what makes it so great, sadly this film failed in the
box office, hopefully folks can see the potential and eat it up on
bluray/DVD.
