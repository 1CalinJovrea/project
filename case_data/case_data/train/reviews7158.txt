Sad for it being just average

After watching I do believe that "The Belko Experiment" would've been a
much better film overall under the direction of James Gunn. I don't
think Greg McLean does full justice to Gunn's script and the
"Experiment" fell a bit short, at least for me. Its not a bad movie in
any aspect but for me it lacked the extra detail and effort to make it
something above average. The acting is just fine. Aside from the main
character Mike - played by John Gallagher, Jr - who I found a bit
cringy and sufferable to watch from time to time - everyone seems to
know what they're doing - shoutout to Tony Goldwyn, Adria Ajorna and
John C. McGinley who for me, where the best of the bunch. Another big
positive for me was the soundtrack. I've grown quite fond of Tyler
Bates since watching John Wick 2 and he excels once more at creating
tension and urgency. With all of that said, "The Belko Experiment" was
a bit of a let down - the major plot point was left incompletely
unexplained and the sequel? teaser at the end didn't make it for me.
They should've been more smart and inventive, otherwise we are only
left with an hour and an half of gore just for gore's sake.
