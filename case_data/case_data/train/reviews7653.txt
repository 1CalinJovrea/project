Not Oscar worthy but I thought it was very entertaining and much better then I expected it to be. I liked it. I say B

"We had decided to leave this place, but it turns out that the universe
had other plans." When a legend of a golden treasure is heard of a
group of various warriors come to a village. When an evil faction looks
to take control it is up to the local blacksmith (RZA) and a rogue
British soldier (Crowe) to stop them and protect the village. I have to
admit that I am not a huge fan of movies like this. I have never really
been into martial arts type movies although I have seen some really
good ones. That said, while not being all that amazing of a movie
itself this one was super entertaining and had some interesting fight
sequences that I really enjoyed. The movie is way over the top and
unbelievable, but it fit in this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar
worthy type martial arts movie then I recommend 13 Assassins or War Of
Arrows. This movie is really just visually fun and the fighting is
entertaining, which is good sometimes. I liked it more then I expected.
Overall, better then anticipated, martial arts fans may really like
this. I say B.
