Kick-Ass!

Adapted from Flashfire, the 19th Parker novel, written by Donald
Westlake under the name Richard Stark, 'Parker' succeeds by arresting
it viewer effectively. A Kick-Ass Action Crime-Thriller, that doesn't
lack the bite!'Parker' Synopsis: A thief with a unique code of professional ethics is
double-crossed by his crew and left for dead. Assuming a new disguise
and forming an unlikely alliance with a woman on the inside, he looks
to hijack the score of the crew's latest heist.'Parker' is good enough entertainment. Its got the pace & the zing one
expects from an action crime-thriller nowadays. John J. McLaughlin's
Adapted Screenplay moves on a fast-pace & offers some terrific
sequences, particularly in the second-hour. Taylor Hackford's Direction
is perfect. Cinematography & Editing are decent. Action-Sequences are
well-executed.Performance-Wise: Jason Statham as Parker, is game, as always. Jennifer
Lopez does well, although she's awkward initially. Michael Chiklis
makes for a worthy nemesis. He's first-rate. Nick Nolte adds tremendous
weight to his part. On the whole, 'Parker' is worth watching.
