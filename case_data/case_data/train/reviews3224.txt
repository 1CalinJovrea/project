Beware...This is not a horror movie!!

This is not a horror movie. It is a psychological drama of a family
slowly questioning their belief in God and descending into madness. The
'witch' is a minor, minor backstory that increases the descent. There
are only three scenes total that has a 'witch' in it.Acting is up to par, but you spend the movie waiting for the 'witch'
thing to happen, thinking there will be a big finale. It does not
happen. Had this movie advertised itself as a drama of a family trying
to make it alone in the wilderness....I probably would have given it a
higher rating(not much, but higher). Instead it is pointless dialogue
and the reciting of scriptures and prayers(not exaggerating, that is
almost 40% of the movie, with another 30% silently looking into or away
from camera).The people who are giving this movie high ratings are the same ones
that said Terence Malick's Tree of Life is a masterpiece. People who
are concerned with plot, middle story, finale or explanation of what is
going on will want to to get back two hours of their life.
