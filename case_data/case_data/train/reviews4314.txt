Great idea poorly executed

Alien-esk, but that is not what pisses me off. Great cinematography. Wonderful concept. Believable sets. Good actors.
Horrible execution and completely contrived plot line and plot drivers.
I will get to the point..... The creature escapes the lab by escaping
into a fire suppression vent!! Assuming it could fit into the 1/2-1/4
inch steel tubing (capable of containing several thousand psi) it would
have dead-ended into a steel or carbon fiber cylinder (again capable of
containing several thousand psi). The alien would have effectively
trapped itself inside a completely sealed system and unable to escape.
Movie over, destroy life form at earliest convenient opportunity. It would have been much more believable and sustained the plot line if
the alien could have just escaped out the door when Rory went in to
rescue Huge (who causes ALL the problems with his maternal instinct -
he calls it "my child" wha WHAT?! - and love for the creature
completely at the expense of the lives of his crew mates). Don't even
start me on when he hides in his pants - not a party in there either. I'm done.... there are just too many holes in the construction of the
plot for me to even believe that such a creature could exist or enjoy
the sinister nature of the creature. Any critic who likes this must
have no basic eye for detail such as the solid state of matter and how
complex machines such as space craft would be constructed to keep the
vacuum of space out side the craft. This space ship is obviously a
sieve. this terrible movie disgusts me and I want my money back.Yuck
