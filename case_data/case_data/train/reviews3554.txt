Do not fall for it ...

As praised in many of the other reviews the acting was indeed quite
good and largely believable if not a bit too effusive in some of the
overwritten newlywed dialog interactions. And while the acting, scene
direction and tension did rise to an intriguing and potentially
stimulating crescendo of sorts halfway through, the expectation of
climax or anticipated thematic bridge from drama/romance to horror
failed to carry with it any sense of suspense.That the film failed to generate horror of any kind is my sole problem
with it. Themes such as a person you love suddenly becoming someone
else can evoke psychological terror and qualify for the genre, however,
here the pending horror reveal is disguised as romantic suspense until
a moment too late for the viewer to reap thrills and chills.Science fiction horror is a favorite genre of mine, but 'Honeymoon'
skips science of any kind and trades horror for a moment of gooey
biological shock left open to far too many interpretations. Lack of foreshadowing also contributes to my rating. "Rest your womb,"
says one character to another. Newlyweds not ready to discuss having
children, Killing frogs, an old boyfriend acting strangely to his wife
who appears a victim of domestic abuse, fear of deep water, hiding
messages inside a hollow effigy--all possible clues in deciphering the
plot, or so this viewer had presumed. But none of the above sensibly related to the reveal. In a seemingly
innocent but presumably deceptively clever line of dialog one character
asks another if he has ever killed anything with his bare hands.
Foreshadowing? Apparently, no. Much like the often discussed but never caught fish in the lake, the
writer failed to stock this plot with sensible clues to the reveal.
