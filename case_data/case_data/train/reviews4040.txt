One of the most visually-striking films ever made

I saw the film at the Tellride Film Festival and was blown away. I knew
that the film would be gorgeous, but the trailer doesn't do the
projected feature justice. The oil paintings are mesmerizing on their
own, but combined they create a transfixing animation that is
completely unique and never gets tiring. The film is worth seeing, and
will be forever remembered, for these visuals by themselves. Its only
stumble comes from a script that has difficulty in reaching its
conclusion, and the use of formulated black-and-white flashbacks to
show Vincent's life leave something to be desired (especially when
considering the film's other creative achievements.) Even so, the film
is an immense triumph that every human being with eyes will love.
