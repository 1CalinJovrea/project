Great mix of Drama, Humor, and Action

My disclaimer is this: I tend to rate a bit high because I rate almost
purely on how much I enjoyed a film; I'm as far from a critic or 'movie
snob' as one could possibly be. My rating reflects pure enjoyment and
if it's worth spending the money to see at the theater. In my opinion,
it is!The movie is truly Pride and Prejudice...and Zombies; it follows the
basic outline of the P&P novel, even some of the same dialog, but
throws in zombies. Personally, I loved the book and I loved the Keira
Knightly film and I will admit it took me about 10 minutes or so to
adjust to what I was seeing; but I quickly became immersed. The action is very well done and if you're a fan of women being in
charge in an action movie then you will really like this!If you're a fan of Matt Smith then this is a MUST SEE, i've never
watched Doctor Who, I'm not a fan of him (just b/c I haven't seen him
in things) but he stole every scene he was in, he was excellent. I purposely try to keep my reviews vague so as not to give anything
away; the bottom line is this: if you're in the mood for a fun night
with a movie with a crazy premise and some good action then I highly
recommend it!I am quite surprised by the low rating currently (5.4); I imagine it is
people who don't like seeing the novel turned into something with
zombies. At the end of the screening I was attending there was audience
applause and everyone genuinely seemed to enjoy it!p.s. the current voting breakdown has 18%(!) of 1 votes! So take that
into consideration.p.s. if you don't like horror, I personally wouldn't classify this as
"horror" but more "action"
