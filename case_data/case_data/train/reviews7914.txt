Impressively Realistic

In 1996, the leaders of the commercial expeditions Adventure
Consultants and Mountain Madness, Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott
Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), decide to team up to climb the Everest
together. After the brief preparation and training, they attempt to
reach the summit. However a blizzard strikes the Everest and they need
to urgently descent the mountain. Rob loses some clients and when the
oxygen bottle runs out, Rob discovers that there are no spare bottles
on the location that it should be. His friend Doug Hansen (John Hawkes)
falls off the path and dies and Rob is stranded near the top of the
Everest. Meanwhile Scott is totally exhausted and his clients continue
to descent leaving Scott, the veteran Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) and the
Texan Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) behind. Later the rescue team
succeeds in saving Beck that has lost both hands and nose. In the end,
the survivors return home and Rob's corpse is left in Everest. "Everest" is an impressively realistic film based on a true story. It
is hard to see what is real and what special effects along the film
are. The screenplay uses personal dramas entwined with the lead story
and the direction is tight. The cast with famous names has great
performance and this film is highly recommended. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Everest"
