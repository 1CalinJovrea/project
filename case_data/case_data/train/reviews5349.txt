Just as wonderful as the original

How to Train Your Dragon 2, the sequel to the How To Train Your Dragon
(obviously), the animated film which came out in 2010. I consider it a
great sequel, just as wonderful as the original, making it another
Equal Sequel. I really enjoy sequels that expand on the first film's
story rather than just rehash the original's plot, and this film does
just that.Set 5 years after the events of the original, the Viking Hiccup and his
friends are now young adults who have since made peace with the dragons
and live in harmony with them in their village. Hiccup and his dragon
Toothless now often go on adventures together, exploring new lands and
territories. One day, the two of them discover a cave made of ice that
is home to many new wild dragons and the mysterious Dragon Rider. Upon
this discovery, the two end up in the centre of another conflict
between humans and dragons, which they attempt to resolve.This sequel was a bit darker than the first one, but it still retains
the charm and wonder that the original had going for it. I really liked
how it showed another way that humans can be the real evil monsters and
not the dragons themselves. Hiccup is a lot wiser and more determined
than he was before, and that made the resolution much more satisfying
to see.I rate it 8.5/10 and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved
the original.
