Terrible

Sadistic and totally devoid of any reality this is an awful film. Full
of anachronisms (a settler's wife with decolletage!), ridiculous
characters and improbable action sequences. One sequence was even a
direct ripoff from Django. Cartoony and predictable this was a waste of
money in its creation and a waste of time in my (almost) viewing. I'm
glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater and my husband regrets
ordering it from Netflix. The people responsible for green lighting
this project should be forced to view it and then be banned from
Hollywood. Stick with the original and its terrific cast. RIP Robert
Vaughn, the last surviving seven.
