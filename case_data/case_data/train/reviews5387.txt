a slow story that has been seen before

I had really high hopes for this movie after seeing the preview.
Unfortunately the preview was the the only thing I ended up liking
about this rubbish. After about an hour into this very slow paced movie
I realized that this movie was just never going to get any good. Harry
Potter does a great job in his first break out role but the story just
comes up short with minimal scares and a crawling pace. The setting and
time period have all the makings of a great spook flick. People were
actually laughing out loud in the theater at how the mood would build
up to something that was going to be chilling but then would fall flat.
Big disappointment.
