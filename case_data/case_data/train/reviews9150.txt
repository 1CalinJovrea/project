An atrocious end to a series that's provided the worst 8 hours of my life

This is a truly horrific piece of cinematography, I watched the first
film because of all the hype. Hated it. Suffered through the next two
because I wanted to see it through. Hated them. Then came the finale.
Hate myself for wasting 2 hours of my staring into space time. I actually created an account on here just to warn people to not watch
this awful, awful film. I'm a Jennifer Lawrence fan, she's funny and
charismatic. In this she is wooden and hard to warm to but
unfortunately still by far the best performance in this piece of utter
garbage. Her boyfriend looks 15 and you are supposed to believe that
he's fathered two children with her. I'm surprised if he knows where to
put it!! In summary this is the film equivalent of paying to spend an afternoon
reading labels on the back of shampoo bottles.
