Disappointed

Just watched this movie for the first time. Overall a good movie.
Didn't quite like the ending. I understand it was based on a true story
but it is a movie so it could be just a little different in order to
pull a bigger audience. Extremely disappointed that Paige didn't
recover her memory. I was waiting for that spontaneous moment that she
suddenly remembered everything and came running back to Leo. Not a
movie that I would watch for a second or third time. Overall I think
this movie lacked drama and character. For instance why was it suck a
big deal that her father cheated. Yes I understand the pain but to stop
speaking to your entire family for five years when it wasn't anyone's
fault but your fathers. Could have been written a little better. But
like I said it is a true story, but things could have been twisted up a
little just for the purpose to pull a little more attention and drama
to the plate.
