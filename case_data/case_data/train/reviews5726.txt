This film is perfect for those who like simple, unoriginal, and clichéd films. Others will see it as it is: A so-so mess.

Zootopia. A popular and buzz worthy film. But why? It has nothing new
going for it AT ALL. It's been done to death. It's crammed full of
nowadays and pop culture references and silly humor. It does nothing
fresh or different. The characters are clichéd and nothing new either. Again, WDAS gives us
another quirky, optimistic, spunky female lead. Judy is the same as
every other WDAS character ever made, except for a small few like Elsa,
Meg, Mulan, and that gal from Atlantis. It's so-so, but not superior in any way, because it doesn't actually do
anything new or ground-breaking. It's the same old by-the-book cop
story, same old cliché plot, and a moral that is handled blatantly and
obviously and just keeps beating you over the head with it every
minute... It's visually nice, but it lacks any subtlety.And the sexualizing of animals is sick and people who go crazy over
wanting to do Hopps sexually and such need lives. Seriously. Messed up. Overall, this film is all hyped now but will most likely end up
forgotten years from now unlike actual good Disney films (even some of
the more recent ones). This movie is right up there with Chicken Little and Home on the Range.
Shame. After Tangled, WDAS has had some good stuff like Wreck-It Ralph
and Frozen and hell, even BH6 was better than this furry lovers film
(seriously...wth...)This movie is for those who like it safe and not wanting to spend time
watching a film that is creative, new, original, and unique. Disney is better than this type of film. Hope they can be impressive
again soon. Sadly, all we have now is this terrible film.
