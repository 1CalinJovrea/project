Pretentious, nihilistic, full of itself: just like a teenager

This movie cares very little about the titular character, Earl and has
even less to do to with the dying girl. It is instead fully consumed by
the filmmakers' needs to tell the world how witty and precious THEY
are. They have 2 hours worth of movie name drops and soundtrack quotes
and their own classic remakes to back it up. It is as if they are
declaring, 'I 'know the conversation so well that I can quote it but I
m too cool and clever to do something this straight forward. So I m
doing this instead.' None of the characters and their emotions here
ring true as they are too busy to out-quirky each other in their
outfits, out of left field dialogues and odd balled behaviour. Why?
Because the filmmakers are cool. That's why. Just shut up and admire
our stop motion Shorts. Its a bizarre experience to see the filmmakers
trying so hard to tell this very generic coming of age tearjerker (and
they know it is) while screaming to the audience, 'forget the dying
girl. Watch us instead'.
