One element to ruin a perfectly average action movie

Most already know this move is a remake of the the original Magnificent
Seven which is a remake of Seven Samurai. It serves as a reasonable way
to interest new viewers to look up those original movies. For that I
thank them.However, this movie would have been entertaining and worth watching if
it wasn't for the ridiculous Gatling gun.A magic gun in the final battle that: - only hits the enemy - can hit
the ground at impossible angles based on the distance. - can hit parts
of the town that aren't facing the gun. - can hit a bell tower on
higher ground yet can't be hit by the two snipers in the tower.Additionally, the personal body guard of our villain would wonder into
to the town during the reloading break of the magic gun. This immensely
stupid act was done just so they can have an Indian on Indian melee
battle. I would have been happy to give this movie a 7/10 as entertaining if it
wasn't for the poor writing related to that magic Gatling gun. 5/10
