Longest 2 Hrs. of My Life

I could not WAIT for this movie to come out. I "listened" to the book
on my drive out west and it was started the day Louie Z passed away
which made reading this book even more intense. I was hoping the movie
would cast the same spell over me but it only really addressed one
aspect of his life and I felt it was a HUGE MISS. It missed so many
other areas that were just as fascinating. The dialogue was almost
non-existent as well. It was almost like watching Castaway but with
violence. Sorry Angelina you missed the boat! IF you feel you must see it, then wait until it comes out on PPV don't
waste your money and time.
