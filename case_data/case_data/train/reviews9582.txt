Cute and Adorable Second Film!

Really a cute film as it is once again the Minions stealing the movie.
As it puts in a sense more of a focus on Gru as a father and the
Minions become part of a sinister plot.Now with raising three daughters of Agnes, Edith, and Margo at youngest
Agnes birthday. And trying to go straight. But when a comedic but
determined secret agent named Lucy tries to recruit Gru into the
Anti-Villains League. He refuses saying he is raising his kids and
trying to be selling jelly and jams, although he is failing at it
miserably.But she gives him her card nonetheless. But also after his assistant
and friend, Dr. Nefario leaves to find work after missing being a
villain, Gru reconsiders and he and Lucy are undercover.While his three girls try to find him a date. Which he does not want
but soon has feelings for Lucy but tries not too good to hide them.
Same with Lucy. As both think that a Mexican restaurant owner named
Eduardo is behind mutating chemicals. Along with getting his minions
kidnapped due to Eduardo wanting them to help in his scheme.To be honest I kind of liked the second film better than the first
film. As it shows a little more character development in the three
girls plus Gru and his love life. Plus the Minions being part of the
plot.Cute and adorable second film!
