Have you ever seen a Jeremy Saulnier film and thought, "It was a good movie and everything, but i thought it should be more tense and violent"? This is that film.

NO spoilersThis stripped to the bone, realist thriller is fantastic. It calls to
mind other stripped down thrillers like Sun Don't Shine(2012) and Blue
ruin(2013) both in its color scheme and intense violence. There was
also a lot of elements, particularly the family dynamic and the
cinematography that reminded me of the fantastic Animal Kingdom
directed by David Mich√¥d and that's always a good thing. I would
recommend going into it knowing as little as possible. In summary Great
direction from debuting director Ben Young, Well written, Fantastic
performances from all the cast particularly Emma booth, Gorgeous
cinematography and a Great score. All the violence is tastefully done
for anyone who is worried. Definitely give it a watch if you like lean,
mean thrillers.
