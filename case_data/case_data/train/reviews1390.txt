Tarantino... I am disappointed

I am a hardcore Tarantino fan and I must say I had great expectations
for this movie. I can now honestly say that in my opinion Django
Unchained is Tarantino's worst film to this day. Lets start with the first major flaw. The soundtrack. Usually Tarantino
has great taste for his soundtracks and on most of his movies (pulp
fiction, reservoir dogs, kill bill) it actually is a fundamental part
and complements the film. On Django it seems that Mr. Tarantino got Lil
Wayne to choose some of the tracks. Hip Hop in a western?? Completely
ruined the movie for me. Second, the length of the movie is ridiculously long... Almost 3 hours.
Usually films of such lengths have intricate plot lines and/or are made
to tell an exceptionally long story. Not in this case. The movie could
have easily been 100 minutes long. If it wasn't for the excessive and
unnecessary dialogues, the useless KKK scene, the first 45 minutes of
the movie which have almost nothing to do with the main plot line. The
last 30 minutes of bloodshed serve to no use and I guess is just a
fetish of the director. Mr. Tarantino seems to lose the sense of time
and you can never tell where his ego ends and the plot begins.Third, bad acting. Jamie Foxx is impalpable. Besides a few punch lines
and some dramatic moments Foxx doesn't portray the slave from the
pre-civil war era but mostly comes off as a thug from the hood. Di
Caprio is too pretty-faced to seriously be the villain in this movie
and if it wasn't for the horrors happening around the character
(Candie) you could hardly tell he's the bad guy. Waltz and Jackson on
the other hand with their excellent performances keep this movie
together. I was really hoping Tarantino, with such an all-star cast,
could have pulled off a both socially relevant and at the same time
entertaining film, but again I was mistaken.
