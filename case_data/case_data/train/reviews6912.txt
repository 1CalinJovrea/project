Watch this film.

In the current crop of films, this stands both head and shoulders above
the rest. The subject matter in my opinion was handled with a depth
that is rearly seen in modern films, cinematography and expression of
the whole environment, characters, subject and plot is second to none.
The story flows and feels neither fast or slow but in time, bearing the
soul of all it touches. My first thoughts on seeing the trailer was
that a film like this could only touch at most skim the surface of this
subject matter, but don't be fooled like me, be prepared as you will
soon find yourself skill fully placed in this world seeing and feeling,
maybe even understanding the whole point of it all. It both answers and
asks questions of the viewer but not in intrusive or forceful way which
is a brilliant stroke of genius. Definitely Oscar material as all of
the actors and the people involved in this film should be proud of this
wonderful piece of cinematography.
