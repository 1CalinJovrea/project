Tim Burton classic

Tim Burton does it again - he manages to create with passion and
imagination a whole new world, for those of us who need new worlds.
Thus if you love fantasy and dreams made serious and scary go see it in
3d because it's great. If you are more of an adult than the child
within and you like films with linear plot and logic and exhaustive
explanations you probably won't become a fan and that's OK too. Just
don't rate it low just because it's not your type, a movie should be
rated for what it was meant to be and for what the team behind it tried
to accomplish. Watch the trailer, if you like it you'll probably love
the film. It's worth mentioning that it is quite dark and scary so it's
not for every child.
