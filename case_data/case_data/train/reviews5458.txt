"Kutcher Bias" belies GREAT performance and movie

This movie easily ranks among the movies I most disagree with the
critics on.Why they HATE it?BIASIt's painfully obvious that their was a "Kutcher bias." The last thing
nerds and GROUP-THINK-CRITICS are going to be open to is a
model-turned-actor taking on the role of one of the most accomplished
men of his generation, esp. so soon after his death.Not only did he nail the role, but he took the responsibility so
seriously, and did such a great job, that he actually paid homage to
the much deserving Jobs.ALL BIAS.I admit. I was bias too......until I saw how much Kutcher embodied Jobs. I couldn't believe he
could do it. I didn't think he had it in him. I was wrong.This is coming from a cinephile EXTREMELY sensitive to poor acting, and
yet Kutcher sold me--hook, line, and sinker. Not only did Kutcher nail the role, but it was a DAMN GOOD MOVIE.I've seen it twice now, and I look forward to the next time. It is
inspiring, and it engenders that sense of magic and possibilities so
few movies do.It is just a great, gripping, story. I was "in it" every step of the
way. I didn't see Kutcher. I saw Jobs, and one hell of a ride.
