I think it's the best sequel

Not sure whether this movie was supposed to be a sequel or reboot but
it was way better then that horrible movie with Ryan Reynolds from 2005
and all the other cheesy sequels like Amityville: the evil escapes,
dollhouse, curse, it's about time, a new generation etc. To me the
awakening felt like a good sequel to the original trilogy. It reminded
me a little of part 2 the possession, just not as brutal and I liked
the realism in the story when they watched the original Amityville
horror DVD in the actual house (at least in the the movies) where the
horror took place. The score was done really well and I liked the no nonsense spooky feel
and atmosphere of this film which worked well without the B-rated
acting and cheap low budget special effects a lot of the sequels
suffered from. All the actors in this movie did a good job making the characters
likable and feel real. My only issue with this movie was the cuts and
some scenes in the trailers not shown, and in 1 scene there seemed to
be a bad edit while they take James outside in his wheelchair. I wanted
to know what the dialogue was before it was cut out during the
conversation. I hope the director will eventually release an extended R-rated cut on
DVD/blu ray with the deleted scenes and the original ending before the
re- shoots. I would have preferred watching it on the big screen for my
1st time to get the full effect. I can't believe after waiting 2 years
it didn't get a wide theatrical release considering some of the other
crap out there that did. This one deserved it & I don't know why so
many people didn't like it. It was short but paced well I wasn't bored.
If it does end up in my local theatre on Oct 28th i will go.
