bares its heart and is both exceptional in its rending of its heart and its humor.

One of the pleasantries of frequenting movies in the theater : when you
go in maybe expecting a decent Gyllenhall performance in what will
probably be another sappy true life story and.... Its one of the best
faakkin movies of the year (as a Bostonian would say)! David Gordon
Green exceeds any expectations by pulling no punches, but at the same
time crafting a tender and difficult love story (this could probably be
on a double bill with the Big Sick, kind of the reverse side of that
maybe). Also Tatiana Maslany shows why she will be around for a while
(one hopes) post Orphan Black, and Clancy Brown reminds us why hes
still a national treasure in about ten minutes of screen time (as Jeff
Bauman's father).It's raw, it doesn't pull away, but the filmmaking has a perfect kind
of dramatic (and at times surprisingly comedy) touch that never goes
too far, never draws out tears like a manipulative bastard. It's
wonderful in that encouraging sense that while Bauman helped to
ultimately inspire those simply by, you know, not just not dying but
that he didn't give up, this director, who might be unique among his
peers as a kind of art-house journeyman if that makes sense, crafts
another film loaded to the brim with deeply emotional performances that
resonate because of Gyllenhall but also everyone else around him. This
is a film rich with an atmosphere that is that Boston in certain movies
(The Fighter is another) where it feels like you're there.Stronger is a case of a filmmaker and cast and entire production going
beyond the lines of the usual by taking it down to the level of the
basic, and yet it has and wrestles with truly existential problems: if
one is still alive, perhaps by a little luck but also from the help of
someone else, how do you cope with everyone calling you a hero when you
feel like anything but? In other words, it shirks at phoniness, and
carries the spirit of what I imagine is Bauman himself. Well well done!
