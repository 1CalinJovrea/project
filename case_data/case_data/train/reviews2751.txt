Conjuring franchise saves itself from itself

Annabelle: Creation is a thoroughly well-executed and thought-out
medium budget horror in a creepy house with a creepy doll. It is also a
borderline comedy at times, cleverly realising that the doll is not
only scary but also rather ridiculous. Moving from scares to laughter
and back was done with outstanding precision and taste.The effect where something first happens with thundering sound and
action, followed by a deafening silence in anticipation of potential
further threats, is somewhat overused, but excellent actors and overall
professional production let this kind of small issues pass without much
distraction.As a prequel to the previous movie which was also a prequel, the story
is eventually tied to the previous Annabelle vehicle, which felt not
only unnecessary but quite clunky and rushed. Stay put for a brief
after-credit scene for more Conjuringverse things to come.
