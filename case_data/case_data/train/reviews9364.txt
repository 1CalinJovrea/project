Great fun

Great fun for kids. All the usual characters, spot on witty dialogue,
overall great to watch if you are a kid or are entertaining some kids.
All the usual stuff from previous movies is in place. This is not and
never will be some deep commentary on life as we know it. It is cartoon
about a strangely shaped gentleman who has a particular ability to
create mischief and be a villain/good guy... I don't know, one of those
I'm sure.
