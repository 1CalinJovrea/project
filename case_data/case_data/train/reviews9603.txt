Bad reviews everywhere for a perfect film

Walter Salles has made another beautiful, captivating, moving film. 'On
The Road' is a close adaptation of Kerouac's famous novel which came to
define the beat movement. Sticking to the fictional character names of
Dean Moriarty and Sal Paradise (this feels historically faithful as
these are the names used in the book up until a recent re-edition of
the original text) we follow Sal's attempts to find 'it' in his travels
across America, and through his relationships, and his attempts to
write a meaningful work of art. Sam Riley is brilliant in the central
role; natural, sympathetic, captivating. All the other actors are
excellent. What is the real strength of this film is the unpretentious
film-making which resists drawing attention to the wealth of talent
involved in making it, is it perhaps the perfection of this film which
has tempted reviewers to pick holes or invent flaws, like a true beauty
it is sometimes hard for others to resist trying to destroy or defile
it? Cinema magic is rare, shame people have trouble recognizing it when
they have it in front of them.
