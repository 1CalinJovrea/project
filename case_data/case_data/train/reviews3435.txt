What about consequences?

This movie depicts only the incident on the oil rig. The real disaster,
the catastrophic consequences on the environment are not taken into the
story line. I was expecting much more. You can learn a lot watching
some videos on youtube.Most important part of the story seems swept under the carpet and
hidden to the audience.The topic is so critical and the result is so outrageous that
everything about screenplay, the acting, the visual effects, are not
worth to be judged.So disappointing that makes me angry. 3 stars, because after all is a
good disaster movie. If it wasn't a true story it could be a 6.
