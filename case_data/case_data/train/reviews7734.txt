Disappointed Cheap Shocks

Im not a huge fan of the found footage genre anyway but Creep didn't
help. This is one of their first directional films and its a good place
to start but it didn't do anything for me. The movie did have a load of
potential. The use of only 2 main characters was great made it more
simpler.Creep follows Aaron a videographer who answered an ad on craigslist for
a $1000 for 8 hours work with Josef. At first it seemed reasonable
Josef was dying from cancer and wont see his unborn son grow up so
wants to make videos for him. Within hours he was acting a little
strangely but always shrugging it off with "Weird Sense Of Humour" soon
enough Aaron has had enough, He intercepts a call from Josefs supposed
wife but instead his sister telling him to leave immediately.Im not going to give away the ending it has a few good scares but also
a few loose ends... like why did he do it?
