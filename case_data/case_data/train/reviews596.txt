Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood. Simply the most
refreshing and entertaining film that I've been lucky enough to watch
since Nightcrawler...really it's that good. The darkest comedy you'll
have the pleasure to experience. Ticks all the boxes, cinematic, a
superb ensemble cast deliver in every short story, dead pan humour,
intelligent, thought provoking, terrifyingly realistic, wonderful
camera-work especially in the final story, with a couple of explosions
and some (thankfully) subtle CGI thrown in to complete this
masterpiece. Lovely to once again sit amid an audience all happily
laughing out loud, without the need to lower itself to racist, sexist,
ageist, homophobic humour, though the scatological humour is
surprisingly perfectly appropriate and carefully framed to make the
point without unnecessary vulgarity. Ten out of Ten. A new name to
watch. Kudos to Damián Szifron.
