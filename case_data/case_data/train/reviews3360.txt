Huh. How didn't I hear about this movie?

Honestly, I've never heard about this movie and I'm just in the habit
of watching whatever Amazon Prime happens to show as "just added".I like a good thriller and immediately enjoyed the pace of the dialog
and the acting level of the actors forced to perform in a group and
make conversation look natural.I also enjoyed that it was unapologetically intelligent. Great plot
doing a difficult job of showing more than half the movie in the wrong
order. Most of all, I liked that it showed what's it like when you're the
genius-level chess player in the room. How odd it feels when people
aren't thinking 4 or 5 or 6 steps ahead.Even as the main character proves to be unrelenting and immoral in her
approach to winning, you're still rooting for her because Jessica
Chastain does an excellent job of showing that she (the character Liz
Sloane) does have some feeling regarding what she must do to be an
effective lobbyist.)In short, an utter and complete surprise! Movie really felt like the
old-school 1970s political/espionage movies like "Three Days to the
Condor". This was made in 2016 and I don't remember hearing ANYTHING
about it! Real shame. Strong cast with a great script.
