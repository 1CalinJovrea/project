Better than most "blockbuster" movies out there.

I read The Host book when it came out and it became one of my
favourites. Say what you will about Meyer's writing for Twilight, but
The Host is different. For one, Wanderer is a very likable heroine.I only heard about the movie version a week before it opened here.
Didn't have high hopes for it, as I thought it would face the same fate
as the Twilight series.. But I needed to see it to make the call...And I was pleasantly surprised! It stayed true to the book - of course
they had to cut out some scenes, otherwise it would've been very long -
but I never felt like the cuts ruined the story.One thing I will really praise is the acting. Unlike most movies today
I thought The Host had a great cast and never did the acting seem
unnatural. Even the cheesy lines were delivered well. Props to the kid
who played Jamie, he made me cry! And Saoirse was brilliant in playing
two personalities.Anyway, I wrote this review (my first ever IMDb review ever) because I
felt it was unfair that the movie was getting too much flak just for
its relation to Meyer or Twilight. There are worse movies out there,
just relying on special effects and pomp to cover up the lack of plot
and characterisation. See the movie or read the book first before you
judge this one.
