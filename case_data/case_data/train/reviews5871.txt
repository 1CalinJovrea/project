I cant believe this was so poorly written

This was without a doubt one of the most disappointing movies I went to
in 2013 and I go to a lot of movies. I saw the previews and like the
fact that Seth and his buddies were going to play themselves. All I can
say is the movie had a handful of funny scenes but had way too little
comedy overall for what I was expecting. It was also a movie with a lot
of blood and some of the writing just looked like they were smoking pot
when putting this together. ( for all I know that might be what Seth
and company had in mind).I like most of the actors in this movie for their previous work so I
thought together this would turn out funny. Unfortunately This movie
just wasn't funny. wait for it to be for sale for 5.00 at wal mart in
about a year or rent it at red box if you insist on seeing it but don't
see it for 10.00 or more!
