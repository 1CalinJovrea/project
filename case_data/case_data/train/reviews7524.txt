A plot that thickens.....................

Every once in awhile a movie will come out that surprises you with how
good it is. Unlocked is such a movie. It has everything a movie goer
wants. It has an intelligent plot, It has twists and turns within that
plot, it has good acting by an A-list cast and a fast tempo delivery
that holds your attention for the whole movie. All in all a very
entertaining movie and I think that is all the audience wants for their
money. Kudos on a job well done!
