Another Over-hyped Horror Film...

Raw is the latest horror film that has become the target of (almost)
universal acclaim. The question remains as to why, considering the fact
that Raw is just a schlock fest attempt at shock value that grossly
(both literally and figuratively) underwhelms. The film chronicles a
teenage vegetarian who attends a boarding school for the veterinary
arts and is then subjected to a grisly accident that costs her her
finger...and her sanity. As the film progresses, it becomes more and
more apparent that this young girl is developing an sensational lust
for sex and human flesh directly borough on by her unfortunate mishap.The film falls into the category of attempted shock and fails to really
shock you. It parades an abundance of sex and gore on screen but none
of it holds any weight. The violence and gore that ensues becomes a
rote exercise in the type of horror that this past decade has been
known for: a big build up to a no nothing pay off. It is about as
frustrating as it could get when it comes to satisfying. Much in the
vein of Salo: 120 Days of Sodom and last year's The Neon Demon, Raw
delivers very lightly and makes promises it can't deliver. The
screenplay is boring and under written and features a couple memorable
moments surrounded by a whole lot of blood drenched fluff that is
brought out by some gorgeous cinematography.. It is woefully
unsatisfying even to the most hardcore of horror fans.Overall, Raw is yet another horror movie that feels a little more hyped
up than it ought to be. Instead of living up to it's potential, the
film falters under the pressure which is frustrating considering this
is a very original idea. Overall, I felt let down by Raw and I really
wanted it to live up to the hype that it brought on when it was making
festival runs. Instead, we get a film that feels half baked even if the
presentation of it looks very nice.
