A Sweet Untold Story

It's hard to judge a movie when the topic of the movie is, in part,
about artistic quality itself. Is the art displayed in this movie great
art or not? In some ways, the commercialization and popularity of mass
public dictation of art as presented in this movie can be distracting
to the more intriguing and powerful issue of intimate relationships
around which this movie is primarily centered. With grand strokes, Amy
Adams takes on the relatively unknown backstory to a truly "cute" big
eye artistic technique that is now seemingly found everywhere in every
store in America. What she experiences in the 1950s and 1960s in terms
of women's rights and dignity is as relevant as the civil right
movement of the times. And with today's racial issues still simmering
today, the concept of power and domination still resonant today.The portrayal of Margaret Keane is an eye opening and told in
magnificent brush strokes with close attention to a color palette. The
director has managed to incorporate in lightness even within the
emerging darkness of the storyline. Somehow the movie is sustained by
the sad big eyes and the real-world response to the sparkling
popularity of the emotion-laden products that seemingly permeate
American society. There is initially hope then growing anger and
frustration dripping from the storyline and yet based on a secure
foundation that this is a movie about a hidden strength and personal
integrity to be found and revealed to the world.Big Eyes is actual simple in its true to life concept and yet told in a
way that is emotional riveting, maintaining a strong sense of the story
to be told.
