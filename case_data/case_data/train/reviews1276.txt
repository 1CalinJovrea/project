poor fidelity and false feeling

The movie doesn't look like 50s, both cars and Brooklyn, Ireland,
dancing, poverty, motivation, costumes, atmosphere itself. Sometimes it
looks like 30s, sometimes 60s. Poor Ireland turns into blooming country
for a few months. The plot is very nice, wide space for creativity,
but... It looks like authors never felt need nor duty nor passion. Life
of wax people with synthetic problems and feelings. The movie pretends
to be a human story, but it is far away from real life, real people.
False feeling. It looks like authors read no book only comics, never
fell in love, they can make love only. Ultimately, poor realization
strangled nice plot. As for me, of course. You eager in anticipation
with plot for all the movie but the small mistakes and disappointments
then and again spoil your impression, but you calm yourself down, OK,
it's just a small lapse, let's enjoy it... I'm surprised the movie was
nominated, it is not Cinema, it's just a piece of pop-culture, clich√©,
comics.
