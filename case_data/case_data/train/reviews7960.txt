Remake Rather Than Reimaging...But Still GOOD!

I have been eagerly awaiting this movie since I heard of the casting of
Chloe Grace Moretz. I could totally picture her portraying the
character in the style and feel created by Sissy Spacek and followed up
by Angela Bettis (2002 TV movie). I knew she would be a worthy
successor after seeing the film Let Me In. I was, however, skeptical of
the casting of Julianne Moore as the religious fanatic mother of
Carrie, Margaret White.After seeing the film twice this weekend, Julianne Moore turned out a
creepy performance that should definitely garner her an Academy Award
nod. Her portrayal of Margaret White was an emotional witches brew of
fanaticism, insanity, and maternal instinct. For me, it was an
unexpected treat.As for Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz did a fine job. She had big shoes to
fill, and her performance does not top that of Sissy Spacek. However,
she does hold her own. In all three versions of Carrie, each actress
has portrayed Carrie in a different way. Each excelling in making the
role their own while maintaining the artistic concept of Carrie
herself. Chloe did deliver a chilling performance during the scenes
where Carrie is exacting her revenge.As for the movie itself, I would describe it as a remake of the 1976
film sprinkled with some additional elements from the Stephen King
novel. It was very well made, and the modernization is appropriate
without being too obvious of the change in times, i.e cell phones, the
Internet, etc.In closing, Carrie is an extremely competent attempt at remaking a
classic. As I say with all remakes, you have to go into it with an open
mind and not with the mind set of comparing it to the original. If you
do that, you will find Carrie is a good movie.
