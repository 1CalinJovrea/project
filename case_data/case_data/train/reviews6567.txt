Class warfare in 2023 from the outlier POV.

America, 2023, Los Angeles. Use of The Purge continues to eliminate
people who live below the poverty line. The film starts at March 21 at
16:34; that is, 2 hours, 26 minutes before the onset of the sixth
annual 12 hour Purge. The opening scene is at a diner. Various Latinos
wish each other to 'Stay Safe' before they head to sanctuary and
whatever weapons they have.Great opposition campaign slogan: We no longer worship at the altar of
Christ, Mohammed, or Yahweh. We worship at the altar of Smith and
Wesson.Thread 1: Papa Rico, mother Cali, and daughter Eva are together in a
small house. Papa announces he's going to sleep through it after
boarding up his room, but he has a different mission to attempt. Will
he succeed? How will the women do?Thread 2: Shane and Liz are a twenty-something couple who are trying to
stay out of trouble, but it comes looking for them early: a gang
sabotaged their car. They had decided to split up. They are squabbling
over how to announce it when they discover the bad news about the car.
Will they last long against the reaper gangs?Thread 3: will the opposition accomplish anything? Will they target the
thug gangs or the rich?Thread 4: Sergeant roams the deserted downtown Los Angeles, looking for
opportunities. He saves a few people from a circumstance or two by
killing gang members. Will his early success continue?The script is ambitious, and the issues hot in the environment of 2015
America. Did the director engage me with the issues of the opposition?
No. I never believed they had a chance, which is unfortunate. Did the
director get me to care about the main characters representing the
lower class? Again, no. Most of them were too stupid to live. So, what
am I left with? Plenty of characters to despise or not care about, but
no one to identify with or to empathise with.
