A riveting, two hour 'ride-along' with the the LAPD.

Gritty, real and lots of action. The director/writer, Ayer, grew up on
the streets of El Lay and it shows. Jake Gyllenhal and Michael Pena are
just electric as partners in a black and white, and the performance by
Cle Shaheed Sloan as the street hood with a sense of honor named Tre is
awesome. The dialog is so good, that half the time you think this is an
episode of Cops without any bleeps.Ayer uses various camera techniques brilliantly to tell the story. I
usually do not like a lot of hand-held (it sometimes makes me dizzy),
but he uses it very well here and I suffered no side effects.I look forward to Ayer's next movie: just see this one and you will
too.
