A dynamic movie full of tensions and twists

"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you
don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a
boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art." Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn't expecting to
feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and
something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to
apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this
story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made
it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for
something bigger. This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner
creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed
without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are
two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who
make beautiful art"Beautiful" because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a
GIFT. Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply
believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly
chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won't say "good job" but
rather "thank you", to the promising Franco-American director Damien
Chazelleï»¿ for sharing his vision.
