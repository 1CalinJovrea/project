Good family fun movie

I took my 11 yr old niece to see this movie and we both loved it. Good
clean family fun. Nice to walk out of a movie singing and dancing for a
change...... Julia Roberts is hilarious, Nathan Lane even more so and
the rest of the cast endearing. Seems if a movie doesn't have violence
or sex, not many like it. That is so sad.... life should be fun
sometimes and this movie made us feel uplifted and happy.Thanks Julia and Nathan..... I am not familiar with the actress that
played Snow White or the Prince but they were both adorable and funny.This movie was entertaining for any age, full of action, surprises and
humor..... go see it, don't let the nay sayers keep you away.
