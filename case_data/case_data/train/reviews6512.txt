Freedom and Choices and Tarantino

In Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, there is a scene in which
Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable
dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops
for new clothes to wear. Schultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the
smiling white man in disbelief. You're gonna let me pick out my own
clothes? Django can't believe it. The following shot delivered one of
the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the
white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick
out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse,
now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit혰an all blue
with white ruffle get-up. It's a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to
further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more
than that. It's a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It's an
affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own
decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit
acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way혰watch out,
here I come, I ain't gonna be quiet no more.And the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film혰it wants us to
get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color
makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick혰that's why he made the
film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It's been
long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and
it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and
meticulously written, it's Tarantino at his most epic.
