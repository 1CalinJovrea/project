Complete waste of time that give porn a bad name.

OK, I admit it, you had me at "Nymphomaniac"...but honestly, the
swelling of certain extremities normally associated with the
anticipation such a title would evoke, left immediately when I heard
LeBeuf speak.The accent he used wasn't even questioned by the director?
Did the director actually watch any scenes on playback? Are we to
believe that a nymphomaniac believes themselves to be worthless humans?
Now, I tried to reserve judgement until I had watched both...a
considerable task when one isn't even interested after the "end" of the
first trainwreck. I will keep my opinion about the "artistry" to
myself. This movie had potential and obviously budget to make a strong
impression, but all it did was come off as predictable and a bit
antagonist toward conventional morality...maybe that was the point, but
again, no comment on the artistic content. It was poorly executed and
excruciatingly drawn out. The end was almost a relief...even mildly
amusing. Both main characters displayed canned hypocrisy throughout and
I would guess that to be another part of the "art" content....once
again, no comment. Don't waste your time. Sex is fun and simulated sex
isn't...especially when the simulation paints sex to be so.....well, no
comment.
