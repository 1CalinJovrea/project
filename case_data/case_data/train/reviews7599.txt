Garbage on film!

Total Recall - What a waste of money and talent! Unfortunately, none of
these 2 aspects are a part of this film.You have high paid actors, 2 female A listers, a highly gross budget,
and a lot of money spent for nothing! I am not sure what the purpose of
remaking this film was for. The Swarzenneger original was a clever and
entertaining film for it's time. If the original was bad, then I would
understand why some studio would have an interest in remaking it.
Building the creativity of the story. However, the original did it's part and for what market or audience it
was originally intended for, the original did the trick and this is
just a sloppy makeover. A film of this kind has but one purpose - to
hopefully, ride the coat-tails of the original (without really adding
anything clever) in order to try and build up the bank bucks on another
unnecessary sequel. Shame on you!
