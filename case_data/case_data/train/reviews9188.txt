A journey from beginning to end!

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a spin-off of the highly
successful Harry Potter-franchise. Naturally, there were great
expectations for this first part of a whole new franchise in the J.K.
Rowling's wizarding world and I can honestly say that it delivers
everything you would dreamed of.From minute one the movie gets you on a journey with great visuals,
very recognizable music and great performances from Eddie Redmayne and
Dan Fogler. From now and then you get the, sometimes funny, sometimes
smart references to Harry Potter, but nevertheless is this a movie that
can totally stand on it's own.There are some nitpicks, such as the very long introduction before we
start to see what the story is all about and the fact that there were a
lot of lines referring to events that were setting up the second or the
third movie, but for a film that had to set up the rest of an upcoming
franchise it was totally acceptable and not a slight bit tedious.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them stands perfect on its own and
doesn't need Harry Potter or any of the planned movies to get you
invested in its story and yet it is an obligation for every J.K.
Rowling wizarding world-fan to go see this movie. The director David
Yates found this perfect balance and ended up with a result that has to
be seen in theaters by everyone.
