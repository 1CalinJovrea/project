One of the worst films

Plain and simple. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Maybe
the expectations were too high, but I've rarely been so disappointed by
a Marvel movie. As a comedy, this was so and so. It had some good jokes
at times. As a superhero movie,action movie - it was just crap.Nothing
happens for more than one hour and when it does it's just CGI.
Characters do not show any superpowers, they are just for making jokes,
there are no real fights or good action sequences. Not to mention the
story is terrible. I really don't understand why everyone was so
impressed by this movie. It's like anything that Marvel throws at us is
amazing, when clearly we should have higher standards....
