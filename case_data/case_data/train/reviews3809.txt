Incompetently boring - unwatchable by anyone with an intellect.

This was so bad that I logged into IMDb to learn who was responsible
for this rubbish posing as a movie. It was Luis Prieto and I will make
very sure that I never bother with anything that he is associated with
in the future. Beginning with the ludicrously over-long series of
images of babies that bored me and imagine many others, it morphed into
rambling and unnecessary nonsense that added nothing to the plot. I
suffered through another thirty minutes or so hoping for improvement
then turned the movie off in disgust. It lacks coherence, logic, a
basic plot, and skill with imagery. BORING INANE BANAL are descriptors
that jump to mind.
