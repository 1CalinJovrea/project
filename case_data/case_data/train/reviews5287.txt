Sparkly Kids movie

This movie is great for 5 yo girls. They'll love the abundant color,
sparkles and soundtrack. Boys - not so much. My 9yo and his friend were
squirming in their seats after the first 10 minutes, but the 7yo sister
was entertained. Adults - well if you can drink a beer/wine or pass out
until the end, this would be advisable - otherwise just shoot me.The story line is the usual predictable, overdone Cinderella story. The
premise of cannibalistic Bergens who can only attain happiness at
another's expense, is a little disturbing. However, this is squarely
for the young kiddos - I suppose most will enjoy it.4/10.
