It's a slasher film that isn't particularly scary and a comedy that isn't particularly funny; what it is, however, is incredibly entertaining.

'Happy Death Day' is a horror-comedy that very knowingly takes the core
conceit of (or at least popularised by) 'Groundhog Day (1993)' and
smashes it together with the slasher genre, but where most pictures of
the kind would try to scare or shock this one solely sets its sights on
trying to entertain, using the language and influences of both its
primary styles to provide a roller-coaster ride that has a good amount
of edge but also knows when to pull back and have some fun; the result
is a piece which isn't scary and isn't funny but is certainly enjoyable
throughout, even if the ultimate 'whodunnit' reveals are a little
disappointing and the machinations of the plot never quite come full
circle to the point that a few holes start to emerge, and actually
manages to maintain a decent and non-repetitive pace that doesn't ape
its most key inspiration all too often (though it does do it, in the
broadest strokes, on a number of occasions.) 7/10
