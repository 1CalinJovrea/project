Mediocre actress directs mediocre film

I was very disappointed in what should have been, hands down, an Oscar
contender. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone because the
direction absolutely ruined this film, which misses the point of the
book altogether. Laura Hildebrand's wonderful book immediately reaches
the reader's heart as she connects Louie Zamperini's life story of
growing up from a kid headed towards a life of crime to becoming a man
who not only survived the most unbelievable odds but also how the human
spirit can sustain anything, if wanted. Never during the two + hours
does the viewer get to know the character, or his friends, family and
comrades-in-arms. Maybe Ms. Jolie should have spent more time reading
the book and trying to understand the emotional connect the book had
with its readers than planning all her promotional interviews and short
documentaries which focused only on her and how fortunate she was to
have been chosen to direct the film. It's not about you, Angelina, it
was about a remarkable life and humanity, and you missed it all.
