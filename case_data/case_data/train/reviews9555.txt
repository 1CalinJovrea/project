Great movie for robots vs monsters anime fans

I just watched Pacific Rim on the first day/time slot of premiere in
3D. Yes, I am a geek. But that is not the whole point. If you had the
excitement of watching anime movies of robots vs monsters in childhood,
this is perfect movie for you. The Kaiju monsters design reminds me of
Godzilla's villain monsters combined with Cloverfield monster,
xenomorph (Aliens), and TRON. As for the Jeager robots, I'll let you to
decide whether they are good or very good. :)To watch this movie I needed to change my mindset to be like a 10 ten
year old robot geek child, like 29 years ago. Because if not, you will
feel a lot of question marks and disappointment through this movie. The
story is quite predictable. The plot and pace are simple enough for
children to understand. And the nerd and geek professor appearances are
a bit annoying for me. But hey, that what is all about: to celebrate
the childhood memory of robots vs monsters.Overall, the movie is great for robot vs monsters anime fans. It's not
even close to that horrible Michael Bay's Transformers.
