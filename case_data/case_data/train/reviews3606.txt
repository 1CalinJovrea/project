I cannot understand all those bad reviews of Passengers

The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I
would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes.
Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty
skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris
Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is
quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that
resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore
the ship design).The pacing was a little bit too fast at the end but not that
noticeable. Rating: 9/10 Sometime a simple movie with simple plot is better than s**t like
Batman vs Superman because there are less space for mistakes. Also, do
not expect much action in this movie (I expected more action but in the
end I was OK without it.)Also, sleeping beauty is also named Aurora xD
