A certain must watch - great story line with great characters

I never review movies but I just could not miss on an opportunity to
recommend this movie to people out there. Certainly one of this years'
best movies. Very well told story and the main character. Deep and
emotionally quite heavy movie but with quite a lot of action. Ending is
so great as well which perfectly sums up Jacobs character and the
things and sacrifices you are willing to do for others.
