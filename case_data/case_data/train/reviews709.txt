A Movie About Men Feeling

I thought this was a brilliant movie. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Davis
Mitchell, gives a tour de force performance as a man who suddenly loses
his wife. Davis is a man out of touch with his feelings and with only a
primitive grasp of the underlying dynamics of relationships. Men, in my experience, can often be unclear about what they're feeling.
Often our emotional vocabulary is inadequate for circumstances in which
we find ourselves. In Demolition Gyllenhaal's character, Davis, is
overwhelmed with feelings he has no conception of how to express or
deal with.The devastation of his loss forces him to wake up to what is most
essential in human existence, our relationships with each other. He'd
just been inhabiting roles previously. Is that a spoiler? OK, I'm a therapist and a carpenter, so the idea of taking things all
apart to put them back together has immediate resonance. Though I did
not lose my wife to breast cancer a couple of years ago, the experience
forced me to contemplate the loss. That experience certainly added
depth to my experience of the picture.Well, I thought that the way the script, the direction, and the acting
portrayed his metamorphosis into a more whole human being was
fascinating and beautiful. Naomi Watts is excellent as Karen, the
catalyst for his transformation, as is Judah Lewis as her son.
Gyllenhaal was perfect and inhabited the part with power and
sensitivity. I think it's a great picture.
