Deserves a Sequel

The newlywed Bea (Rose Leslie) and Paul (Harry Treadaway) travel to a
remote cottage in the woods that belongs to her family for their
honeymoon. They are happy and feeling deep love for each other. They
decide to have lunch at a rustic restaurant where Bea meets her
childhood friend Will (Ben Huber), who owns the restaurant and has a
strange behavior. He tells that he got married to Annie (Hanna Brown)
and asks them to leave since the restaurant is closed. During the
night, the house searched by a light and soon Bea vanishes. Paul finds
her naked and wandering in the woods and she claims that she is
sleepwalker. Paul suspects that she had encountered Will while Bea
changes her behavior. What might have happen to Bea? "Honeymoon" is a claustrophobic and tense low-budget horror movie
supported by a well-written screenplay that keeps the mystery to the
end and great performances of Rose "Ygritte" Leslie and Harry
Treadaway. The conclusion should be the climax of the story but is
quite cold. I usually hate sequels and franchises but this movie
deserves a sequel with further explanations about the fate of Bea and
Annie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available
