Awful trash

This is such a bad movie on so many levels i do not understand the IMDb
rating.The violence is very graphic, and thats about it. Can not get more
cliché than this movie, it's like Welcome to the Rileys with a whole
bunch of retard thrown in.The film is pretty much a definition of cliché, Ex special forces guy
living an ordinary life, Corrupt cops that he beats up, ha ha, A young
girl caught up with some nasty shite decides to trust this guy to save
her, probably because of the way he stares at people.It's just ridiculous, I walked out 2/3 through the movie, it really was
that bad, only the second time in my life i've done that. And it's
beyond me how the movie got such a high ranking here, the term ignorant
masses comes to mind. If you love overdone overplayed clichés, you will love this film.
Otherwise give it a miss.
