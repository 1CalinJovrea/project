Self/less Review

My Thoughts:There are movies that you see the trailer for and think to yourself
that is a very interesting concept I wonder if they will delve into the
deeper aspects of this and then you get to the movie and go nope not
even close. Self/less is a movie that I wanted them to delve deeper
into the struggles inside and outside of taking over a new body.We get a very little taste of that with memories that seem to force
themselves on the new "person" taking over the body but they really
side step all that with magic red pills that they seemed to have
developed before knowing really that they would need them. So you
really do not get a struggle for control because if you continue to
take your little red pills then the memories will dissipate. The only
reason this is an issue in this movie is because the company doesn't
bother telling the people that they are moving into the new body that
they body really isn't brand new but slightly used. And that brings me
to the outside portion of the struggle I wanted them to show more.The company that does this "shedding" as it is called in the movie
first lie and state that the bodies were grown in a lab but we come to
find out that that isn't really true they had issues with the growth
process. Instead of being up front and telling the new owners that the
body they are purchasing was used but the previous owner gave up all
rights to the body due to "x" circumstance they throw the new person
into the body and then try to lie once again about the memories they
are seeing and that take these little red pills and they will go away.Usually when I watch a movie even when I think it is bad I can usually
find something good about at least a portion of it. This one I can't
even say is a good popcorn movie. There are too many movies out during
blockbuster season that I would recommend over this movie, maybe if it
came out in the January through April time frame I could give my
recommendation to check this movie out in the theaters but I can't do
that now. With the three movies that are coming out today if you had to
see one in theaters it would have to be Minions at least you would be
entertained.So let me ask you if you were dying and a company came up to you and
said they could extend your life and were completely honest about the
procedure, would you go for it?My Recommendation:Rent It
