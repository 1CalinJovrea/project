This movie is Great!!!!

I think Halle Berry did great in Kidnap. The movie will have you on the
edge of your seat and trust me there is never a dull moment. Plus the
movie is not predictable so that's a plus! Don't Listen to all the
kidnap haters and not watch the movie. I think you should watch the
movie and judge for yourself whether it is a good movie or not. People
have different opinions and you might actually like the movie. Just
Give It A Chance!!!!!
