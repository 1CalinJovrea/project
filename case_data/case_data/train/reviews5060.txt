poetry in motion

peaceful candles on violent faces - rough vision of emotions deep -
motion matched the poetry - of wondering thoughts to keep.a master piece combining theatre - excellent acting and visual art -
authenticity in dress and location - even Shakespeare would take heart.Michael Fassbender made Macbeth, raw yet vulnerable which solved an
issue I always had with this character. How can a strong war lord
completely losing it? He portrayed Macbeth in a such a way that made me
feel, that he truly (twistingly) believed it was also for survival and
not just for simple ambition. He solved it for me.At the same time, I always thought of Lady Macbeth as a conniving,
over-ambitious gold-digger. She still was yet at the same time I saw a
strong person who helped surviving despite her pain and loss. Marion
Cotillard's acting was so pure and emotionally complex, awesome.A Scottish friend who loves his country's history, was pleasantly
surprised regarding the relative authenticity of highlander living and
praised the costumes: no tartan, but Roman type with leather/metal
battle uniforms which would be likely correct considering that Macbeth
lived in the 11th century.The music was powerful, supporting the Shakespearian lines, subtly
giving them more impact. @Sales: subtitles would be useful even for
people whose first language is English ... although it would reduce the
magnitude of this visual spectacle. This films was everything I was hoping for when seeing the trailer. It
was a piece of art with moving pictures and words. Even if you don't
like Shakespeare, it's an amazing film. A very high 9 score !
