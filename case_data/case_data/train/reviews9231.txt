Two hours of my life I'll never get back...

There are so many things wrong with this movie, it made me want to
scream. I cannot forgive the scene where she freezes the demons. As a
group, instead of killing the frozen demons, they walk through the
demons and wait for them to unfreeze and have the demons kill the
werewolves. Come on! They can kill off the werewolves with more demons.
There are so many little things like that that just made the movie
stupid for anyone who's older than 15.Oh, and the incest theme, come on. Put two and two together people, and
get a frigging DNA test. Also, when "someone" from the inside has let
the demons in, think about it, by a process of elimination, there's 5
of you, 4 of whom were together. Just a thought, it'd be the one who
wasn't with you. Ta-dah! I really wanted to like this movie, the premise is fantastic. The
actors did a very good job with such a silly script, and the special
effects are cool. It would help if the characters talked about the same
thing instead of randomly jumping topics within a conversation.
