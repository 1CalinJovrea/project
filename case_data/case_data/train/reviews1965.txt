Seems Nicole Kidman wanted money very badly!! Hence this master"mess" movie. Spare yourself,Please don't watch.

I was left speechless when the movie ended. The main question was "why
did they make this movie?" And why Nicole Kidman bothered to accept
such role? Whole movie progresses very slowly, with not much drama
(except their children gone missing) and awfully creepy music (which is
totally mismatch for the scenes). You keep expecting to get some twists
and explanations till the end and after the end you keep wondering why
we wasted our time in expecting. Each and every character is shown as
if they are having some mysterious secret (why? why?? why???). Kidman's
character is the weirdest one (you will find out after watching the
movie,but please don't take the risk). I decided to write the review
only to make all you aware that the movie is totally pointless &
worthless. Please please please don't waste your time.
