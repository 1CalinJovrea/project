Truth, not all the truth, yet nothing but the truth, Walt Disney's Saving Mr. Banks is a Best Picture Hopeful with all the good credentials

Walt Disney Pictures rarely aims for the Best Picture crown, being more
a company focused on profits and sustaining its wildly popular brand.
To make you haters hate more: they've earned $4 billion this year
already and this includes the $200 million loss of Lone Ranger). They
usually only distribute the movies that have a shot at Academy Awards
immortality, with The Help (A Dreamworks film) being the latest example
of a nominee and No Country For Old Men being their latest example of a
winner.But with Saving Mr. Banks, Disney is going the whole nine yards. With a
stellar cast, seemingly endless budget (Giving John Lee Hancock a
much-less stressful job in directing), high production value, and heavy
dosage of drama that hides beneath the happier movie trailers, this
film stands as one of the better dramas of the year and a sure-fire
Oscar-contender. Touching upon the tissue-happy themes of forgiveness,
family, and seeking happiness in a miserable world, prepare for
waterworks throughout the two hours.What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay
that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more
accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the
masterpiece Mary Poppins----even if the entire world knows that with
the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Kelly Marcel and
Sue Smith weaved out an engaging story full of crisp dialogue and
skillfully avoids becoming too overblown or too overdramatic. And
whenever the movie gets close to being all-out depressing, we get
treated to humorous moments here and there to keep the audience in
check.In a movie about artists that are addicted to their craft, you need
actors that work with the same type of fervor. Emma Thompson despite
not getting top billing gets the most screen time, gets the toughest
job, and delivers the ultimate performance. She becomes very dislikable
and yet sympathetic at the same time, and it is impossible to see
anyone other than Thompson deliver this type of impact. Tom Hanks in an
Oscar-baiting year does a superb job portraying the icon planet Earth
knows and loves as he gives Walt Disney a humanized performance that
separates the flawed man from the myth the Disney Company has
feverishly worked to this day to protect. The rest of the cast does not
disappoint, and we even see Colin Farrell potentially impress some
Academy voters as the loving yet extremely defective father figure.Disney's protection of its brand is the sole reason why Saving Mr.
Banks could never ever ever ever ever ever be produced or made by
anybody else. But luckily for all viewers, Disney doesn't pull back
many punches in delivering the story behind the complex and conflicted
making of Mary Poppins. It will be deep in the Golden Globes and the
Academy Awards but ultimately indeed deserves the praiseÂ—even if you
won't see all the details behind the true story on screen.
