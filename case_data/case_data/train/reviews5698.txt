An Autotuned Mess

This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson's voice is auto-
tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn't good. Each time the Beast
popped up, he was very off putting. Watson's line deliveries are poor
and doesn't do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit too
young for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast's CGI, at
least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince
compared to Watson. Emma Thompson's rendition of Tale as Old as Time
does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned
to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by
frame copy to the animated film. It's very uninspiring and unnecessary.0/10.
