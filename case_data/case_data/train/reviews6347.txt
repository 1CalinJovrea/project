Rust and Bone: A Disturbing, Emotional Roller Coaster Ride

Rust and Bone follows the story of Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), a single
parent struggling to provide for his young son, Sam, who develops a
relationship with Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), a killer whale trainer,
which grows stronger after she suffers a horrible accident.Rust and Bone is a film that opened in limited release this past
weekend and recently received a nomination for the Golden Globe for
Best Foreign Language Film. It is carried mainly by the performances of
its two stars, Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts, both deliver
excellent performances filled with emotion and heart break as their
relationship goes through its ups and downs throughout the film. The
story is very unpredictable and does a great job of getting the
audience to invest in these characters and getting the audience to
sympathize for them as the film progresses.However, be warned, Rust and Bone is hardly a film for the faint of
heart. Our heroine endures a devastating injury that is depicted and
shown afterwords several times throughout the film. On top of that, the
film contains several rather bloody kick boxing sequences that may
intrigue some of the male audience into possibly going to check this
film out. Also, the actors speak French as English subtitles are
displayed on the bottom of the screen.All this being said, Rust and Bone is a truly excellent picture that
features great performances and an unpredictable story. If you're
looking for something a little more than just your average romantic
date night movie, I would definitely recommend checking this one out.
