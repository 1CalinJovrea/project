A real surprise and touching ending to this romantic thriller

Director Lasse Hallström pulls off a surprise ending to this otherwise
seemingly ordinary romantic thriller; in doing so, he redeemed what
would otherwise have been a movie not worth a mention. Sure, the movie
is sweet for the most part and the dramatic moments are nothing to brag
about, but Hallström has been hiding the real love story all along;
when it's revealed in the last scenes, we ask ourselves, how could I
have not seen this and then you melt. But you do have to stick it out
to the end. I don't wish to spill the beans so I'll keep mum about it.
I understand some viewers are not going to be interested in the movie
because of the cast, but the director's following is not without merit;
after all he delivered Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Chocolat and Cider
House Rules, and it's his uncanny ability to tell a story like no
others is what made me want to watch the movie.
