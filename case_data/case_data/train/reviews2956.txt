I just turned 30

Is it OK if I want to see for my entertainment dollars attractively
thin, leggy, miniskirted women in either nice/kind/classy or action
films?Not everyone has to be me or like me but when I watch a movie I want
fantasy, I want to dream, I want beauty, I want mini skirts or micro
skirts. I want a girl with long hair who smiles.So the first ghostbusters had a heroine who fulfilled those conditions.
Now the women are repulsive, they are angry, they are anti-male and the
ghosts... hahahaha they looked like they want to call their agents and
get out of this picture. The evil character who is launching his scheme
was just not evil.What is Hollywood thinking? Ah, it's not. It is instead committing
suicide.
