Not a masterpiece for sure, yet enjoyable

If you don't have any expectations, this film might surprise you a bit.
I really liked the special effects, even if I started laughing when I
first saw the antagonists. Most scenes between battles were quite awkward, full of clichés. Yet,
once the battle begins, any cliché this film might have is really fun
to watch and not at all annoying. What I hated the most was the unfortunate English accent... used during
the Song dynasty (960-1279). Overall, the plot is quite linear and simple and is centered around one
important moment. Character development was welcoming, but not
impressive and definitely not unexpected. The best part was not
fulfilling the love sub-plot, even though I half expected this and I
would have been really disappointed if it had happened. Anyway, it was an enjoyable film with better 3D effects than I expected
and many other films, so give it a try. But be open minded and admire
what is to be admired.
