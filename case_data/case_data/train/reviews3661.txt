I am broke

I ve heard good things about Logan,spider man hc,guardians 2.And they
all turned out pretty good for me in different ways.Logan is the first hero movie that made me cry.Yondu's death had a huge
emotional impact on me(even more than superman's death in BvS).That
huge twist about vulture being Liz's.And now this spectacular Thor
movie.I am broke now,thanks to you marvel:).After this movie,the hulk grew on me so much.Finally they gave him some
personality.Loki,Hela both were pretty good.Easter eggs were
surprising.Both funny and emotional at the same time.They showed the devastating
events in Ragnarok pretty well.You should definitely watch this movie in 3D,visuals were also amazing
