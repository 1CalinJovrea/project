Unbelievable garbage... Just unbelievable...

It's funny that Paul Anderson has been keeping this series up for over
a decade and he still doesn't know anything about making even a decent
movies. He hasn't learned anything and he doesn't have any vision or
skills. The Final Chapter is full of clich√©s, shitty special effects,
shaking cameras, stupid camera angles that change every second and
brainless script without any logic. It's simply unwatchable. One of the
worst movies i've ever seen, and i've been watching movies for
decades...Paul Anderson, stop. Just stop, OK? You clearly have no idea how to
make good action movies. Go clean streets or something.
