Beautiful.

While I haven't really been a fan of western pictures since 3D replaced
2D, Zootopia won me over with its incredible charm and quirky setting.
The humour and animation were on point - and I found the characters
extremely likable, to the point I could easily overlook the somewhat
predictable plot.Worth every star it earned on this site.
