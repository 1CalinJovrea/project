Mirror Mirror: a worn out classic transformed into a hilariously unexpected story of misfits, outcasts, and, of course, love.

I don't know what movie everyone else went to, but I thought Mirror
Mirror was fantastic. I was laughing throughout most of the movie, and
I think that was the point. It's a fairy tale. It's not supposed to be
taken seriously. The twisted fairy tale plot was entertaining and
adorable. The idea of Snow White teaming up with a group of renegade
dwarfs was hilarious. If anyone said they saw that coming (without the
the help of a trailer) they were lying. I am a huge fan of Tenth
Kingdom, so the similarities made me laugh. The ending was absolutely
perfect. In every way. I didn't see the twist at the end until a few
minutes before, but it still wasn't an "oh, I totally saw that coming."
Also, I loved Snow's character development. There comes a time when you
have to be your own hero and stand up for yourself and others. My
sister and friend were a little weirded out by the dancing and singing
at the end, but I thought it was great. A classic ending for a
Bollywood romance film: a wedding and a dance. It was so funny.
Definitely random, but funny. Overall, I really, really liked this
movie. If you want a lighthearted story and a good laugh, this movie is
for you. :)
