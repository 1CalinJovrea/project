Sometimes we're too quick to see men as monsters

This film comes right after the hysteria generated by the Jimmy Saville
abuse scandals and the revelations about pedophilia within the Catholic
Church.Suffice to say it is refreshing and pertinent to see a story about the
damage that can be caused to an innocent man, by a false report. We
live in a society that is increasingly insecure and paranoid about
pedophilia, rape and abuse. Virgin Airlines won't allow a man to sit
next to a child who is traveling alone. Men are given funny looks in
playgrounds. Mothers are reported to social workers when they give
their screaming kids a slap in public.This film demonstrates the danger that comes from that hysteria and
reminds us all that children, for whatever reason, do not always tell
the truth. The consequences are brutal and made all the more realistic
by a stellar cast of actors. I give props to the young actress playing
Klara, the girl who makes the false accusation, she was fantastic.Distressing, highly emotional, but unlike an American movie, never
over-bearing in its sentimentality, minus one or two slightly clich√©
metaphors in the dialogue. It makes you empathize with all the
characters, not just the protagonist and really makes you think about
what you would do if you found yourself, or someone you loved, in that
situation.
