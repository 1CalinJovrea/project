Inside out

But that title was already taken. Also Room is pretty accurate and hits
"home" (no pun intended). But while I had no idea what I would get with
this (apart from the title and the lead actress I didn't know one piece
of information), most will go into this knowing what it's about. The
general idea is explained fairly quickly, though the why of the closed
space or rather location and the reason for staying might take a while
to sink in.If you already know some of the whys because of the trailer or reading
the story, don't be afraid though. The movie moves forward and it does
not stay stagnant at all. That is true regarding the story, but the
characters have some other issues to solve. Talking about solving, you
won't get all the answers for this, but this is a pretty good and
strong depiction psychologically speaking of what persons go through,
without getting into their heads. Great acting and drama make this a
great movie ... if you like the genre that is of course.
