Pretty funny, great story all can relate to no matter your age or sex.  NOT a romance.

I caught an advance screening of this last night. The theater was close
to being packed with men, woman and children. The movie was
surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing.
The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were
various times I felt bad for De Niro's character, but he was optimistic
and didn't let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of
instances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is
one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in
that circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We
had De Niro's aspect as well as Hathaway's. Good storyline. The
"Intern" group of guys were funny too. I'd see this again.
