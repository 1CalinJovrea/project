Review--Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit/ Night Film Reviews

January is my least favourite month for new movies. By this time of 

year, Hollywood studios are focusing much of their attention on the 

Sundance Film Festival, looking to acquire hidden gems, potential 

blockbusters and, and marvelous new indies. These films are generally 

purchased for next to nothing, and then marketed and released 

throughout the summer and fall months with the hope that they might 

land a huge profit. With that being said, while Hollywood runs around 

securing their paychecks for the upcoming year, the rest of their 

unwanted, formulaic, and clichéd roster is leftover for audiences in 

January. Now let me be the first to tell you, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 

is no exception to this formula. Using the star-power of Chris Pine's 

Stark Trek franchise charm, to faded out female leads like Kiera 

Knightley, and ex-Marvel super director Kenneth Branagh (Thor), Ryan 

becomes a shady, old, and tiresome relic of the glorified days of the 

once cool Tom Clancy character. This was one film project we wish 

stayed in the deep dark corners of Hollywood's unproduced films, but 

like much of the industry's obsession with rehashing established 

characters and modernizing them for current audiences, the film is a 

complete decomposed mush of ideas. Shadow Recruit is an overly-flashy, 

glossed over disaster. Failing to recruit any kind of originality in 

it's storytelling and script, it becomes a non-operational feature with 

actors who are clearly cashing in to a well established iconic 

Hollywood character.



The Jack Ryan character, made famous previously by Alec Baldwin in The 

Hunt for Red October, Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and 

Present Danger and Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears came out well 

before all the Ethan Hunt's and Jason Bourne's of its time. What 

differentiated Ryan from all the super-human covert agents, was his 

ability to be the closest thing to an average, everyday superhero. Mind 

you, in his newest entry in the film world, Ryan seems to have his fare 

share of dumb luck a lot of the timeall the time actually.



The film was supposed to be released on Christmas Day 2013, instead, 

due to an overcrowded array of blockbusters and late-entry Oscar 

caliber films, Shadow Recruit opted for an early 2014 slot where it 

seems to fit in much better.



Pine plays Jack Ryan, who we first see attending the London School of 

Economics in England. After a fateful September day in New York City 

(I'm sure you can guess which day I'm referring to, especially since 

all terrorist inspired spy-plots these days revolve around, if not hint 

at this historic day), Ryan pursues a career as a United States Marine. 

Wounded in action, Ryan oddly gains the attention of CIA agent Thomas 

Harper (Kevin Costner). Ryan's intellectual expertise and Marine 

instincts, along with Harper's experience in the agency, the two team 

up to bring down an elaborate economic scheme that will leave the 

United States in a Second Great Depression. Plunged into the world of 

Wall Street as an analyst, Ryan unnoticeably navigates the corrupt 

underworld of financial markets, which inevitably leads him on a place 

to Russia and face-to- face with Victor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). 

Between navigating the Russian crime world, a life of espionage and the 

annoying and overbearing requests of his girlfriend Kathy Muller 

(Knightley), Jack is tested physically and mentally as he is left with 

the fate of the US economy resting on his shoulders.



Throughout the course of his mission, time and again Ryan begin to lose 

faith in his ability to come through a hero, and frankly so do we. The 

blame can't all be put on Pine, who really does his best with material 

that seems D.O.A once it hits the screen. Unfortunately, Ryan doesn't 

actually accept his mission and take on the bad guys until his female 

love interest is put in the mix and inevitably endangered, which let's 

be honest, makes for a cowardly and unmotivated super-spy.



The film tries its best to round out a cast that is engaging, 

meticulous and somewhat ironic to the overall Jack Ryan canon. Costner, 

who mentors Pine as the current Ryan, was first offered the role of 

Ryan back the late 80′s, but declined to star in Dances With Wolves, 

which earned him two Oscars. Knightley, who seems to be floating under 

the radar rather than on the it these days, clearly took the role to 

get her face back in the mainstream spotlight, especially since her 

descent into independent feature film fame has not planned out as well 

as she would have liked since her blockbuster days in the Pirates of 

the Caribbean franchise. Branagh, who couldn't resist adding another 

cultural character reference to his filmography, offers a typical 

Russian villain with a laughable accent and unintentionally uproarious 

one-liners. Either way you look at it, from the lazy one-sheet with the 

exhausted catch-phrase "Trust No One", to the overused black/orange 

colour scheme on the theatrical poster, Shadow Recruit doesn't seem to 

have much faith in itself, much like the character Pine plays.
