...i choose to see this movie as being misunderstood by fans of the comic...

i see all the fans of the iron-man comics are all heated up and gave
this movie very lukewarm reviews and meanwhile most critics liked it. i
think i know why...you see...once upon a time i was a huge fan of comic
books and iron-man was one of my favorites. as i recall the main gripe
i have and every comic fan out there is that they really did injustice
to the main villain, if you've read the comic then you'll understand.even though i use to be a comic book fan, i am also a movie fan too! i
see this movie in the same light that the critics do and i would
actually give this movie an 8. you see, if you just ignore the huge
change they made to the main villain compared to the comic, then the
movie stands up very well on its own.come on people, how can you not like a movie with a cast including :
will sadler, miguel ferrer, rebecca hall, guy pearce, robert downey
jr,don cheadle and more and everybody looked like they were having fun
doing this movie. besides that you also have a very strong message
about private corporation sponsored custom made terrorists. that is a
very real and scary threat, all you need is one big nut-job in a high
position to do so.the special effects are worth a mention, they were spectacular and for
people that said it was slow and not enough action, i say phooey, it
had as much as the previous two and the pacing i felt was better also.the movie had a nice intelligent script and very competent actors and
if you are a fan of twists in movies, this one has a few.so...all you iron-man comic book fans have to try to cool off and watch
this movie and see and relate to it as a movie and then give your
opinion. for me personally, this is the 4th time i've watched the movie
and unlike the other comic book movies this one seems to get better
with every viewing.if you were to leave the comic book fans out of the voting( there is a
lot of them it seems ) and just leave it to the critics and fans of
movies then this movie would at least be an 8 on IMDb.
