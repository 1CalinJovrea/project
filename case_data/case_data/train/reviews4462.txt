A Powerful Spectacle

I didn't find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly the best
thing the Wachowskis have ever done. I'm not sure how the directing
duties were distributed, so I'll uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons there, but I
don't often leave a film adaptation wanting to read the novel
afterwards, as I did after seeing this.Visually stunning, epic in scope, a strong score; the sort of film that
you're constantly amazed was ever made and happy it was. Equal parts
comedy, romance, thriller, and dystopian speculative fiction, it really
is an astounding mix of disparate elements. The biggest overall failure was definitely some of the make-up effects
- trying to turn Doona Bae into a believable red-headed Caucasian woman
was simply distracting - but the overall art & sound design was
incredible.If I could turn channels while watching TV and switch between stories
and narratives as seamlessly and as deftly as the editing in Cloud
Atlas, it would honestly be hard to go back to simply watching one show
at a time.Truly a marvel of multitasking on so many levels. Great stuff.
