Another İstanbul

As the the first movie was awesome,we were looking forward to watch
this movie.But when the film was over we were terribly disappointed.I
don't know where to start telling the nonsense of the scenes which were
shot in İstanbul.First of all Turkey(Türkiye) doesn't have a
border(looks like a car park barrier) with Albenia.Also Albanians
doesn't have a relation with prostitution as the Turkish people are not
tortures as well.I think it's about the film maker's point of view to
Türkiye. The police cars in the movie were 1980 models and they are now
exhibiting in Tofaş museum.Our police cars are recent as our
buildings.But there is a huge difference between the buildings in the
movie and the buildings in İstanbul.Director was focused in the old
İstanbul called Historical Peninsula and in this area there are so many
ancient buildings bazaars and mosques. In modern İstanbul most of the
women does not wear veils as the men in İstanbul doesn't have beards
like pilgrims. In conclusion İstanbul is not this,Turkish people are
not these.Albanians are not these.
