A thriller with a surprise!

I picked this movie without prejudice, as I hadn't heard a word about
it. And I loved it!!!The tempo is sustained, the performances outstanding. An interesting
story with a twist, well written, and the perfect cast. One element that also enhances the movie: its diversity. Multi-faceted
characters which gives spice to the story's meat.The only downside: the way love is given a bad name. How do you want
the youth to connect if you keep telling them that love ain't the
sh*t?? It is a recurrent theme in 21st century cinema that i condemn,
because it perpetuates mechanic sex--humans deprived from feelings. I
am for a little more optimism in that domain and the human species.My 2cents; LM ARNAL
