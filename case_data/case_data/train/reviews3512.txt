loved it

well i loved it. one of my fave movies that i will likely end up
watching again. i loved all the characters, they were all well acted
and interesting, each had their own interesting story and it blended
well with everyone. even Austin who was my least fave was still
likable. it wasn't as predictable as i thought it'd be either, i
thought she'd get back with Austin for the kids sake so i wasn't
expecting a divorce. i loved the chemistry between Reese and Pico (just
not the close up snogging scenes) the kids were cute too. there were
some funny parts)the only thing i didn't like was the idea a bloke could cure anxiety
issues, that's not sending out a great message for those who don't look
as pretty as Reese. the ending just sort of threw me and i was a bit confused as it didn't
wrap up the story lines. it annoys me when films do that
