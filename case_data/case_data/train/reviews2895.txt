I liked it ...

This is my first review on IMDb ever ... I am not even an amateur
critic.The movie is almost completely dialogue. If you want an action flick or
YA humour look elsewhere.Everyone did a great job of creating a unique character. And the
characters interacted in a variety of interesting ways. And it was all
realistic though exaggerated as all movies are.As always I loved Tina Fey, and found Jane Fonda interesting in her odd
but very good acting technique and presentation.It was, in a word, poignant.I recommend it.
