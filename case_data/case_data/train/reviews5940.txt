A Must See.

What a Brilliant movie. We saw this on the night of the World Premiere,
intense and packed full of fabulous acting... The camera shots were
absolutely spot on, and you couldn't look away for a second without
missing a perfect scene. The entire score, coupled with the dialogue
and videography made this film and I cannot wait to see it again.
