Better than Argo

I've seen all the reasons viewers (and some critics) dislike this film,
but in my opinion it is infinitely superior to ARGO in its authenticity
and dramatic quality. The final scenes, when the SEAL team, goes into
Ben Laden's house, are brilliantly rendered. The idea of doing it
mostly in the dark with flashes of illumination by "night vision" green
is a brilliant touch, which most directors would never have attempted. The performances by Jessica Chastain, of course, Jason Clark and
Jennifer Ehle are top drawer and the torture scenes, while brutal, are
necessary--because that's the way it happened. Congratulations to
Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal for getting it right.I don't want to put the knock on Argo, because I found it entertaining.
But it's artificiality provides a distinct contrast with Zero Dark
Thirity's authenticity, and authenticity wins.
