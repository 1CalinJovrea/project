Dark, Exciting Dracula Story since Bram Stoker's Dracula!

This story gives us something new to watch and keeps you on your toes
on what's going to happen next. One of the best Dracula/vampire movies
of all time. I'm a huge fan of all these type of movies and I feel that
they did an amazing job bringing Dracula to life and a character that
actually makes you fear him. Costumes in this movie are very well made,
and the actors and actresses did a great job in the movie. I hope
enough people feel the same way about this movie so we get more movies
like this back to the classic horror movies instead of senseless
slasher movies with no plot! Don't listen to negative feedbacks, be
your own critic and this is worth taking the risk to find out for
yourself.
