Meh...the marketing was good.

Seth McFarland did not hit it out of the park with this one. I was
actually disappointed. The writing was just not all that creative.
McFarland's overly gratuitous potty humor simply didn't carry the film
from start to finish. I appreciate Blazing Saddles-type humor and this
wasn't that caliber..or even close. Less is more, Seth.I felt Charlize Theron and Liam Neeson were the only redeeming actors.
Sarah Silverman is caustic as usual and Amanda Seyfried was anemic.
Neil Patrick Harris played Barney Stinson a la 1882. The locations were
scenic and the sets were believable.Wait for this one to be on TBS on a rainy Sunday while you nap on the
couch. One man's opinion...
