Real fact, Thatcher time

"The Prime Minister wants the world to see how this country deals with
terrorism" And the world saw it. The film is not bad, it has some
tension but we know in advance everything that will happen so we can
not talk about suspense, everything is predictable. Personally, I would
have liked to be more dynamic, more spectacular. No acting performance
out of the ordinary, all actors just do their job to get their pay.
