Walking around, more walking, oh and did I mention walking?

I was excited to see this movie after reading the synopsis a couple of
days before the screening. As the title of this summary suggests, there
is a lot of walking in this movie. The story starts out semi promising
with you wondering what happened to the earth but ends up being the
walkiest and least talkiest movie I've ever seen. I know those aren't
words but goddammit they get my point across. The main actress is forgettable, Jason Momoa, Jim Carrey, and Keanu
Reeves were miscast or maybe it was just the bad script? Possibly both?
Back to the walking part, with minimal dialogue and no action
whatsoever, this movie becomes a student film really quick. What I mean
is that they don't cut out all the walking around and other useless
scenes that should have obviously been taken out. There isn't really a story, it's sort of tried to take elements from
Mad Max and other post apocalyptic films that are much better than it
and hope the audience notices and doesn't care or doesn't notice at
all.My suggestion: don't see it unless you want to be bored to death.Seen at TIFF 2016.
