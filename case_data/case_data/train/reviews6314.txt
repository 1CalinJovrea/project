Really something else then expected

This is in many ways a good, strange and different film, it is a zombie
film, but not in the way you would expect, this is a drama about a dad
finding and taking care of his daughter in her last days of an illness.
The illness being she is turning into a zombie after she got bit and
everything is treated in this film as it is just a terminal disease,
there is no cure, there is a time frame, there is some signs to what is
happening, but in the end you can't survive it.It is a slow moving drama and really is the storyline and the
characters and their interactions that is the film, we are talking a
time frame of a week or so and we mainly follow Maggie and her dad and
how they try to spend their last days together. We are slowly but
steadily introduced to the plague that have been turning people into
zombies and how people with the disease are being treated and
eventually put away, because there is no cure, if you are bit, there
are only three ways of going on, go to the camps where the rest of the
zombies are kept, get some kind of shot that will kill you in a
excruciating way or take the life of yourself by shooting, breaking
your neck or other means.It is a heartfelt movie that you really can't stop watching even though
the story moves slowly ahead and it is not like any other zombie movie,
it is insightful and interesting and really shows some aspects of life
that has nothing to do with becoming a zombie, it could have been about
any other terminal illness that can't be cured, but the zombie part is
just a great twist to it all.I was entertained and thoughtful after seeing it, it was really
something other then I had expected.
