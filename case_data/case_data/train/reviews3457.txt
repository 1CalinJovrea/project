Read spoilers before watching the movie!

This is one of the few movies where reading the spoilers beforehand
will actually improve your viewing experience. So if you haven't seen
the movie yet, keep reading and then watch the movie! ###Spoilers###This movie is all style, and no substance. It is about "feeling
feelings" of something important going on, its about eternal love in a
way, about cosmic fate, maybe a little bit of afterlife mythology
and/or simulation theory sprinkled in. But don't keep your hopes up!
There will be no resolution whatsoever. If you are looking for some
kind of revelation at the end, you will be as disappointed as I was.But now you know, so you can watch the movie, enjoy the scenes, the
beautiful actors and the sparkling atmosphere for what they are (style
over substance), and don't feel betrayed when you find out that all
those threads were never meant to lead you anywhere.Best of luck!
