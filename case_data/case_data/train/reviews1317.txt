Bad movie

Mila Kunis plays a hard working mom with two kids. She juggles her work
life which involves endless meetings and working extra hours even
though she only works part time with her family life of getting the
kids ready for school, doing their homework, picking them up for school
and taking them to various activities as well as shopping and cooking.We are not sure where the dad fits in all this, he appears to be a slob
with an interest in internet porn.No one takes her seriously and when she throws her husband out she
falls out with the bullying head of the PTA played by Christina
Applegate.Mila along with two other mothers, one who is timid, the other a
slovenly herself join ranks and indulge in some bad behaviour of
drinking, partying and attracting men.This puts them on a collision course with Applegate who treats the PTA
as her very own fiefdom.The film is marketed as a gross out comedy centred on females, a bit
like Bridesmaids. It just comes across as wretched and unfunny. The
writing is atrocious. You have a head of PTA threatening to sack school
staff and doing illegal things yet no one seems to notice even if it is
common assault in front of witnesses.It just shows what a poorly contrived mess the whole film is.
