A so/so movie with an incredible ending!!!

I gave it 4 stars only because I'm rounding up from the 3.5 it probably
deserves. The first hour and a quarter the movie was cheesy and with
horrible lines ("you nicknamed my daughter after the loch Ness
monster?) but in my opinion the acting was at least better than the
rest. The CGI of the baby and little girl was so horrible I was
actually embarrassed for the actors in the scenes who couldn't have
known during shooting how silly they would look interacting with it. It
was simply awful.Now, what saves the movie is the last 20 minutes. I thought it was an
incredible twist only truly able to be appreciated by readers of the
books. I bet it made Stephanie Meyer wish she wrote it that way. It was
fun to experience the audiences astonishment as events unfolded... And
to be honest, I wrestled with my own unexpected feelings as I watched
it. In the end though, those last 20 minutes and the great performance
(as usual) by Michael Sheen saved the movie from being a wasted night.
In fact, the last 20 minutes alone ALMOST makes me want to see it
again.
