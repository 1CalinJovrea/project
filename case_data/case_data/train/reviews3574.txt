Boring and predictable

Boring and predictable, but not at the same time. The first 80 minutes were about as exciting as watching paint dry. No
one could have predicted the film could be that uneventful for that
long.Then it got predictable. All the stuff you had been waiting for finally
happened. 15 minutes of Luke warm action that you thought would happen
earlier in the movie finally trickles out. Then, just as the last moments of the film arrive, a surprise ending!
Which, instead of being sprung on you hoping to leave a lasting
impression, is instead gradually introduced so that 30 seconds later
the big reveal is now a tepid event that you caught onto 28 seconds
ago, 29 if somehow your brain hadn't turned off before that and taken
the extra second to wake up. This movie will make you wish for the time of analog TVs, when you
could tune to a non- station and just watch static.
