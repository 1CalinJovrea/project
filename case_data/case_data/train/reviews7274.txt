Better than I expected

I was a little bit skeptical about watching this movie and I came very
close to not watching it. But, because I had a spare couple of hours
with nothing better to do, I decided to give it a whirl.A lot of modern-day horror movies are made on a budget. The typical
tell-tale signs which give them away is the use of poorly lit sets,
very few filming locations and a very small cast of young and unknown
actors. They like to follow the path of "The Blair Witch Project" and
rely on heavy breathing to create the suspense. A pretty young lady
starts to breathe heavily in the dark, something jumps out and gets
her, right? Nowadays, this has become the norm and this is what we come
to expect.Well, I'm pleased to say that "House at the End of the Street" is
different and unique in its own right. Why? Because its actually got a
storyline and it keeps you thinking! Just when you think you've figured
it all out there's another clever twist that comes along and makes you
think "Gee, why didn't I think of that". This is a movie which is
always one step ahead of you! Also, the actors in this movie actually
act. Don't get me wrong, it's not on the same page as an Alfred
Hitchcock movie, but it is, nonetheless, very refreshing."House at the End of the Street" turned out to be a little gem. I'm
glad that I rented it.
