BRAWL = WTF! Give me MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Let me allay any fears this movie is lame, as stated by a couple
reviewers here. Their opinions here are extremely inaccurate. With that
being said....Vince Vaughn is a shining star in this brutally violent, perfectly
paced story, with a descent into a hell only his character can
navigate. The movie is rare in that it's not slow, boring or overdone.
Each piece is compartmentalized on purpose, to guide the audience to
the climax. There isn't a big list of elite A list actors, huge musical
score, tons of CGI, no. What you have here is director's genius,
visualizing the journey from A-Z in a way that will captivate you. You
will not want the movie to end. I do think this is a turning point for Vaughn, as I only usually see
him in romantic movies or comedies. He's truly found his spirit here
and I hope it leads him to similar roles. He plays it in a way you've
never seen him. Try to imagine Tom Hanks playing a man without a care.
It's that hard to wrap your head around. Don Johnson shines as a degenerate warden and the small cast of
characters scattered throughout the movie play key roles in the makeup
of the plot; all done to perfection.Trust me y'all, you DON'T want to miss this one, it will have you
begging more for more, guaranteed! So much face smashing destruction is
actually a delight. I will not spoil a single thing, go see
it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
