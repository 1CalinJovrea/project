Cookie-cutter, albeit beautiful, slice of Disney cheese

Tell me if you've seen this movie:Princess wants to do something a parent doesn't want her to do. Close
friend/relative inspires her to be/do it anyway. Princess meets wacky
sidekick. Prince and wacky sidekick don't get along but are forced to
work together. Princess and wacky sidekick bond. Conflict happens and
princess and wacky sidekick part ways. Princess continues on. Wacky
sidekick shows up out of nowhere to help princess. Princess and wacky
sidekick win, become friends forever. Parent realizes they were wrong,
encourages princess to be/do whatever.I felt like I already knew the plot to this film because I had seen it
100 times before. Why didn't I rate it lower? Because it's visually
stunning. The style of this film is very unique and I like the way they
wove Samoan artistic sense into it. I found myself mesmerized at the
water effects and the animals more than anything else.Fun for kids, but nothing you haven't seen before.
