If I was your age I would date you.

Ashley (Olivia DeJonge) on her way to college does a final babysitting
gig for Luke (Levi Miller) who is "almost a teen." Luke is seriously
crushing on Ashley as he helps defend her in a home break-in that has a
wicked twist.I enjoyed the film, although there was room for improvement. Acting was
decent. Most likely won't become a Christmas classic. Has some cultish
aspect to it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.
