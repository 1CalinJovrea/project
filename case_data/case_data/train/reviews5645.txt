The Emperor is well and truly naked

Utter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the
most boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story.
Leonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar
for Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to
act. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit
in a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed
to be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round
the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's
character, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved,
dehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and
rides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.
