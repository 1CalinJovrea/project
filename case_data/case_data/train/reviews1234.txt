Unbearable. The $20m budget was for paid reviews.

Awful does not even begin to describe this mess of a movie. I am
absolutely gobsmacked by all the positive reviews here and on rotten
tomatoes.....Or maybe I live in an alternate universe? This is right up
there with overrated movies like Gravity and Inception.Anyone ever see South Park's ImaginationLand episode where they
interview Hollywood directors for ideas on how to stop terrorist from
taking over? They interview and dismiss one crap big time Hollywood
director after another until they got to Mel Gibson-who actually had an
idea that made sense...Then they conclude, "say what you want about Mel
Gibson, but he knows story structure".Whoever wrote and directed this pile of steaming garbage does not know
story structure.(Spoliers) Yea, the guy was crazy but that girl was so unlikable and
unbelievable. Absolutely NOTHING happens until the last 5 mins where it
suddenly switches gears and becomes a post apocolyptic sci=fi flick.
