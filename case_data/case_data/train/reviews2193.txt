Yes. YES. More, please!

Boy, was that a good film. Italian. Neo-noir. Dark. Masterfully shot.
Omnipresent debauchery and depravity of all sorts have rarely looked
this good on screen. What's not to love?! I have a soft spot for
Italian cinema of the good kind, and that leaves me constantly hungry
for more, considering the fact that except for Maestro Tornatore's
magnificent opus the last few decades have been... Well, disappointing
to say the least. Enter Sorrentino (I firmly believe "La grande
bellezza" is one of the top 5 Italian films ever made, with "Youth" not
so far behind), and now Sollima too. The only reason to give "Suburra"
9 stars instead of 10 is the microscopically imperfect acting in a few
instances, but other than that the film is practically perfect. No need
for a wordy review, just go see it. It grips you by the innards and
doesn't let go. If you happen to be fluent in Italian and especially
the Roman dialect, that adds at least 30% more enjoyment. A big,
heartfelt THANK YOU to everyone who worked on this fantastic film!
