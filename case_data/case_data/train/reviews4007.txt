As a Jackie Chan movie it's great, as a thriller with action it's even better.

I knew ahead of time going in this movie was more about the story that
it was Jackie beating the crap out of goons (which I personally love to
see). Both Jackie and Pierce did very well in the respective roles,
Pierce's malice really shined through in the story while Jackie's
dramatic acting was very believable and really helped immersion. I was
impressed by the actions scenes as they were fitting and not ill
placed. Everyone added to the storyline and wasn't throw in there to
just to give us action. Even though this doesn't fit the standard role
we usually see Mr. Chan in, he really brings depth to a story that
could have been shallow. If you're debating it, don't just watch it.
