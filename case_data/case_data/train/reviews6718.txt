An Insult to Mothers and Especially Fathers

Take films such as New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day, but remove any
continuity and romance, replacing it with an attempt at suburban farce
in a scene of mass parenthood and that describes What to Expect...the
only thing is I wasn't expecting such bad big budget, big cast film.
Yet, I should have known after seeing a turkey like New Year's Eve.The worst part of this film was something that liberal Hollywood loves,
from TV adverts to movies, the denigration of the American man.Talk about role reversal...according to this mess. all women do is have
kids...its the men that raise them, in tight knit groups...virtually
every guy in this group is totally henpecked and submissive to their
wives.The only decent romantic story line was that of a young woman who has a
miscarriage and misses out of the man she has longed to love...yet, her
story is relegated to mere brief sound-bites as the film jumps around
from couple to couple and always winding up back with the inadequate
group of chaotic husbands....a waste of time.
