Trailer trash will embrace the stupidity...

Who DOESN'T remember the original Vacation film? I hate crude humor
with a passion, but I could overlook the occasional innuendo or sex
joke because the original film stayed family-friendly for the most part
and never got too crass or offensive. Well, unfortunately it looks like
the 21st century is now casting its wave of stupidity across every
nostalgic family film, and Vacation gets it especially bad.This new Vacation film, starring the now grown-up Rusty Griswold,
wasn't funny, wasn't even remotely humorous, it was just disgusting and
pathetic. I was horrified by the number of parents bringing their
children to the theater to see this film. The scene with the cow's
insides exploding across a car? A little girl in the aisle in front of
me began to scream and cry and her parents ended up leaving with her. I
heard many adults saying "what the f*ck?" and just leaving out the
door. It was a nasty film, as if somebody took that Robin Williams RV
film, tossed it in a blender with a bad exploitation film and a few
episodes of that god-awful Family Guy show.Some people love fart jokes and pervy sex jokes (what's wrong with
humanity these days!?), but if you're going to see this film, whether
you're into crude humor or not, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR
CHILDREN. I don't understand why it was being marketed on the radio
station here as being a family film. It's the kind of film that drunk
college guys and rednecks will fall in love with.I bet it'll be The Goonies or Beetlejuice that gets wrecked by crude
sequels next. :(
