More Chucky than you can handle (?)

We get a direct sequel to the previous one (they all kind of build off
each other, Chucky movies that is), this feels just even tighter
knitted to the one a couple of years ago. Of course it has to do with
Fiona coming back replaying her role. Guess she hadn't had enough of
her father coming after her (her real father is the voice of Chucky, in
case you didn't know that).So while I thought the previous one was way funnier that it had any
right to be, this tries the same formula in a different setting. And
overall I'd say it succeeds. It's not as good as it's direct
predecessor, but if you don't mind the mixture of humor and horror, you
will be entertained with this too.
