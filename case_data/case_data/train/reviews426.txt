Worst film I have ever seen, does not even deserve 1 star.

Avoid this movie at all cost, it is the biggest waste of 1.45mins
Celebrity cameos will draw a lot of people in, but most of the real
famous people are killed in the first ten mins of the film starting.
The rest of the 90min film is downwards from there, It's not funny, not
interesting and is just plain awful. Has moments that will remind you
of Little Nicky, which itself is awful too, but even if you found that
movie entertaining in any way, its still a million times more awful.
Sometimes films are so bad it's funny, and this probably was the
purpose of the film, but it couldn't even do that properly, it was just
plain awful. This film was only made to get the stars on screen and try
to make it big at the box office, while celeb cameos and an OK trailer
will draw you in, don't be fooled, it truly is one of the most awful
films ever made. AWFUL!!!!!!!!
