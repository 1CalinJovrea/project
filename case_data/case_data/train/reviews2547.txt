If you're a fan, go and see it. If you're not, go and see it.

I have just seen the movie at an advanced screening. I'm writing here
because, somehow, there are already 34 baseless reviews from people who
haven't seen the film. I registered immediately to rectify that
situation.I was truly concerned that this movie wouldn't satisfy me as a fan.
Even though the accusations of whitewashing were baseless to begin
with, I was concerned that they may have westernized or washed out some
of the GITS flavour that I know and love. To me, this film was fantastic. I went in expecting to be disappointed
and I came out grinning ear to ear. I laughed as I watched Aramaki be a
down right bad ass. The relationship between Major and Batou was
freakin' spot on. There's a lot of philosophy to represent, and that's
not easy to do in a movie designed to capture and keep attention, but
they did it. The fan service was brilliant and I loved it. It was
visually stunning. The soundtrack was wonderful. Scarjo was an
excellent study of the Major. It was not tacky or clich√© at all. Please, do not listen to the inevitable vapid borderline insulting
"critiques" that you'll no doubt uncover by the various news media who
were targeted with pumping out a review for a movie they genuinely
don't give two shits about. This movie won't be for everyone. It's
scifi. It's intellectual. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But it's good. It's a classic. And I, for one, am genuinely gratified
and impressed. Good work.
