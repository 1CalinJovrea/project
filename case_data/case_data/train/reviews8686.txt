Nothing new here

So I knew nothing of this movie. Just saw it out of luck. Being a huge
fan of the horror/fantasy genre, I was caught by the synopsis, because,
hey, who doesn't love a good post apocalyptic drama involving family?
For a moment there, I saw myself on the hype train towards something
related to "10 Cloverfield Lane" or "The Survivalist", but what I got
was an extremely weak mix of both. While the idea is interesting on
itself, I'm afraid the development lacked originality throughout the
movie. If you are a seasoned horror/thriller geek like me, you saw that
ending coming a MILE away. I mean, really. Besides, they don't explain
the origin of the problem that apparently covers the Earth, or what
lead the characters to behave the way they did in the end. Its all left
to interpretation, and we're fed up with that. I wouldn't recommend
this movie. Sorry.
