Clever, dark and funny

The movie is actually 6 short films, all related by brutal violence
motivated by different situations. Family. Society. Government. It
works very well like that, lasting over 120 minutes that go by quickly.
It feels very fluid. Szifr√≥n's eye is very precise. You can tell
everything was very well thought. I wouldn't say this is a
philosophical film, but it is clever entertainment, that makes you
think if this wild tales are actually that wild... Even though this
stories are taken to the extreme, everything feels somehow possible
when you look back. Darkly humorous. Watch it.
