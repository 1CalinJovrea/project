Smart horror with depth and levels

I'm starting to see a trend develop in modern horror movies (the good
ones at least) and I really like it. Film makers are beginning to
realise that for horror to work there has to be some different levels
to the film. 90 minutes of watching people get killed isn't going to be
able to cut it anymore. You have to be able to make the audience laugh,
think and even move them emotionally. If you can do that then your film
will be a success. Earlier this year 'Get Out' pulled it off and now
'Happy Death Day' has nailed it too.When the opening logos featured a joke (literally in the first few
seconds of the film) I thought I may have misread the tone of the film
in the trailers. Turns out I had, but in a good way. It wasn't an
indication that the film was to be a laugh-fest, simply that it had
that layer to it. And the thing about the layers that the film
possesses it that every one of them works. Whatever it tries to pull
off it manages.The twists and turns and how crafty it is about concealing them truly
blew me away. At least three times I thought to myself such and such
element would be better if they'd done so and so, only to later find
out they did indeed have that up their sleeve the whole time. The film
is incredibly smart.I can't say enough good things about this film. The trailers won't give
a fair indication to people of what this film is truly capable of, and
so sadly I fear many who would love it will not get around to seeing
it. If you get the chance though please do see it. It's a fantastic
film and you won't be disappointed.
