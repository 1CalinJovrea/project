Don't waste your time!

This was a disappointing film in virtually all respects. Strained
acting, combined with a ridiculously unbelievable plot which was
heavily overacted throughout. Don't get sucked in by flowery reviews if
you are looking for an enjoyable, meaningful experience. This film
lacks substance, struggles to be funny, and isn't consistent with the
time frame that its set in. Rather it awkwardly tries to meld modern
themes into a time and place where they don't belong and likely didn't
exist! I'm 60 and grew up in Victoria so I have a pretty good idea. I
Strongly recommend you look elsewhere for some worthwhile viewing.
Maybe the late night movie?
