More timewasting rubbish from a dying Hollywood.

This was supposed to be a comedy. Yet, I never laughed once. In fact
after 15 minutes I was ready to turn it off but I thought I'd save
others the 15 minutes and warn people off watching this. So I watched
to the end. It was such dross that I now struggle to remember what
happened.Instead of comedy it should have been categorized under embarrassed. I
felt embarrassment for the director, the writers and the actors most of
all. The same embarrassment I felt when I watched "The Internship"(OMG
what a terrible movie) .The movie felt like something that you would see on YouTube. The acting
was terrible it was like a bunch of friends who decided to make a movie
for the laugh. I'm sure it made them laugh. It certainly won't make
you.
