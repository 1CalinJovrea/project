Good looking trash

The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography and the
special effects. The physics is glaringly wrong throughout the movie,
the technicalities are completely ignored, the characters act like
incompetent idiots, and the attempts at making them more human are
risible. What made Apollo 13 so good was the realism, attention to
detail, and focus on problem solving. Gravity has none of these.
Instead we get an idiotic, annoying mission commander who acts like a
mentally deficient drunk, and a ditzy engineer who is so incompetent at
being an astronaut that you have to wonder how she got past the
qualifying exam.
