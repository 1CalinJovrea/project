So Much Fun

This movie is outstanding. You know how when you are a kid you and your
brother throw over the toy bin and pull out dinosaurs, knights, tanks,
submarines, Lamborghinis, Transformers, GI Joe, Voltron, some LEGO
vehicles that can be disassembled and reassembled and a few Star Wars
space ships? Maybe your sister wants to play so somehow a Barbie ends
up in the mix. Then you have an absolutely epic battle with Knights
fighting space ships and LEGOs transforming on the spot to whatever you
want. Toys switch back and forth and fight for whoever is holding them.
Complete insanity ensues. The story makes no sense because it can't but
the battle is truly epic. Your brother grabs a chair and declares its
his planet and throws it at your toys so you throw the couch at his.
Finally your mom comes in and sends everyone outside, so you leave
every toy out and all the furniture turned over to clean up later.
Maybe your sister declares that Barbie just did something. That is this
movie! It has absolutely everything and makes about as much sense as it
can considering. This movie truly channeled second grade for me. I had
so much fun and I cannot wait to go back! Definitely watch in 3D and
try to watch in IMAX if it is available. Do not wait for it to come out
on DVD.
