Would have walked out if I had been alone

Interesting concept - the entirety of the interesting part can be seen
in the trailers. Save yourself both the money and an hour and a half of
your life.Once you get past the shock novelty of food talking and being
ridiculously raunchy the movie becomes pathetic, repetitive and dull.Bottom line- Should have been a 5 minute cartoon. Beyond that it is
really just a raunchy, garbage philosophy, amorality play - A vehicle
for the usual nihilistic liberal memes involving sexuality, romanticism
of hard drugs and atheism. I could forgive the vacuous leftist part if
the movie were genuinely creative and funny. It isn't. It is an Utterly
stupid, vacuous waste of time.
