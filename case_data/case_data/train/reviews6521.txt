What was the Point !!

If you want to know about the war, then watch the amazing 'World At
War' documentary series.If the point of this film was, as so many other reviews have said, to
demonstrate the carnage, pain and suffering or war, then why is there
no real context to any of the action.Why is Brad Pitt's body in one piece when the Germans explode 2
grenades at his feet, inside his tank.Why does a crack SS battalion continually commit suicide by walking in
front of the machine guns of the crippled tank (instead of walking
round the back) Why did the Yanks leave the spare machine gun ammunition on the outside
of the tank when preparing the ambush? I know, it was so Brad could
look heroic and get shot trying to retrieve it.The SS troops fired 2 or 3 RPG type rockets at the tank, caused damage
and killed one of the men, then stopped firing them.The premise of keeping the crossroads was ridiculous. Anyone could just
have walked through the adjacent fields if they wanted to get past.This film has pretensions of being a serious movie and the
cinematography/soundtrack etc. are very well done, but the whole thing
just lacks any reality or validity.
