Great "Edge-Of-Your-Seat" Film

I saw an advanced screening of this movie yesterday, and I was
absolutely blown away. I had hoped it would be a fun thrill-ride, but I
did not expect it to be as exciting and involved as it was.My favorite part of this movie, was the fact that it takes a plot that
is implausible, and makes it as plausible as possible. You can
definitely tell that the writers did their research on air marshals,
airplane mechanics, etc. There was not one moment in this film that I
was bored, and it was filled to the brim with twists, and turns.There definitely is a lot that went into this movie, and even though
it'll have you thinking more deeply about the security of airlines,
most of all it's just a really, really fun ride.
