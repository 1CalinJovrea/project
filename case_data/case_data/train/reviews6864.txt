Fast and Furious in Space

I was worried when Justin Lin was signed on to direct. I am not a fan
of the mindless Fast and Furious franchise with its ridiculous stunts
and silly plots. I gave him a chance, because after all, its Star Trek. What we got was Fast and Furious in space. Just running, fighting,
explosions, one frantic scene after another with no time to develop
characters, motivations, or even plausible Sci-Fi. It feels shallow, a
promising plot sacrificed to the alter of YA expectations. Another Star Trek movie where the enterprise is destroyed, again? Is
this sci-fi disaster porn now?The dialogue is forced, the banter off tempo, and in the end, the
actors talents and IP were wasted on what feels like a B movie.
