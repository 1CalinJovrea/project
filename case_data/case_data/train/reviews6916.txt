Excellent.

I saw the trailer for 'The Intern' sometime ago, advertised before 'Spy
(2015)'. I liked the premise and the two lead actors, so today (the
premiere in Romania) I had to watch it.I expected a fun, neat comedy but what I experienced was so much more:
a great plot, brilliantly executed and acted. The jokes and fun parts
were on point, and the world the movie created felt very authentic,
immersive and a joy to watch on the big screen - this was helped by
amazing costuming and cinematography.The entire cast had very strong chemistry between them, and both
Hathaway and De Niro were wonderful.Overall an awesome, heartwarming movie. I walked out of the movie
theater with a smile.
