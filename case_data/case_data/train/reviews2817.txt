Overrated movie lacking direction

This movie was built up by the trailers and I was actually excited to
see it. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring and not
worth seeing. How major movie critics almost unanimously gave this
movie positive reviews really makes no sense. Googling reviews for this
movie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on
"reputable" websites. The scores are overblown because people were
being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive
reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie. If you want
to watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you. The
emotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a plot that falls
apart like the memories in the movie. Unfortunately my memory of this
movie will remain.
