fun CGI romp with Matt Damon

i heard all the bad critique levied against this film, and it was
almost by accident that i wound up watching it.Matt Damon is a ruff n gruff explorer / mercenary in vaguely-
historical ancient china. He's come to find the secret of "the black
powder" (gunpowder), and soon finds himself captured by the Chinese,
and taken to The Great Wall.The fictitious Great Wall is .. kinda like the great wall, but if
Michael Bay had a go at rewriting it. Fireballs, explosions, and CGI
monsters quickly follow, along with much Wuxia fighting, an all- women
army, Willem Defoe in the part of "The Guy Who Speaks English", and the
very beautiful Tian Jing as the co-star of the film.I recently ripped apart the horrible Gods Of Egypt; well, this film
isn't too different, relying on CGI and over the top action to tell the
story, but fortunately TGW doesn't overdo it as much, and the end
result is something quite watchable and fun. The brief moments of
acting are quite passable. (the only critique i could raise to Damon,
is that he starts the film trying to play a different character, but
quickly returns to his typical Jason Bourne thing)The Great Wall is a fun CGI film with monsters. I would recommend this
popcorn film to anyone looking for an afternoon of fun, and since there
aren't any scenes with gore, or particularly scary stuff, it's OK for
families with kids as well.Good film. i like. 7/10 - it is what it is.
