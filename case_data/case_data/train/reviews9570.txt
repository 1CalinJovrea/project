Assassin's Greed For A Good Movie

OK, I love AC games and the whole AC universe. The first game was a bit
boring but thanks to Ezio's trilogy I learnt this wonderful world and
have been experiencing till today, in AC comics.And I found this movie such a generic borefest.This movie just took some tropes of AC universe, served 'em as a
mediocre fan service, through generic action scenes full of crappy CGI,
in a Madrid like AC 1's desert for some reason, and that's it. There
was no mystery, no interesting characters -except the black guy who I
do not even remember his name!- and the ost WAS TERRIBLE. This movie
even had three top actors and still, could not use'em well! Probably
that's why Fassbender went all out "crazy" in the only scene I memorize
from this crapfest. The script was so bad that came back & forth to
past & future without leaving room for characterization.I honestly have no reason to suggest this movie to anyone. Not even to
AC fans... The worst AC game or comic has more interesting story than
this... Let's just forget this snoozefest and hope that, if a sequel
will occur, will be with different characters, script and such.AAAvoid!/10Equally disappointing to WoW movie...
