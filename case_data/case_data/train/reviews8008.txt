The craft of film making at it's very best

I really loved this film. Right from the beginning, the music hall feel
of the unfolding drama was very engaging. Intelligent editing and the
fabulous script kept the pace of the plot at a rate which held my
interest from start to finish as each twist and turn was revealed. John
Kildare (Bill Nighy) was the methodical, steady influence which
balanced the emotional excesses of the other characters. He only showed
emotion when confronted with the inevitability of the fate of the
intelligent and articulate Lizzie Cree (Olivia Cooke). The film used
dramatic devices to great effect, showing several characters actually
committing the awful crimes as each became suspect. The interleaving of
the music hall version of the Lizzie Cree story with the live action
which somehow heightened the suspense by making you smile thus
relieving tension. The sets were a total joy, completely recreating
Victorian environments in very convincing fine detail. The cast were
superb, totally plausible and very engaging. Don't miss this fabulous
film, the craft of film making at it's very best.
