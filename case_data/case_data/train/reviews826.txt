A must see, and a vastly underrated movie.

No Escape is one of the best action/thrillers of recent times. It isn't
one of those movies that will be spoken about for years too come, but
we must give credit where it is needed.No Escape is a gripping, intense, cleverly put together movie. From the
beginning the movie sets us up with the motives of why the family is
moving and you feel connected with the main character Jack (Owen
Wilson)who just wants to do whats best for his family. Seeing and
loving, Owen Wilson is more comedic roles i didn't know how he would
fair up is this action pact thriller, but i must admit, there may be a
new genre around the corner and maybe another huge turning point in his
career, sending him among the greats.The film's writers have a lot to do with the success of this film, its
script never dumbs down for the viewers, it is a script of what people
would actually say and conversations that would actually happen in this
situation. It makes you feel for the characters in the film and helps
you to understand what is going on. You will feel apart of it. it
cleverly leaves out all of the irrelevant details, keeping viewers
guessing about what will happen next and how they will get out of a
very sticky situation, while the mayhem continues around our main
characters.No Escape hits the ground running and never takes its foot off of the
gas petal. Tensions are high and there is moments when you question how
they are going to get out of an outrageously dangerous, near impossible
situation. But it is not a movie where you feel as though the main
character will survive no matter what. There are times where his death
looks likely.No Escape is a strong emotional and physical battle for survival and
will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.7.5/10A must see, and a vastly underrated movie.
