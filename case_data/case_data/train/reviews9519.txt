8
A very worthy sequel, and it ties the story together.

This film I actually liked a lot. It is a sequel in ways and it has the
original actors from the original films in it too, which is a total
bonus. The movie links all the other Chucky movies together in its
plot. I was watching this and found myself flashing back to when I saw
the original movie, I had fun watching it, and I was quite surprised to
how good it actually was. There are some great cameo roles in it too
(not telling you who they are though). Like I said though, how it ties
the other movies together is very well done. If you are a fan of the
first movies, then you should like this movie just as much, I did. It
has some great bloody moments, and some cringe worthy moments also.
Also, keep watching after the credits, there is more to the story
there. I give this film an 8 out of 10.
