Better for the old souls, I guess

If you're a deep thinker and introspection is your thing, you are going
to thank God a movie like this came along as movies like this are so
few and far between. It's definitely better for mature audiences, as
in, they've lived a long time and are humble enough to see themselves
in it. It, seriously, should connect with everyone, but if you're young
and arrogant (as so many of us are when we're young,) the intense
realities will not have a place to go and, sadly as I read in so many
comments, the movie might be rejected. I encourage the haters to come
back and see it again in a decade or so. I'd love to be there for the
ah-hahs. My 19-year-old son is going to eat this one up, the old soul
that he is. I can't wait to hear what he has to say when he sees it.
