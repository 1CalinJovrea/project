Moving love triangle, leading to Armenian Genocide

Beautifully shot film, with intriguing intertwined love stories. Well
balanced between the protagonists narratives and the inevitable lead-in
to the Armenian Genocide, showing its impact on a very human level,
particularly on the story's leads.Those who provide a 1 star of 10 clearly are not actually rating the
film, but providing political feedback. How many who have rated it as 1
in 10 have actually seen the film? Doubt many have. Some of the rants
are a clear attempt at revisionist history to try to rationalize the
actions of the Ottomans. Sad part is that there really should be no
need for those rating that way to do so, since Turkey (which I know is
a denier) is not the same as the Ottoman Empire, and modern Turkey
(though less modern under Erdogan), and Turks, should feel no
compulsion to try to defend that Empire.Please use IMDb for the purposes for which it is meant, not to attack
for political purposes. It would be fair, for example, only once one
sees a film, to criticize it for being too political (though politics
are worthy of expression in film), or too one-sided, and explain why,
with examples.
