Michael Haneke's Sophie's Choice... or Stanley Kubrick's Happiness?!

Neither. This is a Yorgos Lanthimos joint all the way. But it's as
powerful and piercingly original as a work of the aforementioned
masters.The premise isn't as intriguing or clever as The Lobster, but the
execution, oh boy... is even better. A horrific black comedy, a
nail-biting thriller, and a compelling moral tale all at once. The
entire cast is superb, but Barry Keoghan will be a star. Between this
and Dunkirk, it's his year.Go watch it on the big screen. Experience it, then see it again, and
let its brilliance wash over you. I don't say this often, but to me,
this is an instant classic.
