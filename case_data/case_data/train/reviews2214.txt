I really wish I could love this movieÂ… but I don't

I have read all the books. Entertaining young adult novels, easy to
read and difficult to put down. Loved them even though I don't really
fit the age category being over 30 and a mother of teenagers. However,
I was looking forward to seeing the books come to life. I kept my
expectations down, but still, I'm sad to say I was so disappointed. I
really, really wanted to like the movie but it fell flat. I think it would have worked so much better as a TV-show, since the
books are really about characters, and in the limited time that a movie
has, there is simply no time to develop characters in the way the books
do. A whole lot of time goes in to explaining who is who and what and
why, and the story's twists and turns come too fast and doesn't have
any time to build up any suspension at all. I found myself getting
bored and wishing for the movie to end sooner than it did. It is such a
pity that it was not developed for TV instead.
