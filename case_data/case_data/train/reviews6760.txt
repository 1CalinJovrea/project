Ordinary, sweet & simple

This is a rather ordinary romantic comedy, but it does have some great
ideas, i.e. his smoking self that judges him in his endeavors, that is
a very good character, really like the voice inside your head advising
you to do or not do what you are about to.It is in short a romantic comedy about an author experiencing real love
for the "first" time, so his life is a romantic comedy and at the same
time he is writing a manuscript for a romantic comedy.It is very ordinary, sweet and simple with very few surprises, but it
is okay entertainment and have a lot of good scenes where he as "the
writer" puts himself into all the stories told by his friends etc.
