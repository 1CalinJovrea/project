The Great Shatzby

Genuinely awful movie. Watching Toby Macguire act is like watching a
mannequin that's realized its sentient but still chooses to do nothing
about it. The cinematography feels like the work of an overzealous
child. HEY LOOKS LETS GO ACROSS THE RIVER... WHOOOSH... HEY LETS GO
BACK ACROSS THE RIVER... WHOOOSH... LETS GO INTO TOWN... WHOOOSH...
LETS GO BACK HOME... ZOOOOM. I lost IQ points for sitting through that.
I'm secretly hoping that the unobtainable green light on the dock
represents the green light for all other future movies this director
wants to direct.The films only saving grace is that it ends.
