Pitiful, awful movie

I watched this on a plane ...what a joke...I am sick of the bogus
Boston accents too...Depp is bad, don't kid yourself.If you read the weasle confessions from the gang...you have the
story...they just seemed to act out what has been written in
newspapers....it starts with a bad script and no back story....everyone
is so in awe about Jonny Depp transformation from a dr√ªgged out punk
movie actor to a semi bald Bulger...please! It is holly weird they can
make anyone anything....bad movie, bad acting...go see a high school
theater group it will be more entertaining and much more talents.They miss out a lot on what really happened with Jimmy and southie, no
shakedowns, no Framingham aqueduct hit...lots missing. Seemed they just
rushed through it all and had no drama.
