Cute and will make you smile

I think we need more movies like this again. Haven't had enough
romantic comedies as of late and it's nice to just watch a comfortable
and light movie to escape. The friendships and family relationships in
this movie all made me smile. Don't get me wrong I love all types of
movies but it's nice to see a movie like this again that doesn't
include nudity, vulgar language and focuses on positive relationships.
There's so much cheap shock in movies and TV recently that this is an
actual feel good escape.
