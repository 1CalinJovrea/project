-Jet Li appeared for 5 minutes total and doesn't even fight (seriously?
Feels like he was kept in the movie (top-billed too!) just to lure
asians to watch it. Yes I'm an Asian.) -Action scenes are a yawn; all the been there done that. No suspense
whatsoever; it's even worse than a Micheal Bay film. -The climax fight was just 3 minutes tops and was like Stallone wasn't
even trying. -PG-13 violence; Christmas's knife stabs are now blood-less and bullets
are now made of rubber since nobody bleeds or spurts blood after being
fired upon by a minigun. Seriously? -The storyline is just a drag and dull; the worst in the series IMO.
The "young-bloods" in this movie are just plain unlikeable, arrogant
and disrespectful i.e. One of the young ones (I didn't even bother
knowing his character name) screamed at Stallone to shut up. Are these
kind of characters the ones we're supposed to like?-Banderas was just wasted and everyone hates his character. He was
supposed to be comic-relief, but instead he's just annoying. -Talking
about comic-relief, the jokes were just bad. I remembered laughing with
tears watching EX2; I barely grinned at this. Stallone said he wanted
to go back to the dramatic storyline like EX1 and look what happened.
Not dramatic and not funny.5/10 P/S: Just don't waste your time.
