"Once" twice: does lightning strike again?

"Begin Again" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Greta
(played by Keira Knightley) and Dan (played by Marc Ruffalo). As the
movie opens, we find Greta reluctantly going on stage in a small bar
venue to play a song, urged on by a friend. By complete coincidence
Dan, a veteran of the music business, is in the audience, and loves
what he's hearing. We later learn the background of how these two
characters ended up in that very place, as things have not been going
as planned (and I'm being mild). Dan tells her he wants to record an
album with/for her. Along the way we get to know the side characters
(Dan's wife and 14 yr. old daughter--both estranged from Dan), and Dave
(played by Maroon 5's Adam Levine), Greta's boyfriend who has just hit
the big time. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience,
you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: as a general matter and contrary to apparently many
other reviewers, I did not "fall" for this movie like I did for "Once",
writer-director John Carney's previous tale of romance and music. In
fact, when it comes down to it, this movie is nothing more that a
re-imagined "Once", set in a different city and with different leads,
but in the end it is nothing more than a variation of what we've
already seen. Lightning does not strike again: as sincere and moving
and impossible Once was, as contrived and unoriginal and self-evident
Begin Again is. There are still a couple of great scenes in the movie,
reason I'm giving it 5 stars out of 10, and which I cannot describe in
more details so as not to give away anything.And then just when you've think you've seen it all, comes the ending of
the movie. Wow, just wow. The irony of it all. (For more details,
please see my comments in the movie's discussion threat here on IMDb,
under "The Ending (spoilers obviously)".
