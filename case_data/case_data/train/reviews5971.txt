Seems like you've seen it all before.

Chris Pine takes the role of Jack Ryan but has nowhere to go with it.
Kevin Costner gets the worst of a clich√© riddled script with lines
like, "now you are operational". Perhaps they were going for comedy?
Keira Knightly is capable of more. Kenneth Branagh makes a good
villain.The movie delivers about what you expect. There is loud music that
gives away the suspense scenes. Cars crash about. Everyone you know
will survive does and the world is saved for another day.Everything is predictable. The only twist will be you in your seat as
you hope for a fade to black. There's a reason this is a January
release. Wait it will be coming to a platform near you soon.
