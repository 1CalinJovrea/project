Finally -- an action movie without a zillion pointless explosions

I went to this movie because I was curious -- Owen Wilson NOT in a
comedy?? I was pleasantly surprised. Owen Wilson nailed it -- a loving
father trying *desperately* to save his family. Yes, this situation has
been done a zillion times before (for example, THREE "Taken" movies) --
but I've never seen it done with this much intensity. The movie's focus
was not on the "action." Rather, the focus was on the interplay between
the parents/kids, how they dealt with each other and the various
situations, providing a deeply human touch against a horrifically
inhuman background (a massacre). And it was this extreme contrast, of
the human vs the inhuman, that kept me on the edge of my seat
throughout the movie.Pierce Brosnan was also amazing. No plastic Kennie doll here -- Pierce
Brosnan played an imperfect man trying to do the right thing. I've
never seen Pierce Brosnan play such a wide range within a single role
-- from off-key karaoke to ____. (I won't say it as it would be a
spoiler). I also enjoyed Pierce Brosnan's sidekick, "Kenny Rogers." And I must say, it was refreshing to see an action movie where the only
"car chase scene" involved a moped going five miles per hour.
