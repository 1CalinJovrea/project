Emperor's New Clothes

Despite the visual similarities to Inception, Doctor Strange (in 3D)
looks incredible. In places it's breathtaking. Without a doubt, this is
the closest to tripping you can experience in a cinema. However, all
this eye-candy fails to hide the fact that underneath it all is a
terrible, terrible, by-the-numbers film. It makes the same fatal error
as Finn fighting Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. The villain is powerful
and experienced, but our hero, who is a beginner, manages to defeat
him. This is only one of dozens of 'groan out loud' moments. The script is poor and the 'jokes' are misjudged. If there's one sure
fire way of preventing your film from aging well, it's by inserting
jokes about Beyonce. I can understand why Mads Mikkelsen did this film, as I'm sure he was
well paid, but it's probably the worst film he's appeared in by a mile.Lazy and formulaic. I give it 3/10 only because it looks so good.
