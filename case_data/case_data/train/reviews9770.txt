Hopeless

An overlong movie that has no reason to be overlong.Or ever being made.It is mind-numbingly boring; "it's got Jason Segal in it" makes you
watch it, hoping it gets good except it is so. effing. boring.And the producers never asked anyone about how irritating the London
accent (or whatever it was) on the girl was. Every time she talked it
was like Paris Hilton trying to be the most irritating English person
ever, and she did it well.There was about 7 minutes 30 seconds of good stuff in this movie. Segal
ought to be ashamed of himself.
