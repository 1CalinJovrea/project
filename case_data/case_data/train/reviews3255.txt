Over hyped

Watched this movie as I kept seeing it being hyped all over the place
and was disappointed. First of all a good deal of you are going into
this based on all the Bella Thorne controversy. She is not the
babysitter and is only a main character because the cast is twenty two
people. Secondly this movie has some very obvious parts that have been
ripped off other, much better comedy horror movies (Zombieland comes to
mind). Lastly it plays on every movie trope that does nothing but
fictionalize reality. A perfect example is how a bullet hits a
character in a movie and they fly back twenty feet, when even a twelve
gauge will not budge you in real life. I will admit I have bias towards
this movie because the jokes in it are referenced from everything I
hate even though a good deal of the time they are being used to make
fun of what the joke is about. The vast majority of people will more
than likely enjoy this movie, I am just warning you that you are in for
what is basically an hour plus long instagram joke with dead bodies. Oh
and do not try to make sense of how he is the only person in this day
and age over two years old who does not have a cellphone. Do not expect
to understand a good deal of the jokes unless you are the stereotype of
the millennial generation and have every social media app and live your
life by them.
