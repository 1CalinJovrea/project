OK movie, not terribly exciting

The plot is simple and not very interesting, the characters are not all
very likable, and not all necessary. They can delete some of the
classmates without affecting the movie much.I hope no kids tried to duplicate the electrical experiments on their
dead pet. They might end up with a charred dead pet, or a tripped
circuit breaker.Kids would enjoy this movie more than adults. I wonder why they
couldn't spend a little more effort on the script/plot to make
something enjoyable for adults as well. An earlier movie by Tim Burton
-- Corpse Bride, is one of my favorite. That's a movie that can be
enjoyed by all.
