Now this is good acting...

Michael Shannon should get at least an Academy Award for his
performance in this movie. This guy can act and you lose the person and
totally see the characters he portrays. Reminds me of Daniel Day Lewis.Anyway, I had never heard of this Kuklinsky person and it was
interesting to see his story. The multiplicity of his lifestyle had to
be a killer (no pun intended) to live out. I don't know of many actors
who could go from one to the other so effortlessly. From cold-hearted
killer to nice person to ragging man to loving husband and father.
Michael Shannon can do this well. And those subtle expressions of his!
They're great. Icy. Kind. Murderous.I'm not a fan of Winona Ryder but I liked her portrayal of the Mrs. in
this movie. She was believable and really had the suffering wife thing
down.While leaving the movie I ran into a gentleman who had watched the
actual documentary of Kuklinsky's life and he said the movie was a good
portrayal of the facts. That is a good thing to hear because this kind
of story like lends itself to Hollywood sensationalism. And while some
of that may have happened, it was a good movie about a bad man. Did I
feel sorry for Kuklinsky at the end? Yes...well actually it was pity
that I felt.
