10
Very enjoyable experience

I gave this a complete 10 because both the wife and I (as well as the
other movie-goers -going by their reactions) thoroughly enjoyed it from
the beginning to the very end.Was it predictable? Of course. Its an animation geared towards children
(what would you expect?) -but like most of the animation movies of
today, there were quite a few 'hidden humor' spots as well which would
be completely missed by the younger audience (not unexpected since it
is the adults, after all, who are forking over the bread and it doesn't
hurt to keep THEM entertained as well). The movie is fairly fast-paced
and the animation well done. I'm usually a little apprehensive when
I've harbored good expectations from a movie based on clips/previews,
but in this case I felt it truly delivered. This one will be added to
our library when it (eventually) hits the shelves. Too many people look
for a great amount of depth and unpredictability in animation movies
-but THAT is a bit unrealistic (no pun intended) -think about it: These
things USED to be called CARTOON MOVIES for a reason. They weren't
intended to fit that kind of expectation. They ARE intended to be fun
-and this movie is just that: FUN.
