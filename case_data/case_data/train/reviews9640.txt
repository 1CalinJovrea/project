A Grim & Bloody Horror Film!

Haerd about this film a while back & have been looking forward to it
ever since it's release. The film has a pretty basic setup. A loving father Kent finds an old
clown outfit in the attic to substitute for a clown that is doubled
booked & had to cancel! The party goes down well with Kent as the clown
replacement. But after waking up the next day, he finds he can't take
off the suit & tries fanatically to cut, slice & rip off the outfit to
no avail. His wife Meg tries to help him as he runs away & tries to
figure a way to get the suit off. She eventually finds & tries to help
him but he escapes!The film goes at rapid pace from drops of blood to buckets as Kent
begins to change into a blood thirsty child killing demon! Which in the
middle of the film, by Karlson is explained that the suit is skin &
hair of an ancient demon that kills children!The back story of the film was interesting & fitted in well! Unlike
others which have a back-story that's just "Thrown In" & makes no
sense! The blood was top notch & didn't fail to amuse! The theme of the
film it'self was dark & gloomy! Which I felt really added to what was
going on!You really do begin to feel sorry for Kent as things go from bad to
worse in seconds! But after a failed suicide attempt (which involved
him accidentally killing a prying child) he eventually gives in to the
demon & devours the him! Grim as F**k!The scene in the play area was well done! Again grim & dark!However the ending I wasn't entirely bought by! I mean it ended well
but Meg had to kill her husband who was possessed by the demon! She
wasn't the one bit sadden & sorry for doing this! It seemed like a
difficult decision, sacrifice her son & her husband will be free or
kill her husband & let her son live! But why couldn't she just find a
random kid to sacrifice to the demon clown? The ending would've been
better had this been the case! Overall the film is pretty good! Gory, dark & grim in so many levels!
Though the ending wasn't exactly a great one, the film as a whole is
pretty intense! 9/10
