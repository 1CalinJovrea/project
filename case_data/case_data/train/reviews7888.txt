Home Depot EQUALS a bad place to be while on Robert McCall's bad side

In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after
felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll
it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no
bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action
scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But
when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these
scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from
every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex
specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that
he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man
working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like
just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday
weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and
explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus
to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. As always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a
good wholesome action movie.
