Barbie and Ken get a doll for a threesome...

Seriously, the Young couple look like Barbie and Ken dolls. He's
handsome and boring and she's pretty and boring. And so is this so
called horror movie.Apart from the movie itself, being boring and predictable, the couple
act moronically throughout the movie.1: why would anybody want a creepy doll like Annabell in the first
place? 2: after they move to an apartment after the first hauntings,
the doll is in a moving-box even though Ken threw it away. And Barbie
is not freaked out by this at all and decides to keep the doll?? 3:
after Barbie and Ken and the clich√©-priest finds out that the doll is
possessed by a demon, they don't destroy the doll, which would probably
destroy the demon as well. No Barbie throws it around and yells at it.
And the priest takes the doll with him to his church where he is almost
killed by the demon.4: as for the exercising couple that is not even in the movie, they're
boring as well. And a franchise about that couple seems like a really
bad idea.5: the exercising couple keep the doll in a glass box to keep the demon
trapped. Again, destroy the doll and destroy the demon.6: why did this movie get an R-rating? There is no blood in it, no
nudity, no swearing.Apart from a few creepy scenes and only one good scare, this movie
isn't worth watching. If you like horror movies with dolls and those
movies certainly can be creepy, I recommend Dead Silence. Directed by
James Wan that produced this garbage.
