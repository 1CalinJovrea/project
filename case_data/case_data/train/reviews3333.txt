Fails to deliver.

Although Clash of the Titans was universally dismissed as an
overwhelming disappointment  and featured the worst post-converted 3D
ever  it raked in the big bucks and a sequel was naturally green-lit
by Warner Bros. With a new director (Battle LA's Jonathan Liebesman
replacing Louis Leterrier) and an extra $25m to toy with, Wrath was
given the opportunity to learn from its predecessor's mistakes. Alas,
this loud and sporadically entertaining mess largely fails to deliver;
Sam Worthington's acting again doesn't cut the mustard, the action is
well-choreographed but repetitive, and the CGI remains below par
considering the dosh thrown at it. However, it's the lack of
imagination and unpredictability in the plot department that truly
stifles the proceedings. If you get to the end of the first act and
don't already know how the rest of the movie is going to play out,
you're probably sleeping. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes spice things up
as Zeus and Hades respectively, and Toby Kebbell's comic sidekick is a
successful ploy to inject the humour sorely missing from Clash, but
it's not enough to make this misfire recommendable.
