A standard comedy - but with a teddy bear

Whilst I did not dislike 'Ted' I cannot say I was overly impressed by
it. The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release
had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing
days after. To my disappointment, 'Ted', to me, turned out to just
another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself. Having said that, 'Ted' did provide some good laughs, whilst they
weren't exactly side-splitting the film was entertaining and I did
watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The
animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making
it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a
computer-generated 3D image. What I felt let 'Ted' down was it's predictability and lack of
memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15, 'Ted's plot didn't
seem to suit it's targeted audience, I have seen similar story lines in
films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of 'Ted' was clearly
intended for more mature audiences, therefore I felt it deserved a more
mature plot. Overall, I'd recommend 'Ted' to those who are looking for a relatively
light-hearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing, yet
somehow still lovable, teddy bear. It's good, but nothing overly
special.
