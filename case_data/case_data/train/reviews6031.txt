Stunningly Good

Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, I just found this riveting
and important film to be truly exceptional. Much of it is done in a
low-key style, as layer after layer of the abuse by Catholic priests
and subsequent cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese as well as other
powerful interests, is uncovered by the Spotlight investigative team of
the Boston Globe, in the early 2000's.I haven't yet seen all the movies nominated for the Best Picture
Academy Award in 2016, but I can certainly see how this one won it, as
well as winning Best Original Screenplay by Tom McCarthy (who also
directed) and Josh Singer.Overall, just an outstanding motion picture that I would recommend
highly.
