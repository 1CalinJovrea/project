Take a break

Most importantly: relax. Take it easy (as the song goes). But do not
watch this, if you are easily offended. It really goes out there and
language wise, it does not only cross the line, it catapults over it,
with a vicious grin on its face. If you know you can't handle that,
better save your money and time.For those familiar with the original (it's been too long since I last
saw it), there are a few throwbacks, most of which surely can be read
here. They are nice and as "tasteful" as they can be expected to be in
a movie, that really takes no prisoners. And I only watched the version
that was shown in cinemas. I can only imagine where they probably will
go in an extended version (that's surely happening, right? If not at
least many deleted scenes and outtakes, with more "fun" - for those who
liked it). Also many jokes throughout the credits, that will either
delight you or annoy you more - depending on how you liked the movie
