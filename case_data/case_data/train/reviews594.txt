Snore-Fest I felt like we were watching a remake of an average movie

The cinematography was beautiful. The locations, the sets, the
wardrobes, the sound, the lighting (very Good), the supporting cast...all was very good. The story (which should be thee MOST important thing) was very average. The Chemistry between the leads was non-existent. It was
obvious that they were trying to create an obvious lack of heat. That killed
the film. Two usually very good actors, were forced to create an unusually strained and uncomfortable relationship, that didn't ring true for a second, on the big screen.
