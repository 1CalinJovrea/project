one of the best of the Hollywood re-imaginings...

Lets be frank. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took
something dusty and old, and tried to turn it into something shiny and
new, you could retire.In fact, most of these attempts barely work. But (having seen this one
front to back three times since its first release) I believe this is an
exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to
these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film (hence
the low rating) without even giving it a chance.The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witty and clever and engaging. And
wonderfully demented. The cast is to die for. Eva Green and Johnny Depp
are at the peak of their craft, delivering with a straight face bits of
dialog that lesser actors would choke on. The supporting cast (almost
all A-list with a young ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) is rock solid.Overall a delightfully deranged yet still entertaining exercise in
being silly -- which is exactly what Hollywood aims for in these odd
exercises.The IMDb rating is much too low. Give it another chance.
