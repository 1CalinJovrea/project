Highly underrated

Fans of King's books appear to be unable to judge this movie on it's
own merits. I think it was well put together and very entertaining.
Adaptations of King's work are always difficult and the screenwriters
have chosen not to attempt the impossible task of incorporating all the
facets of multiple books in one movie. They simply used whatever
concepts and details they wanted to. If you enjoy it for what it's
worth, you'll have a good time ;-)
