Frenetic start, slow in the middle, very predictable and not funny

I'm the only person I know that didn't love this movie. After hearing
all the rave reviews I had high expectations. I had several issues with
the film...-The pacing in this film was very off putting for me. Frenetic start!
Character development was weak and things happened very fast for the
first 15-20 minutes. It sort of made my head hurt. Then things slowed
way down and I found the movie to be pretty boring right until the end.-The plot line, where a father is taking away his kids legos, kind of
irked me and it was obvious from the start he was going to come around
by the end of the movie. As a Dad, I also thought it had the potential
to undermine my authority with my kid a little. -The punch lines just weren't that funny. I chuckled a few times but
that was it, and all the best jokes were already in the trailers. -Too much product placement. Lets be honest, the entire move is big ad
for Lego. But then they throw in all the other products, and it really
made the whole film feel like a giant "get your parents to buy this!"
commercial to kids. So, there it is. My opinion on a very highly rated film that I just
didn't enjoy very much.
