Dances with the Wind

Jeremy Renner is cool as f***, but that's nothing new. Wind River got
good acting and fantastic pictures of raw nature but what it lacks is
imo a suspenseful and captivating story, so I wouldn't call Wind River
a thriller or a crime/detective story but more kind of drama about loss
and being lost spiced up with some hunting and shooting. Not bad, not exceptional, but okay, thanks to the good acting and the
great supporting act called nature.
