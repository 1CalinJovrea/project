Brilliant and Visceral

What a great film.Ignore previous reviews. How people can ignore the realities of
psychotic family behavior is beyond me. This film smartly peels the
layers and transparently reveals all about people running astray with
their lives and emotions. It captures how families really are or maybe
should be. Americans are all too good at bottling and hiding their real
feelings and the result is vapid soullessness. Not with this film. It
displays like European honesty ensuring every word drips viscerally
from their tongues until the effects are felt. So reassuring in a
country gone soft and dull. Amazing performances, sharply written and
wildly funny, this film will pull tears, smiles and laughs.
