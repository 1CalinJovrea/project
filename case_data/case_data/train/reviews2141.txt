Explores beautiful psyche of old age human

I watched this movie in MAMI, year round program film screening. I had
also got opportunity to interact with director of the film - Ritesh
Batra. He is called as cinematic tinder of common man, because he
brings romance into lives of characters that have faced struggle and
challenges in life. It is a beautiful story of old aged woman and man who were living alone
for years after their spouses have died. They break silence and start
sleeping over same bed only to escape loneliness. Both of them continue
talking and gossiping about their past lives, happy moments as well as
regrets. Their children have grown up and are living their own
independent life. Film is an emotional drama, warmth in relationships,
and shows sense of human life in dialogues. It explores psyche of old
age through their responses to life circumstances. Film end up teaching
many life lessons through these characters. Addie regrets that she has
spent years thinking what people would be talking about her. Film is adapted from the novel of same name by Kent Haruf, who died
just few weeks after publishing his last novel.
