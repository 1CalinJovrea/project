Much More Than Just a Boxing Movie

Creed is the 7th installment in the Rocky franchise but this time
focuses on Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed's son. He wants to follow in his
father's footsteps and is trained by Rocky Balboa himself. More than
boxing, this movie really goes into the relationship between Creed and
Rocky and how they both support each other when they most need it.
Michael B. Jordan is fantastic as Creed. He is so energetic in the
boxing scenes and he is even better when his character is being
developed. Now we come to Sylvester Stallone as Rocky. In his signature
role, he absolutely knocks it out of the park in what may have been his
best performance in his career as an actor. He honestly deserves an
Oscar for this part. He brought tears to my eyes on multiple occasions
and still has the same charm from the old Rocky movies. Creed perfectly mixes elements from past Rocky movies, especially the
first, with modern culture. The amazing Rocky score is complemented by
modern styles. Creed's story is told just like Rocky's and it is so
beautiful to watch. The cinematography is also visually pleasing.
Coogler captured the look of Philadelphia extremely well. The boxing
scenes are excellent. There is a fight that is done completely in one
take and I have no idea how they did it. It was amazing. This movie is
a drama that tugs at your heart a lot, but at times it still manages to
be quite funny as well. I love Creed as a film. Its characters are so well realized and acted,
the cinematography is gorgeous, and the boxing is glorious. Creed is
definitely one of the best films of 2015. Creed gets an A.
