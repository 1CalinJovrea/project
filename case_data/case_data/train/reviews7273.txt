Amazing movie with an unexpected ending

A really really good movie, full of suspense.At the beginning I thought of, how easy, I understand what this movie
is about but as the minutes passed I was trying to put everything
together, to understand who is the one behind all these, is it the
husband, is it she, the wife? I admit I suspected her all the time,
after all she is one smart, beautiful and powerful woman, isn't she?:))
It s just one of those movies who leaves you at the end with your mouth
open saying ''I wasn't expecting that'' because you simply have no
clue...I simply give it a 10, I think that the story is great, the characters
play their roles very good, the atmosphere is full of suspense and the
screen play is very well thought.Hope to see more movies like this! Enjoy!
