See it for the visuals, not for the story

Plot: Warrior princess Snow White takes on the wicked queen with a
little help from people she barely knows. Drive-in Rating: Yield right
of way. Just to get it out of the way, I don't understand the appeal of Kristen
Stewart as an actress. She always has the look of a stuck up brat to
me. There, done with the casting critique.The movie was visually stunning and Charlize Theron made for a truly
wicked-good Queen. Chris Hemsworth was compelling (in a vacuum) and the
dwarfs (casting controversy aside) were engaging. I love that the
writers know their fairy tales enough to remember what properly lives
under a bridge!...but I didn't find myself rooting for the entitled heroine or her
comrades. The story idea was good enough but the writers tried to pack
so many concepts into 127 minutes that they forgot a little character
and conflict development. Even the most compelling scenes, the final
kiss for example, left much to be desired (I'm not spoiling anything by
telling you there's a kiss, it's a well-known plot point in the fairy
tale). In addition, there were some unacceptable leaps in logic (for
example, what compelled the Queen's brother to tell the Huntsman the
truth about his wife?).And finally, is there an award for the least compelling title of the
year? "Fairest Blood" immediately comes to mind as a reasonable
alternative.If you pay to see this in the theater, make sure it's because you want
to see the visuals on the big screen.
