Astounding Oscar worthy performance from Eddie Redmayne

We are all familiar with the story and with Steven Hawking. His
groundbreaking work 'A brief History of Time' and devastating
disabilities propelled him irrevocably into the public consciousness
and immortal fame.But few of us could understand the complexities of his personal life
and the shocking divorce in 1990 from his long sacrificing wife of more
than 25 years. Indeed that episode served to darken his reputation in
the minds of many, including myself, who felt ill at ease with anyone
who could leave a partner who had done so much for him just at the long
awaited moment when international fame and recognition finally arrived.This wonderful production, so well scripted and paced throughout,
serves to explain that vital anomaly in Hawking's life. And it is made
all the more poignant as it is based upon the account written by his
wife who has borne so much.But it is the breathtaking performance of Eddie Redmayne as Hawking
that simply blasted this film into an extraordinary level. It is
difficult enough to mimic so famous a person as Hawking and it is even
more difficult to portray so accurately the debilitating and gradually
increasing effects of Motor Neuron Disease. But to transmit so clearly
the profound emotions and inner suffering that Hawking must have
experienced in his agonizing journey was a performance that left me
quite speechless and at times in uncontrollable tears.It would be a travesty of the industry if Eddie Redmayne is not
nominated for an Oscar after this performance. And to my mind it was a
work of art that simply cannot be equaled let alone beaten.Have a good handkerchief ready to hand.
