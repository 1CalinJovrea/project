It's not adaptation - it's bastardization

I am bitterly disappointed by this film. It's noisy, jumbled, and
chaotic, far too violent (it was a children's book, for heaven's
sake!), and almost completely formless. The action sequences are just
ridiculous, and what's worse is that they look fake - maybe an artifact
of filming a 3D movie and then showing a 2D version, but something that
you can't say of the LoTR movies. This was like a not very attractive
cartoon.Morevoer, even as stuffed to the gills as it is with material from
Tolkien's appendices to LoTR and other things that should make the
world come alive and draw you in to the back story, much of it doesn't
makes sense. It's just a blitz of portentous talking between fights and
chases. The acting may not be all bad, but nobody's even on screen long
enough to actually act or is given anything to *do*. Ian McKellen's
Gandalf has become a caricature and his performance no more than a
collection of tics and mannerisms. Sylvester McCoy is embarrassing. At
least half the dwarfs aren't' given enough actual acting time to create
characters, which just makes the film even more cartoon-like.Overall, watching The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was about as much
fun as watching someone play World of Warcraft. I hate to say it, but
even as someone who has been a scholarly Tolkien geek for decades, I
may not bother to see the moves that are to follow. I'm afraid that may
be a rather common reaction, too. Oh, well - maybe it will turn people
toward reading the book (and Tolkien's other work) to see what the fuss
was really about.
