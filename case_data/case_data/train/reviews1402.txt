one of the best movies i seen as far as story

its so weird that movies that get great review i usually dislike or
just find meh, this is an other example, i watched yesterday "the
host", in my opinion one of the best movies in the last year, yet it
got terrible reviews, its been over a day and the movie is still in my
head.. sure its not as flashy then oblivion, but those movies i watch
and an hour later completely forget about it, $100000000 special
effects are great, but no money can make up for a great story.. now
sure maybe the book is better, but a book is ALWAYS better, get over it
;) its not a book, its a movie. the host became one of my favorite
movies of all times
