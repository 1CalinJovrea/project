A decent remake

I was excited to watch The Evil Dead remake after finally having seen
the original trilogy. I thought this film was okay, but the main
problem I have with the remake is that it didn't really scare me. There
are lots of gore and bloody scenes, but I just couldn't feel the same
atmosphere from the original Evil Dead here. The use of practical
effects was a nice alternative to the CGI dominance these days and I'm
all for that. There are a few gross moments that seem realistic and I
think they wouldn't look as good by using CGI. The acting was actually
all right and I found it more believable and not annoying like some of
the characters were in the first two films. Another positive aspect I
can say is that director Fede Alvarez does a nice homage to the
franchise by recreating the same location and elements from it. He also
adds a few interesting twists to the story and some scenes look
visually impressive. Nevertheless, I just didn't find the movie
effective in giving me the scares so that's a major problem, being a
horror film.
