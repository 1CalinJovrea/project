A film about nothing

With all the controversy back in 2016 over the #Oscarssowhite shambles,
it seems that in 2017 the Academy has made a conscious effort to
include as much diversity into the show as they possibly can.
Unfortunately, the downside of that is that films like 'Moonlight',
which are in reality very average, get recognition they don't deserve
and people are fooled into thinking they are better than they actually
are. 'Moonlight' is a simple film, in fact it's far too simple. There
is almost nothing thought-provoking or interesting that happens for the
entire 110 minute run time. Yet somehow it's up for a plethora of
awards. Go figure.Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris have each been nominated for Academy
Awards in their respective Supporting categories. Ali is quite
brilliant, in fact he's the highlight of the film. He's in nearly the
entire first third of the film and I was starting to wonder how this
was considered a "Supporting" role, yet he soon drops away. I wish he
had been in it for longer though, because he was quite superb. Harris
was also quite good in her role. She has a more spread out performance
in the film, reoccurring in each chapter. I wouldn't say she blew me
away, but she was certainly solid in her role. I will predict Ali to
win his category, and Harris to miss out.'Moonlight' is one of those films that just kind of drifts along until
the credits role. The question I kept asking myself as I watched it
was, what is meant to be so extraordinary about these characters? What
part of this story justifies making a film out of it? To me it appears
that some impressive acting and some false award nominations have
tricked people into thinking this film is better than it is. Very
disappointing.
