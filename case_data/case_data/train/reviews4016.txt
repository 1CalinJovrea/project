Superbly crafted screenplay of the Doc

I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in
Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to
the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime
conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion,
the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays
YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely
adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his
enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith
community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war
or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers
fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of
war is universal; even among soldiers.
