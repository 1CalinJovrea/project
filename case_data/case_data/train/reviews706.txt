Frances Hmmm...

Can't really decide how I feel about this film. It was somewhat
intriguing, beautifully shot (in black and white), and the lead
character was perfectly cast. I love quirky characters in independent
movies, but most of the time I couldn't decide if Frances was
incredibly endearing or incredibly annoying. Immature, yes. Quirky,
yes. Childlike, yes.I didn't by any means hate this movie, but I did not love it as much as
others. It is a film like no other, and worth a watch, but it left me
feeling ambivalent. There was really no plot, which made sense because
Frances didn't really seem to have any clearcut goals or ambitions
(other than being a dancer, which wasn't ever going to happen). She
lived moment by moment and the film took us on her journeys even though
I am not sure they served much of a purpose.
