A high school romance with more emotion and truth than any other

A high school romance between an alcoholic, party boy and a more
reserved, shy, girl. This movie did an exceptional job of hitting
reality. Everything about this movie was believable, and all the actors
fit their roles. This movie had a similar feel in style to Ruby Sparks,
in that at the heart it was a romance, but there was a lot more too it.
Family drama, fear of the future, alcohol, and even friend drama were
all in this, just like most teens experience.In a Q&A afterwords an audience member asked why this was such a
idealistic school, and why it didn't have any bullying and the truth
is, because even though those exist, most schools don't have a serious
problem with it.Another audience member said they didn't recognize anyone in the movie,
and that the lack of makeup made it feel more real. While the lack of
makeup is true, this movie has quite the cast list.
