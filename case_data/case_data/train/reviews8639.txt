All in all pretty good

Assassins Creed is by no means perfect, but I did enjoy it. The film
has the classic setting from Assassins Creed games, a modern day
protagonist enters the Animus to relive the memories of his ancestor.
The film does a pretty good job explaining the series mythos to those
unfamiliar with the games. Sadly, we don't spend as much time with the
ancestor Aquilar as we do with the present day Cal, and Aquilar feels
under developed as a character. The movie also felt a bit short. It
really could have benefited from a longer run time, to give more
character development to the ancestors, and explain some of the
characters motivations better. The action in this movie is great, the
story is solid, and the characters (that are properly developed) are
interesting. Both Fassbender and Irons play their roles well. Overall a
decent movie any Assassins Creed fan would enjoy. The critics like to
bash it because it's a video game movie, and it's cool to hate video
game movies, but it's not bad at all. 8/10
