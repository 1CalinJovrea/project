A heartbreaking snapshot of true life events

This magical film focuses on the diaries of the noted writer Vera
Brittain. Vera battles against all objections to win a post at Oxford
university, studying English literature at Somerville Cottage. War
breaks out, and all those close around her sign up to fight, including
her love Roland, wanting to help and make a difference she turns her
back on Oxford and becomes a nurse. The War had heartbreaking
consequences for so many, Vera included.The film boasts an utterly wonderful cast, it's no wonder that there
are some fabulous performances, Alicia Vikander is utterly sensational
as Vera, watching this film you'd never in your dreams believe she was
Swedish, her RP English is incredible. I've been a life long fan of
Miranda Richardson, and she doesn't disappoint, she truly is a national
treasure. Colin Morgan is excellent as Victor, one scene in particular
was incredibly moving.The period detail is impeccable, the buildings, decor, fashions,
hairstyles etc, all is as it should be, it certainly looks the part.The scenes in France are so sad, very distressing, but painfully real I
imagine. You'd need to be made of granite not to feel something. There is a huge switch in tone in the film, the first 40 minutes are
gentle, almost idyllic, but as War strikes there's a shift, it's almost
purposely slow to begin.It's a fabulous film, one that totally draws you in, I found it
extremely engaging. Beautifully acted, you will need your hankies, not
ashamed to admit I cried. 9/10
