Not that Good

I have to believe if in the hands in a more experienced director this
film would have been much better than what is presented on the screen.
The storytelling is mediocre and lacks the intensity that it should be
considering what happen to this airman. I am disappointed that the
script was so weak considering who had their hands in rewriting it. It
totally lacks the normal Coen style, perhaps it was there and Jolie
just could not figure out how to put it on screen. Now don't get me
wrong, she manages to get the gore and suffering all right, but that is
all we every really get. It would have been nice to see how that
effects him in his later life and because we only see this small slice
of his extraordinary life we are left wondering what the nightmares he
survived as a POW changed him later and how he survived the nightmares
he endured later on suffering from PTSD.
