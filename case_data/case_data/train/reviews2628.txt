If you're looking for a good RomCom you just found one.

While being predictable, as is normally the case with romantic
comedies, this movie still manages to make you enjoy the ride and keep
up with the story as it progresses. No spoilers, I just feel like it
should be said that there are moments where the predictability is
compromised and there is some doubt of whether or not the narrative
will carry out with the expected ending, but it's not some gigantic
dramatic blow up. It feels very natural, heck the entire movie feels
very natural from the character choices of the actors to the colloquial
nature of the dialogue. The humor is consistent, and there are running
themes and jokes that thread into the story with ease. It may feel
semi-forced in some places due to some of the actions the characters
perform or the choices they make, but it fits into the universe of the
movie. You may have think over these bits for a moment, but the overall
direction and writing of the film is fantastic and witty and just makes
you feel good. The acting is wonderful (huge props to Daniel Radcliffe
in this role, seriously he is great and fits into the character so
well) and it was very well-casted, and I highly recommend if you want a
good romantic comedy to spend the evening with.
