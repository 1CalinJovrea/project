Entertaining clown slasher...

As far as clown slasher go, I rarely see any true effort put into them
- especially these days. "Clown" is actually a pretty refreshing entry
in the genre - being clearly of modest budget, yet still managing to
come across as a professional looking flick with an unusually likable
cast of characters, a reasonably memorable villain! There's also a few
decent and relatively gory deaths, cleverly themed after traditional
clown tricks.The gore level in this movie is extremely high. Every kill is based
upon a trick that a clown but all with the intention of making your
skin crawl. It won't be to every one's taste, as limbs are literally
ripped from bodies, heads kicked of.think that most will enjoy this movie knowing ahead of time that it's a
gory slasher.
