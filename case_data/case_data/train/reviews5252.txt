Much better than expected, best amityville film in years!

As an Amityville fan I have seen all of the films, so I was prepared to
watch yet another straight to video flop of a movie, considering this
films release has been delayed for 2+years I was not expecting anything
special.But finally this movie included everything that was missing from all
the films since the evil escaped in Amityville 4. Im talking about the
house! The house is exactly the same as the original movies even the
interiors match somewhat. I also think that possession movies have been done to death, but this
was such a new a perfectly horrific idea for a possession. Seeing a
loved one waste away from disease is horrific by itself, the
desperation to do anything to bring them back to life makes you
sympathize with the mothers insanity of believing demonic reanimation
would allow her to see him alive again.Having the characters discuss the amityville movies and the fact that
nothing has happened in the house for 40 years was such a fun idea,
getting to watch the amityville horror in the amityville house, that's
something you would never expect. It was great!I had to give only 9 stars because the use of photos of the actual real
house slightly ruined the (are we in the movie or real life idea). It
looks like the characters decided to move into the filming location in
toms river used for the first 3 movies, and that Bella is looking at
footage of the real house. Then they watch a movie which looks more
like their house than the real house. It just doesn't work... but I
love the movie version of the house, so I will try to forgive it.The characters were all very likable, the little girl was so cute, most
of the amityville kids are just annoying. The ending was satisfying, he
got to die. Pulling his body out of the ring was great because as a
viewer you always think, why can't they just stand in the garden. The
house can only hurt them in the house.
