A unique fever dream of a movie

Hollywood California, 11.30pm and the Bay household or should we say
mansion is quiet and ready for bed. Michael removes his gold slippers,
finishes his cigar and nestles into his Transformers silk bed sheets
and closes his eyes ready for sleep. As he drifts into a deep rest
visions of explosions, young models in short skirts, explosions, a
really big explosion, short skirts, explosions, loud noises, a slow
motion explosion and robot dangly bits fill his mind. As he awakes in
the morning light with the rays of Beverly Hills he forgets what dreams
filled his night yet is inspired with a jolt of creativity to go and
blow things up Â– all in the name of art and entertainment oh and he
needs a nubile young model to sign on for her "acting" skills.Oh Michael Bay we could make fun of you all day and all night long,
you're the butt of many critics joke and an easy target at that yet one
thing that cannot be denied is your track record with your films making
in excess of 4 billion dollars at the global box office therefore
giving you a license to pretty much blow up whatever you see fit and
really the world is all the better for it.It may come as a surprise but Pain and Gain is explosion free for a
whole 52 minutes! That's right Bay does not blow up a single creation
either small or large until almost an hour into his bizarre, frantic
and seriously entertaining take on a unbelievably true story set in the
sun drenched city of Miami. Bay's tale is perhaps his wildest yet and
features acting turns by it's 3 leads that rank as some of the most
committed of the year.The trio of Wahlberg, Johnson and Mackie committee not only physically
to this tale but mentally, portraying versions of men so hell bent on
the American dream they will turn to kidnapping and murder to get it.
This outrageous tale is a fascinating allergy on the American dream
with voice over monologues from the characters letting us know just how
brazenly dumb these men are whether it be thinking Scarface is real or
wanting to be a Doer and not a Don't-er. It's a crazy tale directed
with a Red Bull infused energy by Bay that one suspects will be a cult
classic in years to come due to its subject and portrayals.Make no doubts about it there is a lot wrong with Pain and Gain but
it's also one of the best filmed and interestingly acted movies from
last year and at no stage is it in any way boring. Bay is a man easy to
hate on but for a director who makes unashamedly entertaining films he
is a genius and on the strength of this effort shows us to be a daring
filmmaker whether you want to admit it or not. Bring on the next
