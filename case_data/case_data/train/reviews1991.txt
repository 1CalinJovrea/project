Cleverly written with an eerie twist

This movie is appropriately in a genre Mr. Jordan Peele has christened,
"Social Thriller". The movie creates a very unsettling feeling from the
beginning that slowly builds to a crescendo, that forces the viewer to
see prejudices head on. When all is said and done, you now have kind of
a bird's eye view of what is wrong with society. But besides that, it
hints a Hitchcock-type of thrill that is sure to deliver Goosebumps. A
HUGE congratulations to Jordan Peele for hitting a HOME RUN, his first
time up to bat. Looking forward to future projects from him. GO SEE,
GET OUT. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
