Great supernatural horror flick I've seen in years

Over the years, many movies have failed dismally to deliver that hair-
rising horror experience. The Crucifixion succeeded where many failed,
and if you wanna have those scary jolts, I recommend this move. The
plot is simple to follow, the scenes are well-executed to give that
intense but memorable horror experience.
