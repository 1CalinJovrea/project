It's all about the acting

This movie is formed by the excellent Tom Hardy performance. It's that
good. I would put it up there with Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mocking
Bird, and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. Okay, now I think
you understand how good I think Hardy does. The movie seems boring from
a simple summary. "It's about a guy taking phone calls in his car for
almost 90 minutes". That sounds boring, but it's not. It's actually the
most suspenseful movie of the year. (2014, it came out in the US in
2014). Sounds impossible, but writer/director Steven Knight does
amazing with a tiny budget. You also get to know, not only Hardy's
character, but the people he's talking to on the phone as well. They
truly seem like real people. The situation they create is also very
creative and interesting. I won't say what it is, but I don't think
it's a spoiler. I'll just say it makes you wonder what you'd do in the
given situation. It's the best British film I've seen since
Trainspotting, and definitely deserves one, if not more, viewings.
