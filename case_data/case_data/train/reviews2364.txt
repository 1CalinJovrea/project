A great horror flick to watch around Hallowe'en time for the creepy factor

I scored this high because it isn't like any movie I've seen before.
Its not as much as scary as it is creepy, however. In my opinion, its a
movie that plays more on an individuals phobias than anything else for
that kind of fear factor. I won't go into detail because I don't want
to spoil it for anyone - but you have to be into hand held camera
movies like 'The Blair Witch Project' to enjoy it.I read through the negative 'don't waste your time' comments and came
across a positive one which swayed it for me, I watched it and wasn't
disappointed, so hopefully you won't be either. Its original,
realistic, and if you get really into it, it will certainly creep you
out.
