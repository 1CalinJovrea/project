Waste of time and money  !!

For a couple of months now , I have been seeing the trailer, of this
film ..... And I was looking forward, to finally seeing it ! So, last
night , a friend and I , had the misfortune of viewing ,The Girl on the
Train ... To tell the truth , I've seen better mysteries on "Murder She
Wrote " reruns !! Pathetic characters , nasty sex , thrown in every
couple of minutes , and I for one, am SO sick of F this F that , every
other word ! Personally , my contemporaries, and I do not use trashy
language ,and we are sick of vulgar conversation ,in this and other
films ,of recent years !, I guess next time ,I'll just stay home and
watch TCM !! Great movies , with great plots , great actors and NO
trash !! I seriously, would have left after the 1rst 45 min. , if I
would have been alone !, Oh , and by the way , I would give this film
an X rating ! May appeal to some .... But , no one that I know !!
