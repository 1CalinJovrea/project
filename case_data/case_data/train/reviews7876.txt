Not What I Expected

I will not get into the particulars of why this is bad- all of the
other reviewers have pointed them out (i.e. thin script, mediocre
acting...etc...) all true. The entire thing boils down to a father son road trip bonding movie,
which is totally FINE as a genre. But, from the trailers, the
advertisements, the cast, and what I know of Favreau (Swingers,
Made)that is NOT what I was being promised. I expected a comedy, this
is NOT that.What I wanted (and coincidentally what I think would have worked) would
have been a movie about a chef, stifled by a boss and food critic who
figures out a way to do his own thing and proves to himself and to his
poor neglected family that he CAN live his dream and make his family
life work too. I expected some Anthony Bourdain- esque tirades and lots
of back of house restaurant drama. I wouldn't have even minded the
food-truck thing (since he needs to find a way to do his own food and
has no money- look at that house his alimony was paying for???) or the
twitter thing (as that is how a lot of Food-Trucks operate on word of
mouth and buzz). The father-son on the road bonding bonanza=LAME. It has been done
before, better. Everyone seek out the short lived TV series based on
the Bourdain book "Kitchen Confidential"- THAT is what I expected from
this film's marketing. Go in prepared, perhaps none of the issues this
film has will bother you. I do not agree with those who say it is
"un-watchable", for fluffy "independent" reasonably low-budget pet
project, it is well- made crap and watchable. But, you have now been
warned.
