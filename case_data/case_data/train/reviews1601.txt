Worst Ninja Turtles movie in the TMNT franchise

When I first saw the trailer,it reminded me of the old movies which I
loved to watch when I was a kid.But after I saw the movie in person,I
became really disappointed on what the turtles franchise in live action
was turning to.Like how the turtles look like Doomsday from DC
Comics,April is not a redhead at all,they made the character Vern
played by Will Arnett whose's character annoyed me in the movie before
this and he became a celebrity,Casey Jones who is played by one of my
favorite actor's Stephen Amell who plays as Green Arrow on Arrow is
shown as a major wimp who wants to be a cop,and Casey Jones doesn't
want to join the cops in any other adaption, he wants to be a vigilante
.And shredder has long hair on this movie and I remember he had short
hair in the first movie.So I give this movie a 1 out of 10 star,I wish
I can give it a 0.
