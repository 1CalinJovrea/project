Worst movie ever!!

Took all of 15 minutes for my husband and I to walk out on this movie.
It was awful!! The cheesiness and bad singing just wasn't worth it!! I
went in and gave it an honest chance and had to get out of there when
Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin started singing together in a hairbrush.
It almost seemed like a really bad version of a Glee episode. The music
selection we heard was great, but it was very "karaoke" and I didn't
care much for that. I couldn't even stay in my seat long enough to see
Tom Cruise's character. Frankly, I'm not even sure I could rent this
movie to see if the rest was as bad as it began. The trailer for the
movie gave it a much different "feel" and it was kind of deceiving. Big
thumbs down from me!!
