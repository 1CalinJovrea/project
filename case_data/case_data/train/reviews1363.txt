Madea + Halloween = Epic Win!!!

I LOVE Halloween, and I love the Madea character and I was ecstatic
when this was announced. I like that Madea is more of the main star
now. In the earlier films like Diary of a Mad Black Woman and Madea's
Family Reunion, she was mostly a background character that only came in
for comic relief. Madea's Witness Protection, A Madea Christmas, and
now Boo! A Madea Halloween have all be good to me because she's out in
front. Brian's daughter, Tiffany has grown up and now a teenager. She and her
friends want to go to a college Halloween party but her dad forbids it.
Tiffany is out of control, so Brian calls his crazy Aunt Madea to come
watch her all night while he's out of town. Madea brings Aunt Bam,
Hattie, and Joe to keep her company. Tiffany tries to convince them the
house is haunted. Soon enough, she sneaks out and Madea chases after
her. She has to put up with frat boys, clowns, ghosts and zombies
throughout the Halloween night to try to get Tiffany back on the right
track. If you love Madea and Halloween, I highly recommend BOO! A MADEA
HALLOWEEN!!!
