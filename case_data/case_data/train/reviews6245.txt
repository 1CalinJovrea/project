A new and interesting story, No real climax, needs more humour.

Throughout almost all our fairy tales we have always seen big, scary
monsters and children hiding under their beds in fear that these
monsters would come and eat them up. Ever heard of a story where things
happen the other way around? Dracula (Sandler) has built a hotel called
Hotel Transylvania where all monsters and beasts can come and feel
safe. No scary humans to come and disturb them, only darkness and
peace. But when Jonathan (Samberg) a young human bag packer arrives at
the castle, Dracula is petrified. Dracula's young daughter Mavis
(Gomez) is eager to explore the world outside but her father refuses to
let her go into the destructive and dangerous human world. The movie
explores a good storyline which is the exact opposite of the stories we
usually hear. The movie is light and entertaining but the movie still
lacks a lot of humour. Yes it would appeal to a 10-year-old but the
movie still needs to give the audience some more reasons to laugh.
