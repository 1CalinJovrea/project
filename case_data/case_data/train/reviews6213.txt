Unfairly criticized; worth a watch!

I saw Jupiter Ascending tonight (after a VERY long wait I might add).
Sadly it is not in the vain of other Wachowski films in terms of
thought- provoking subject matter; however, I feel this film is being
very unfairly criticized. No: the subject matter is not as deep or profound as in The Matrix, V
for Vendetta, or the masterful Cloud Atlas. But it was never advertised
to be that kind of film--it's a solid blockbuster movie (with plenty of
room for sequels and/or prequels). I'd see it again!If you're considering watching this film, but hesitate after reading
the same scathing reviews that I came across, just consider what
interests you about the movie: if you're looking a movie with a complex
plot and lots of underlying messages, this might not be the best
choice. It's a blockbuster film pure and simple. A good one! But a very
typical blockbuster/action/romance movie.
