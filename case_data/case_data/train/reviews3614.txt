Eccentric, Eerie and Hauntingly Beautiful

As a fan of J.A. Bayona's previous work "The Impossible", I had fairly
high expectations for this and to say that I am astonished would be an
understatement. "A Monster Calls" is based on the book that Patrick
Ness published in 2011. After this breathtaking adventure I assure you,
You will be inclined to read the book. As this is an adventure that
builds on your emotions and thrives on your imagination. Conner is a
young man that is trying to cope with the fact that his mother who is
diagnosed with a terminal illness isn't long for this world. But as his
mind races with fears and his imagination takes hold, he creates a
creature that would give adults nightmares, But as he realizes the
creature is friendly, He grows close to the "monster".This is one of those movies that must be seen in theaters, mainly
because it's two hours of escape from reality, where you can turn the
page back, to a time where your imagination used to run wild. A time
when, your biggest responsibilities were picking up your socks. In
other words, a time when you were really free.
