disgusting unfunny filth

I'll make this short and sweet as I'm not even sure IMDb will allow me
to post a review of what may be seen as a minority opinion.Aside from being overall a waste of time and not funny, what really
disgusted me is there are a ton of crude gay oral sex references in
this film. Literally, it's as if the writers were paid on a 100%
commission to insert as many explicit and implicit gay oral jokes or
innuendo into the film as possible. The film projects the image that
virtually most of the characters in the film harbor gay urges. I've
noticed this self deprecating punch line is being inserted into quite a
bit of comedies. Spoilers: The scene towards the end where the one character has his
privates shot off and then has to pick it up with his mouth because he
is handcuffed is revolting, disgusting, not funny and should have never
made it past the censors. In an earlier scene a character makes a crack
about forcing another to wear a snorkel mask and that they will then
defecate into it. This is not funny, it's disgusting and sophomoric at
best. In closing, Hollywood please stop with the disgusting bathroom humor
and the relentless gay agenda. Also, knock it off with the fake reviews
on here, there's no way this piece of garbage is a 7.6, me personally i
would give it zero stars if i could,but i would bet without the fake
reviews this would rate a 4.0 Same with that sleep inducing garbage
from last year: "Drive".
