Empty attempt at being 'stylish'

I think this film only made it to cinemas cause it has managed to
involve household names such as Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx (why these
great actors ever said yes to this project heaven knows). It is a
thoroughly empty and soul-less attempt to be a stylish new thing, but
falls to the ground with a thud. Nikolas Winding Refn's film Drive has
already done everything that Baby Driver tries to do. Where Drive
succeeded in telling a mysterious, deep story involving romance and
action at the same time as having a unique auteur style, Baby Driver
falls short in every respect. There is nothing wrong with the cast as
such, Im sure the actors do their very best with a thin plot and an
even thinner dialogue. Why this film has received such high rating on
IMDb is a mystery to me.
