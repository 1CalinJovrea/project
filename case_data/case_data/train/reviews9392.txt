Clarke is adorable and the critics get it wrong

How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the
critics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia
Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and
wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to
none.Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is
paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance
develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound
disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie
depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own
judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer
to die.With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and
suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good
times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated,
the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love.
