Les Mis√©rables. the most aptly titled movie of all time.

I must be getting old & cynical or both. I saw the actors listed and
thought this has to be a great movie. It wasn't. I couldn't endure more
than 30 minutes, so perhaps it got better after I left. (I doubt it). I
love a good musical. I also like it to have some dialogue mixed in as
well. When I realised the whole movie was going to be sung I started to
cringe, no amount of delicious hot popcorn and gallons of coke was
going to keep me stuck in the seat. It's the WORST movie I have seen in
a long long time and I have seen some shockers lately (WRONG as an
example). As I said in the header, Les Miserable is exactly how I felt
when I walked out of the cinema after spending good money on utter
rubbish. After I walked out I noticed many others quietly exiting the
cinema.
