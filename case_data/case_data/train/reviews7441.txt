Heartwarming Story that Leaves No Showbiz Clich√© Unturned

Structurally speaking, ONE CHANCE follows the trajectory of just about
every showbiz rags-to-riches movie you could think of. There's the
skeptical father (Colm Meaney) offset by the devoted mother (Julie
Walters); the best friend (Mackenzie Crook) who supports Paul (James
Corden) despite evidence the contrary; the dramatic reversal scene
where Paul is told by Luciano Pavarotti that he will never make the
grade; the touching scene where Paul's wife Julie-Ann (Alexandra Roach)
vows to support him through thick and thin; and the climactic sequence
on the talent show BRITAIN'S GOT TALENT where Paul proves himself in
front of the judges including Simon Cowell (the film's Executive
Producer). And yet the film has a certain integrity to it: James Corden
gives a winning performance as Paul, conveying the uncertainty and
gawkiness of the character. Roach makes a convincing lifetime partner -
someone who willingly puts up with Paul's basic self-centeredness as
she truly believes in him. Meaney turns in a competent turn as a gruff
rugby- playing patriarch with a heart of gold. Oh -- and there's the
music as well, which is always worth listening to.
