Great story ended badly told

Movie started with narrating everything and it kept it through movie
that is was very bad. Scene introductions with quotes is not what you
do in movies, except if you are one great story teller and you got
powerful writing skills, instead you should just let the movie plot
flow. Everything from meeting two friends up to their partnership is
very lame. From bunch of so called fun moments there are just few of
them worth real laugh and Jonah laugh in the movie starts to be
annoying after a while. Some of dramatic moments with Iz are nicely
played and showed the power of their lie. Best scene of the whole movie
is when they run guns in Iraq, it was the only moment that was very
funny but at the same time full of action and tension. Acting was on
place, Teller did it very well as he had little bit more dramatic
character, Jonah tried to make it funny but ended somewhere in between.
Cooper playing bad guy is a nice catch as he did not disappoint. It
seemed that movie tried to be better with comedic approach to subject.
Great story and not so good story telling of it. 2.5/4
