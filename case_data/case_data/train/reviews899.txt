Too many holes !

Why was he killing? Where did he come from? Does she know him in
passing? Was her friend involved with him? The story had a lot of
holes. Plus, I noticed how the lead star had a disability and lived in
that nice fancy house but didn't try to put the code for the police in
the house alarm? Do they expect us to believe she didn't have a house
alarm? Also, when she ran outside and tried to get away, that was crazy
because she couldn't hear his foot steps which was obvious of course..
She ended up running back in the house because he was standing right
there. The friends boyfriend gave all her personal information to a stranger.
The guy didn't even look like a cop. Where was the cop car? Why
couldn't he use his walkie talkie like all police have. He claimed
someone called the cops and that is why he was there. How did he get
there?It was so many questions. So yeah I gave it a 4.
