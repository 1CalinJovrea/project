each of us can relate to one of the two drivers

this is the story of two formula one drivers. one (hunt) is a reckless
hunk, a smooth-talking, get-all-the-girls typical type of driver who
amazingly drives very well. the other (lauda) a confident, disciplined,
laid back kind of guy, doesn't care what you think of him, luckily
comes from a rich family and also a super-skilled driver. flip side is
he's also a pompous, arrogant, know-it-all on cars, engines, etc
therefore the kind of guy nobody likes. the movie takes us through the
rivalry of these two guys in the very dangerous F1 racing scene of the
70's. It shows how Lauda's discipline gives him an edge over his rival
but also how Hunt's likability and sometimes cunning ways evens this
score! All in a riveting movie which will keep you glued to your screen
till the end. everyone of us will relate to one of the two opposing
characters in the movie, and will probably be rooting for your guy to
come out tops.. the danger in the races will keep you on toes
throughout, remember this is from a true story and things do get awry
in true stories..all in all riveting - from start to finish!!
