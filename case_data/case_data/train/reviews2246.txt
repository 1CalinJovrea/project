10
Worth the watch - greatly underrated movie

I almost did not watch this movie due to the lower rating - thankfully
the first review I read praised the acting and movie set. For that
reason, I wanted to share a review highlighting the cast lineup which
was phenomenal! Who could ask for more than having Hugh Laurie and
George Clooney and Tim McGraw in the same feature movie! The special
effects were "out of this world" (Please excuse the pun). This sci-fi
story brings to the forefront the deliberate abuse that we are heaping
on our Earth and that we are knowingly doing nothing to make a change.
It speaks to never losing hope and to always keep the dreams alive. It
was worth every minute of watching and is very entertaining and family
friendly. Definitely a 10 out of 10 for me and a movie that I would
watch again.
