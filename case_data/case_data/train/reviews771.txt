Badly burned

A sorry excuse of a film. Awful writing, from the plot to the terrible
dialogs. There are so many goofs regarding what a real chef does in a
high class kitchen, that you could fill pages with them. Too many
inconsistencies, one after another. Examples: a two-star Michelin chef
does not "do everything" by himself, shouting constantly at all his
staff; he does not do the starters, the main courses AND dessert. There
are "sub-chefs" who specialize in different items.The film is so full of Hollywood clich√©s... It's "one of Hollywood's
eight plots," set in a fancy kitchen environment: the plot reads like a
sports film about a failed college basketball coach, trying to make a
comeback. Such a waste of ingredients.
