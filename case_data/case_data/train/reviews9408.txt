Excellent, moving film

I saw this movie yesterday. I agree with previous reviewers, this is an
excellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think to
go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another.
You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - "what are
you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!" But the great thing is you always
understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree
with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic.
Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before,
and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It's
a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at
the same time it is not vulgar or "in your face", it's tactful. I
really loved it.
