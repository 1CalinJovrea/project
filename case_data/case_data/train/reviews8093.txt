Loved it!!!

I don't know why some people don't like this movie! I don't think this
movie is cheesy at all. I absolutely loved it! I love the modern take
on it. I love the actors and actresses and all of the songs. I have
watched it several times now. I love how Quvenzhan√© Wallis gives off
the "okay, I don't care" act when things rise up against her character
(Annie) in the movie. But as she walks away, you can see her true
emotion of hurt or sadness show through. I think that shows what a good
actress she is growing up to be. I love the modern take on the original
songs as well as the new songs added. I think this is a very well made
movie. I wish it had better reviews than it has been getting.
