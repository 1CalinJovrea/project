Just terrible

I am sorry, but this is one of the worst movies I have watched... ever.
I normally check IMDb for good films and get them from the video store
to watch. However when this got a 5 star rating from various reviewers,
I decided I would actually go to the movie theater. What a waste of
time. Sitting next to one of my friends, I could guess what was going
to happen before it happened, literally, throughout the movie.There
were multiple to name, however, but there were two that struck me as
the most cliché, and forced me out of the cinema to take a toilet break
(which I never do when watching a movie at the cinema). The first was
when the power was turned back on and the horrible acting protagonists
moved to a store which is know overrun by trees and vegetation. A guy
puts on a song and I said to my friend, "If they start dancing, I'm
leaving." I subsequently left. Another cliché (and extremely annoying)
moment was when the main human (somehow not Gary Oldman who had about 4
minutes screen time!) had to run back to get Caeser some supplies (he'd
been shot) and I guessed, "hey, Caeser's son who is the only ape
against the new leader not tied up for loyalty, will meet him and
ignore him". It just sucked. Sometimes people say "that was 2 hours of
my life I'll never get back",well for me,that was 2 hours of my life
I'll never get back!Not joking! Highly unrecommended!
