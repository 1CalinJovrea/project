Unique movie

This movie challenges lots of things that we wrongfully take for
granted in today's society. Mortensen is brilliant for yet another time
and all the cast is simply breathtaking. The concept of the movie and the backstory were brilliant. A touching
movie, heartwarming and brilliant all along. A father that although
strict and sometimes military like, who's also artistic and deeply
sentimental. An amazing depiction from Vigo Mortensen. Amazing. A movie that in a simple but yet elegant way depicts all the things
that have altered our society and brings forth lots of the things that
really matter. It makes us think about the ways we were raised and
rethink the ways in which we want our children to be raised. This is a movie well worth your time. One of the best movies I have
watched in 2016, by far!
