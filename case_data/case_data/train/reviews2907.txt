Oh my god! I don't know where to start...

The "Vacation-series" are all classics that are loved all around the
world. They all got this warm humor with the excellent Chevy Chase in
the leading role. Nowadays "Christmas Vacation" is a new tradition on
our family Christmas evening. That said...This was by far the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. Bad script,
bad humor, bad acting. Just really really bad. I know the movie isn't
one that wafts of intelligence, but come on. A three year old kid would
have done a better job than this. I know that the old character of
Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wasn't the most intelligent man in the
world, but he still got some parts that were recognizable for a normal
person. We could see some parts of our own dads in him. All characters
in the old movies were built like this. With a story built upon a great
portion of humor and some part kind of real situations. This movie is just dumb. Really dumb. I was sitting through the whole
movie with my mouth open gasping on how incredibly stupid both the
script and the characters were. Yikes. The most annoying person in the
whole movie isn't actually the leading role played by Ed Helms, but the
small son "Kevin" (Steele Stebbins). No adult in the right state of
mind would have put up with this kids behavior. It's not even a bit
funny. At all. That kid belongs in an institution. I don't think I need to say anything else. The whole movie stinks. I
will now try to forget the movie all together, sit back, relax, put my
feet up and watch the reruns of the old ones instead.
