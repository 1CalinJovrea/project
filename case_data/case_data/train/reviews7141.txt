Choose Trainspotting (And my God, what a choice!)

It's not often I go to the cinema to watch a day-one screening, but my
love of Irvine Welsh and the previous Trainspotting film meant I just
could not resist.This film is a wonderful show of friendship and Begbie's psycho temper
which encapsulates left over stories from the first book and large
portions of 'Porno' the following book.I'm pleased to announce that all characters still have that beautiful
chemistry featured in the original and work to provide scenes of pure
comedy genius and others of emotion and absolute anger. The film really
lives and breathes nostalgia of its predecessor, as well as showing
how, even if we all change on the outside, we are still the same on the
insides. We all make the same choices in life over and over.My only complaint with this film is that it didn't feel as slick as the
first film. This is probably because of the vast improvements in
cinematography which you'd expect considering there's an over 20 year
age gap. Transitional shots mean you're waiting that little bit longer,
but you are probably looking at some of the best views Scotland has to
offer in that time.To sum up, I'd have to say this film is essential viewing for anybody
who's seen the first film or read the books. There are so many
references which you'll pick up on, leaving you with a wry and joyous
smile throughout. For anyone else, you need to watch the original film
first (and understand Scottish for anyone reading not in the UK), but I
assure you that this film will not disappoint. It's textbook Danny
Boyle packed full of nostalgia
