My god this is a terrible movie....

I am not sure where to begin....Maybe I was a bit lost because I never saw the first "Thor"...and I am
not familiar with the character and what he is all about...But regardless...this movie was rambling and disjointed. All the
characters were so superficial and one dimensional that I did not care
in the least what happened to any of them. Apparently the entire
universe was at risk, and this film managed to make that prospect
completely boring and leave the viewer 100% indifferent about the
outcome. Impressive.There were a few attempts at humor thrown into the movie. They were all
childish...they failed...and in fact were so "unfunny" they made me
cringe.About Thor. How interesting is a character who is apparently entirely
omnipotent....? Near as I can tell, he can neither be hurt nor
killed....and can travel the universe at more than the speed of light.
Yawn. I have enjoyed Natalie Portman in many films...but even she could
not contribute anything useful to this turd.Having said all this...as of this writing this movie has a 7.6 IMDb
rating. I don't get it... I felt I had to post an honest review to
counter that nonsense.
