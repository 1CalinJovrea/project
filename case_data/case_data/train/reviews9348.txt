Incredibly tense, oddly realistic

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the score for this film. It
doesn't do it any justice, and some of the reviews I've read here don't
make valid points in my opinion. So, I felt I owed this film my own
review.First of all, the tension: man this thing has a killer build-up! You
could call it slow (if you're a Transformers kind of guy), but it never
gets "boring". You're on the edge of your seat from the moment the film
starts, partly due to a very subtle but creepy soundtrack, which
reminded me of sound effects in some of David Lynch's movies. Adding to
that is the fantastic performance of Logan Marshall-Green as the
tormented Will. He, and the events that follow, will keep you guessing
about his mental health and whether his paranoia is justified or not,
almost until the end. Michiel Huisman plays the very smooth and lulling
host to great effect, and the rest of the group of friends is also very
believable and natural.THE scene (no spoilers, you'll know which one I'm talking about when
you see it!) was so well done I really had the feeling I was there. It
all happens so slow, so eerily apropos, and so jaw-droppingly
unexpected that you really get the feeling of "oh my, that could be me
out there". The little twist in the last couple of minutes is the
cherry on the cake, and makes you even more uncomfortable than you
already were.This is a case of an "ignore the scores, just watch it already!" film,
and I hope you enjoy it every bit as much as I did!
