Not as Smart or Original Like the First Movie, But It Still Has Fun With What It's Got

Unlike most people nowadays where they are sick and tired of these
movies especially the Minions, I loved the first Despicable Me when It
came out, It has somewhat dated animation and you've seen this sort of
story before, but It felt refreshing, smart, funny and at times
emotional, the two-time Oscar nominated Despicable Me 2 was not as
fantastic as the first but It did Improve as a sequel, had a well
crafted plot, well developed characters, It was Interesting and the
Minions were still going as always, the Minions movie again not as good
as the first movie but was more fun then the sequel for reasons that
people may disagree, critics and audiences were mixed about It I
generally liked, the choice of music, the characters, the jokes and
references were really funny and It was a good prequel to the first
movie and yes I did like a little more then Despicable Me 2 but I still
liked that too.Now when I heard they will be releasing the third movie this year and I
saw the trailer last year, I was really excited to see how they will
Improve the franchise even more with better clever writing and
characters, even the second trailer looked like It It will still have
the family element that the first movie had, after that avoided all the
trailers Inlcuding TV spots because If there's something I learned from
Smurfs: the Lost Village Is that, the more you show, the more It's
gives too much away.So I went and saw It today still really excited and....It was great, It
has a Interesting plot, It got some new characters that are pretty
Interesting and funny Including Balthazar Bratt voiced by Co-creator of
South Park Trey Parker, all the recurring characters are all still good
as they are, well most of them.However again, not as fantastic as the first movie, slightly better
then the second but on par with Minions, Because there are a couple of
things that this movie got a bit of downgrade from, the writing while
executed fine, It has far too much going, Gru and his twin brother Dru
(both voiced by Steve Carrel) are bonding, the Minions end up In
prison, Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig) trying to be a better Mum for the
girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes, Balthazar Bratt sitting around In his
lair and Agnes and Edith try and find a Unicorn.With too much going on, there Is no real plot to this, the most Is Gru
meeting his twin brother and trying to stop Balthazar Bratt, It could
of been like Toy Story 2 where they only focused on two while a couple
slipped but they were kind of short towards, but these drag on although
Lucy's sub-plot finishes very quickly and finally the other thing and
people will be split with me Is that the Minions were somewhat
misleading, In the first two trailers they were just the supporting
characters, but In the film and the advertising they are In prison,
they are In It for good like 10+ minutes, but they are everywhere In
the advertising, sure they are iconic and are mascots for Illumination
but they are not In the film often like the other movies, I don't know
I just like when the Minions show up they can bring me a good laugh
they do here but not as much as before.So as you can tell I'm a bit mixed, the writing Is all over the place
and the Minions are not In as much, but It does have okay execution,
still great animation, the new and old characters are fun and It was
still funny, as a long time Despicable Me fan, this Is not the best In
the franchise, but not the weak thus far.I'm giving Despicable Me 3 a 8/10.
