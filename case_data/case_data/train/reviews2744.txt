The Exorcism of Adelina Marinescu

Like 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' (based on the true story of Anneliese
Michel) this movie is also based on the true story of the Tanacu
exorcism, which was a case wherein Maricica Irina Cornici, a mentally
ill nun at the Romanian Orthodox Church monastery of Tanacu in Vaslui
County, Romania, was killed during an exorcism by priest Daniel Petre
Corogeanu with the help of four other nuns.Adelina's story is told through a series of flashbacks and this is
where there are some truly disturbing elements and shocking visuals
which push the genre from murder/mystery/thriller to actual horror.The Romanian setting has an almost Gothic allure and certainly adds
atmosphere.Although there were some cheap jump-scares it did actually manage to
shock (and disgust) me a couple of times when something 'real'
occurred.I don't want to come across as negative in this review as this is a
nicely made movie, however it's nothing I haven't seen before (done
better).6/10
