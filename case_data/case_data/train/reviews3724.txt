A waste of time

You can't deny the success of the Hangover trilogy and its notoriety,
and yet typical of many sequels before it, The Hangover Part III fails
at almost every hurdle. From humble and I dare say somewhat original
origins from the first Hangover, out is produced a loud-mouthed, vulgar
and humourless successor. Little in this film captures attention in an
admirable light. Abundant is the nonsensical, violent drive that paved
the way for a series of good jokes in the first film, yet now no longer
we see the laughs, merely the stupidity left in wake. There is no
humour, no sense of longevity beyond a month or two, or even the
mildest gesture towards good entertainment. Instead, a monotonous
undercurrent of rushed scenes, placid dialogue and exaggerated violence
carried throughout makes "The End" quite well a heavy thud into
in-existence for the Hangover franchise.Did anybody really expect brilliance? Likely not. Which is good, it
should just make this final flick a forgettable yet entertaining encore
to the previous films. But it's not. It's just a mess of too much money
and a desire for more.Nothing about this film appeals, nothing makes it worth seeing. Go to
the park. Walk the dog. See something else. Just don't waste your time.
One day everything will come to an end. Prolong your success with a
final, exciting goodbye, or keel over into nothingness as one of the
many forgotten films of Hollywood. The Hangover Part III likely won't
dent the enjoyment most people think of at the first film, but it has
formally announced that this, truly, is "The End".
