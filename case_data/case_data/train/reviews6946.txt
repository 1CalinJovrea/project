Strong start but poor final act.

Just came out of an early screening of this film during Odeon's monthly
'ScreamUnseen'. The film surrounds 4 friends who embark on a hike across a remote part
of Sweden for a recently deceased friend. Things start to turn bad
after they decide to take a shortcut through the forest. I split this film into 2 parts: The first part surrounds the group
getting lost in the woods trying to find their way back to their cabin
and encountering strange things and sounds in the woods. The woods give
you a very strange and eerie vibe which I think the film excels at.The
cinematography was great and really captured the sense of unease and
isolation in the woods.The films also explores the subject of grief,
especially in one of the main characters in the film and this has
consequences heading into the latter parts of the film. Unfortunately the second part of this film falls short for reasons I
can't go into without spoiling the film. If you are a fan of horror
films set in the woods you'll have seen this kind of ending many times
before. 'The Ritual' has some great strengths but unfortunately falls short
towards the end of the movie. Definitely a film for fans of films such
as 'Blair Witch' & 'Backcounty'.
