Don't do this to yourself! Do NOT watch!!! Good user reviews are fake!

This is, hands down, the worst piece of entertainment i have seen in my
life! Forget about coherence, forget about story, forget about humor,
you find non in this junkyard. Batman vs Superman is about two wannabe
bodybuilders who try to build up a heated and involuntarily gay
atmosphere in 2.5 hours only to fight for 4 min with CGI rubble flying
around. It is Brokeback Mountain meets Crossfitt commercial. Poor Ben
Afleck never looked dumber! I am trying hard to find anything positive
with this movie but it is really really hard. download this
masterpiece,see 5 min and turn it off. Go do something nice with your
buck! P.s. Avengers was crappy in its own right but this one takes the
word to a new height!P.P.s If your looking at the user review section to see a better feel
for what people think of the movie, just beware of the fact that warner
brothers hires people to make thousands of fake accounts to score this
movie 10/10 to raise the overall score.
