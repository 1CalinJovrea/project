Could have been an Adam Sandler movie

Given how much I loved "The Other Guys",I was pretty excited to see
Ferrel and Wahlberg back together again. But it turns out that "Daddy's
Home" is for the most part just a normal family friendly comedy. It
lacks the edge and twisted humor you'll normally find in Will Ferrel
movies.Since this is a spoiler free review I'm not going to say too much about
the plot. Will Ferrel plays the role of "Brad", who is working his ass
off trying to be the new dad for the two children in his new family.
But suddenly one day their real dad, played by Wahlberg, shows up with
a plan to win his family back. From there on out everything is pretty
predictable. In fact, if you replaced Will Ferrel with Adam Sandler you
might think to yourself "have I seen this before?"If you're expecting a movie in the style of "The Other Guys", you will
be disappointed. If you just want to relax with a typical family
comedy, it's pretty good. You just might want to have your youngest
kids sit this one out.
