Would have been great if they had stuck with what the trailer makes you think.

I went into this with really high expectations after watching the
trailer. The idea of Home Alone meets Strangers sounded epic.
Unfortunately the trailer gives you the idea that it's spun from the
Home Alone side of things, kids fighting back against intruders. Nope.
Turns out it's just a kid driven to madness by puberty. I know now why
I'd never heard of this movie. It's one that the trailer is not only
deceptive, it's a bold face lie. I was furious.
