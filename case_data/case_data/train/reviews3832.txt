a real waste of talent

clichés are everywhere in this completely unfunny comedy-Tina Fey Adam
Driver and others in this cast are good comedic actors but the script
gives them no option but to grin and bare it and collect a paycheck...i
could not make it to the end of this mediocre exercise in clichéd
tedium- this movie has been done many times before-the awkward family
reunion-do not waste your time...Bateman was good in his last film
about an adult who enters a spelling bee but here he is just another
forlorn character...and guess what-the comedic gold of Tina Fey is
nowhere to be seen-it amazes me that movies like this actually get
made-Rose Byrne -was boring as was Jane Fonda who is now forging an
unfortunate career choice playing sassy older women...if you really
want comedy watch The Kroll Show or Broad City or even Project
Mindy-this movie was a waste of money and time...
