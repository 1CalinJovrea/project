Rogue One another worthless Hollywood cash-in that runs at snails pace.

Rogue One - another worthless Hollywood cash-in that runs at snails
pace.Die hard fans will obviously find enjoyment in this film - entering the
star wars universe again, the stunning visuals, and soundtrack... But
look closely at the film itself and there is not a lot on offer.It starts out with this awfully paced run of throwaway scenes to
showcase the main characters in the story - they go far to quick to
feel any emotional connection with them later on in the film.Two large chunks of the film are worthless dialog (that sound like
video game instructions) and this 'epic' beach siege at the end that
clearly looks like the Atlantis hotel resort in Dubai. Once you see it
in your head - you can't take what is going on seriously. The cast are also not well put together, the main character Jyn Erso is
unlikable - half her lines are rushed and predictable and her acting
made me cringe. On the other hand the characters - Chirrut ÃŽmwe (blind
fighter), Saw Gerrera (dying extremist) and Orson Krennic (Empire
deathstar leader) offer some great nuggets of depth but aren't in it
enough to justify their full potential.SPOILERS!!: I did enjoy however the stunning cgi restoration of Peter
Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, but when a young cgi of Princess Leia
appeared at the end of the film acting as the lead into 'A New Hope' -
felt cheap and reinstated the fact that this was a cash-in film and i
was stupid enough to fall for it and go see it!!Rant over! x
