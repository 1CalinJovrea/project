Solid 1 out of 10. Everything what is wrong with Hollywood.

Sometimes I wonder how bad can the Hollywood script writers be? Looks
like the people who wrote the script for this movie were imbeciles. Its
one thing to write a bad script and its totally another to write
something which is this nonsensical.The title of the movie is "dead men tell no tales" but Salazer does
tell a long tale to Barbosa a...... The biggest culprit of this boring movie is Jonny Depp. He makes no
effort what-so- ever to deliver anything new.The jokes are all stale, the dialog is stale, the characters are stale. Perhaps the only bright thing was Javier bardem... but he was not
enough to save this movie.
