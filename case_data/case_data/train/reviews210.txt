We adore this modern upgrade to a beloved classic.

My 5 year old and I have seen this movie three times now, with three
different groups of children. I loved the original Annie and was
slightly skeptical of any remake attempt. Also, understanding how hard
it is for some to progress past their own biases and possible
prejudices, I wondered how a black Annie would be perceived. I must say
that the writers, producers and actors did an amazing job retelling
this classic. There is zero focus on skin color within this story,
which makes it perfect for people of all ethnic backgrounds to enjoy.
This is a perfect family movie in which everyone we have attended
showings with, have given a high rating. I am amazed that anyone would
think a remake should look exactly like the original, which was
released in 1982. We all have the right to have varied opinions of this
movie. That being said, I think some negative reviews have been written
by individuals stuck in the year 82 or quite a few before.
