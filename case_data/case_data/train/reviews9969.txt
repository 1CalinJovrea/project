Even as a stand alone....it doesn't work.

Woody acting and product placement ruined this movie for me. i'm not
sure how he did it, but spike lee even manged to make 20 years in
captivity feel rushed and uneventful. to elaborate further, there was
ZERO character development, everything felt pushed along, including the
20 years in the room. he was just a pitiful alcoholic for YEARS, then
"EPIPHANY", a five minute montage of getting clean and getting in shape
annnnd he's out. there was no passion to it, there was no empathy that
you get from the original, you don't feel sorry for him. he's just a
sociopath on a revenge spree. although, i think the big ending twist
was done well, the overall movie was a snooze fest. they even managed
to make a pivotal scene, the hallway fight, BORING and pushed along.everything the main character is, is because of that room, his life,
his persona, his transformation, and his realizations. it had no heart.
the subtlety and nuances of the original are just lacking. like i said,
you you don't care about the characters, you're just waiting to see
what happens next...and what made it even worse, is that i KNOW what's
going to happen next, but dammit, i wanted my money's worth.
