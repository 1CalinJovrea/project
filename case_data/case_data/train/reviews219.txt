Kind waste the great cast

There are something about nudity of Grace Van Patton's student film
annoying me. One thing is unnecessary and abrupt. The other is I think
that Noah Baumbach borrowed the scenes from "Cousins" where the
grandson showed his disturbing documentary in his grandpa's birthday
party. It's a great cast assemble. However, it's somewhat shallow and
unimpressive. I often feel great cast make great movies. This one fell
short in that front. There was a dysfunctional family all right. But
there were also caring and considerate elements which could be enhanced
by the well-craft dialogue. Anger seemed to be the only dimension
exploited in this movie. I love "The squid and the whale" because it
told the full spectrum of human emotions. This one could be much better
if there were multiple layers involved.It's not entirely funny as comedy. It's also not as serious as drama
either. I do wish it could belong one of them.
