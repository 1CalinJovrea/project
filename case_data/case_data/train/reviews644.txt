Garbage

JJ, you really are destroying a large piece of scifi history.Star Trek was never an action based show/movie. It was always a story
that had supporting action elements. This movie is completely devoid of
any cohesive story and is an action junkies dream come true.Kirk in the original series was confident, capable, intelligent, suave,
etc.... The new and improved JJ version of the character is a moron.
Don't get me wrong, I really like the choice of actor, but the
character portrayal which is dictated by the writers and directors is
everything the original Kirk was not.Space ships crush under pressure....its physics dumba**es...the
Enterprise is not a submarine. I could go on and on, but I find it all a bit depressing. Star Trek is
after all just a piece of fiction. ...now lost to time to only be
remembered by a new generation as bad fiction.
