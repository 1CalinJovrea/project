Great entertainment

Watched the movie about two weeks back. I must say that initially it
was not my first choice. I am a big fan of action and looking at the
showings it was too scientific and didn't interest me that much but
nevertheless I ended up watching it because my first choice was? not
available at a time. I liked that it kept me intrigued and almost was wondering how Samwell
and the most respected body guard are going to cross their paths. It
was interesting, entertaining, funny, memorable and full of action.
Probably one of the few movies I would like to watch again. Big up to
the producers.
