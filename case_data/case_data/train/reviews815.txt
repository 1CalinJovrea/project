The Lucifer Effect

Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on
randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison
situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building.Anyone who has taken a psychology course is familiar with this
experiment, or at least the summary version of it. When put in a
position of authority, people become the role they are given. The
prisoners likewise become more and more like the role they are
portraying. This in itself is interesting, but is only the surface.This film gets into the deeper story that the textbooks tend to gloss
over: the nudity, sexual humiliation, violence to the point of torture.
How the heck Zimbardo and the school did not get sued into oblivion is
beyond me.
