Rooney Is Captivating As Always

Story line was very good, acting was excellent by all characters.
Rooney Mara, of course, IS the picture, as Una is Focal point in most
scenes. Her range is limited somewhat..and always has been. However,
her persona IS a somewhat truncated one, in all her pictures, and in
Real LIFE. She just uses what she has so brilliantly..always
understating and well clear of any unauthentic spoken words or body
languageRooney is captivating to look at, and to hear her speak is also a
pleasure. This is why she is such a sought after actress-she is so
compelling. Thus, with a good story line and superb playing by all the
characters, we are given our monies worth for sure, and a memorable
viewing. So glad to see her used wisely. The last couple pics she has
appeared in, were a bit weak..with Rooney still somehow bringing the
movies up a notch or two in entertainment value.
