100 Shades of Terrible.

I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a
successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not
the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being
in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They
see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame
on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of
mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat
good if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry "falling" for each
other. "Falling" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the
use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt.
This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in
over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in
a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a
control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including
the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while
they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows
no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the
antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love
is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving
family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after
they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly
female babysitter. 50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG
FAT ZERO.
