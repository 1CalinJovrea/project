That Awkward Moment was not awkward at all! Just hilarious

I have read a ton of reviews saying this movie is not worth seeing but
I don't understand. I laughed the whole time. Come on, it's three
20-something's fooling around with women. What do you expect? Oscar
winning acting, costumes, music and writing? No. It's a feel good
comedy meant to entertain you. And that's what I got out if it. And so
did the rest of the theater, I'm assuming from the constant laughter.That Awkward Moment was not awkward at all! Just hilarious. Well, there
were a couple of awkward scenes but it added to the hilarity.The specific "awkward moment" is when a girl says "so..."; the three
friends say that nothing good comes after a girl saying "so". For
example: "so, where are we headed" or "so, what are we?". But this is
me (a girl) saying "Soooo... That movie was hilarious! You need to see
it."I mean, it did make me glad I have a bf already and don't have to deal
with guys like in the movie but they are funny, attractive and
charming.I didn't like Ellie who is a main character. She seemed disheveled and
couldn't get a US accent just right the whole movie but everyone else
was wonderful. Especially Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis), she was the icing
on the Zac Efron, Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan cake. Yum.The movie definitely earned its R rating with swearing and adult
scenes. Oh, and Zac Efron does in fact Rock Out with a large, strap-on
(Blank) Out. For a good amount of time. So, be ready.There was a woman behind me talking the entire time. PEOPLE. STOP
talking through movies! We can all read the 8 ft tall "three months
later" placed immediately in front of our faces. No need to narrate.Go see it.
