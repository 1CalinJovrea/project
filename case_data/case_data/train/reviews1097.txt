I would starve myself over watching this again.

I actually enjoyed the first movies, but the Mockingjay additions were
like watching a bum try to hump a park bench; I just couldn't believe
or understand what was happening. It's horribly cast as just a knockoff
of Hitler's Genocide but plagued with propaganda film talk, propaganda
film planing, and the stupid phrase "prapa film" basically just all
being used to gang-bang what could have been a good movie. There was no
need for a part 1, the entire heap could've been surmised by a 20
minute section explaining how much they loved making war films, and
then tacking on the 10 minute rescue scene. These movies have more
filler than Burger King chicken nuggets. Only positive thing I will say
about this movie is that Katniss lost weight.
