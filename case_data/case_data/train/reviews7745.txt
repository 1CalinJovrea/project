A very decent (romantic) movie

I am really not a fan of this kind of movies. And honestly, I just see
this movie just for Britt Robertson. In every performance that I watch
her, she is really good, and as always, she doesn't fail in this movie
(a chameleon actress, this time is a normal and very reasonable girl
with no big issues). But, surprisingly, I found a decent romantic
movie, I mean, this is a movie based on a book of Sparks (I haven't
read completely a book of Sparks, but there is no need to do this to
know the style).So, I don't know why some people see a problem with this movie, which
follows two love stories through a healthy, successful, and good
looking couple? Unlike other cases, there is no a deeper problem (a
trouble of the psyche... I am not talking about the real problem of
Ruth and Ira), that require to think more than the necessary, you just
need to enjoy the movie and eat your popcorn, and of course for us
(men), watch to Britt is always nice. It is a story about a simple, but
real problem of some relationships. OK, this time the story has a
really happy ending and they live happy forever. But don't
underestimate the plot, there is a message. A clich√©. Yes. But, what is
wrong about that?To be a romantic movie, achieves the goal, so then, you could say that
is a good movie. Of course, if you are not a fan of this kind of
movies, don't force yourself to watch it, you will not like it. Maybe
that is why a lot of "critics" give a bad qualification... like those
in Metacritic. I have no doubt about how bad are the "critics" of
Metracritic, Rotten Tomatoes, etc., etc. A lot of times, the average of
the reviews people is more reliable (even when this is not a unfailing
rule).I have just a complain: some scenes are dramatized (not in the best
way) more than necessary and really affect story and the characters,
and, whom edited the video of the accident that was uploaded to the
web? A great edition... for a movie ;)
