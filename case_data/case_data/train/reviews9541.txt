Awful

If you want to enjoy this do not ask logical questions. Of course if I
wanted a documentary movie , but logical inconsistencies here are too
much...How a camera mounted on boomerang would not flip?How the boomerang was
capable to hover?Why the enchantress didn't took the Amanda Waller's phone and killed
the whole suicide squad?How the El Diablo didn't triggered the explosive when he went full
fire?How the explosive was capable to kill the 'brother' but combination of
fire, bullets and katana cuts was not? Explosion didn't look so
powerful...Why at her final appearance Amanda Waller had her fingers on the touch
screen of her phone and this didn't kill anyone? Who gave Harley a cell
phone? And did't spy her communication at least? This could save few
marine's life and a helicopter.Why Deadshot,Boomerang,Slipknot,Harley Quinn (and even Katana) were
considered as meta humans?Why Amanda took the helicopter as it was the helicopter? There was no
helicopter operational more than 2 minutes , before it was took down.Does the enchantress has two hearts at the end? How nobody recognized
her brother's statue as a dangerous thing? Was his heart hidden
somewhere? And what kind of archaeologist was June? She brook the
potential precious artifact?And she was alone in the jungle?Why Slipknot was not present in the initial intro of the 'metahumans'.
He came out of nowhere and died stupidly.How the squad attached so fast to each other? Especially the boomerang
who killed his biddy during the robbery.And even a simple pistol is a superior weapon than this stupid
boomerangs.What was the point of captain boomerang , except the
hovering boomerang with the camera?And the joker was a joke. Who the hell thought that a joker without
eyebrows will be a good idea. His face is so expressionless without the
eyebrows.And these flashbacks were so chaotic....
