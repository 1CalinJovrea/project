For all the wrong reasons...

OK, maybe this movie isn't aimed at "mature" audiences, but for adults
looking for a trashy good time at the movies then you won't get a movie
any better than this. If you want to see unrelenting brutality & most
of Eva Green you will get your money's worth & then some. Green totally owns the "Dame" role that she was perfectly cast for.
When her story ends the movie does drop off (fortunately her story is
most of the movie).The "Sin City look" is enhanced by 3D (I normally avoid 3D) & rates as
one of the best uses of 3D I've ever seen. Fans (like me) of Miller's
"A Dame To Kill For" comic book will be thrilled at it's obsessive
loyalty to word & frame screen treatment. It looks fantastic! (Maybe, I
mean to say that Green looks fantastic. It's both.) I don't get all the
criticism of how this "look" has grown tiresome --not for me in 3D.All the actors in big roles to small look like they are having a sinful
amount of fun, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt is almost as strong as Green in
a new role in one the new stories written for the movie. If you saw
"Looper" (or "Inception") you already know that JGL can play a tough
guy despite his physical size.Make no mistake this movie is a feature length Roadrunner cartoon for
adults --emphasis on "adults"--with all of the ridiculous action &
over- the-top violence that only a cartoon can get away with because of
the way it's rendered.(No kids, please: there is just enough gore that
isn't so cartoonish to make it unfit for children.)Like the first Sin City 9 years ago, this new Sin City is B-movie
bliss. (I still don't like Jessica Alba as "Nancy".)
