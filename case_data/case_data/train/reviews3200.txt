Bad episode of the Twilight Zone

There are 2 large flaws in Coherence.The main one is being written by a geek instead of a writer. A writer
can very well choose the passing of a comet as a source of strange
events, but a geek won't resist showing off that he read, and thought
he understood, about quantum physics and Schrodinger's cats. A writer
would have concentrated on the human story, and left the pseudo-science
to our discretion.The second flaw is that the thing is filmed like a US TV sitcom, from
the selection of camera to the flow of dialogue and the direction of
actors. If you're addicted to TV, you may ignore this comment, but to
me Coherence offers the same soulless feeling than the post 1980s
programs. I don't believe budget restrictions are a cause for such
atmospheric platitude.The movie does get better towards the end, although that's too late. It
gets better when a character finally realises what's happening and
decides to act. So far, a bunch of idiots were talking and behaving
randomly and uninterestingly. Finally, someone gets us interested in
finding out her purpose and her personality. The story would have
greatly benefited had that understanding been shared early, with more
characters fleshing out from there. Less of the so-called mystery and
more of the human motives.Small spoiler: The simple fact that none of the (more than) many people
involved try to meet their match is an aberration and a missed
opportunity.
