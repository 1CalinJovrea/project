Stronger Review

Stronger is a brilliant film with strong performances by Jake
Gyllenhaal, Tatiana Maslany, and especially Miranda Richardson. David
Gordon Green's choice to use practical lighting and creating a setting
that seems real results in an extremely sincere film. John Pollono
writes a script that held true to Jeff Blauman's story by focusing more
on his struggles and keeping the Boston Marathon tragedy in the
background. Also boobs.
