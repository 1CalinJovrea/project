Hmmmmmm?!?!

OK, let's get right to it. This is not good story telling. I need more
lines so, the actors, director, and whatnot can only work with what
they are given. And, in this case, they weren't given very much.Almost everything in the movie has been done before except better. I
was joking to my wife when I said there will probably be some zombies
or similar types attack them when they were underground, and to my
surprise (because I really was just joking) a horde of underground
"zombie like" creatures appeared and of course started trying to kill
them.This is what you would call an expensive "chick Flick". The hero is a
girl. The commanders are girls. The only real leader was Snow (Donald
Sutherland), and by the way, I think he did a great job as a villain.I guess my main complaint is that this is just a bunch of boring,
clich√©d, yawn-producing crud.Also, I just asked my wife her opinion of the movie, which we just
watched last night, and she said she doesn't remember what it was
about, and she doesn't have Alzheimer's. So, I guess that about sums it
up.
