Disappointing..apparently even for kids

If you've seen the trailer for this then it doesn't matter if you turn
up to the cinema 15 minutes late as the beginning is an extended
version of it with few extra jokes. The guy next to me obviously had as
he fell asleep during it! The cinema was full of children. Not children laughing. I suspect some
were actually bored by it. To be honest, I was expecting more jokes
myself but most of it is just a bit predictable and even uninteresting.The last 10 minutes produces the best parts, but you have to sit
through the rest of it to get there. All in all it was disappointing.
