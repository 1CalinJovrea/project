Comic Placebo for Serious Issues

Like most comedies, 'The Big Sick' is powder-puff drama spiced up with
some humorous moments. Its plot tells how a Pakistani-American stand-up
comedian embarks on a love affair with a blonde psychology student
after she heckles him during one of his stage shows. She breaks up with
him when she discovers his family are pressing him to choose a Muslim
bride for a traditional arranged marriage, but soon afterward falls ill
with a serious infection. While keeping vigil at her hospital bedside,
he realizes he's still deeply involved - and when her parents arrive,
the three of them attempt to break through some cultural differences.The characters and story possess some originality and relevance, but
the film's effect could have been far more intense if it hadn't focused
principally on laughs. Despite the strong emotional content - love,
family and ill-health - the film never escapes the clutches of light
comedy. The actors deliver respectable performances, but their efforts
can't lift the material above the level of a featherweight sit-com. Ken
Loach's 'A Fond Kiss' explores similar territory in a far more
memorable manner.
