Warcraft is simultaneously a successful VG adaptation and a poor stab at fantasy-action.

Did I miss the post-showing brief?! Little exposition leaves non-WoW
playing viewers in the lurch; characters, locations and the very crux
on the film  the Fell  are given very little explanation of
base-building. "Our world has been destroyed" feels cheap and lazy for
the whole Horde-invading premise. This poor foundation made the
remainder of the film totally uninteresting to me. The CGI is classically Blizzard-esque and the Orc scenes and settings
are the best in the film  character design is colourful and engaging 
they all look different. However, the same cannot be said for the
Humans  beards are dyed and have such well-groomed demarcation images
of the Berlin wall are conjured. Their sets feel unlived-in, clinical
and tacky in a Stargate SG-1 kind of way. The casting is equally
uninspired  specifically in the plucky mage turned hero  an entirely
average, intellectual-type who I imagine the aforementioned players are
expected to relate to. A half-breed predictably attractive and buxom
female Orc also seems to play to this demographic. The villain is lame
and doesn't scare me or even his Human counterparts. Don't get me wrong, fight scenes and visual effects are certainly high
points in what was a drudge in mediocrity, playing far too heavily to
its existing fan base.
