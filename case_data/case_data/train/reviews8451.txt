I want a revenge sequel

I loved Eli Roth immediately after Hostel 1. I knew this man can deal
with human nature. I follow his work since then. This feature shows a
man taken at his soft spot when he was not expecting any trouble.
Sometimes people give in to temptations of much lesser magnitude. He
made a wrong decision, he got what was coming. But the ending! Imagine
he is an idiot and cannot explain his wife that he was attacked and
framed. Imagine his wife is an idiot, did not believe him, took the
kids and divorced him. That would be the suggested ending, won't it.
What seems to be a moral story leaves an unfinished business. I want to
see the architect taking cold revenge. Track down the ladies, think a
little, and turn their lives into a living hell. They'd played their
game and had had their fun on account of the architect and other
people; now they have it coming. Give us the revenge sequel!
