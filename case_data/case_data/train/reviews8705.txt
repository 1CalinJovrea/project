Nothing special (Contains spoilers)

I've been a fan of Star Wars for a majority of my life, and this was a
major let down. The story is mediocre at best, with clich√©s and useless
characters riddled about. The story is nothing more than a fickle teen
running around with her pals trying to get the plans for the Death
Star. It has a few bright moments with their reprogrammed droid, K-
2SO, being the only good character out of the whole movie. The action
scenes fall short, and are more inclined to have something explode
rather than show the tide of a battle drastically change within a
second. As for the Death Star, well, it honestly only needed to be used
once. But no, go ahead and destroy a key base which has all of your
plans, most of which most likely don't have any back ups. I'm sure the
Emperor won't mind losing key military schematics. Then the movie fails
to even get the menacing Lord Vader's look right. Episode 3 did it well
enough, you can do it too Disney. This movie was an eye opener, critics
had nothing but praise for this movie, yet all I see is a big step in
the wrong direction.
