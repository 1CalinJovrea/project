Amazing Film!

The Place Beyond The Pines was a magnificent third feature from
director Derek Cianfrance. The performances were outstanding and it was
a great story. The three act structure was executed brilliantly and
were all tied together in a very satisfying way.The opening tracking shot was absolutely brilliant and did a great job
establishing Ryan Gosling's character without any dialogue. The
soundtrack, by Mike Patton, was impeccable and did a great job
capturing the tone of the film.The story of the film is really well told and does a great job dealing
with multiple genres. This film will appeal to anyone who wants to
watch captivating performances, intense drama, and a great story! I
highly recommend it!
