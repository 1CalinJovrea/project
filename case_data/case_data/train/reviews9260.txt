Amazing Movie ! A must for a sci-fi fan.

I read the reviews, it had enough good ones for me to give this movie a
shot. I am so glad I did, it was excellent and amazing. It is like
others have said a little Mad Max and a little Alien, but the did it
right. This movie could have easily been campy or bad.. but its not.
Its really good !!The ending is great, and leaves you wanting more.. so I hope a sequel
comes out. I would thin it will since the title has "volume one" in it.Another neat thing is the actors, they are not typical well known
American actors, I really only recognized a few.. that made the movie
even better !!
