The worst war reenactment I  have ever seen

I saw the movie with a number of friends this evening. Of the 10, 3 of
us are combat veterans, with a total of 5 wars between us. (2 Vietnam,
2 Desert Storm and a current war in the Middle East veteran.) All the
non-combat veterans thought the battle scenes were "so horribly, so
frighteningly realistic." Those who have been to war thought they were
incredibly cartoon-ish.The tactical mistakes such as bunching up, not seeking cover, bodies
flying through the air, artillery explosions obviously gasoline, all
the ridiculous yelling, were all so blatantly wrong. It was the worst
depiction of battle we ever saw.If the Japanese occupied the top of the "ridge" why didn't they simply
cut down the cargo netting the troops climbed? Why didn't they throw
grenades down on the assembled Americans below? How did the cargo
netting ever get there is US troops didn't already occupy the top of
the mountain? Vince Vaughn was the Basic Training sergeant, again, best described as
cartoon-ish. Peter Sellers as Inspector Cleuseau would have been more
realistic.Quite frankly, there is nowhere enough space here to tell you how bad
this movie really is.In reality, battle is hell, in some ways worse than what was shown on
the screen, but in terms of realism, this movie is atrocious.
