Epitaph of Great American Hero is Eastwood's Best Film

Few times does a movie remain entertainment yet tell a deep truth,
American Sniper manages just that. If one wanted a recent definition of
a American Patriot hero it's effectively brought to life by the
masterful direction of Clint Eastwood. This movie will be his crowning
achievement in a much celebrated career. Such a feat could not be
accomplished with just any story however. The life of Chris Kyle, and
what he stood for, makes a perfect synergy.Bradley Cooper's amazingly real depiction of a "complicated, yet simple
Texas cowboy" breathes life into a story surrounded by the darkness of
war. It single-handedly makes that phrase "The Greatest Generation" as
one that didn't end after WWII. It wouldn't be a stretch to say Coopers
got a lock on best actor after seeing the film.American Sniper is rare in that it feels brutality honest yet
palatable. While folks such as me led a very normal life stateside men
just like Chris Kyle were laying everything on the line for the very
belief of good we were enjoying. One can't help but feel humbled by
what these men accomplished. War is the worst of humanity without
doubt, but within war the best of America often rises above both evil
and politics. Chris Kyle was assuredly one of the finest examples in
all of American history of such and American Sniper is a fine testament
of which we all can be proud. See this movie for any number of reasons,
but take away the best we as Americans stand for.
