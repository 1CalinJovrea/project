24 October 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Morning -
The Book of Life. An unusual animation from the stable of Jorge R
Gutierrez. Joaquin, Maria and Manolo are best friends who are torn
apart when Maria is sent to Europe to calm her wild ways. The two boys
are both in love with her and when she returns, they compete for her
affections unaware their lives are being controlled by the two Lords of
the Underworlds, who have set a wager on the outcome of their love
triangle. La Muerta is the mistress of the beautiful and vibrant Land
of The Remembered, whilst Xibalba is the discontented ruler of the Land
of The Forgotten. The characters were portrayed as wooden puppet style
people, yet when they entered the Land of The Remembered they became
exquisitely carved skeletons. The animation was amazing. Apart from all
the characters in in three lands I found myself avidly watching the
backgrounds. The colours were so vibrant and the details were so
beautifully worked. This film was set around the Mexican Day of The
Dead and the whole feel of it came across as one glorious fiesta.
Another animation triumph and a spectacular musical score to match.
