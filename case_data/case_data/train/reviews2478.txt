Motivation is key

This is an excellent movie even for people that don't really enjoy
boxing. This movie goes way beyond the sport. It's the mindset behind
it that is portrayed. If you feel down and needs a heads up: this is
the movie to watch!After this movie, ask yourself again, what are my goals? Once you
figured that out, it is easy, just do it, and ace it and never look
back just focus on your goal and never stop.I know it is easier said than done, there are going to be hurdles
trying to stop you, but you just need to keep going. you are the star
