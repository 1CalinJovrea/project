The Hills have Eyes meets Wyatt Earp !

I watched this film very tired the other night and found myself sitting
up alert immediately !Pleasantly surprised I found it an entertaining macabre mystery
thriller horror with outstanding performances by a quality ensemble of
veteran actors working with good dialogue from a competent script. Normally expect relative unknowns to do this type of film and end up
with a B-Movie type of re-working of 'Hills with Eyes', but instead of
the atomic bomb test in-bread cannibalistic mutants we are dealing with
North American cannibalistic Indian savage troglodytes, That somehow have avoided being massacred by the U.S Union Calvary Army
and take revenge on some trespassers on their Indian burial ground and
follow one back to a small town, end up killing and kidnapping some
locals including a young woman whose husband, town sheriff, deputy and
local gun slinger go in hot pursuit.There is some elements from Ravenous 2001, Japanese horror film 'The
Audition' with hints of blinding and limb amputations. A quality low
budget movie with top notch acting from a first time director who wrote
the script.
