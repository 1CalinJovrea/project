omg...

Where do we start...the first 60 minutes are spent on watching a bunch
of teenagers being selected for the "games". I cannot tell you many
details, because i got so bored and partly annoyed after only ~15
minutes that i started playing a game while... watching.Bored by the meaningless dialogues, uninteresting characters (often in
laughable costumes), and a story floating right in the air.Annoyed by the camera work (i could probably do a better job shooting
some pictures), and just the overall atmosphere that suggests a game
where teenagers will be killed is a truly glorious event, like a snob
party. Hey, i wouldn't mind some nice hunting and splatter, but they
could at least try giving it a deeper meaning like Battle Royale did.So...after those 60 minutes are finally over, the action is supposed to
start. Right into a nice landscape we go, and while i didn't think the
camera could get any worse..it instantly did. Everything felt blurred
and bizarre.It was impossible for me to feel any emotions, while the first
teenagers got killed without *any* introduction. Oh the irony of
wasting 60 minutes of our life, and then not putting any effort into a
somewhat interesting start of the games.At this point i turned off this movie, couldn't take it anymore and i
watched a lot of crap.1/10 What's wrong with places like IMDb or rotten tomatoes these days, i
cannot tell you. I just know this movie sucks balls, and should never
be any higher than 4.0
