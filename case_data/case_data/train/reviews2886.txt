As the Title Suggests, this Film Really Begins to Flatline as it Progresses

When it comes to its great effects and spooky ambiance, Flatliners has
a lot of style, but when it comes to its narrative, the film is
significantly lacking in substance. As a fan of the original, alongside
being an admirer of Ellen Page, I was really looking forward to this
film, though by the end, left the cinema disappointed.Flatliners begins with Courtney (Page) experiencing a tragic loss. Nine
years later, she is a medical student, trying to convince her
colleagues to help with an experiment. Later in the film both events
are connected, though significantly more depth was required.As one can guess, Courtney's experiment involves her death, in an
attempt to record what happens to the brain after a person flat-lines.
Her friends Jamie (James Norton) and Sophia (the beautiful Kiersey
Clemons), originally discouraged with her intentions, quickly become
involved, as do Ray (Diego Luna) and Marlo (Nina Dobrev) when things
don't go according to plan.When characters travel to the other side, the use of light, sound and
motion are used wonderfully to create a fantastic experience, the world
beyond often visualised as been very beautiful, the music also adding
to the magic of the occasion. After returning from their near-death
experiences, characters are miraculously gifted with greater intellect,
an idea that is never elaborated upon. Moreover, despite the characters
been perceived as studious and intelligent, unlike the characters in
The Taking of Deborah Logan, rarely do the leads in Flatliners attempt
to use science, or their training, to find a solution to the problems
they face, instead behaving much like the stereotypes found in other
genre films.Though the always entertaining Kiefer Sutherland (who deserved a much
larger role) has a cameo, don't mistake this as a sequel Â– this feature
is in fact a remake, though it is disappointing we didn't get to see
Sutherland's Nelson again after all these years.Much like in the original, the characters begin to realise the
consequences of travelling to the other side. It is during these
moments, when the film fully embraces its dark material, that
Flatliners is at its best. The music adds to the already well developed
spooky atmosphere, and the performances of the cast further heighten
the sense of dread. Though occasionally predictable, the feature has
its share of unexpected scares, the chase sequences being very
gripping.Like the original, characters find themselves pursued by their 'sins',
though the secrets the characters have been harbouring are rarely
provided the required depth. Despite flirting briefly with the
supernatural, the film pulls on this string only once, which was quite
disappointing, the film rarely attempting to stray from the original.
Though the original shone a flashlight on bullying, racism, sexism and
betrayal, the remake is often centred around the competitiveness of the
medical profession, which joins each of the characters together.As the film progresses, the confrontation between the characters and
their 'sins' becomes progressively worse, been far more malicious than
what was experienced in the original. Though the film appears to be set
for an exciting climax, it is here that the movie appears to run out of
steam, and instead rushes towards a happy ending that does not do the
film justice.Flatliners is never boring, capturing the fun lives of the up and
coming professionals of tomorrow, and the horror of when things go
terribly wrong. The latter however is not given the depth it deserves,
and coupled with its weak conclusion, the richness of the films
potential goes largely untouched.
