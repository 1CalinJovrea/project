Well that was bleak.

I just finished watching Logan and--oh my God--what a dismal, dreary,
dreadful and dumb bit of cinematic nihilism that was. Brutally and
graphically and disturbingly violent too.All those tremendous adventures the X-Men had in years past? All the
times they defeated evil villains? The camaraderie, the sense of
family--of a home for misfit mutant kids? The risks and victories and
sacrifices? Yeah, it was all ultimately meaningless.I can understand if they felt they needed to kill off the old X-Men but
they did so in such a way as to make every previous X-Men movie and
story appear to have been a foolish exercise in futility. A miserable
and lonely future awaits, addled and alcoholic, only to be relieved by
violent death. Yay.This could have been an uplifting homage to the ideal of what the X-Men
were. But Hugh & Patrick & Co. apparently decided they would rather go
out with a sad whimper instead of a celebratory bang.
