Depends on the viewer

If you haven't read the book they did an excellent job with the special
effects and graphics. Things very much reflect the current American
viewpoint on military behavior and the representative mix of races and
gender at the battle school. If you like the book, the mutation of fundamental points of the story
makes this movie a complete waste of time. It has been warped into
basically an action movie with only a shell of meaning. After loving
the book for so many years I found myself repeatedly saying outloud,
"WTF!".!Spoilers! I have no idea why they moved the entire formic invasion
into the atmosphere instead of leaving it spread throughout the solar
system. I have no idea why Dap got changed into a drill sergeant
instead of being a substitute mother figure. I have no idea why they
wussied out on Bonzo's death scene. I have no idea why Bernard lost his
french accent and his broken arm and became a supporter of Ender. I
have no idea why they allowed Ender to contact Valentine while in
school. I have no idea why they erased the colonization movement after
the war and had Ender find the cocoon in walking distance of the
military base. I have no idea why a key part of general training in the
book, the mind game, became something specifically authorized for Ender
instead of everyone. I don't know why in the giant's drink game they
made all the drinks look the same instead of having the variety
described in the book. At least they didn't have Ender getting
romantic.
