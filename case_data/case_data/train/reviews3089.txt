The 7th (and hopefully last) movie of the Rocky franchise seems to be
considered the best after the original by the critics but don't believe
the hype cause it's merely disappointing. The movie on the surface
tries to go to a different direction exploiting all underground
stereotypes. The hero is a young black that listens to hip hop. Rocky
has retired and manages his wife's Italian restaurant. The biker gangs
of Philadelphia support them. The young fellow is in war with his last
name, Creed, and what that represents. The easily foreseen screenplay
includes amped-up training sequences and climates to a title fight with
an absurd number of punches landed in every round. Stallone's character
suffers from (spoiler alert) cancer and there you have a golden globe
for him as well an Oscar nomination (wtf?) for best performance in a
supporting role. Stallone getting an Oscar sounds like the academy is
trolling us. The movie is extremely overrated (8.0 in IMDb, 94% in
rotten tomatoes) but even for a Rocky fan (as I am) it's extremely
predictable and completely lacks emotion.Grade: C- (D if you are not a Rocky fan)
