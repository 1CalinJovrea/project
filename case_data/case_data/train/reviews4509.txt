another dumb slasher

When I see this Maddie, I'm thinking she's begging to be killed living
in an isolated house all by herself, and with no hearing. A normal
person would live with other people, or get a dog, or get a gun, or
hang some mirrors around (to reduce blind spots).When she tried to cock a crossbow but didn't have the strength to do
so, her solution is to keep trying. A normal person would look for
other solutions instead of repeating what didn't work.And when she was shot with a crossbow bolt, the first thing she does is
pull out the bolt and bleed. Hmm.It'd be a more refreshing and surprising ending if the victim actually
gets killed because of her stupidity.In horror movies, people always appear more dumb. Why is that?
