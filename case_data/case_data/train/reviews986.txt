Best movie I see

The movie was pretty very perfect and the movie has good animation.
Especially the end credits 3 frame animation. Watch only one good fight
scene and no story elements or any story to follow at all. TBH not a
good reboot. No spinjitzu or anything that made the series first 2
seasons great. Me Lloyds only personality?
