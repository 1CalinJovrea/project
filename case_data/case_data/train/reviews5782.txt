If you thought 'Jack and Jill' was bad, you haven't seen anything yet !

For his last movie he broke a record with the Razzies Awards in getting
10 awards in every category such as Worst Movie, Worst Actor, etc. You
would think he could not hit more rock bottom. That is unless you've
been unfortunate to waste your hard earned money, and more importantly
your time, in seeing this movie. Perhaps they will add a new category
for this years awards so he can do another sweep and break last years
record. I am not even going to comment on the movie itself in this
review, as that is just even more time from my life I will not get
back. I am going to turn on the TV and watch anything that's on to get
my mind off this, even an infomercial on the Shake Weight, as that will
still be orders of magnitudes better then this movie.
