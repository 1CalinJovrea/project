Edward Snowden: Hero or traitor? Decide for yourself.

I'm sure my bias will be obvious, but no matter. Oliver Stone's bias is
well- known. Not a problem to me. If you're reading this, I imagine you
are smart enough to see past any bias. To me, this movie works on three
levels: as filmmaking, as entertainment, and as information. I am no
critic, but the acting, casting, cinematography, direction, etc.,
certainly seemed competent, if not outstanding. As entertainment, I
found it thrilling and very engaging. I feel that the most important of
those three levels I mentioned is information. This is where the film
shines most. Stone may be guilty of some factual errors and gross
manipulation here, but I detected no significant amount of either.
Most, if not all, of the essential information in this movie is easily
checked against online sources. If you are not familiar with the
Snowden story, I promise you will learn a lot that you really should
know. If you think you know the story up and down, I bet you will still
learn some meaningful things. I recommend going far beyond this film
and reading about Snowden from sources both for and against what he
did. In any case, I found the film to be most worthy of my time. I hope
you will, too. Don't miss this one!
