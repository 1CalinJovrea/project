Is ''Besson'' French for ''hack'' or ''p--nographer''?

Why is it that every time I stumble on a violence-filled mediocrity and
check on IMDb the director is Luc Besson. Everything he does is glossy,
violent, profane and empty. How does he get A-listers - even these
over-the-hill A-listers - to star in his movies. It's not like this
mess is redeemed by comedy. It's about as witty as being buried in an
Iowa cornfield. It's almost hard to believe how highly regarded Robert
DeNiro once was. At this point he's been a hack longer than he was ever
good.
