Poor writing and characters

There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be
disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad
guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow
everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever
know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer
nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced
Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists
solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with
Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different
world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main
characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll
my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in
Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because
the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed
by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet.
These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for
the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another
disappointing let down.
