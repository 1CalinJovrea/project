Where's the Big Switcheroo?

So the reason you pay $10 and sit two hours is for the big heist
payoff, right? Here it is: Instead of the cash being vacuumed into
plastic trash bags and hauled away by a garbage CART...get this...some
of the cash is vacuumed into plastic trash bags and hauled away by a
garbage TRUCK!I was anxiously expecting the big switcheroo to involve credit cards,
NASCAR winnings, gold bullion...ANYTHING...except more trash bags in a
slightly different trash disposal vehicle. Silly me (for wasting $10
and two hours).
