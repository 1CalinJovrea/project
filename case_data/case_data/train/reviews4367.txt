Just when I thought it couldn't get worse after Vol 1...

I'm going to keep it straight to the point. Just when I thought, after
vol. 1 that it couldn't get worse, along comes the nadir of blackness
and utter hopelessness. I know Von Triers from "Dancer In The Dark", a
film that I liked but found nearly unbearable to watch and only saw
once and never want to see again. I recognize the talent, however, and
braced myself for another helping. Little did I know what I was really
in for. The bottom line is that these films depict a world inhabited by
people that are desperately and hopelessly doomed. I've never seen such
nihilistic portrayals in my life. I'm all for "realism" in films but I
don't want to be thrown into the "real lives" of these people....no, no
a thousand times no! Their world is so bleak and hopeless and devoid of
any affection or warmth or light that it simply looses any sense to it.
The lives of these people have not an iota of the elements that make
living worthwhile so once that's realized, after about a minute, it
becomes pure torture. I pride myself on my level of tolerance for the
fetishes and idiosyncrasies that people have but sheer brutality is
something that I know exists but care not to be thrown into in brutal
graphic detail. These are the most bleak and depressing films ever made
to my knowledge.
