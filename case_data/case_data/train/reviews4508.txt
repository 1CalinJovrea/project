One dimensional characters in a movie that tries to cover up that it's just one of the poorest revenge flicks.

It gets one star for the beginning of this movie when it shocks you
with people death and walled in to a house. The ending of that scene
reduces a lot of the shock by not taking in the account of checking
everything properly in such a big operation as this seems to be. This
happens multiple times in the movie and I was really missing the
technological advancement these sort of agency's usually have.First half doesn't seem to matter cause in the middle everything gets
switched and it turns into a revenge flick that also doesn't seem to
make much sense. Especially the final scene is laughable because Del
Toro's entry into this big mansion is so easy it is hard to explain
that such an important cartel boss who could expect something like this
is so unprotected. I would at least expect something along the lines
like they did it in "scarface" with Al Pacino and that was way back in
the 80's.Emily Blunt,Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin all played roles way
beneath their top roles in other movies and a lot of characters and the
overall story were written poorly and only some set pieces stand out
and therefor it gets another star.I'm amazed I saw hints for a sequel and I don't even wanna think what
that would be like knowing how stupid this one was and I will
definitely pass on that one.This is just to much of a mess to be called realistic or even
entertaining and for me I am done with this and hope everyone involved
will go on and do something better.Will not go so far to not recommend this but I'll never watch it again.If you get something good out of it,I'm happy for you.But for me personally.....neh!
