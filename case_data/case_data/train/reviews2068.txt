Big hit, bigger miss.

It has been 12 years since John Goodman and Billy Crystal voiced the
original star characters. You would think by now Pixar could have come
up with a better story. The premise is in the title, the story is non
existent.Perhaps Mike doesn't see how bad this is because he is looking at it
through one big eye. The 3D up charge is wasted on Mike and everyone
else. The movie is long for a animated feature and it feels long and
redundant with scare games, scare contests and scarcely anything
happening.The good news is it isn't very scary and got a "G" rating. The bad news
is there isn't much there for the adult in the audience. It is not
funny.There is a message about cheating and consequences but it gives the
impression so what if you are kicked out of college. So what if there
is nothing to this prequel except a big box office.
