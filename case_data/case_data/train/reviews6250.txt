Exposition from a VA Series Reader whose not a YA

I have read all of the VA series and enjoyed them immensely, mainly
because of Rose. Rose Hathaway is feisty, determined, funny, and
flawed, and it was always fun to see what she would do next and how
that would land her in trouble. This story is not your "typical
vampire" story. Everyone in the story already knows about vampires and
the makeup of the society they live in. Nor is it a damsel in distress
story. Rose already possesses strength and determination, although she
does have impulse control issues. She is best friends with the vampire
princess, Lissa Dragomir who is the last of her line, and extremely
loyal and protective of her.The movie and books have been compared to many other YA/vampire genre,
but the story does not follow Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey outline.
Both Star Wars and Harry Potter did excellent jobs capturing the hero's
journey, and the Twilight series followed Carl Jung's development of
the soul and the anima/animus well. Mead does not use either of these
outlines/archetypes in her books, and her storytelling provides a
freshness, as well as giving a portrayal of strong women who look out
for each other.Perhaps, the story could be compared to "Thelma and Louise" navigate a
dysfunctional high school that just happens to have vampires and magic.Now for the movie itself: the tone and pacing of the movie are very
much Rose and are true to the tone and pacing of the books. I actually
liked the new scenes that were added to the movie Â– they did not
distract in ways that other book-to-movies have done, but actually
enhanced the story. I think the movie represented all the dynamics of
the various relationships well, although I do wish the Rose/Dimitri
relationship had been better developed. There wasn't the tension
between them that there was in the books. And although I wish I could
have forgotten the story (and the previews) during the movie so that I
could have enjoyed the movie without all that knowledge, I did find
myself getting lost in the movie.Of all the first time movies of various popular YA book-to-movie
adaptations that I have read and seen, I think this movie was one of
the better ones that has been done.
