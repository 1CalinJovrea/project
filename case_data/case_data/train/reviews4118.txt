Wow! What an amazing action filled, tension filled zombie flick. I enjoyed this more than World War Z.

Saw this on a pirated DVD. Unfortunately it released in theatre jus aft
one week of my viewing. I am a big endorser of viewing films in
theatres. I enjoyed this more than World War Z. This movie is very
entertaining. Fast paced, nicely edited, nicely acted, awesomely
directed, tension filled film. Surprisingly its an awesome
action/zombie thriller without guns, bullets, helicopters, ex navy/army
or doctor/scientist leads. This movie had strong character developments
which is rare in a horror film. Viewers may genuinely care for its
characters. One may crib that the zombies were too fast (similar to
World War Z) or there was no gore. Believe me its much better than
World War Z or recent zombie films. The pace, the action and the
tension will make u forget those minor cribs. The cinematography is
awesome. The camera angles were very good n plus the isolated train
stations, some good aerial shots of the train. This is an edge of the
seat thriller. Not for a single second I paused the movie or fiddled
with my fone. The movie displays plenty of social commentary.I was rooting for the husband of the pregnant female. He was one
helluva bad ass and selfless fighter.
