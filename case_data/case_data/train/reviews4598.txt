The first movie I have ever truly hated.

This is the first movie that I can say that I actually hate. Definitely
one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I new it had bad reviews
before but I though I would give it a shot. I regret this, don't watch
this movie if you value humanity. Women are objectified and men are
shown to be morons. The humor is gross, slap stick, and crude and even
though it may get the occasional laugh it is not satisfying. This would
have been okay if it had a plot, but there is no plot. This movie is so
disjointed that not only does it go in the sh*t list, but so does every
actor who played in this including the non-actor - Shaquille Oneal.What is even worse is that they had a lot of great material that they
could have developed, but it is like they just gave up. The daughter
with her hidden talent, the estranged father son relationship, the
surprise pregnancy, the fake affair, and the bullying. There could have
been some important life lessons taught and some even better more
developed comedic situations, but it has none of this. The slap stick
and farts take the dominant role. This does not even deserve a spoiler
warning, because you can't spoil something so sh*tty.
