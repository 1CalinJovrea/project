Wow!

Being an avid Thriller watcher, I came across this Gem by
accident....and what an adventure this movie takes you on. Who Done It,
comes to mind and just when you have solved it, it then twists you into
another scenario. It is in Spanish and there are Subtitles, but it
doesn't take away from this masterpiece. Well done, Oriol Paulo for his
direction, and well done on the film editing. I will be watching out
for more of Paulo's films. Well and truly worth the watch.
