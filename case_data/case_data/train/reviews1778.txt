Daniel Bruhl even beats Oscar bound Leonardo

Niki Lauder is among the most well known personalities in the history
of Formula One. Even today millions of Germans watch his TV
presentation at every race. We know his manner and speech extremely
well and any actor portraying him faces an uphill if not impossible
task. But Daniel Bruhl delivers a performance so wonderfully convincing in
his faithful and profound portrayal that he should clearly be among the
Oscar nominees for Best Actor. The story of Lauda's famous struggle
with Hunt in 1976 has become the stuff of legends. And perhaps this
production has used some artistic license to enhance them. But the film isn't really about the thrilling story of those events.
That's just the vehicle for a much deeper drama examining the ever
relevant dialectic between hedonism and pragmatism. It's about the self
beneath the skin rather than the glamor of the surface: a concept
normally quite alien to the Oscar awarding Hollywood elite. So poor
Daniel Bruhl must await another vehicle to display his superb talents.
And one day he might be remembered internationally in his career as
Niki was himself.
