10
I gave it 10 as it is both novel and brilliant - though if I explained why I might spoil it for you

The writer has obviously thought about the challenge of building AI
seriously. I have heard it before and will reiterate this shared
insight - Transcendence (2014) is ahead of its time. In a way perhaps
one's enjoyment of the film will be a function of what one most wants
from a movie. If this is emotional support, intellectual ease, or
philosophical certainty; then perhaps it is not the right film for you.
It definitely leaves more than one door open; in the characters also.Â I did speculate over some apparent inconsistencies but these are
folding the more I think about it. That is part of the fun with good
movies; to try and work out why things happened the way they did. I
won't detail these. I rarely rate a movie that doesn't draw me back and
invite me to deconstruct it. If every single thing clicks the first
time then perhaps it is too simple. I will end the review on that
theme.
