simply wonderful...

what can i say?this movie is simply a masterpiece. this movie is what i hope to see
every time i enter a cinema.this movie is warm, engaging, natural, simple, cruel, human... it is
everything at once.i cried my soul out, it is unbelievable how danish directors (lars von
trier and thomas vinterberg) are able to move me with their movies.story is superb. casting is superb. acting is superb. directing is
superb.they say danish people are cold and detached, denmark being a northern
country. no one ever takes me to such an emotional journey as danish
directors... i think i should marry a danish guy ;)let me sum it up with what i already said before: this movie is the
reason why i go to the cinema in the first place. not for the
entertainment, but for the art. for that feeling that i just read a
wonderful book. that feeling of satisfaction that i just did something
great for my soul. purging, cleansing of my soul, if i may say it that
way.beautiful. thank you, thomas vinterberg... and thanks to the rest of the crew.
