Terrible, terrible, terrible!

A film with little substance or meaning. Zero plot, zero character
development and zero fulfillment after watching. Cardboard actors, poor
plot line (wasteland zombie survival by inexperienced 'teens' with luck
on their side). I simply cannot understand why Hollywood can continue
to churn out such condescending and boring films like this which cost a
fortune to make (wow - must be good if cost $100million!). I can only
think that Hollywood marketing overrules common sense of young adults
whom Hollywood execs think are easy to hoodwink to pay and watch tripe
like this. It's up to you, but if you go and watch this and waste your
money watching the same, then don't blame me for not warning you. Total
garbage and about 2 out of 10 from a film lover with 35 years viewing
experience.
