Awesome film

Loved it. Jessica is very believable as uptight and smart, her lines
are delivered with sharp intensity and she is just darn right sexy.Beautiful sets and cinematography. Cool wardrobes. Excellent whistle
blowing. Any film that exposes truths about how massive greed and
corruption are is a needed film to see.The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption and
how deep it goes. Seeing an educated, powerful women with needs also shows realism. The score is also nice.This is a great film and is very underrated!
