It Follows... is just horrible.

This movie is so f. boring from the start until the very end.. I'm
surprised I didn't fall asleep. I mean, a sexual transmitted curse in
which a ghost that can look like anyone follows you... walks after you
everywhere you go.. Walks.. really slow.. and if it catches you it
kills you. "Oooo".How is that scary? Haha. Other than this you get no backstory and I
felt they only ran around in circles trying to defeat this thing, by
that I mean trying the same things over and over even though it did not
work the first time... hilarious in a way. Such a stupid story, with
bad acting. Not once was I scared and I watched it alone. It was not at
all worth my time. Don't watch it. To be honest I don't get how anyone can think this is anything other
than trash. If you want to get scared for real I'd recommend Dead
Silence (2007) or Grave Encounters (2011) some of my favorites in the
horror genre.
