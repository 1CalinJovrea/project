Full Metal Fame Jacket...Or something.

I gave it 28 minutes. That was generous, in that I knew it was going to
be terrible within about 2.I've been to music school. It's not like this. The teachers aren't like
this. No one's like this (obviously I'm referring to 'Hollywood idea of
what a hard-ass music teacher might be like in some weird juvenile
negative fantasy' Fletcher).I switched off when he threw a chair at Andrew the drum prodigy and
then slapped him. SLAPPED him. Repeatedly. In front of a whole, cowed
class of what, in legal terms, would be called witnesses to an assault,
for playing slightly fast, the first time he's ever played to him in a
band practice.I'm sorry, what?! Where does this/would this/has this ever happened? In
a Charles Dickens novel about a jazz drum student, possibly. In
anything even vaguely purporting to be based on real life now, um...No.I'm stunned. Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest that
is so laughably bad, you have to check the page again to really believe
it's got such high praise.Excruciating nonsense.
