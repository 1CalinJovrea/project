Compassion is that which makes the heart of the good move at the pain of others. It crushes and destroys the pain of others; thus, it is called compassion.

This is an amazing movie. Emotive, political and even
spiritual.Therefore I would liken Savages to The Godfather, in its
depth, And study of the the male ego.When natural Born killers was released it was banned in the UK. Perhaps
part of the reason was its moral code? As it was controversial as much
as it was integral. Savages on a basic level deals with relationships
and the way that the form the fabric of our humanity. Refreshingly
Polygamy is given a supportive portrayal as is drug use.Furthermore the
emotional destruction caused by firearms is very clearly portrayed. The ending is one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen in a
film. And is created to invoke intimacy with the viewer. challenging
the way media feeds us clich√©s. The changes that each character go through enables each of them to
become more spiritually whole. each person must face their own demons :
whether it is compassion for a ex solider, sadism for a Buddhist. or
humility for someone with vanity.As Families can be found in all walks
of life and this film shows how a family in love can creates a
spiritual space, a dampening of the ego. Likewise the opposite a family
without love will wither. even from the most aggressive of hands. I
would then conclude the ego plays a large part in the making of a
'savage.' For when we have no-one to yield to, are we are left with stagnation? I
took all of this and more from this great movie.
