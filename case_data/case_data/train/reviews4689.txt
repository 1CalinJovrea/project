Simply AMAZING

How to put it in words? I haven't been left so overwhelmed by a movie
since the 2006' illusionist. This is a Masterpiece. This is Cinema.
Everything in this movie is perfect: the script is amazing; the filming
and editing are beyond words; the acting is perfect. Obviously as as
been written, the movie is violent but i would't say that it is not
easy to watch: the violence is just there, as a part of the world and
its protagonists and no concessions are made in showing it. For me,
probably one of the very best movies I ever saw; along with 1986' 8
million ways to die and the 2006' the illusionist. Simply amazing.
