So disappointed

I watched the first movie I believe at least 50 times, one of my
favourite movie since the last 10 years; however this Vol. 2 really
disappointed me. I think it's a goofy movie for kids, a bit different
from the first one. The "funny" scenes have been dramatized too much,
so much that they became stupid jokes. The movie itself is too long, no
funny movie should ever be so long. You cannot keep people laughing for
more than 2 hours...even if the movie was a REALLY funny movie (which
it was not). I was expecting coming out this Vol. 2 for so long...I
guess I created too many expectations for it. Go to watch the movie
thinking that would be "just OK", my 2 cents.
