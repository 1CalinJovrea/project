Cool black comedy - don't expect anything artful or serious and you're in for a fun ride.

I just watched "The Family" and I for one have had a very good time.
This movie is gleefully dark, wickedly funny and offers great acting
from all the stars involved, (who really seem to relish their parts). I
was shocked when I checked IMDb and found so many comments and reviews
from disappointed film fans. How can anyone complain about the violence
in this dark comedy and at the same time love films like "Fargo" (or
practically anything by the Coen Brothers, for that matter)? I came to
the conclusion that the main reason behind all the negative reviews is
that people expected something more akin to "LÃ©on", "Goodfellas" or
"The Godfather" (where the violence isn't played for laughs), when in
fact this is something completely different: This is a black comedy
about a group of predators who have to hide among - unbearably arrogant
- sheep. You can imagine how well that will turn out (for the sheep).
Anyway, I admit that with other actors involved, this would probably
just have been an average mob comedy, but with the kind of talent you
get here, it's hard not to have a blast. My rating: 7 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/
