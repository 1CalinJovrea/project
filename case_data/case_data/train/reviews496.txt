Minnie's Haberdashery, where the elite meet

You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney
Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living
participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene
O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.The action is set up when the stagecoach where bounty hunter Kurt
Russell is taking his prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh to the town of Red
Rock to be hung. A couple of prairie hitchhikers also come on board
another bounty hunter Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins son of a
former Confederate general who says he's the new sheriff in the town of
Red Rock. Kurt Russell replete with full flowing beard and mustache is
one suspicious man. He has those suspicions justified before the film
is ended.80% of the action takes place on set of the 19th century bed and
breakfast during the time of a nasty Wyoming winter and does the dialog
crackle. If you think you're going to see a western the kind that John
Ford or Howard Hawks or Henry Hathaway did back in the old days, then
don't watch The Hateful Eight. Hateful is the operating word with these
characters, there's nothing really noble about any of them.Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin
Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off
each other. As the outlaw queen Jennifer Jason Leigh got a Best
Supporting Actress nomination, but in my humble opinion she doesn't
stand out any more than any of the rest of them. The Hateful Eight also
earned Ennio Morricone an Oscar for the best musical score for 2015.The Hateful Eight is a great western, but it ain't your grandpa's kind
of western.
