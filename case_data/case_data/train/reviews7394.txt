This can't be true:(

I went to see this movie the other day and since I'm a big fan of the
books I was all so excited to actually be able to see my fantasy on the
big screen. But as the movie started playing everything went down the
hill. They have changed basic dates which play a big part in the whole
story since certain events happen at specific time and they actually
change the whole story. With the exception of the funny poetry scene
with Erik everything else was.. how can I put it politely? Bad. I
couldn't even understand the feelings the characters were supposed to
be feeling before they were spoken out loud. In the books there is a
certain motive, communication-battle- communication-adventure, so
you're able to understand what's going on. But in the movie you just
don't get it. The movie itself is a spoiler, it gives way too much
information which is supposed to stay hidden because it makes the
upcoming story more interesting and breathtaking. In conclusion, I really think that the books had good potential for
becoming a movie without changing everything, which unfortunately
happened.(Read the books, they are amazing. and skip the movie)Dear Hollywood, make a remake.
