1
worst movie of the year

This movie was terrible. I can't say one good thing about it. There was
absolutely nothing funny about it. I like both Jonah Hill and Channing
Tatum, but they were awful in this. Even the whole drug plot was just
dumb.Action scenes were just lame and even the bad guys were just so
unoriginal. And having 2 cops jealous of each other while undercover in
college. I think a 9 year old could have written a better story. I mean
who came up with the octopus in the beginning, terrible.FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps the worst big budget movie in a long time. Don't
waste 2 hours of your life.
