Don't judge with an iron fist... see it for what its worth...

This movie does not deserve such a low score. I think this has to do
with the fact that this movie wanted to please the new and the old. In
doing so, it attracted low ratings from hardcore fans of the 1995 manga
movie from one side and young teens who don't really understand the
full depths of this movie. Simply put: too easy for old fans and too
hard for young ones. For example I am a fan of the 1995 manga movie but
I really liked this one even though it wasn't as deep as the first
movie. But it was fun and clever nonetheless with good CGI action. The
main character was absolutely fantastic. Personally I think she was
perfect for the role.
