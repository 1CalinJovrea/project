Gory? Sure. Fun Gory? Meh..

You know the story. Heads explode, people are stabbed, sliced, and
shot. I'd rather see 'Final Destination' type creativity with this sub-
genre. It's decent enough to watch. Nothing to rush out and see right away,
though.Gore without creativity no longer amuses me. It once did. But I'm a
grow ass man, now.Please hit the "this review was not helpful" button. I love that. I try
to give an honest opinion about a film and people are going to hate on
it. It is what it is. But, this movie was mediocre at best.
