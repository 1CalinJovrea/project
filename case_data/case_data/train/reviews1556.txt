A Little Bit Bland

'Safe Haven' is from the same author as romantic classic 'The
Notebook.' 'Safe Haven' is not exactly as generic as 'The Notebook' but
it does qualify as pretty boring in terms of cinematic exploration. Despite the story  on paper  seeming fairly interesting and
relatively unique to the romantic genre, the film still manages to bore
you for the first hour of it. In fact, the last 30 minutes of the film
are sadly the most interesting. Before that we have endless
conversations that seem pointless and clichéd, naff romantic gestures
and unrealistic characters. Domestic abuse is sadly a very real problem
for many but this film somehow makes the issue seem very unrealistic
and as something so dramatic it could never happen in real life.
Beautiful people deal with their problems in a beautiful, idyllic small
town very quickly and very easily, it isn't exactly interesting. The acting was a lot better than I had expected; Julianne Hough was a
bit flat in some scenes but her performance wasn't bad  just not
memorable. Josh Duhamel gave a fairly good performance; he was not
playing a pretty face with zero background like he has done in other
films and he managed to show he can act with at least a little depth.
David Lyons gave the best performance in the film but unfortunately had
the least amount of screen time. Playing the creepy, alcoholic, abusive
husband, he made the final act worth watching and was quite scary.Overall, the film certainly is not a bad film; it just isn't a very
interesting or memorable one. It's full of clichés and there are not
many emotional, heart-warming scenes so it is a little bit bland.
