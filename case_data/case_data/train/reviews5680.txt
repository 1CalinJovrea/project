Nothings been the same since new-york!

How do i put this? Nothings been the same same since newyork. Just saw
Iron man 3. and what do i say? Freakinglegendary.. A MARVEL-ous start
of the Phase 2.. RDJ you were...you.. as always..we know who you are!
Even if you take away all the tricks and toys and all the money and the
suits. YOu can fix this. You are the 'Mechanic' !Mandarin..never saw you coming..really.. Guy Pearce great job.. Gwyneth
outstanding.. Shane Black.. Hats off... It was more of a Shane Black
movie than the marvel movie.. Just don't know what to say.. still in
anxiety attack..!!;) Was it the end of the iron man trilogy? or the
start of the phase 2? cant say.. but one thing I can say and which you
cant take away.. " I AM Iron Man..!!"
