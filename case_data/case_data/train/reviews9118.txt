Disappointing.

It sucks that they had to put up a poster of this movie with Duke
(Channing Tatum) and Joe (Bruce Willis) so grossly misleading when Duke
showed up about what 10 mins or so then dies and Joe shows up when half
of the movie is already finished, and not getting much burn at that (I
should have known, how many of Willis's recent movies has been like
this already). For an average movie goer like me (i'd like to think of
myself like that) that doesn't normally go researching(goggling stuff)
before watching a movie, I was sucked up by the poster itself expecting
a whole lot of Duke and Joe in action. In my opinion, The Rock is not a
bad actor himself but sadly he is not able to carry the movie by
himself. I believe the movie producers/marketers or whoever is
responsible for creating that misleading poster cheated people for
their money. To be honest I am not sure I would be going to watch the
movie in theater had I known I would be only getting this much, It's
one of the movies I could have waited to be available on HBO\TV or on
DVD. I did like the special effects though, especially the mountain
action scenes.
