Hilarious and so much fun to watch!

I had been anticipating watching this movie since I first saw the
trailer. I love this movie!! I saw it with my closest girl friends and
we laughed out loud throughout the entire movie. I will definitely
watch this again and again. The story was great and the characters were
a lot of fun to watch. The cast was absolutely perfect and I don't
think they could've done a better job casting this movie. I had no idea
Tiffany Haddish was so funny! I appreciate a great FEEL GOOD story like
this one and I love that the bond of the characters is one that
inspires women to stick together and support one another. Well done!
