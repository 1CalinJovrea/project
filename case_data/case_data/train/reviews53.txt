Tulip Mess

Several reasons may tempt you to watch Tulip Fever. In my case those
were the historical background (Amsterdam, 17th century) and the
actors. Indeed both factors are worth noting. Based on trailers one
could easily mix up characters of the movie with the figures from
Rembrandt paintings. It seemed that production design was done at its
best so that the viewer is dipped into the epoch. Plus, characters are
played by famous actors, Christoph Waltz, Alicia Vikander and Dane
DeHaan. Interestingly, Clara Delevingne is also there, as if we see a
prequel of Besson's Valerian.Despite the mentioned ingredients, which if used properly could be a
good recipe for the Oscar contender, the movie is a disappointment. The
biggest problem is probably the script. Dialogues and actions do not
convince at all. The historical tulip fever in the movie is not
impressive at all. The romantic line is shown very superficially. It is
really difficult to believe that what you see on screen could actually
happen in reality. There is an obvious lack in the development of
characters. Due to this they may surprise you a lot during the film.
Some story moves are completely unexpected. The director's work also
raises questions. The authors of the movie have not decided for
themselves how serious their movie has to be: whether it should be a
drama, a comedy, or rather a TV show. It seems that the movie starts in
one genre and ends in another. Of course, some movies are difficult to
be attributed to a specific genre, for instance, some pure art-house
joints. However, in this case this is not art-house at all, and jumping
between different ways of storytelling is not a good idea.So, the only reason to watch this movie is to convince yourself that
good actors play sometimes in bad movies.
