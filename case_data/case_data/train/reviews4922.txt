Excellent, and refreshingly so

I knew nothing about this film when we sat down in the cinema tonight
to see it, so I had no expectations. But from the opening moments I
found myself completely engaged by the acting, and interested in the
characters straight away.Christian Bale has not done much for me in recent years, but he was
captivating in this, and in every single scene. His physical
transformation into a slightly overweight conman with a bad comb-over
was enhanced by his believable character portrayal, and I have renewed
respect for him now as an actor that can be damn interesting to watch.Bradley Cooper was brilliant, as was Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer
Lawrence, and Louis C.K.. There wasn't a single person that didn't pull
their weight, and it makes the film's more-than-2-hour-length fly by.There's not much in the way of physical action...in fact, I can't think
of anything any action at all really...but the drama of the film is so
well handled that action simply isn't necessary. Even the comedic
moments were handled superbly.I'd love to criticise something, cos no film is perfect, but this is a
tough one to find fault with...maybe I would have left out Lawrence's
dance scene when she mimed to Live and Let Die, cos it felt slightly at
odds with the rest of the film in my opinion, but that's being
seriously harsh.So, to sum up, if you want a movie with top acting, big stars,
brilliant dialogue, no over-the-top action and a well thought out story
(with some historical truth mixed in), then this one is for you.Trust me, you won't be sorry!
