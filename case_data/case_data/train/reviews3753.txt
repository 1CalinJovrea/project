The Dark Knight rises quite high, Nolan's destiny has been fulfilled.

The Batman series by Christopher Nolan was and is probably one of the
best superhero series ever. In an industry where very few sequels have
been that good, The Dark Knight, I believe was designed by Christopher
Nolan to be head and shoulders above Batman Begins; and it was. The
Dark Knight surpassed Batman Begins, end of story. Now that you have
accomplished what very few have managed, how do you surpass this one. A
daunting and mountainous task indeed. Only now, Nolan wasn't even
trying to surpass it. He was merely trying to present a movie that
would build on its predecessor.The movie is set 8 years after the Joker incident so that anything
related to the Joker need not be shown (RIP Heath Ledger). Nolan
presents us a completely different Gotham. A different take on it. And
how 8 years can change people. How the harvey dent and joker incident
can affect people and batman himself. In a time of peace, it is quite
easy to plan and attack even an entire city. Everything is taken into
concern. And it all adds up to one seemingly invincible villain. The
logic is never lost at any point of time. The screenplay is penned to
allow the impact of what has happened to Gotham and its people in "The
Dark Knight" and what could happen if something goes wrong now.All things said, if you are expecting something better than The Dark
Knight, you are mistaken. This was never going to compete or surpass
that. This is a very good movie in its own right. As for the series,
there cannot be a better conclusion and I really hope nobody else
continues this series if Nolan decides not to.TDKR needs to be appreciated for staying true to its roots and still
giving us something good, exhilarating and unexpected.
