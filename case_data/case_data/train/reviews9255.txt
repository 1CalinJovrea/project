If you are looking for a horror movie DON't WATCH!

This movie is about kids just going around having sex to pass on a
ghost that no one knows where it comes from or how to get it of.
There's no real story to this. Also these kids are teenagers and
there's no parents around, ever! The movie never takes off, it's slow
and boring, There's no scary parts, unless you are 10 and get scared
with a ghost that takes weeks to get to you. The plot is poor, there's
no real dialogue I could've been watching a good movie with a good
ending that didn't leave you hanging the way this one did. Worst two
hours of my life. I can't even laugh at this movie because there's not
enough interaction or dialogue between the actors. It was a bad movie,
although the acting was somewhat OK, but since I didn't like the whole
dialogue of the movie and their interactions I can't really say much
about their acting. I'm trying to be nice here. But seriously. WATCH
SOMETHING ELSE!
