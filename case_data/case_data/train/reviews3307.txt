hard to recommend to an adult

I wasn't particularly keen to see this in view of the very modest
rating but upon closer inspection I discovered that generally this was
marked down because it was felt that an unnecessary amount of blood and
gore spoiled the well crafted artifice and theatricality of the piece.
I beg to differ without the aforementioned blood and gore I fear I may
have dropped off. The Jane Goldman script is fine, Bill Nighy is as
good as I have ever seen him, Olivia Cooke is radiant and shines
throughout while Douglas Booth is most effective. And yet.. this is
cloaked in such colourful and campy theatrics that for me at least
there is always a considerable distance between what is on the screen
and what is in my head. Nothing is convincing, even those 'Yorkshire'
and 'London' locations. Just how much is real street and how much CGI
is impossible to tell. There is also much repetitiveness with whole
scenes created with slight variation and by the end although there is
nothing outrageously wrong with the film it would be hard to recommend
to an adult.
