Verey funny spoof

I loved this film. I didn't have high hopes when I chose it on Netflix
but laughed more than I have done for ages. It's not Citizen Kane, OK,
but it has more laughs. It is sweary, and a bit crude but it all works.
Statham is superb, sending himself up and I even liked Jude Law.
Miranda Hart does her usual thing, but again it works. My partner told
me to say how nice it was to see an older, none thin women, in a
leading role!
