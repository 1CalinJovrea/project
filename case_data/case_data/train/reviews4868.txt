sensational

After a very lackluster 2012 Frightfest Festival with only a very few
memorable films and much straight to video crap this came as a
sensational blast. After a great deal of stuff showing rape as fan boy
entertainment this was brilliant. The Soska Sisters have added a
feminist spin to a Cronenburgesque tale of body modification and
surgery. There is a lot of stuff here about body image and The reason
this film was so compelling a many but include: 1. Oscar worthy central
performance which makes it the best Horror acting for ages. 2. Sheer
unpredictability 3. A horror film by and about women 4. Real setting
not a suburban Disneyland 5. Cool and stylish direction that thankfully
restrained itself when you thought you were just about to witness
something that might need a sick bag. 6. Make up and prosthetics that
showed you stuff you definitely won't see in the average Horror. I
could go on but you really need to see this if you like Horror and it
deserves to be seen by a wider audience (although I doubt ti will
succeed with a multiplex crowd)
