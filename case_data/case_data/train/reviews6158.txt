Finally a scary movie!

I went in to seeing this movie after reading the book, and personally I
thought it was great. Horror movies these days get loss in blood and
gore and that's what the work thinks is "horror" these days, thankfully
this movie took a turn to what horror actually is. There are plenty of
scenes that make you jump and keep you on the edge of your seat and the
storyline is great too. The only weird thing was there were just a
couple scenes in which I just couldn't help but think of Harry potter
but that didn't even come close to ruining it for me. I was nervous
because I thought they Showed all the scary moments through the
previews but they did not! Daniel Radcliffe did a great job and I would
go see it again with out a doubt. We need to see more horror movies
like this one!
