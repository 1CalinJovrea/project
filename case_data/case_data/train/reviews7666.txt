Very important movie!

Everyone that had a death in the family ,would probably relate more to
this movie. This movie has a great message about life. Everyone needs
to learn from it. I want to say thank you, to all the actors and all
the people that were involved in this movie.I watched this movie twice,
because it was so emotional to me and it got me re thinking on my life,
after my mother's death.
