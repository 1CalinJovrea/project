Quintessence of Life

This is my first review ever. I was tensed over some issues since
morning then I saw the movie. It took me to a whole new level, gave me
peace. There is so much to admire about the film that you can just
ignore the small imperfections left at key places. This is the best move of Ben Stiller I have watched so far. The
background score is amazing, the dialog's are awesome & the screenplay
with the beautiful surroundings is really fabulous. Ben Stiller has rocked the movie and Sean Penn though got only 1 scene,
has done complete justice to his role. Go for it, it will simply relax
you in your pacey life.
