I am surprised by the acclaim for this movie.......

I get why movies like this get nominated for Best Picture and why
topical pictures get so much attention and star-studded casts. It's an
If this worth an Oscar...how it won best picture is beyond me!!!!
Seriously though, it's just dull. There is nothing in this movie that
is cinematically interesting. Just scene after scene of people in
varying states of agitation either reading or speaking. Compare this to
a movie like Steve Jobs (2015) which is also very dialogue heavy and
note all the various ways in which Boyle and crew aid their dialogue
through camera movement, interesting angles and shadowing, etc. It
makes you realize how thoroughly uninteresting Spotlight is in that
particular way. Spotlight could have been done as a picture book with a
few sentences of dialogue per page and Mark Ruffalo's happy face or sad
face plastered on top.3 stars though just because a very interesting subject.
