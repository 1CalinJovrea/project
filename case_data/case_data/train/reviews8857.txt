Pretty good history lesson

Not usually a fan of Spielberg but I feel he's done a pretty good job
here. Not an expert on US history either, nevertheless he seems to get
across many of the nuances of the abolitionist movement and the
compromises it had to make. There's no use imposing 21st century post-
civil rights values on this era, things were more complicated. I can
see this movie being used in schools and I expect to return to it to
better understand key moments in the birth of the modern United States.
It's beautiful to look at too, with top-notch costumes, cinematography
and music - and it goes without saying that Day Lewis is superb, and
his resemblance to Lincoln uncanny
