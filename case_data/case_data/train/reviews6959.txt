Surprisingly Intern-resting!

Without knowing too much about the plot, I assumed this was taking De
Niro down a familiar trodden path of another "Fokker" type role. How
wrong I was! This is a very endearing, gentle and easily watchable
escapade that sees an ageing De Niro being given an internship with an
e-commerce fashion company and becoming surprisingly useful at
bestowing his considerable knowledge to his new colleagues. I can't
remember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly
any flaws to his character. Hathaway charms her way through the film
and there's a nice cameo from Russo as a love interest. A film that
doesn't try too hard to be funny and comes across better for it.
