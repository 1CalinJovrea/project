An Unexpected Disappointment

I was convinced the (many) criticisms I read beforehand were
exaggerated and wouldn't bother me. To my surprise, quite some
criticisms seemed justified in the end ...***THE SCRIPT***ADDITIONS: On paper, the additions looked like a great way to create
added value. However, while I understand why they included them, they
all feel out of place.- Opening scene: Ian Holm just looks too dissimilar from his appearance
in FOTR (especially his haircut), which is really distracting. The
frame story doesn't blend in naturally and the history of Erebor has
too much to show in too little time.- Radagast: He appears as suddenly as he disappears. His scene in Dol
Guldur really threw me out of the movie.- The White Council: I know the screenwriters want to underline the
growing dark powers (hence the - preposterous - finding of the Morgul
blade), but the empty talk about things of which we all know how
they've played out in the LOTR films isn't convincing at all.- Azog: An appallingly one-dimensional character, who feels most out of
place (the fact that he looks like a creature from a cheap horror movie
also doesn't help ...). His scenes have a strange "un-Tolkien" vibe,
particularly the battle of Azanulbizar (the worst scene of the movie),
which doesn't feel like a fierce and thrilling battle at all.FROM THE BOOK: The episodic structure prevents the film from having a
fluid narrative and squeezes the tension out of every new dangerous
situation: the events just leave you cold.In the book, we experience everything through Bilbo's eyes, which
creates a strong connection between the reader and the main part. This
is missing from the movie: Bilbo even seemed to have more or less
disappeared between the troll encounter and the stone giants' battle.
His homesickness, his doubts, all of this isn't really developed in the
script.The emphasis on Thorin is a good thing, but also not perfect: during
the enclosure by the Wargs, I didn't buy Thorin's charge towards Azog
and especially Bilbo's sudden "action hero saves the day in the nick of
time" intervention. The latter seemed like a very inappropriate way to
illustrate Bilbo's courage.There were actually only two great scenes: Riddles in the Dark is
amazing, but ironically, it also painfully shows how mediocre the rest
of the movie actually is, because this is the only moment that comes
close to the level of LOTR. Also, Bilbo's speech after they've escaped
Goblin Town is a very welcome, for rare touching moment.***THE PACING***It's quite astonishing some people complain about the pacing, because
the film was over before I knew it. In fact, I think the pacing is
about just right and proved it would have been really difficult to
adapt the book in just one fully-fledged movie. But since I didn't like
the additions, I'm doubting whether a third film is necessary after all
(but I suspend my judgment until 2014).***THE CINEMATOGRAPHY***One of the biggest (unpleasant) surprises is the cinematographic style.
I'm not talking about the bright colors or the digital images, but the
(lack of physical) camera use. Whereas LOTR has stunning "real" camera
movements and an extremely accomplished "handicraft" feel, AUJ often
feels like a video game. The camera is flying and whirling so
limitlessly that it just doesn't feel like an authentic movie anymore.
This is particularly apparent during the Orc chase and above all the
absurd Goblin Town escape. The CGI is perfect, but too much is just too
much.***THE MUSIC***After my long list of complaints, I'm truly relieved to say there is at
least one thing that unconditionally gets my support, which is the
score. The people who unfairly label Howard Shore's work as a "re-hash
of LOTR" obviously didn't pay full attention, because when you listen
to the score multiple times (and I admit it also took me several spins
to really appreciate it), you discover a new rich and diverse musical
tapestry once again masterfully woven by Shore. OF COURSE you hear the
same themes when EXACTLY THE SAME places are visited as in "The
Fellowship of the Ring" ... If someone deserves credit for "The
Hobbit", it's Shore: his music is in my view the only aspect of the
movie on par with the level of LOTR.***3D & 48 FPS***- The 3D was good, no complaints about that. However, although I have
no problems with watching movies in 3D, I start questioning its
necessity.- I am bewildered many people claim that 48 fps creates a "TV-look"
with "actors with clear make-up on a fake set". I didn't have that
feeling at all, but on the other hand - and this was the most
surprising - the difference with 24 fps isn't THAT spectacular. After
30 minutes, I even had to remind myself: "Oh, I'm watching 48 fps,
right?". Yes, the images look very clear and it does smooth fast
movements, but the latter (which is positive) only sticks out a couple
of times (and no, the motion never comes across as "sped up", so I was
never distracted by the higher frame rate). All in all, I consider 48
fps to be an improvement over 24 fps (without diminishing the
"cinematic" look of a film), but I didn't have the feeling I had
witnessed a "revolutionary new cinema experience".***** CONCLUSION *****I didn't expect (or want) a replica of LOTR, but while "The Hobbit"
isn't a bad movie, it isn't good either. I'm still perplexed I don't
feel any urge to go see it again, unlike the LOTR films. We can only
hope that Jackson recovers in time to save the next two films from
unnecessary additions, lack of focus on Bilbo and a video game feeling.
Well, at least we have new brilliant music to listen to!
