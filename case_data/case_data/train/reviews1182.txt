Taking ourselves too seriously, are we?

If you are the kind of person who liked Inception, chances are that
you're also going to like this. But if you don't like Nolan's movies in
the first place, you're probably not going to like his latest
imitators.While writing a brilliant short story "All You Zombies", Robert A.
Heinlein knew that when working with such a ridiculous premise, like
going back in time and having sex with yourself, it is really not
possible to try to make the story gritty and serious. This is what the
movie does not get. Heinlei's dark humor permeates his short story. But
the movie tries hard to appear smart and sophisticated but because of
the ridiculous nature of its premise - paradoxical time travel - seems
just pretentious and stupid and ultimately fails horribly.Back to the Future is the way to go, a movie that really knows what it
wants to do with the mind blowing nature of time travel.
