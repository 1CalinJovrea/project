Great Thriller

In New York, the insider trader Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is
released after four years in prison and his mother and his wife Emily
Taylor (Rooney Mara) welcome him. Unexpectedly Emily is depressed and
tries to commit suicide, hitting her car against the wall in the
garage. Emily goes to the hospital and the psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan
Banks (Jude Law) treats her and she decides to be her client. Dr. Banks
consults her former psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) and she suggests that Dr. Banks uses the new drug Ablixa in
her treatment. Emily tries to commit suicide again, but she returns to
a normal life with Martin and occasionally has sleepwalking episodes.
One day, Emily stabs her husband to death while sleepwalking and she is
sent to trial. She is declared non-guilty but is forced to go to a
psychiatric facility and Dr. Banks is responsible to periodically
evaluate her mental condition.Dr. Banks has his career destroyed with the negative publicity and also
his marriage with the unemployed financial consultant Dierdre Banks
(Vinessa Shaw) after receiving anonymous photos of Emily with him. He
decides to investigate the case to clear his name and discovers that
Emily faked her suicide attempts. His further investigation discloses
an evil scheme in the stock market. "Side Effects" is a great thriller and the best work of Steven
Soderbergh in the last years. The storyline is very similar to the
"Jagged Edge", but updated and using more characters and a more
sophisticated plot. The smart conclusion seems weird since the double
jeopardy prevents Emily from going to court again, but she is punished
by Dr. Banks evaluation of her mental condition. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Terapia de Risco" ("Risky Therapy")
