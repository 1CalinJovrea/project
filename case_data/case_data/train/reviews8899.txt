Why make $1billion on 1 film when we can make $3 billion on 3 films.

The Hobbit is absolutely terrible. Maybe the most uninspired musical
I've ever seen. Its like they reshot the lord of the rings with a
veneer of hobbit overlaid on top. how many rube goldberg cgi events can you put in one film? Swinging
bridge jump, swinging giant foot jump, more swinging bridge jumps,
collapsing rock jump, etc.rabbit powered sleighs, goblin goiters with shakespearian English
accents, hunky dwarf king, and somehow the 3d model of the giant white
god guy from prometheus got a role as an orc.the whole time i kept thinking about the marketing meeting that
resulted in it becoming 3 films, 'why make $1 billion off 1 film when
we can make $3 billion off 3 films.' the only emotion i had during the entire film was hatred...for Peter
Jackson the soulless nazgul.
