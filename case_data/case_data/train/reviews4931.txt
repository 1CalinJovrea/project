Cheap and full of stupid clichés

Seriously, I don't understand why this movie got such a high rating on
IMDb (7.9 at this moment).First. The whole thing is boring and predictable. And come on, it
doesn't take much skill to scare a viewer with a sudden and loud
shriek, accompanied by some puppet jumping into the screen. And they do
that in the movie all the time, they do it a lot. And this is very low
class for a horror movie, if you ask me.Second. The music and sound effects. They serve just one purpose here -
to teach the stupid spectator how to react at certain moments. Like
"look, if you didn't notice, it's a really tender family moment, say
'awww, how sweet'", "and here it's ominous". Come on, we're not that
stupid! We don't need THAT many hints! Third. There's a lot of clichés. I mean it. Wind-up toy truck moving on
it's own - how original! Then some vintage-looking toy with spooky
pictures that come alive, then happy children's lough in the distance,
then some background cathedral singing, then scary faces that only show
in the mirror, then low-frequency growling - I can go on and on. It's
boring. I know I've said earlier, but it really is.But what got me the most, is that the creators of the movie exploit
that "based on true events" line, and they are quite shameless on that.
It's NOT based on true events in the full sense of this word. It's
based on the STORY which is told by a couple of very successful
hoaxers. And the main female character - her acting was all about delivering
just one image, it was all about that look on her face: "ah, I'm so
enlightened, I posses hidden wisdom, I pity you, stupid hectic
humankind"Not a good movie. Just a bunch of old and cheap tricks.
