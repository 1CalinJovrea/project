False Advertising Trailers

The trailers were misleading to say the least, they make it seem like
this is a straight up comedy, which it is in the beginning, i'll give
it that. But by the 2nd act turns into an allegory about abusive
relationships, this one being between a woman and a man.All in all, it's still a semi-good movie, but not as comedic as i'd
first assumed from the trailers.Furthermore, the whole Sci-Fi angle is a very minimal portion of the
flick (5%?). So if you're looking for a huge Mecha vs. Kaiju movie,
this is not the one for you.
