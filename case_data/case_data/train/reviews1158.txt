Just awful

Lee Child always made sure the reader understood the size of Jack
Reacher as an introduction to almost every fight. In this movie
everybody is larger than Tom Cruise. In one fight scene he gets tossed
about by one guy who isn't very big. In the first movie you could
overlook the fact that Tom Cruise is not even 6 feet tall but not so in
this movie.If you've read this book then you'll be so disappointed in this movie.
In the book the part of Reacher's supposed daughter and her mother are
both likable characters. In the movie she's a juvenile delinquent and
almost immediately unlikable.Lee Child wrote Reacher as an intelligent man reasoning through the
situations he found himself. You could see that in the first movie. In
this movie we don't get a chance to see that intelligence. Lee Child
wrote the Susan Turner character as a smart woman but that doesn't come
through either. It isn't always about the action. It's also about him
being intelligent and solving the problem.I walked out on this movie in under 30 minutes. The first Reacher movie
allowed Reacher fans to accept the tiny Tom Cruise as Reacher. This
movie makes it impossible to take that leap. Reacher always seemed to
me to making his way toward something as he worked through the problems
he found himself overcoming. I admit to not seeing this film through to
the end but it seemed to me that in this film he was running from the
bad guys. The Reacher I know always plays offense.Save yourself the disappointment. Watch the first Reacher movie again
or read the book again. Either would be more pleasing to Reacher fans
than watching this garbage. Tom Cruise is a good action star but the
writing and direction are so bad in this movie that you just can't
overlook tiny Tom Cruise being huge Jack Reacher.
