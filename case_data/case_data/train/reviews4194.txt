McConaughey the 'GOLD'en guy

First of all McConaughey the only guy runs this movie. I liked the
plot,actually McConaughey takes this average plot to an 7/10 with his
performance. Movie never slows down, that is the good thing.McConaughey
always get into the character that makes you feel like how desperate
was that guy to find GOLD. I was expecting a lot from Edgar Ram√≠rez but
he couldn't deliver as per the role he got here but don't worry
McConaughey will not gonna waste your time. I would recommend it for
those who are in dilemma due to the overall rating this movie has got;
this will not waste your time.
