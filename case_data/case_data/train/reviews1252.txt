Already done by many

I am not the most discriminating of action film viewers, avid reader of
Clancy and his designated batters and thought Chris Pine did a
wonderful job on the Star Trek films. That said, this film was a load of rubbish....one of the few times that
I seriously considered walking out mid-film. The reasons: 1. Acting was wooden across the board and the selection of
Keira Knightly as Dr. Cathy Ryan was abysmally bad;2. Plot (contrary to some of the views I read) was non-existent and
farcical. Unlike a good Clancy novel, no basis in reality;3. There is one scene that is particularly ridiculous. All I will ask
an intelligent viewer, do you ever think a Russian oligarch worth
billions would seriously consider going out to dinner with a compliance
officer. I would seriously not bother going to see this film or even bother it
renting it. In short, even if someone gave me free tickets with dinner
included, I would now pass on the "opportunity."
