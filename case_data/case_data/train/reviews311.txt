Epic in every way!

Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read
on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his
earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie
can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes
were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre
expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for
action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey
does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all
the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!!
Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception,
this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who
said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating
it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me).
Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved
Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready
to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!
