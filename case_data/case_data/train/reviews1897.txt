could be the greatest love story of all time

In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from
outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most
basic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to
do right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY
GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world
and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN,
another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as
the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments
about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the
other. I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all,
because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this
moving, this powerful, in graphic form.
