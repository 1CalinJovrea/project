Don't waste your time on this garbage movie.

Basically the movie is about two women trapped in a steel cage on the
seabed 47 meter below sea level. How this movie possibly got an average
rating of 5.7 is beyond me. Screaming and shouting for help in one and
a half hour make the movie just annoying. It's Worse Than Passing a
Kidney Stone. I know a lot about low budget film making and I
understand that this film is not necessarily the worst low-budget film
ever made... but it comes very close. Here are my two main gripes: Who
signs off on it's production? Are they proud of their work? Do they
have any concept of shame? I never do reviews but felt this was worthy.
