I loved it

Every one is Trashing the Movie for Knowing the plot and expecting how
it will end. Well Guess what ,It's a Kids Movie ,you should get the
Idea of the Movie ,as it tells every Kid to be him/herself and they
will Turn out great.You don't need to be a copycat or to be like someone to be successful
,you need to be yourself.That's a Great Lesson for everyone not just kids. The Message that this
Movie delivers is brilliant. I enjoyed the Movie and all the Kids in
the Family Laughed and enjoyed it Specially the Ending. Such a cool
idea. I think the reviews are not giving this movie what it deserves.
