What a let down

I was enthusiastically exuberant about returning to what I've known as
a cult classic, the original "Point Break". This reboot, is full of
slick stunts and visuals, but the story, or lack thereof, makes this
taste like pablum. I very seriously doubt that after two hours from
getting out of the theater watching this, that anybody would even
remember the name's of the central characters in this film. Why,
because the film maker neglected to give us a story where the
characters are expounded and fleshed out beyond the 3 minutes for any
resolute back-story on any of them. I appreciate the stunts and stunt
people for their quality work involved, but stunts don't make a movie.
A good story, with quality characters that are inter-meshed with
emotions and plots that pull the viewer into the characters' world is
what makes a memorable film. I'll stick with the original "Point
Break".
