Original Interpretation of an interesting story -- for adults

Fantastic film. But not as sexual as the advertisements promised. In
fact, apart from the curse words, this film should be rated PG-13 at
best. I found it surprisingly chaste.The first thing you should know is that this film is NOT based on the
book, The Secret History of Wonder Woman. It is based on original
research by the director/writer of the movie, who did a great job
interpreting the story her own way. It's a story about what happens
when you defy convention! And the good that can come of it.Is it factual? Mostly, yes. Kinkiness and BDSM is in the book as well,
not to mention the early comics of Wonder Woman. Anyone denying the
lesbian/BDSM content of the real story and the BDSM content of the
comic ... is in denial. The granddaughter of Marston has started a
campaign to destroy the film, unleashing neoconservatives and Trumppets
to spread the word about how it's "fake." But what's fake? It's a
fictional retelling, not a documentary, based on a true story. Fake is
the show, Fargo, which claims to be based on actual events, but is
COMPLETELY made up. But no one seems to make a big deal about that.
Why? No BDSM or lesbian content in it -- so it's perfectly fine? I
think certain people need to acknowledge their own prejudice.Anway, I thought the actors were solid. The director did a great job
telling an unconventional story. This is a movie for adults, obviously.
I could see this film as a theater piece -- a Broadway play -- actually
-- particularly those dress-up scenes with the Frenchman, Charles
Guyette, the "G-String King." Very theatrical indeed.*** SPECIAL NOTE: this movie is shockingly CGI free! Will comic fans be
able to handle that? Probably not! ***
