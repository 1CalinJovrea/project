Wow!

My, oh, my! First 'El cuerpo/The body' and now this. Spanish
cinematography does not fail to impress. This has been their most
successful thriller by far, and I believe there will be more. Having
Mario Casas in a movie by itself is a reason enough to see this movie,
and did he deliver! The acting is astonishing, this world deserves more
Spanish actors, but the directing was a pure masterpiece. Orioul Paulo
is a man to be reckoned with. Throughout the movie, the plot will take
you on numerous emotional and moral roller coasters, and every time you
think you know it right, the plot will mercilessly prove you wrong. I
enjoyed the movie from the first seconds till the last ones. If you are
willing to dive into the depths of Spanish thrillers, this is the best
movie to begin your journey with.
