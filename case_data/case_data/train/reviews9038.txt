A masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits

Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through
the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the
screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest. Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It's not a sad movie. It's
not a pretentious movie. It's a movie about love, and love, and love. A
beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and
drown in it. Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you
want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with
absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your
life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn
heart. It's so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of
longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written
words without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelation
and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on
everyone.Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who
is somewhat glorified through Elio's lens in the first part of the
book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring.
He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touchingMichael Stuhlbarg's monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is
a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be
taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene.Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don't let it fall victim
to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve
minutes, then question every single time you didn't allow yourself to
feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a
possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a
taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache
worth it? Was it worth it?
