Dire miscasting

There's not a lot to say that's good about this movie. I understand
it's a spoof, but spoofs should be funny, and I didn't laugh at all in
this waste of two hours of my life.I had problems with the casting. Alec Baldwin is totally miscast as the
aging rock and roller owner of a nightclub. Every time he came into
shot I was mesmerised by his shoulder-length wig. He seemed to be the
sort that would kick back to some gentle jazz or Sinatra rather than
heavy metal.Tom Cruise as a younger Iggy Pop style drunk, drugged, spaced-out sex
god just didn't work. He obviously had fun in the role, but sadly I
didn't.Brand's phony Scouse accent added nothing to his part, and the gay
revelation between Baldwin and Brand was simply excruciating.The love interest, two young idealistic rock and rollers made Sandy &
Danny from Grease look carbolic. They were too clean. When she became a
stripper, it was simply unbelievable.But the biggest gripe I had was with the music. The fans devil-horned,
dressed in leather, and partied like Satan worshippers. The band
posters looked like an explosion between def leppard and kiss. So what
sort of Rock and Roll songs did they belt out? I want to know what love
is. Really? A fine ballad, but the sort of Rock and Roll that would
cause churches to protest outside? Please. It made me embarrassed to be
part of the generation that first bought those albums.
