10
Absolutely Amazing.

Do not listen to critic reviews they just down movies for attention .
This movie is hilarious, witty, and interesting. Seeing how the girls
bond will make you almost wish this was happening to you! I just
imagined all the fun they had and me in their place, it was an awesome
movie. I signed up just to review this movie if you don't read anything
I say just take this advice. Watch the movie yourself. Cameron Diaz,
Leslie Mann, and Kate Upton played their roles stupendously and each
had their own unique skill to bring into the sisterhood and none were
as dumb as one might think. I would rate this movie a 100 out of 10 if
I could I cried during the last 10 minutes just seeing how each life
was changed as a result.
