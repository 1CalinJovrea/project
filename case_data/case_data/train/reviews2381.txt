Good food guide

I'm no foodie but I really enjoyed this road-trip / father-son / buddy
movie, written directed by and starring Jon Favreau, based on the
recent life and times of a perfectionist chef who struggles to suppress
his own innovation to the demands of his conservative paymaster boss.
More than this, he gets involved in a spat with the town's number 1
food critic, sees his relationship with his son founder under pressure
of work and still pines after his glamorous and super-rich ex-wife.There's not much more to the story than that and I feared for all the
anticipated parental-bonding scenes I would see the second I clapped
eyes on his flop-haired 10 year old son but I was very pleasantly
surprised to be engaged by this lighthearted, fast-moving, feel-good
movie, right up to the predictable happy ending for all concerned.With a busy but enjoyable soundtrack of soul and salsa in the
background, nice realistic acting by all the leads right down to son
Percy and of course lots of scrumptious shots of freshly made food,
this movie certainly mixed its ingredients together well, delivering in
the end a most palatable dish.Perhaps the star-power cameos were a little unnecessary, maybe the
father-son stuff did get a little hokey at times and the wraparound
happy ending did seem somewhat forced but on the whole I found this a
very watchable and occasionally funny movie which more than whetted my
appetite for a decent Saturday night stay-in movie.
