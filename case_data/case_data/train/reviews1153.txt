Dark, Twisted, and Haunting Imagery

When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its
job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters
this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on
jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's
brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. It's hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period
piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action
elements. And I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to see a film
like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed
from beginning to end. I wouldn't say anything about the story shocked
me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising
nature to Robert Egger's direction left me breathless. Within 10
minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself "why would
you go there?", "Don't do that!", or "come on, really?". Not because I
thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to
what these characters were doing.With that said, I don't think this film is for everyone. It's brutal,
harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th
century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous
tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it
has done with me. But that's the way horror films should be. I wouldn't
say it's more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of
terrifying moments, but it is more for the 'Under the Skin' crowd than
it is for people who love 'The Conjuring'. Even in its harsh moments, I
was always invested and I can't deny the quality of the writing,
directing, and acting all around. This is how you make a horror film.+Terrifying imagery+Egger's direction+Invested from beginning to end-Sometimes the dialogue is difficult to follow7.6/10
