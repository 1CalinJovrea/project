Finally a good teen movie

I wanted to see this film to soothe my wife. She usually loves
adolescent romance stuff, so I thought I would suffer through it.
Instead, I ended up liking it more than she did.The thing about romance films and adolescence films in particular is
that the kids are presented like complete idiots, like aliens from the
planet Dumb. In order to keep up with this superficial image all other
characters must act the same. The result is a complete fake.The Spectacular Now is nothing like that. From the start it portrays
teens as complex, intelligent, troubled about their past and their
future, maybe laid back alcoholics or chronically shy or overachievers
with low self esteem. And they all interact like human beings. It's a
joy to see a film like this.I also loved that they didn't use the cheap tricks of romance movies in
general. No evil adversary to define the character as good, no ultimate
goal to direct the entire film from point A to point B, no artificial
accidents or catastrophes to move people out of their stupor, no
highschool cliques, no Facebook or Twitter dramas. Instead, normal
people doing normal stuff, trying to get over themselves and have a
happy life.The film was not without its flaws. It was a little too slow, for once.
It only lasted an hour and a half but it felt like more. Also there is
a somewhat seamless jump of a few years that takes the viewer by
surprise (I still don't know when it happened). Also, I am a bit grumpy
today, the film probably deserved a 9. Go watch it!
