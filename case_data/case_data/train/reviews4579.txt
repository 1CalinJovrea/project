Fun!

I loved it! Yes, it is made for the family audiences but it really kept
me going for two hours! It is an action filled adventure on the high
seas from the times when Britannia ruled the waves. It has it all!
Action, pirates, sailors, ghosts and what not, but it really is
entertaining! You have no other option but to take your kids to this
one, you will not be sorry.I especially liked Mr. Bardem as Captain Salazar, his acting is a
little bit better then the rest but every actor gave hundred percent
for this film and it shows! Since this is my review 400 for IMDb.com I have to take an opportunity
to thank staff at the Multiplex Cinema City Sarajevo for being
generally kind and professional. Not to forget Meeting Point Cinema as
well. I also want to thank IMDb.com staff for letting MOST of my
reviews pass.
