Worst movie ever!

I wish I could give it a zero. This movie had no taste in it
whatsoever. I wanted to get up and leave the theater so bad but
spending almost $10 on a movie...I figured I'll get my moneys worth
first. Bad idea! I felt like I needed to run to the nearest church
during the movie to cleanse my soul. It was nasty and terrible. Not
even funny at all and I personally think that it gave the actors and
actresses a BAD reputation! And I really loved those actors/actresses,
and now I just look at them differently. I can't believe that they
would stoop so low for this movie. Don't see it! It will ruin your
mind.
