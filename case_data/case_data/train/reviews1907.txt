Great movie!

I really loved this movie... every minute is thrill with a good story!
You can relate to the characters. Halle's acting is again breathtaking.
I really don't understand why some users have negative comments about
this movie. I gave it 10 out of 10, because it does justice to its
genre.Thriller movie lovers should definitely see it.
