Disappointing. Missed Opportunity.

I so wanted to like this and thought it good enough to watch in the
theater rather than wait to download. So I was full of expectation. The filming itself and the action scenes are excellent but horribly
flawed. As with Saving Private Ryan and so many other WW2 movies the
Director seems to think that the Germans only tactics were to either
sneak attack or get mown down in waves. Its patronizing and
distracting.Brad Pitt also seems unable to decide if he is a bitter veteran or a
kindly father figure. The scene with the German girls was also silly.
Would a young innocent fall for a American soldier who burst into her
room in 5 minutes? Hardly likely.The battle with the Tiger tank was better and had some credibility and
is the best part of the film.By now I was in 2 minds about Fury but then the final scene came along
and it defied belief in its stupidity. That 4 soldiers could attempt to
take on 300 hardened SS from a fixed position was so utterly dumb as to
leave me speechless with incredulity. Nor do we get into any insight as
to why they want to commit suicide. Why?The absolute last scene is farcical in the extreme, when our 'hero'gets
let off the hook. Honestly I wanted to ring up the script writer and
ask what he was thinking?With better attention to the actual fighting methods and outcomes
during WW2, with some deeper characterization and attention to detail
this could have been a truly great film. That it wasn't and isn't is a
sad disappointment.
