Honor in Death!!!

A band of samurai who have lost there master set out to avenge his
treacherous death at the hands of Lord Kira. Enter Kai, a humble "half
breed" with more to him than meets the eye, with catching favor with
the fallen Lord's daughter, Kai must join the 47 Ronin to not only
avenge his honor but save the woman he loves..Very visually appealing with a nice blend of action and a wonderful nod
to ancient Japanese mythology. I felt though that there could have been
more to the story, simple and clichéd in some areas but overall an
enjoyable film. Keanu does a decent job with his part but the true meat
and potatoes comes from Hiroyuki Sanada, who does a masterful job in
his portrayal as the chief ronin, Ôishi . The true pleasure and joy
within this film is its nod and ode to the ancient Japanese mythology
of the time, which in my opinion is done very well. Some may not
understand the conclusion of this film but in a little learned
knowledge of the culture one would see it for what it was intended
for.. All in all an enjoyable movie and film for any fan of action
films and historical fantasy.
