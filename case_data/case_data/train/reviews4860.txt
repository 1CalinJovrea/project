Major plot hole.

This girl goes through all the trouble of researching the mirror,
setting up the cameras, lights, alarms etc. To combat this force that
can manipulate your mind into seeing and hearing what it wants you to
and she thinks it's a good idea to set up a fail safe that could easily
impale the both of them. Saw this coming a mile away, as soon as the
"anchor" was shown. It's a major flaw that ruined the whole movie. They
could have made it more interesting with the real/unreal aspects But
the whole time this anchor is looming above the premise rendering the
point moot. Also the flashing back and forth between present and past
was not interesting it was more annoying than anything.
