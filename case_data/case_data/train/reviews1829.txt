Does not live up to the hype

I regret paying for this on blue ray. The hype gave more to this movie
then it deserved. As it was from the makers of Insidious and conjuring,
I thought this might be something enjoyable, since those movies are
campy, fun, roller coasters horror movies, that are set in a less then
believable world, so you can suspend your suspension of disbelief for
them. This movie has none of that element to it. While the acting and
cinematography is fine in this, much like the conjuring and insidious,
that however is all the good I can say for this, similar
cinematography.The plot however ruins it. And I'm just gonna spoil the ending of the
movie for you so you don't waste money on this. The big surprise of the movie is the family, including the daughter
who's in on it, use hypnotism to break any black people they make
friends with slowly, so they can prepare them for operation to remove
most of their brains and have it replaced with white peoples brains, so
they are white people walking around in black peoples bodies.The main character gets away in the end BTW.I cannot help but feel that the reason why this movie was given so much
more hype then it actually deserved, was because despite how the movie
went along, the writers made effort to make every white person in this
movie into a villain, and every black person to be innocent victims. If
they made a movie like this but did the reversal of skin color on all
the cast, there would be screams from racism from social justice
warriors today, but its okay to make every white person in this movie
evil. Thats why this movie got all the hype it did, because even if its
a bad story, as long as all white guys are vilified and all black guys
are saints, its perfectly fine. And no, I'm not racist saying that,
this is one the fault of the movie makers awful storytelling. Do not buy this movie based on the hype it was given. Only get this for
the cinematography.
