Fantastic Film

We were able to see this at an early screening but per that paper, not
to say anything until after other screenings. So, now it's screened
elsewhere I can pitch in my thoughts.Life of Pi is a film that absolutely surprised me. I had not read the
book, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I knew that a film
from Ang Lee would be exceptionally well done, and I wasn't wrong. This
is an incredibly strong work, on par with "Crouching Tiger" .. Not
through action or events but in the way the cinematography, camera
movements and beautiful settings help draw a viewer in and really sell
the story.The Life of Pi is so well crafted that it moves effortlessly between a
story of youth to a story of adulthood. If you have not read the book,
the ending is the kind of twist that while completely understandable
redefines your entire film experience in a way I hadn't been a part of
since "The Sixth Sense". You immediately think back over the entirety
of the film and see it in a drastically different way and it works.No matter the perspective you chose, this is an amazingly well acted,
well directed film that goes into my list of some of the best films
I've seen this year.I watched in 3D, but this is a film full of so many bright colors and
scenes that I will seek out a chance to see it in 2D just for the
beauty of the scenes. Strongly recommended.
