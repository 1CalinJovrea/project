a forgettable movie with an even worse ending

Spoilers ahead:Where to start with this one hmmmmm. The movie explores the already
over navigated "what if AI was created" however unlike most movies that
question should it be created this one throws you full into "oh we did
it already and here is a brief explanation on how we did it". The premise is weak to say the least with our main characters having no
real reason to be doing anything they are doing other than they can.Caleb is a young tech savy man who we learn more or less is picked to
be part of an experiment with Ava and Jay. Throughout the film we learn
very little about him other than he has no family and has the hots for
Ava. Sadly this is the least thought out character in the film even
though it depends on him to carry us through what we are watching. Jay is a genius with an apparent drinking issue and a very bland
personality. His motives for making AI can basically be summed up as
him wanting fame and money and that's about it. Through the film you
learn these robots are ehem full functional females and yes that does
mean he is sleeping with one. Aside from the otter non sense that this
one man has created several robots on his own with full functional AI
he gives you the ending to the film with roughly 20 mins still left in
it. Whoever decided to have Jay basically say outright what if this is
all a setup and then end the movie that way should be fired and kicked
out of Hollywood.This brings us to Ava who honestly has nothing going for her. Shes a
robot who manipulates everything and walks out as the last man
standing. No reason is given for why she does what she does other then
what Jay says and that's about all we know. To me the film felt rushed and incomplete neither saying why AI was
created or where its going. It was simply we made robots, the robots
are free and everything you wanted to happen isn't going to happen.
