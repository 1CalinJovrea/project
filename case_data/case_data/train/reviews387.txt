Serviceable Film, But Could've Been Better

The strongest part of this film is its premise. It's really fantastic.
There is so much possibility for this fun, satirical look at what
people will do in certain situations. The film is really filled to the
brim with brilliant possibilities. But for the most part, they remain
just possibilities. I do think this is a really good script. However, I
don't think the execution of this screenplay was as good as if could've
been. The characters making decisions and breaking off into groups
could have been fascinating and riveting, but it didn't reach the level
it should have. The actual streaks of killing could have been so cool
to watch, but it comes off as kind of dull. Where the action could have
been really inventive and insane, in a Kingsman: The Secret Service
kind of way, it ends up being rather rudimentary and bland. There isn't
nearly as much electricity or excitement in this film as it deserved to
have...
