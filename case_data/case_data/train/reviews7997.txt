An exciting mystery

Park goes back to the origins, with its cinema full of mystery, brutal
but mostly exuberant. In his new film, Park, brings surely one of his
best works, the plot is set in Korea in the thirties, in a time of
Japanese occupation, and focuses on four main characters, Hideko, a
Japanese heiress who lives isolated in the camp with Kouzuki, his
domineering uncle, Sook-Hee, a newly hired maid, and a con artist who
presents himself as Count Fujiwara to teach painting to Hideko. Being
divided into 3 parts of lies and betrayals, the film has a huge camera
work, abusing well-designed plans and space, both indoors and out,
traveling through a mixture of English and Japanese architecture, the
film is a breeze in the eyes of so beautiful, from the very accurate
track, immersion in the beauty of Japanese erotic literature, the film
explores well-developed characters, and of course, returns plot twist
on plot twist, as the director knows well how to do, no doubt one of
the best films of the year.
