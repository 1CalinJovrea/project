A funny, entertaining, heartfelt, and immersive movie with great characters

"Zootopia" is the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the
animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was
impressively perfect.A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She
wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police
officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong
enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about
her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is
small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for
her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already
committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to
avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding
the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends
and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she
cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to
refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this
yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular
cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.
