Modern rage + black comedy

Mixing modern rage with black comedy this collection of shorts rises
above expectations to become one of the best and funniest movies from
Argentina along with The Secret In Their Eyes and El Aura, and probably
the most accessible for international audiencesSix unrelated stories that share a common theme of revenge are shown
back to back, and not edited back and forward like it's usual with
these kind of movie, some of them are better than others: the opener,
the road rage incident, the hit and run, and the wedding stand out,
while the more conventional and predictable "Bombita" and "The Rats"
still entertain thanks to superb writing and directingThere's a few annoying problems with logical plot holes like why would
the rich yuppie go out of his way to put the damaged spare tired in his
trunk (and thus leaving it open) when running for his life and factual
errors like on the wedding episode the bride's threats about this
husband's companies are meaningless because in Argentina possessions
are considered marriage goods ("bienes gananciales") only if the are
acquire during the marriage and not before like the screen husband's
companies, and like these are others but among such high quality stuff
glaring mistakes like these are more evidenthighly recommended
