apart from good graphics, not much excitement here

I wanted to like this movie based on the earlier ones and took my
kids... was I wrong, it was awful. The whole movie is based on the red
car trying to get his mojo back because he's too old or needs work, and
in the end he basically quits. And still gets called the "winner." I
don't like to overly analyze movies or entertainment and will watch and
enjoy things with any reasonable message about self-empowerment, until
that entertainment tries to shove a ridiculous message at people ---
defeatist. More or less inane level propaganda, and about how NOT to
succeed at something at that. If you want to see a real comeback movie,
and one that makes a little sense, just rent any Rocky. 1 through 7 (or
whatever they are on....) There are tons of other good ones.
