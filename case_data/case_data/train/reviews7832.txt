Non-attractive confusion

Fist of all, I don't consider this a horror movie. It really doesn't
contain those building blocks of a proper horror. It is not even a
thrilling thriller. Just a big mass i could not put together. In my
opinion, just a producers bad try to use psychology to rise a
popularity. Some scenes I found ridiculous and I actually laughed at.
Gore and blood is one of the reasons i didn't vote "awful". There are
grouse moments but as nearly enough to call this at least a good
thriller (this movie just cant be a horror). The only frightening scene
was the bare ending and that is all! Simply saying, a big miss in
imitating a Shutter Island.
