Open-minded and loved it

There are no spoilers here, just a real person's true review. I almost
did not watch this due to the overall reviews, and that would have been
a shame, because I liked it. To all the naysayers looking for a solid
track to the original story, this is a bit different. This a a
completely different take. Parts of the movie were not so great, but
overall, I LOVED IT.Depends on what you're looking for. If you are
looking for a story perfectly true to original - not so much. This
movie is a wonderful alternative view. I appreciate and really enjoyed
the risk-taking and the different view. May not be for everyone, but
thoroughly enjoyed it.
