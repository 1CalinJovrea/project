This movie shows that I can't rely on the user ratings on IMDb anymore!...

Is this some kind of a joke? Are there cameras that filming people's
reactions and laughing at them or what?It was AFWUL! It was neither scary nor funny. I hated myself that I
didn't leave the theater after the first 15 minutes. The only scary and the best scene of the movie was the guy appeared
suddenly at the old gas station. The movie is that bad...Too bad I can't rate it less than 1.Unless you are from the new generation who loves nonsense bloody scenes
and find them funny and somehow scary; STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!My rating : -10/10
