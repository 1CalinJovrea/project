Good Old Fashoned Samurai Fun

I remember getting excited when I saw the previews for this film, and I
was hoping it would be good. Lately I heard rumors that it was a bomb,
that it wasn't good, and my heart sank. Guess what? It looks like the
critics are looking for their "Lone Ranger" for the season, which only
means this is a good movie that's getting an unfair bad rap. I saw it
today, and the film delivered in every possible way: It's a big
production, great action, good acting, and very cool special effects.An outsider is allowed to stay in a Samurai community, falls in love
with an unattainable member of the upper classes and because of his
background, he's treated a second class citizen, usually being the
target of offensive remarks and unfair practices. His good character
helps him endure this difficult life, and the situation doesn't improve
when a member of the royal family comes to visit his community. Because
of a misunderstanding and the underhanded maneuvers of a witch, the
community members and him find themselves in real trouble.There is a lot of action in the whole movie, and some of the dark magic
stuff is fun to see. This is a film when the villain is well defined
and works really well because she's a malevolent individual, with a
pretty nasty agenda and a good arsenal of devilish spells. In addition
to that, the fights are well choreographed, the action moves fast, and
there's attention paid to some of the traditions of the Samurai culture
(not sure if it's accurate), but the great art direction and beautiful
photography give it a sense of reality.Be prepared not to listen to the credit and enjoy yourself.
