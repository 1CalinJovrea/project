Loved it!!!

I have never written a review on a movie before no matter how good or
bad. But this movie really deserves high praise! I had brought the kids
to see a few other animated movies before this like Wreck-it Ralph and
Rise of the Guardian, but they turned out to be somewhat boring and
unengaged. So I went into this not expecting much, it was more for the
kids. To my surprise, I LOVED IT! It's different, funny, smart, and
adventurous. I found myself giggling through most of the movies and at
other times astounded by the visual effects. I also see my kids and
other kids sitting at the edge of their seats at times. It is great for
all ages. The picture was stunning and saturated with imagination.
Dreamworks has outdone themselves with this one. I highly recommend
taking your family to see this!
