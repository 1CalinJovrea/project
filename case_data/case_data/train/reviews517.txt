The amount of shaky cam is unbearable.

It gave me motion sickness 20 minutes into the movie. Every action
sequence has 3-4-5 cuts every other second The camera is shaking even
when all the characters are static. While the quality diminished with
every new episode, I still hate to see such a disastrous ending to one
of my favorite franchises. This is sad.
