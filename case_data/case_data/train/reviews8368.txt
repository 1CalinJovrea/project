Who says there is no such thing as time travel....?

Because writer/director Zahler has taken his audience back to an era
when films were simpler, direct, and,above all, unrelenting in their
pursuit of a single theme or idea.He has manufactured a true guilty pleasure -- a film about a man making
bad choices that is driven by brilliant characterizations, raw
Adrenalin, and a compelling narrative that makes you watch no matter
how much you know you should look away.In the grand tradition of Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood, Vaughn,
an actor once relegated to romantic comedies, does "the" physical role
of his career and it is a barn burner.There is no pretense at class. This is 1960s grindhouse from start to
finish and if you have any doubts just listen to the closing music at
the 2:05 mark --- a brisk orchestral piece that sounds more fitting to
a vaudeville act than a melodrama. Zahler ends the show by signalling
that he was messing with your head, overloading your senses, all along
-- and moreover he was doing it deliberately and knowingly.Don Johnson, an actor who continues to win SEXIEST MAN ALIVE awards for
merely showing up at the ceremony, wanted to try something different
and succeeded - his cigar-smoking, sadistic warden is a masterpiece.
Unforgettable.A hard film to review, a difficult film to classify, and an impossible
film to ignore. The closest analog in this era would be the highly
stylized, and highly violent, films from South Korea that glorify the
individual over the system.Highly recommended.
