Sooooooooooo good

I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival
screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O.
Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a
dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley
Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character.
Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of
Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This
whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with
heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable
characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are
sure to see this as Osacr buzz.
