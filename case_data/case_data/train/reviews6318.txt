quite possibly worst film I have ever seen

as the title says this is quite possibly the worst film I have ever
seen, do yourself a favour & go see something else.Male lead was boring, uninspiring and you really didn't care whether he
achieved his life ambition. He's an atheist scientist and yet you see
him being superstitious and taking reincarnation seriously. Michael
Pitt does not put any emotion or effort into this role & you could see
he did not care about the film, the female leads are irritating and
stupid and you wonder how the director found such vapid actors. All of
them failed to draw you in and make you care about what happened.A chance encounter at a party leads to him stalking the poor girl, the
death scene is unrealistic & childish.The whole film is full of contradictions, confusion and you will sit
there and you will question what you have just seen and heard.This film was so bad I fell asleep after 30 minutes and walked out
after 60 minutes, go see something else or you will be asking for you
money back.
