What A Joke, Save Your Money

Nice special effects but unrealistic storytelling. Poor acting and poor
casting. The movie drags on and on until it ends leaving you feeling
worse off then when you came in to watch. I thought it would be better
from the previews and all the hype (which clearly is unmerited) but
it's not. Bale should stick with the Dark Knight roles he clearly did
not know what he was doing attempting to take on the role of Moses.
Bland dialogue, slow paced. You know what's coming, everything is
already there for the movie to be a blockbuster and yet it amounts to
an utter failure. This movie had potential to actually be done well but
whoever green-lighted this should be fired. A waste of time!!
Uninspiring film. Choppy. I don't think children would even enjoy
watching the movie beyond a few special effects here and there. Not
family- orientated, poorly executed. Would not see again.
