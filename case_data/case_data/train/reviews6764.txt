A Good Ghost Story Developed at a Slow Pace and Beginning Similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula

In London, the lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) still grieves the
death of his beloved wife Stela (Sophie Stuckey) on the delivery of
their son Joseph (Misha Handley) four years ago. His employer gives a
last chance to him to keep his job, and he is assigned to travel to the
remote village Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel
Marsh House that belonged to the decently deceased Mrs. Drablow (Alisa
Khazanova). Arthur befriends Daily (Ciar√°n Hinds) in the train and the
man offers a ride to him to the Gifford Arms inn. Arthur has a cold reception and the owner of the inn tells that he did
not receive the request of reservation and there is no available room.
On the next morning, Arthur meets the solicitor Jerome that advises him
to return to London. However Arthur goes to the isolated manor and soon
he finds that the Eel Marsh House is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a
woman dressed in black. He also learns that the woman lost her son
drowned in the mush and she seeks revenge taking the children of the
scared locals. "The Woman in Black" is a dramatic horror film by Hammer with a good
ghost story developed at a slow pace. The beginning is very similar to
Bram Stoker's Dracula, when the young lawyer Jonathan Harker is sent to
a remote village to a real estate business and has a cold reception by
the villagers. The vampire is replaced by the evil ghost of a woman in black that
takes the children from the dwellers. The conclusion is a little
disappointing but the film certainly makes the viewer startle many
times along 95 minutes running time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Mulher de Preto" ("The Woman in Black")
