Awful movie

How this movie received 6.4 stars is beyond me The trailer looked
awesome, as usual they show you the good bits, Halle Berry's acting is
really substandard, anyone in there right mind would not have acted in
the same way she did. The car chase scenes are very disappointing, the
director should have put a little more thought into the acting, car
chases and story line. The movie left me feeling really frustrated with
majority of her actions, the last time i felt this way was after
watching Jeepers Creepers. Lets do all the wrong things for the sake of
it to make an entertaining movie 1 star - utter garbage
