Read the script, saw the movie, not impressed

I read the script like a little month ago, and the movie is as I
thought. Flat and boring. The dialog sounds very unnatural - the topic
between the CEO and Caleb have no depth and is uninspiring - always
tension and potential hostile.The CEO give impression of someone who have reached too much too fast
and is not even interested in what he have created (did he really
create the AI?). So... he decent to having sex with the previous IA
models, get drunk, and boring thoughts.Caleb start impressed by what he see in Ava, but soon loose the
admiration, as he see the CEO as someone who do create something unique
for then to destroy it - which starts a conflict inside of him.I guess the director try to make the movie deep (drama) and
controversial, but the acting is too stiff and the dialogs are ... (to
me) boring. OK, I have 40 years experience in AI and read about all I
could get hands on, so I am not impressed by some transparent robot
with a 'deep' ping-pong dialog.That the CEO place is far away from everywhere, that he is drunk,
creating something special, and a partly naive outsider is there to
evaluate Ava makes potential for a great movie, but .... I am not
impressed.After ca 70 minutes it start to be ridiculous and more boring. The
movie have 'tense' music to build up suspense (drama), but it don't
work for me.
