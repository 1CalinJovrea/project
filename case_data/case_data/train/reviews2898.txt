Lord have mercy

This is by far the worst movie, I have ever sat through.I thought, I'd give it a shot 'cause of Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Nick
Offermann aso. But boy was I wrong... The story was absurd, the acting
was off, you never knew with the language if it was medieval or
modern-funny-ish or so... It was just pure awkward and sometimes I even
threw up a little 'cause of this BS. I am sorry, but that movie isn't
even "indie-good", it's just plain awful. I don't know how else to
express my disgust for that "shartwork".Move on. If you ever consider this movie, it might be better pointing a
gun to one's head...
