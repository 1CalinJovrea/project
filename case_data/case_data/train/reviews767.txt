Swank & Jones Are Terrific But Be Prepared For Some Incredibly Bleak Scenes

Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones give terrific performances here, but
be prepared to witness some incredibly bleak scenes. Do we really need
to see in graphic detail a mother throwing her baby down an outhouse
hole (a scene I'm still thinking about a day after viewing), a man
forcing himself upon his wife in bed while her mother lies next to them
in revulsion, or one scene, about 2/3rds of the through the film, which
is just horribly shocking and disturbing.Swank portrays Mary Bee Cuddy, a highly independent unmarried religious
woman, who's toiling hard on a farm by herself in the small town of
Loup, in the Nebraska Territory in the mid 1800's. She has volunteered
to become a homesman, who will transport 3 women back East who have
gone "mad" from the extremely harsh and horrible conditions on the
plains.Mary Bee comes upon the scoundrel George Briggs (Jones), whom she finds
with a rope around his neck, tied to a tree, and upon his horse. She
sees an opportunity here, and makes a bargain with him to save his life
in return for his assistance in the arduous 5 week journey to Iowa that
she's facing. Of course, once underway, they'll face all kinds of
difficulties and obstacles, and, as mentioned, it can all get very grim
at times.In small roles, other screen notables that will pop up along the way
include Meryl Streep, John Lithgow, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson,
Hailee Steinfeld, and William Fichtner.The movie was also directed by Tommy Lee Jones who co-wrote the script
with Kieran Fitzgerald and Wesley A. Oliver, based on the novel of the
same name by Glendon Swarthout.All in all, I felt the heart of this film is in the portrayals of Swank
and Jones, and the way they play off of each other on screen. However,
you'll need a very strong constitution to stomach the intensely graphic
and bleak scenes that appear on screen.
