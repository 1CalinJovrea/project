It's been a while since I have been this tense

First off I would like to say that this is one of my favorite movie of
all times and I'm usually extremely picky when it comes to movies. It
exceeded my expectation in every single way possible and let's just say
I had a really high expectation to begin with. The acting in this movie was stunning. Hank did an amazing job as a
likable Captain Phillips while Barkhad exceeds in his character as a
scary villain yet someone who we feel like deserves our empathy too.
The production design in this movie is really well done and the
directing is FREAKING amazing.The pacing of this movie is great and I
loved the way they delivered the climax. The way they blend the emotion
and tension in this movie was pretty balance without over doing it. My experience with this movie is honestly one of the best two hours of
my life. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie through and
thanks to the great performance I could feel that I was in the same
boat as Captain Phillips (no puns intended). This is truly a great
movie and I would recommend it to everyone who likes thrillers because
this is one heck of one!
