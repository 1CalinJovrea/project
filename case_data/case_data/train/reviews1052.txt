Hard-pounding action and tons of gunfights

The third installment of "The Expendables" is right up there alongside
with the previous two movies. Not only in adrenaline, action and
impressive action stars on the cast list.Without going too deep into the storyline here, then Barney has a
conflict of morales and have a falling out with his team, and he has to
recruit a team of new blood in order to go after a former team member
who went rogue and was left for dead.The movie is a little bit slow at the start, but it quickly picks up
pace and then it just steamrolls continuously on towards the very end.Wesley Snipes was really a welcomed addition to the movie, because he
played his role so well. I can't really say the same for Antonio
Banderas, well for his character that is, because the character was
just a royal pain in the... Well, you get the drift. Antonio Banderas
himself did a good job portraying this annoying character though.
Kelsey Grammar was a bit out of his usual playing field, but all in
all, then he also did bring something new to the movie, despite having
a supporting role only. Mel Gibson did a good job with the role as the
villain. And finally Harrison Ford also popped in for an exciting
visit.Having grown up with the action movies of Stallone, Statham,
Schwarzenegger, Lundgren and Li, then "The Expendables" (all three of
them) are like everything you wished for in a movie as a child. All of
your action heroes coming together for the ultimate action blast.If you enjoyed the previous two movies, then you will also enjoy "The
Expendables 3". No doubt about it.
