We are revoking Jamie Dornan's Irish citizenship.Awful movie. Awful acting, shouldn't be in cinemas. I have washed my
eyes out with a mixture of battery acid and white spirits and the burn
is less then watching that attempt of a movie. Now I just need to fill
space so people can see the review. You should go see Spongebob with
your other half on Valetines Day. avoid watching this movie at all
costs. I'm a little teapot short and stout here is my handle and here
is my spout.These reviews need more lines then Charlie Sheehan. I'm
nearly running out of things to say, nearly but not quite. I believe in
a thing called love ah ah ah yeah. C'mon Barbie let's go party oh oh oh
yeah. Thanks for reading, Irish Passport Office
