Very watchable if you like original stuff or things

First off I'm impressed by the sets and acting in this from start to
finish, with a few accent slips and redo-able lines but apart from
that, Original, funny, sad and surprising so its really 2 thumbs
up........ Siskels or Eiberts bum. If you're a fan of Sci Fi or "Man on the run from the evil Corporation
to save his family" style episodes/shows then this is for you. What
will impress you more is that Daniel MacnCheese is acting well beyond
his Neighbours days in OZ and should truly be called Daniel Macpherson
as he isn't filled with cheese anymore.Shame the creatures didn't seem that realistic (they reminded me of the
Sketchies? in The Dark Crystal but silly how they didn't look
physically possible to move the way they did) but overall very
enjoyable and looking forward to the next volume as it looks like it
might get a bit Bioshockish???
