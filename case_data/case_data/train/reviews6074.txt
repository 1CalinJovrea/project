Great, silly, cheesy action fun - this movie should have been a hit!

I'll never fully understand why people flock to films like "Iron Man
I-III" and then completely ignore a fun action film like "White House
Down". After reading so many bad reviews, I started watching Emmerich's
latest noise-opera only because I wanted to get tired enough to go to
bed. I had planned to watch the first 5 minutes and to then fast
forward through the rest of the film and have a quick look at the
expensive special effects. Never did I expect to actually enjoy myself
- and yet I did. In fact, I enjoyed myself so much that I couldn't stop
watching for the entire 2 hours, and I didn't even get up to go to the
bathroom. Right from the start I realized that this movie doesn't take
itself too seriously and that this is Emmerich having fun (destroying
the White House - if you count freezing it - for the fourth time). But
despite all the silliness and the tongue-in-cheek moments, this is a
suspenseful ride which never lets up and kept me hooked the entire
time. There are quite a few unexpected twists and turns along the way,
and the wonderful supporting cast (James Woods, Richard Jenkins and
Jason Clarke, to name a few) keep even the most clich√©d characters fun
and interesting. So my verdict: Great, silly, cheesy action film!
Suspend your disbelief and you will have one hell of a good time. I
rate it 7 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/
