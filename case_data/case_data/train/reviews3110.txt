Wasn't Funny or Dramatic enough

Lay the Favorite stars Rebecca Hall as an ex-stripper and Bruce Willis
as an ageing Las Vegas bookie. But nothing comes good in the script. It
is as flat and the writing is noticeable. We can now see why the film
was not shown wide in America. The affection between Beth and Dink
feels a lot more genuine, with Willis delivering a finely tuned
performance. Hall bounces off him with comically goggle-eyed
expressions but she comes across more clumsy than needed. This film is
listed as a comedy and drama but it really is neither funny, nor it is
as dramatic as one should be for a sports betting film. It is also
utterly predictable, specifically its ending.
