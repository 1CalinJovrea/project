A failure with some nasty hateful parts

This is another example of how a good comedy is far more difficult to
make than a good drama or action flick.I was dragged along to this movie by a friend hoping that it would not
be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggested. It is. I really
wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for
the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to
achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An
unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on the
beloved Hangover franchise. It has some of the poorest dialogue and
worst performances I've seen in a while. I honestly can't think of any
redeeming qualities that this film has.The ugly gag about uncircumcised men is particularly nasty and reveals
a mean spirit considering that circumcision rates are declining in the
USA and currently at only about 60%. So that's almost half the domestic
population that has been insulted by the dirtbags responsible for this
disaster. What pathology is behind this scene one can only guess at.
