Everything is B movie standard

On the plus side the rare and vintage cars are quite beautiful and the
scenery in the South of France is attractive even though Marseilles is
not the prettiest town in France. The cast is OK but B movie caliber.
The girls are semi hot and the villains semi menacing. Scott Eastwood
is alright but he doesn't quite have enough charisma to make up for the
rest of them.The story seems pretty predictable until a twist saves things then it
doesn't seem like such a ho hum movie. The car chase is rather slow
because the cars are delicate and can't be damaged. In fact I was more
anxious about the cars being dented than anything else. This movie
doesn't attempt to be a Furious type movie.Not a must watch by any means.
