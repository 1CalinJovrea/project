Just bad

I had heard good things from friends about this and I kind of wanted to
see it. So I decided might as well go see it. Before I saw what I am
about to say, I am a huge fan of almost all the movies these actors
have made. I thought pineapple Express, Hot tub time machine, Superbad,
and Knocked up were all amazing movies. I died in laughter throughout
all of those movies. However, I thought this movie was really bad.At the beginning of the movie, I found almost all jokes and everything
very amusing. i thought it was going to be great until after Danny
McBribes scene when he appear. From that point on it just went down
hill. The jokes started to get worse. I thought I was the only one at
first that thought the movie was getting a little redundant and
ridiculous. It was then when i looked around and relieved people had
stopped laughing as well. I found myself waiting for the movie to get
better but it was just getting worse the jokes were just getting run
into the ground (Danny McBride and James Franco referring to
masturbating on everything). By the end, all I could think was I wasted
10.50$.One of the most disappointing was almost all the actors. Seth Rogen,
awful. Michael Cera, really weird. Jonah Hill, just bizarre I mean I
personally found his performance really strange. Craig Robinson, Okay
but wasn't very funny. Danny McBribe, funny at first but then grew on
as very annoying. James Franco, funny. Overall, I really did not like this movie. Between the rape references
and biblical references, I found it to be really weird. I usually don't
care about that stuff but like I said they would drive it into the
ground. I would honestly wait until this is on Netflix. Trust me, this
will be on Netflix's for sure. Really not worth 10.50$.
