Too many flaws.

We thought the cinematography, casting and acting were exceptional, and
worth seeing. The story, however, has too many flaws. The dog would
have awakened the man and put him on guard. How on earth would a blind
man track down, capture, and enslave in a block and tackle harness, the
woman who killed his daughter in an accident? Without being seen? How
could any man survive multiple brutal attacks, including several
swinging sledge hammer blows to the head? The police would have
identified the blood spatter DNA from both the captive woman and the
escaped woman (Jane Levy), seen the block and tackle harness, and not
simply closed the case as a blind hero successfully dealing with only
two robbers; they would have pursued those leads, even in Mayberry!
With a little more work on those issues, this could have been a real
classic.
