I had low expectations

I put off watching this movie because I read an awful review of it. So
my expectations were low. But let me tell you, i LOVED this movie! What
fun! Just a super fun movie.I'm not going to spoil it for you, the less you know the better. I will
tell you that John Carter was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the man
who wrote Tarzan. But unlike Tarzan this is science fiction. If you
liked Star Wars, if you liked Willow, if you like adventure and action
movies then check this one out. I might even buy it, which I almost
never do any more. This was SUCH a pleasant surprise.I just wish I had a 3D TV, because it comes in 3D also.
