Stoker made me want to watch a Michael Bay movie

About 25 minutes in, I felt like I had been trapped in a coffin for 196
years like Johnny Depp in 'Dark Shadows.' No stimulation, no light, no
sound, just complete darkness and a dreadful sense I'd never escape.I know it was 25 minutes because I kept checking how long the movie had
been going because nothing had happened until then. I prayed something
would.Anyway, due to my emotional investment and over inflated ego, I thought
with actors like this, and a director like that, I couldn't be wrong
and it would get better.Like all of my prayers, this one went unanswered. I grabbed a Kleenex
and blew my nose. I grabbed another to wipe the tears from my face,
thinking I must be a really bad person for God not to have answered
this one too, for it was my most sincere by far! So, here I sit, an
empty box of tissues by my side, another hour and a half of my life
wasted, and just praying again for better judgment.Sniffle, sniffle...
