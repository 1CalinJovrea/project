Difficult to emotionally invest in but wickedly entertaining.

With 2011's Take Shelter, Michael Shannon is proving to be a
fascinating leading man. Just through his presence, he can convey that
unstable line between sanity and insanity and bad and good. You can
just tell his inner conflict is going to explode at boiling point. It's
unfortunate that while Shannon certainly transforms into the 'iceman,'
The Iceman's script doesn't call for much of his range. Instead, it's a
moody gangster film that revels in the moments where it can step just
beyond the clich√©s while still pressing all the standard buttons. It's
interesting in these kinds of scenes where a mob boss forces an
associate to give to a homeless person or Shannon lets James Franco's
cameo pray to God just to see what happens. It's a well-acted film,
particularly Winona Ryder standing out in the supporting cast and it's
very slickly made. But the fundamental problem with the film is its
rhythm. The editing is constantly hectic even at the smallest things.
There's no natural fluctuations that give emotional moments gravitas or
action moments excitement. It does end up fatiguing and it lessens the
sense of journey and change. Nevertheless, it's still a wickedly
entertaining thrill ride to the end, just blunt at its edges.7/10
