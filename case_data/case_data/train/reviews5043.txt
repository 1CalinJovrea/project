A near-ideal mix of gory kills and organic laughs

The concept of director Greg McLean and producer/writer James Gunn's
THE BELKO EXPERIMENT won't seem overly original to those who've seen
BATTLE ROYALE or really any movie in which people are forced to hunt or
kill folks they know and like, but in Gunn's hands it's a whole lot
more fun: office workers for a Bogota-based non-profit are trapped in
their shiny office tower and told by a mysterious intercom voice that
they've got to murder a certain number of their own before a
pre-determined deadline or double that number will be killed via the
company's "alternate method". To prove the seriousness of the
situation, several employees' heads are suddenly ripped open by a
mysterious force. After several attempts at teamwork to devise methods
of contacting the outside world result in even more bodies as
punishment, some of the (literally) more mercenary members of the
management team decide that the voice sort of has a point, and set
about liberating several handguns from a downstairs vault, not long
after other sluggos have raided the cafeteria of its sharpest utensils.Not surprisingly, Gunn's script establishes a firm balance between
action, horror and organic comedy -- bother Sean gets some of the
biggest laughs as the corporation's resident stoner and conspiracy
theorist, who leads his own little squadron of three for much of the
film -- and he and McLean have assembled a such a strong, fan-friendly
cast of familiar heavies (Michael Rooker! Tony Goldwyn! Gregg Henry!
John C. McGinley!), lesser-knowns and newcomers to play this likable,
believable group of office drones that they're able to smartly subvert
expectations on a number of occasions.The body count is extremely high -- most of them on screen -- and the
blood and gore is plentiful and extremely well-crafted, but it wisely
isn't lingered on and there's no off-putting, drawn-out torture scenes
to speak of. Mind you, a few of the most audience-pleasing kills are
exceptionally squishy, so I could see this eventually hitting DVD and
streaming in R and unrated versions. The TIFF audience saw the unrated
version for sure last night, so plenty of cheers all around when some
of the most devious players met their makers.This is a great "what would you do" kind of show, and I'd imagine a lot
of genre fans will get a huge kick out of it.
