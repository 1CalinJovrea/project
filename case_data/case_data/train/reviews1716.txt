The best film I've seen.

Without me blabbering on, I would like to give my complements to John
Green and his Team. The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which
has a really sad ending (I'm not going to say it to you). As the quote
says "Some Infinities are bigger than others" however, Hazel and Gus's
love was quite an extraordinary one. It must of been hard living with
Cancer. The book was different, but it still had the same story to the
film but with more parts. I got the book after the film came out so my
book has the photos in it. I have to say I did cry at the end but I
couldn't stop blabbering through the film. Too be honest, Hazel Grace
has inspired me. Not everything in life is perfect and people are
dying, this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer. Like the book says, pain demands to be felt. It touched my sad side.
This book is one of the best. Thank you.
