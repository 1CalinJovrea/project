Very enjoyable.

If you want a very enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing and romantic movie
to watch, I think this is absolutely perfect. I think critics are
giving it bad reviews because it didn't have the best dialogue, so
don't go if you're just looking for something negative in a movie. If
you're emotional, I think this would be a good movie to watch during
that time. It's beautiful, well done, heartbreaking in some moments,
and has amazing actors. It's comedic and romantic, with some intense
parts so it has a lot of complements and genres in it. This isn't a
negative thing at all, this movie just has it all. The story line and
the message are thought provoking, and it's an all around amazing
movie.
