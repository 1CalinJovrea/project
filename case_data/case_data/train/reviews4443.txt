Why is this bombing at the box office?!!

It makes absolutely no sense that this film is bombing at the box
office, this is a great film! Maybe it's because it's fresh off the
heels of an exhausting election, or maybe it's because of the other big
time films out right like Star Wars. I sincerely hope that it's not
because of the NRA, I hope that people won't avoid this wonderful movie
just because of the gun lobby. Jessica chastain gives a real powerhouse
performance as Elizabeth Sloane, a tough as nails lobbyist for the
Brady campaign. Also here is Sam Waterson, who works for the gun lobby,
and I really liked him in this role, he fit in it well and gives a good
performance. I loved the great writing in the movie and the clever
moves that are made. This political drama is so interesting and well
constructed. Mark Strong is so good here too, chastain and him have a
great on screen chemistry/presence too. The film will keep your
attention the entire way through, it has too because there is just so
much happening. Now I know that plenty of conservatives and big time
Pro-NRA people will want you to avoid it and maybe even write a bunch
of scathing articles slamming it, but don't listen, oh what a great
movie this is! 10/10!
