Worse film of the decade

I watched this film with my girlfriend expecting to see another great
film by Will Smith. After you have seen him in films like I am Legend,
I robot and other great films. I thought this would be yet another. I
was poorly mistaken, the acting was terrible. from both Will Smith and
his son. I cant help but feel his son only gets parts in films due to
his fathers fame. Maybe if the boy were to sell popcorn and soda to
people, his contributions to the film industry would be more welcoming.
As his acting is far below par. The film was so shockingly boring that
my girlfriend and I left the cinema 20min before the film ended. As a
few other people had done before us. Avoid this film like the plague.
If I could have given it no stars I would have. Bad story line, bad
acting, bad film.
