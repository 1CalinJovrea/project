Even as a BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM ripoff....it doesn't work.

Woody acting and product placement ruined this movie for me. i'm not
sure how he did it, but francis lawrence even manged to make Battke
Royale 2 rushed and uneventful. to elaborate further, there was ZERO
character development, everything felt pushed along, including the BR
Act itself. there was no passion to it, there was no empathy that you
get from the original, you don't feel sorry for anyone. although, i
think the big ending cliffhanger was done well, the overall movie was a
snooze fest. they even managed to make a pivotal scene, the clock
shaped battle field, BORING and pushed along.everything the main character is, is because of that room, her life,
her persona, her transformation, and her realizations. it had no heart
and was just copied from BR2. the subtlety and nuances of the original
are just lacking. like i said, you you don't care about the characters,
you're just waiting to see what happens next...and what made it even
worse, is that i KNOW what's going to happen next, but dammit, i wanted
my money's worth.
