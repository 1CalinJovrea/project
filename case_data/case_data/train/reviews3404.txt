Elegantly filmed piece portraying the futility of war

23 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight -
Testament of Youth. Based on the book by Vera Brittain which is a best
selling account of her experiences during the First World War, this
film follows the life of Vera herself during those harrowing times.
Starting out gently, we follow Vera, her brother and his friends from
their comfortable life in the country to the eve of the war in 1914 and
beyond. I say gently because this film eases you into what was one of
the horrors of recent history, a time which shattered people and ruined
lives forever. After fighting so hard to get to Oxford, Vera then gives
it all up to become a nurse, a journey which ultimately takes her to
France and gives her first hand experience of the massacre that war
dishes out. There is a romantic thread running through the film but her
strongest bond is with her brother and her world is torn apart when he
signs up to fight. Vera was played beautifully by Alicia Vikander, a
Swedish actress who I am not familiar with, but she had look of Emily
Blunt in her facial expressions and mannerisms, and unfortunately did
not seem to age at all during the film, not even in grief. However that
is my only criticism in an elegantly shot film even when covering the
abomination that is war. Another cinematic experience to make you
think.
