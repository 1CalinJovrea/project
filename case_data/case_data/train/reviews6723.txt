Who knew the history of McDonald's could be so interesting

This biopic of Ray Kroc who expanded but didn't exactly found
McDonald's - (he bought it from the McDonald brothers as shown in the
movie) is interesting from start to finish. The beginnings of fast food
industry which changed the landscape of the country and many parts of
the world.The story is well written in a straightforward non confusing manner. It
clearly details the various stages and struggles in franchising raising
finance and expansion and the various conflicts that can arise.
Insightful contrast between old rich investors and hungry young
struggling people as franchisees. Along the way the people who helped
him with good ideas are shown and the poignant buyout of the people who
started the first McDonald's with the innovative kitchen format.Michael Keaton sounds a bit Beetlejuice at times and he is good
throughout. Enough of his personal life is shown. He is presented quite
neutrally - it's shown he didn't honor his promise to pay the original
brothers a percentage of profits but it comes across as just the way
business is done in this country. There was a less than flattering
depiction of Bill Gates in "Pirates of Silicon Valley".A surprisingly delightful and interesting look a the history of
business in America.
