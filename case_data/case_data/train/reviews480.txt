8
Is EXACTLY what its mean to be - a THRILL RIDE

Before seeing this movie, I read many reviews. Many of them were giving
this film a poor rating, stating that it doesn't come close to the
original, stating that it doesn't have this or that, etc. I decided to
ignore the reviews and form my own opinion of the movie - which is what
you should do as well...First of all, in my opinion, this movie is not a remake - it seems more
like a Reboot. Same concept, some of the same characters, story line
has changed. Once you can accept this movie as a standalone and not
compare it to the original - I believe you will be very pleased.Special effects are wonderful, Story was fast paced and exciting,
actors are some of the best in the industry, and to me - it was a
Thrill Ride from beginning to end.The only reason I give it an 8 instead of 10 is because I wish the
movie had been just a little longer for character development and so
that the movie didn't feel so rushed. Aside from that, I thought it was
a great movie!Watch it and form your own opinion!
