Big Disappointment

Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson...how can it miss?It did.Performances were first rate, especially Ms. Thompson. How CAN that
woman play such a frumpy and unpleasant character and still be so
beautiful and desirable? The woman is an artist. That wasn't the
problem. Hanks was adequate and nothing more.The story spent WAY too much time on the deeply depressing relationship
between Ms. Travers and her father and WAY too little time on the
relationship between her, Disney, and Disney's team. The movie is
frankly a downer, BIG time.I can't recommend it. Sensitive people and those prone to depression
NEED to avoid it.
