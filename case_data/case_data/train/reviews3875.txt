Crime thriller which keeps its schizophrenia under control

Robber with morals Parker (Jason Statham), shot and left for dead,
wants only to recover his share and teach people how to behave
properly. Having tracked those who owe him money down to Palm Beach, he
poses as a Texan businessman in order to get a real estate agent to
help him identify the property they may be using as a base. He may not
have reckoned with the real estate agent having her own agenda, and the
crew who owe him money having high powered connections... This crime caper movie starts off firing on all cylinders. It opens as
a robbery gets under way and then stays in full action mode for the
best part of an hour. Then Parker arrives in Palm Beach, encounters
Jennifer Lopez's hard-up real estate agent, and something really weird
happens. You can feel that, at this point, the film badly wants to
become a comedy. It never does - it remains a violent, hard boiled
crime thriller throughout, but there is always this strong urge for it
to be something lighter and frothier whenever Lopez is around.For all that, I enjoyed it especially given that it didn't always do
what I expected it to. It was, as always, a mistake to get Statham to
do accents - as well as a generic American accent, he is saddled with
having to have a go at a Texan accent, and accordingly he wanders
around all over the place - US tough guy, Texas, and (mostly) London,
sometimes all in the same sentence. The action sequences are well
staged (Statham exhibits powers of recovery on a par with Wolverine's
healing factor), with one especially satisfying moment during a fight
which produced an audible, "Oof!" from the cinema audience. Good fun,
if a little odd in places.
