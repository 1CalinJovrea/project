Ugh...

I love the first 5 movies by Peter Jackson and this completely
disappointed me...The battle could have been much more epic but the
problem lies with all of the extra plot lines Peter Jackson decided to
throw in (that weren't in the book). Because of those, the movie was
forced to focus on tying up any loose ends dealing with those added
characters and plots. So, the movie didn't do justice to just how
important of a battle this was in Middle Earth history.Also, what happened to the elves half way through the battle? In the
book, there are supposed to be over 1000 of them. And they don't
retreat in the middle of battle.And why did Jackson leave out Beorn?? So Thorin could get all of the
glory? Dumb...
