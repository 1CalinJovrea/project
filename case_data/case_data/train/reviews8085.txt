totally boring and utterly ridiculous movie

though i usually enjoy more movies where there is a delicate balance
between substance and style - the film has an intelligent story and
characterization that produces deep emotions, too - i also find great
and perhaps a little guilty pleasure watching action films once in a
while but this is one of the films in its genre in which i simply do
not find anything enjoyable or pleasurable at all. it is totally boring
and utterly ridiculous watching experience and i only wonder why on
earth it was ever even made in the first place? there is NOTHING
original. everything has been seen hundreds of times in hundreds of
other movies...the characters are silly the story is totally predictable almost in
every turn and there is absolutely no humor which may be the worst
thing of all: all the people concerned producing this piece of stupid
crap take themselves so damn too seriously and that is the most
apparent source of yawn breaking boredom most viewers must feel at it.
it is just another stupid piece of dull action cinema.keanu reeves who is still a sight for most female and many male sore
eyes even in his fifties cannot save it (i think quite few women would
have the overwhelming interest to watch the film despite its handsome
protagonist). reeves as a retired professional hit man is as irritating
cardboard character as anything else in the film. for most male viewers
it is still enough if you slaughter a hundred guys around you with a
relevant weapons arsenal and sprinkle blood on the walls in endless
killing euphoria while on your vengeance tour de force but that kind of
treatment when consistent all the way from the beginning to the end
rarely makes a very good action movie. there must be something more.i admit that south koreans who are the real masters of the action genre
nowadays have sometimes managed to do a fair movie from the scratch but
this film crew has not been able to do so.total waste of time.
