Avoid at all cost!

This is probably the worst movie I 've seen for years.I suppose I
should support the film since I am Greek and Lanthimos is Greek too,
but I'm afraid I 'm tired of this pretentious and meaningless cinema we
are producing that gets its foreign distribution and recognition now.I
thought that Dogtooth was a terrible movie too, but I was hoping that
something might have changed with this one, especially as Colin
Farrel-whom I like very much-was the lead actor;unfortunately, this is
a dreadful movie, full of stupid dialogs, pretentious and pointless,
stupid, and it asks to be taken for surreal or weird but Lanthimos is
neither Bunuel nor Lynch.It even begs to be taken seriously as a
symbolic comment on relations, which makes it seem even sillier. There
are and there were great directors in Greece(Nikos Panagiotopoulos,
Vasilis Vafeas and, most of all, Stavros Tornes, to name a few) but
Lanthimos is not one of them ;he is a fake and I was angry I had to
watch this trash of a movie. I'm still angry, so I wrote this review.
