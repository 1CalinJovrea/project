Unbelievable tear-jerker

Lion tells the story of a very young boy in India who gets separated
from his family for 25 years and his struggle to piece together his
past.Dev Patel plays the older Saroo and is outstanding. He delivers
terrific emotion at all the right times. Nicole Kidman is of course
outstanding as his adoptive mother. But the real star is the young boy
Sunny Pawar who plays the young Saroo. He was just outstanding for such
a young actor.I think the movie could have been better by shortening the sequences of
Saroo's anguishing over his past. And we would have benefited from
learning more about Saroo and Mantosh. It would have been great to see
more growing up scenes with Kidman, though you got enough of a picture
to see that the kids were treated wonderfully.The Hollywood ending isn't one, because it's a totally true story,
which makes Lion even more unbelievable. This is the kind of movie to
watch when you think YOU are having trouble. Think of this poor young
boy lost and alone in a city of millions and your problems should drift
away.Roony Mara's role as the older love interest seemed to be like a throw
in, just as a foil for Patel. I wonder if she was real or added in.Anyhow, solid acting, great cinematography, you'll love Lion. It could
just have been tightened up in editing a bit more. Enjoy
