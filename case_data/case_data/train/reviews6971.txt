Better than I expected for a typical CIA/terrorist action thriller

This type of film has been done many times before, so I didn't expect
anything close to the far superior 007, Bourne or Mission Impossible
franchises, yet it was better than I expected from seeing the trailer.The directing, editing and cinematography were all on point and the
writing was decent - although a little far fetched with Dylan O'Brien's
character from an average Joe to better than the best military
combatants.All the actors carried their roles very well, and although I had my
doubts about Michael Keaton playing the retired Navy Seal/trainer role,
he actually nailed it.My main complaint was casting Dylan O'Brien; he did play his role very
well, I just feel his age/looks/skinny physique did not fit his
character. And that small fur patch on his chest was just annoying to
look at and take his tough-guy character seriously.Overall very enjoyable and a well deserved 8/10 from me.
