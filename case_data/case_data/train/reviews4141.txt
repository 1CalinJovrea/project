Disney's Best in 20 years.

A lot of people criticize Frozen for what it isn't. Their preferred
setting, cast, etc. Not for what it is. It is an incredibly touching
story with fantastic music, score, script and performances by Menzel
and Bell we haven't heard in a long time. I took 117 nieces and nephews
ages 18 months to 14 and not once did any of them get up to ' go to the
bathroom' or get more snacks. Boys, girls were both drawn to the film
the whole time. The younger kids responded more to Olaf than the
thematics of it all. The story centers more on the sisters relationship than a romantic one
and has a great message. I would recommend this to any family or Disney
fan.You will be singing the songs over and over.
