Poorly Scripted, Senseless Plotting, Badly Dated, Cookie-Cutter Characterizations

If this sequel had appeared in 1997 or 98, it would have been averagely
interesting. But in the past twenty years hence, the audience has had
the delight to savor so many other much more superior movies of its
genre (which were ironically spawned by the first Independence Day's
success) - something which the direction of this movie did not bother
to account for, hence we are in for a very badly dated why-bother
sci-fi flick. The original was passably good for its time, and this
sequel is but almost a poor spoof of itself.Everything from the plot to the mundane cheesy dialogue, un-laughable
jokes, and empty characters, and OK-ish CGI  all cookie-cutter
mishmash from other passé movies. Situations make no sense, neither do
the illogical reaction of the characters, including our supposedly
'super-intelligent' big mother-monster chasing after a school bus for
no real reason apart from the fact its there, like a playful kitten
after a spot of light on the floor. And of course the 'saviour'
alienship with all its bombastic intellect and scientific pizazz comes
right up face-on to be blown to smithereens without doing the obvious
thing of announcing the altruistic reason for its presence  when
apparently it does speak English at that too! Anyway, so so so many
nonsensical senseless situations here, don't even bother to care two
hoots after a while.None of the characters nor actors have any lasting impression nor
charisma  and the two 'romantic' couples . totally plastic with inert
chemistry. I can almost hear Jeff Goldblum whispering to Judd Hirsch,
"Geez, this movie is just so bad we need to wind-up our exaggerated
gestures and jaw-drops to save it!" The original TV Star Trek would be more interesting.
