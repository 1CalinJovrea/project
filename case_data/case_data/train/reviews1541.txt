the metaphysical paradox of the reviewer...

Is the reviewer writing the review the IMDb member is reading -- or is
the member reading the review he was looking for, regardless of the
text actually used? I ask because clearly that sort of thinking, that
sort of dialog, was near and dear to the writer of this oddball film,
yet, paradoxically, it is this very strangeness that gives the film
historical worth, and the chance (however slim) that it may be
remembered fondly by viewers of the the far future.We will skip the metaphysical question as to why a remake was done of a
perfectly serviceable and timeless classic? What the original may have
have lacked in CGI, it made up for in heart, and in its almost unique
satirical POV on modern corporation communications (which led to a
series spin off on Canadian TV, BTW) But Hollywood likes reimagining
stuff. Even Vincent Price as THE FLY was reborn as the forever
self-aware Jeff Goldbloom, and we sense this was what was intended here
too.Reviewers notes: 1. Strange casting. A-List supporting cast (including
the under-used Jackie Earle Haley) yet the lead himself seems
uncomfortable in the role.2. The references to Wizard of Oz are doubly ironic since the movie
itself suffers as much of an identity crisis as the main character.
Since this is clearly no longer an action film with embedded satire
(the "origins" go for a full hour!) then what is it? Sci-fi? Horror?
Fantasy? The viewer is left to decide.Bottom line: not entertainment as we know it. More of a film school
essay topic, along the lines of what was intended ... and why was this
greenlighted?
