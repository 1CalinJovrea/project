Disappointed

So the new year has kicked off and many were hyped to see the video
game turned movie.Let me just say save your money this flat movie is designed to get the
gamers' to the movies and then be bored for the entire time.Save your money for something else that won't have you checking for the
exits within 30 minutes and kicking yourself at 50 minutes for not
running to the nearest exit.The actors and director have done well with a script that should have
been better and is more about trying to set up a franchise rather than
providing the movie goers with a action packed movie.
