Best movie of 2013!

I just came back from the theater and to be honest I went into this
movie with very low expectation! But WOW did it prove me wrong. The
film left me on the edge of my seat all the time, one could argue
things were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big
picture.Performance are top notch and if it was for me I would give Jackman his
very deserved Oscar for this amazing performance, of course all the
other performances were really great also but Hugh's stands out for me.This movie is worth your time, and I'm sure by the end of it you'll
keep talking about it with your friends, for me that is a success stamp
if the movie can keep my mind busy all the time.This is not your feel-good movie. This is a perfectly paced thriller
which I haven't seen anything like it in a very long time. For me this
was a totally new experience as I usually go for lighter movies in the
cinema, but after this movie I will go out of my comfort-zone in movies
more often to find masterpieces like this one.
