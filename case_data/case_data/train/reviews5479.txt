Thoughtful zombie meditation on sickness and love

Saw the premiere of this and haven't been able to stop thinking about
it. Schwarzenegger is tender and subtle, I saw one review describe his
performance as 'gentle', which I bet is not an adjective often used of
the man. Abigail Breslin is a sad, scary, horrific lead. Joely
Richardson plays a difficult role in a stepmother; a terrified third
wheel doing her best with two small kids of her own. Movie is 90
minutes long and destined to be a cult classic. I think my only
criticism is that the director's palette looked like an instagram 'old
photos' filter; there was enough great acting in this film, and sad
suspense leavened with humor, without having to wash it in beige.Overall loved the film, and the studio will regret not putting it in
wide release.
