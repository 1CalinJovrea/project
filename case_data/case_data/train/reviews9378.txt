Love, Curse and Sacrifice

In Gatlin, South Caroline, the teenager Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich)
dreams on leaving the conservative town and go to the college. Ethan
has dreams with a mysterious girl and when he meets the fifteen
year-old newcomer Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) in his class, he
realizes that she is the girl of his dreams. The outcast Lena is
rejected by the mates since she is the granddaughter of Macon Ravenwood
(Jeremy Irons), who is considered a worshiper of the devil by the
superstitious dwellers. Ethan gives a ride to Lena and they fall in love with each other. Soon
he learns that Lena is a good witch that on her sixteenth birthday will
be claimed by the light and the darkness. She may stay in the light,
but is cursed to change to the dark side if she falls in love with him.
Further, her evil mother Sarafine (Emma Thompson) is a caster that is
pushing Lena to the dark side. Now they are seeking a spell to save
their doomed love. Will the lovers succeed? "Beautiful Creatures" is a pleasant romantic fantasy about love, curse
and sacrifice. The fight between light and darkness is well resolved
and the conclusion is open to interpretations. It will never be
nominated to an Oscar, but entertains. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Dezesseis Luas" ("Sixteen Moons")
