A superficial, generic, by-the-numbers "Gangster" flick--What a joke.

Black Mass is a waste of your time and money. DO NOT see this. The
number of well-known actors used in this film is a damn shame because
every single role is such a cardboard cutout that any lesser-known
actor wouldn't have made a difference. Depp plays "Whitey" Bulger, and
to constantly remind the audience that he's a real bad guy, he gives
stone-cold, eye piercing looks, he throws in the necessary run of the
mill curses, kills a few unremarkable people throughout and that's it.
Don't expect any action or colorful, well-written characters. Yes, this
is based off a true story, but, in the context of the film, there is no
significance; it doesn't matter--it's been done a ton before and it
adds absolutely nothing new or refreshing to the genre. Except for a
couple of interesting subplots (which are all quickly brushed off and
"resolved" by a single line of dialogue in a following scene), this
film has nothing going for it. And it really is a shame; there are
hints of a better film that shine through every once in a while during
its seemingly forever-feeling run-time, but, that's not to be had.
There's not much more to say because this film really doesn't have much
going for it. DON'T go to see this--it really is THAT bad.
