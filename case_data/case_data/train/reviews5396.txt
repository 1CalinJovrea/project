Dreadful. Possibly even worse than Quantum of Bondness.

***BEWARE - MAJOR SPOILERS - BEWARE - MAJOR SPOILERS - BEWARE - MAJOR
SPOILERS***Amongst the very worst of the Bond series. Surprisingly, after an
action-packed pre-credit sequence it became so slow, plodding and
tedious I wasn't sure it was actually supposed to be an action movie
after all. Then a few unimaginative 'action-sequences' were thrown in
and we were supposedly off, except that the dull, leaden script (except
for a couple of sparkling moments) and badly contrived storyline
(meandering between inanely pointless set pieces and sheer
unbelievability) never actually let the film take off at any point. And
there were so many plot-holes you could fire an Uzi a full 360 and not
hit a thing. All this and what appears to be a complete aversion to
many of the long-standing characteristics that always made Bond who he
is (and made a Bond movie a Bond movie) and you have a dull, third-rate
spy movie about some tough bloke employed by Whitehall.If the central character's name was altered from Bond to, say, Jack
Steel or something, there would be little if anything left in the movie
to suggest you might be watching a Bond movie.Yes, its tough and gritty, but gone is the suave, sophisticated,
knowledgeable, utterly committed agent we are used to, now we have a
stroppy, confused man moping about getting drunk instead of reporting
for duty; who about a quarter way through the film remembers where he
left his razor and even gets himself together enough to shave; who,
after being felt-up by a homosexual villain, alludes to previous
homosexual experiences he might have had; and who hatches a really
stupid plan to use M as bait by taking her to a completely isolated
manor house with hardly any firepower available, whilst inviting the
baddies to come and get them, which they do with more men and more
firepower than Bond thought to bring along; not surprisingly Bond's
daft 'plan' to get the villain results in Bond getting his boss killed.If the makers of the film want to revisit classic Bond, perhaps the
theme song to this one should have been "Nobody Does It Worse."Bond is dead.
