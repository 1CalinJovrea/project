An incredibly emotional, yet unbalanced, journey

I'll start by saying that I'm an incredibly emotional person myself,
which means I'm capable of feeling great empathy for most of the
characters on screen, but this time I could clearly hear the whole
crowd in the projection room crying their hearts out, or at least
feeling sad for that little, genuine and brilliant kid played by Sunny
Pawar, whose first performance on screen was pure gold.The first half of the movie would deserve a solid 9, with a rhythmical
and powerful editing, mostly long shots (which will most likely make
you want to visit India right away) and the tough, indifferent and
unscrupulous reality Saroo finds himself fighting against. A strong
journey of survival and nostalgia, filled with moments of pure disgust
and decay as well as moments of relief and hope.The second half, tho, is barely comparable to the first one. The script
gets slightly weaker, even tho Dev Patel - whose accomplished maturity
is unbelievable - is incredibly real and fragile in a wonderful
performance, as long as the classy and subtle Nicole Kidman. Rooney
Mara is a short, but very pleasant, add to a great cast. Saroo's search
for his biological family is way slower and way less powerful than the
tough struggle for survival in the first part. But in the complex,
Garth Davis' debut on the big screen is more than successful, and the
suggestive cinematography, with a wonderful soundtrack and a genuinely
good story, make this movie more than recommended.7/10 is a democratic average between first and second half of the
movie.
