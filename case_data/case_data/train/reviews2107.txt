I really liked this - I laughed out loud!

As a Brit - I never grew up with the Three Stooges. But I love Laurel
and Hardy, Buster Keyton all that stuff, so I know the territory.I really enjoyed this - it's a silly romp, but it's brilliant for it.
Lots of slaps, smacks and pokes in the eye. I laughed out loud a lot
and at times I was in tears laughing! You need to keep your eyes open
as an adult viewer - there are lots of oblique and hysterical
references! Came home and treated myself and my 9 year old son to some
original Three Stooges on You Tube, and boy was that funny too! We
loved it. So now we have discovered the Three Stooges! The film is very
faithful to the original stuff. Only slight query I had with this film
is the guns (and the Three Stooges buying in to a potential murder...),
which, if young children are going to watch it - it doesn't need. But
that does not detract - the Three Stooges is good old fashioned
slap-stick family entertainment.I might even get the DVD when it comes out!
