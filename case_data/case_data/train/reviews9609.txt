Contrived, Clich√©, and Snore-worthy

I saw this early because a friend of mine was able to get free tickets.
If I had paid money for it, I would've walked out in about twenty
minutes. The plot is entirely predictable (except for a half unexpected
twist towards the end) and derivative. It's one part Amytiville Horror,
one part Black Christmas, and one part Psycho.Everything from this movie is essentially ripped from another movie.
Each "scare" is just a jump scare. Absolutely no ambiance or tension.
They keep attempting to do misdirection, but after the first few scenes
of "hah! nothing behind this door!" it becomes a parody of itself.
There's even a scene in the last few minutes that is mostly a
scene-for- scene of the night vision bit from Silence of the Lambs.The cinematography is awful. During moments of "emotional drama" the
camera is all but three inches from the actors faces. The camera is
shaky through almost all of the movie, from which my friend became
nauseous. They do that cheesy "move slowly towards object of interest"
thing.The director seems to want you feel for the characters by shoving their
life problems in your face within the first few minutes" Oh, teenage
girl has problems with her mother. Oh, teenage guy is shunned by
everyone. Are we supposed to feel for these one-dimensional characters? All-in-all, a terrible movie. It's definitely NOT for horror fans. Save
your money and catch it on cable in about three months.
