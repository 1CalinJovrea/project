Great Movie for both children and adult

Son: i really love the last part it's so funny i almost broke my spleen
laughing i love the movie you should definitely check it out. read the
whole captain underpants series at your local library. Father: I
watched the movie with my son as he commented above. No doubt that was
great movie for children but as a adult i would say there are many
jokes and part you would love to and I think they also reminded me my
school days.
