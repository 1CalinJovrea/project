Sooo much potential

First off the girl that played the daughter is probably the worst
actress ever. I blame her for the low ratings. There were so many other
options to play the daughter, one that is funny and has somewhat of a
personality. Favorite scene was the two ladies fighting in the ring.
Lets do a remake and replace the girl.
