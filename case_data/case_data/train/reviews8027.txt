Fun suspenseful horror film with a twist of sci fi

I'm actually surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. Right
before this I watch the horror film "Mama," which I criticized for
showing too much and leaving nothing to the imagination. Refreshingly,
this movie does the opposite, and shows very little, which really makes
the movie better. It is common for low-budget movies to have to be
creative and not show things they want to show, but this is usually a
blessing in disguise. The two young actors are great and they have a good chemistry. They
seem so perfect for each other, so it becomes that much more
suspenseful as things start to go wrong. The movie has a fairly simple plot, and never really explains exactly
what is going on. From an early point in the film, I got an idea that
we were dealing with a sci-fi, otherworldly evil and there is never
really any twist or surprise that reveals anything different.The reason that the movie still works, is the couple is likable and we
really feel the husbands frustration and feel sorry for him. I read another review complaining about the ending, and I can see where
they are coming from, but to me the ending was fine. I'm actually glad
they didn't try to reveal too much or explain everything perfectly. The
main let down is that it is very predictable. It basically confirmed my
suspicions all along.I like sci-fi horror movies like this, and I actually prefer this type
of explanation over the more common metaphysical/ghost type of evil.Overall, it was a fun and suspenseful movie that kept me engaged until
the end. There is not a lot of depth or substance to keep me thinking
about it, but I can definitely still recommend it.
