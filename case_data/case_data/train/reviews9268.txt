A movie that exceeded all expectations

Just a very general comment. I was really looking forward to see that
movie since it is based on the real life events of the Benghazi embassy
attack. I think the movie has got by far less publicity than it
deserves. Extremely well made movie which offers non-stop tension and
excitement.In this movie you will have everything. It's not simply a movie full of
action but also gives a little insight into the personal lives of the
Americans who lost their lives in the attack. It's emotional, about
love and friendships, hope and faith, courage and self sacrifice.If you watch this movie, you know that your time and money was well
spent.
