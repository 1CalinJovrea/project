Don't bother watching.

Oof, should never have seen this film. It was slow, boring and with
literally no stand out moments at all. James Franco was cr*p, and
totally unlikeable. Mila Kunis gave an odd, over the top performance.
Ha, which leads me on to another thing.. She was literally over the top
of all her tops in the movie.. 3 female characters all wore cleavage
revealing corsets, and fawn all over male character. They're supposed
to be witches ffs, and *spoiler* even when Mila Kunis turns into the
wicked witch she rips her top off (for no apparent reason), turns green
and warty, but still has a low cut cleavage revealing corset dress
going on. Eh? When I was a kid witches were wicked, a bit scary, and
probably covered in warts but not really sexy.. Does everything female
have to be sexy? No need. It shows how bad the film was that that is
pretty much all I can remember about it though.....
