Well I liked it

Americathe near future: the annual 'Purge'a 12-hour period where all
crime is legalisedturns into a nightmare for a wealthy family who had
hoped to spend the time in the safety of their heavily fortified home.The Purge has been the victim of a lot of negativity, but I found it to
be a well-executed thriller with a satirical edge that deliberately
adopts a far-fetched premise in order to take a pop at the USA's
culture of violence, its undercurrent of racism and a legal system that
favours the rich.I imagine that much of the hate comes from Americans who simply don't
like the messages the film so effectively illustratesan understandable
reaction, perhaps, but sometimes its good to take a long hard look in
the mirror, and if you don't like what you see, do something to make a
change.On a more shallow note, the action was suitably hard-hitting, with the
snooker room fight being particularly bad-ass, and both Lena Headey and
Zoey Sandin are total babes.
