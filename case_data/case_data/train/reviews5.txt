I love this movie!  This is NOT the Stallone Dredd at all.

After my third viewing of Dredd (in 3d) I have found something that I
rarely find nowadays...a movie that I can't get enough of. It is action
packed, dark, brutal and oddly poetic in its violence. The perfect guy
movie. Karl Urban, as many have said on these boards, IS Dredd...and that is a
remarkable feat to pull off, considering half of his face is shielded
for the whole movie (just like in the comics). He plays Dredd with a
stoic, uncompromising demeanor...someone who lives and breathes justice
and the law, who can kick anyone's ass at a moment's notice, but who
also has a very slight 'human' side to him that comes out in brief
moments of morality. To be honest, I did not see this in the theaters after not really
caring for the Stallone version back in the day. The trailer did look
very promising, so it was one I waited for the 3d Bluray release. I am
so glad I took the chance because this movie is so satisfying in
everything you could want in an action movie.The 3d looks fantastic on Bluray. The studio used new 3d cameras that
really show up on the screen. Thankfully, there really aren't many
'throw random things at the viewers face' type of gimmicks, but more
so, concentrates on closeups of the actors showing their faces in great
detail. This is critical for a character like Dredd, who teeth gnawing
grimace must be showcased in order to show any type of emotion from the
character.I can't say enough good things about this movie and it is becoming the
movie I showcase on my home 3d theater. Hopefully, the home video sales
more than made up the rather lackluster box-office results to warrant a
sequel. Check it out if you want to go through a wild ride through the
eyes of a regular day in the life of Dredd.
