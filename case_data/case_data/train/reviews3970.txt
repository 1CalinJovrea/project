Jane Fonda and Robert Redford

This subtle love story profiles two lonely seniors in a small town in
Colorado. They've known each other for years. They are neighbors. Yet
each is wrapped up in his/her own life and memories.When Addie (Jane Fonda) appears on Louis' (Robert Redford) doorstep one
day, she has a remarkable request. A stunned Louis mulls it over and
agrees, and the two virtual strangers begin an offbeat relationship
that forces each to face the ghosts of their pasts as they gingerly
move toward one last love.There are no histrionics, no emotional explosions, as they begin to
know one another and their family members. He has an estranged daughter
who has never gotten over his abandonment of his family 40 years
before. She has a bitter son who has always felt she blamed him for his
sister's death 40 years before.What heals them and brings them all together is a lonely boy (her
grandson) who gets dumped on Fonda after his mother runs off. Together,
Fonda and Redford reach out to the boy and they become an odd but
loving family unit with the inclusion of an unwanted rescue dog.Can the idyll survive? Will the demands of family tear them apart? In
the hands of two great stars, the roles of Addie and Louis are
delicately yet firmly portrayed as people who have made mistakes but
who move on with their lives. You can't change the past ... and you
shouldn't forget your mistakes.Co-stars include Bruce Dern, Phyllis Somerville, Judy Greer, Matthias
Schoenaerts, and Iain Armitage as the kid.
