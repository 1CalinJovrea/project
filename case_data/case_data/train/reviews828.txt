In a word...EPIC!

I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly
negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am
definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured
my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the
plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the
oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves.
This is a new version of some of the old "Godzilla vs....." movies. Not
similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and
destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an
epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most
reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in
the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time,
but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works
very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the
action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is
quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything
away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY
entertaining. 10/10
