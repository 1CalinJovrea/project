Breathtaking - A Musical with Heart

I went to an awards screening of Les Miserables and left the cinema
speechless. Tom Hooper's direction and the cinematography, costumes,
art design and editing are nothing short of genius.Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper
emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is
absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with
spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as
Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is
one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT
rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.Also, a great supporting turn from newcomer Samantha Barks as the
heartbroken Eponine (look out for her waist - it's absolutely tiny!),
who is sure to be shot into stardom. Eddie Redmayne, Russell Crowe and
Aaron Tveit are also good, and there's some great comedy relief from
Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.It will leave you laughing, crying, and feeling inspired. A great
watch, sure to win some major awards this year! 10/10!
