A bit boring. Huge shocker, I expected this one to be good.

I went into this movie with high expectations so that may be the reason
why I wasn't at all impressed with this film. The action was bland,
short and just seemed like everything we've already seen before. The
truly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and
that was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over
the rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this
with the usual expectation of seeing something "new".. well I was let
down.The majority of the movie was completely boring. There were only a few
scenes of very mediocre action and it just seemed like they did not put
a lot of effort into this movie.
