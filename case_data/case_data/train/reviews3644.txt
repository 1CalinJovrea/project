Throughly enjoyable...except for the f*rt gag...And the f*rt gag is
worth mentioning because it was foul.Otherwise, switch off your brain and enjoy the gorgeous Channing Tatum
laugh, cry and bare his beautiful buns -- and all in the name of love.It's a film that doesn't bear much examination. It's a chick flick with
a dumb heroine (why are they always artists???) who wouldn't know love
unless it smacked her in the gob...which it eventually does.The reveal where we find out why she originally changed so radically is
like: Oh, get over yourself, girlfriend! The punishment hardly fits the
crime...unless you're 12.But who cares. It's a fairytale. And for me it worked.
