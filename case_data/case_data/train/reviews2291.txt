Interesting.

"A Royal Affair" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign
Language film. I would agree that it was a very well made film about
some interesting people, though the film was otherwise a rather
unremarkable biopic. Good, but I could see why it didn't take the
prize.The story is about the Queen of Denmark, Caroline Mathhilde--the sister
of George III of Britain. And, while some of the small details might
not be correct, the story itself is based on her sad and short life.
After marrying King Christian VII, she soon realizes he's mentally
unstable and rather perverse--and has absolutely no interest in her.
It's a lonely life until she falls in love with the King's favorite, a
German doctor who eventually becomes the virtual leader of Denmark.
What's next? See the film--though I suppose you could just read up on
her on Wikipedia! But you probably shouldn't. The acting and quality of
the production is very good and quite compelling. A very good film but
one that is, at times, a bit difficult to like because the characters
in the movie are a bit hard to like--even the 'good' ones.
