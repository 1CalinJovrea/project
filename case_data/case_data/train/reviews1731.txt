Terrible

Nothing scary about it. You never find out what exactly "It" is or what
it wants or how it originated. Pretty pointless movie. It's basically a
movie about passing a STD around, which apparently passing it on to
someone else didn't help the problem since the original guy still saw
"It". Filming was horrible too, most of the movie looked like someone
was walking around with a video camera. I gave it 1 star because 0
wasn't an option. I'm flabbergasted at the people who gave this a good
review. How anyone thought this movie even deserved 2 stars is beyond
me. The only things I could come up with was either they had a part in
the movie or they were on some hard drugs. An hour and 40 minutes I'll
never get back.
