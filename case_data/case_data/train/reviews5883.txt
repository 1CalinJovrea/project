Whut?

First and foremost, the concept of the film is good - interesting
although somewhat unrealistic and illogical. However, as the story unravels, the connection of the characters simply
does not make sense. The main character played by Frank Grillo, who was
on his way to seek revenge on the 12 hour Purge Night, rescued four
helpless civilians from the street. Despite that they were loud and
annoying, he decided to escort them to a safer place in exchange of a
car. Somehow in the process of running around and shooting crazy people, he
felt that one of the civilians - a young girl that kept asking
questions, was "special". The connection was weak, but he felt
obligated to protect her no matter what. Anyway, after many plot holes along the way, he finally got to the
place he wanted to go 11 hours and 55 minutes ago. He had 5 minutes to
seek revenge but suddenly his conscience comes into play. He decided to
not kill someone so recklessly (although he has had his fair share of
fun, shooting like a gangsta). Like whut?The end.
