Why all the negative talk?

So what was everyone expecting with this film to give it such harsh
reviews and ratings? We do remember this is a children's bedtime story
right? I thought that the movie was great. The giants are a little
scary, depending on the child this may not be the movie for them as the
giants are somewhat gruesome beasts. All the nerds out there
complaining about the CGI and poor quality of the giants, go get a
girlfriend, watch some sports and stop being such a geek. Special
effects and CGI are fine in this movie, again this is a movie about a
fairy tale so imagination should be something needed for a film about
flesh hungry giants that live in the sky. Most of us know the ending to
this movie without watching it, but the extra story line added in to
extend the movie are entertaining and do not spoil the film or change
the classic story we all know. I recommend this movie, but please watch
it with an open mind and remember that your watching a film of a child
fantasy story. I give this film a 9....more of a 7-8 but I threw it an
extra point or two just cause all the dorks who are highly critical of
such non sense regarding a film about a kids bed time story ha ha.
