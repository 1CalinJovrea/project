Ridiculous Character Actions Ruined a Cool Premise

I admit that the premise was pretty cool, but the way the characters
act in this film defies any and all credible explanation.When some strange things begin to occur the characters immediately jump
to the most outrageous conclusions without a hint of hesitation. For
example, after a neighborhood blackout a couple of guys return from an
outing with a metal case containing pictures of everyone in the group.
A real person would assume a joke is being played on them or that
someone is having a little fun at their expense. Not this group of
people. They immediately assume some unexplainable event must be
occurring. Why? Because the plot needs them to. They make absolutely no
attempt to find a logical explanation for the events that are going on.
To the contrary, based on a single paragraph out of a random quantum
mechanics book they all assume that what is happening must be
supernatural. From there the movie continues to devolve into a series
of ridiculous character actions and motivations that defy any semblance
of human nature. In fact, it was beyond ridiculous, I would go so far
as to say it was unwatchable.If you don't require believable explanations for character motivations
then you might be able to enjoy this movie. Otherwise, I'd say skip it.
