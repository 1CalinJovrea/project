Entertaining, but never quite reaches the heights of its predecessor

'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' has everything fans of the first film
could have possibly wanted and more. Action, humour and special effects
are all in abundance and visually it's very impressive. The plot is
decent, especially for a sequel, but it never quite reaches the same
level as the first film. The British/American theme works well though
and there are some very funny cultural jokes and references.As someone who loved the first 'Kingsman', I'm pleased that the sequel
didn't disappoint. It remains true to everything that made the first
film such a success, including taking some big risks and thinking out
of the box. The end result is an imperfect and at times messy film, but
a rewarding and highly entertaining one nonetheless. 'The Golden
Circle' is much better than expected but just not quite on the same
level as the first film.
