Sit back and enjoy this film.

First off I just want to say that this is my first review of any film.
I attended the world premiere of Maggie last night at the Tribeca Film
Festival and I am also a huge Arnold fan. It was great seeing him
perform in a different (dramatic) role. The cinematography in this film was absolutely stunning. From the
location setting, the small town, old house; it was all well put
together. I thought the cast was great and Arnold did a great job in
his role but this film was focused on Abigail Breslin. And she stole
the show. She outperformed the rest of the cast and made each viewer
connected to her character very closely. Abigail had many scenes alone
in this film and without giving too much away, there were times you can
feel her pain and sort of understand what she was experiencing as the
film progressed. Maggie really shed new light to the zombie genre because it showed
intimately how a family member was deeply affected by an outbreak. A
father and daughter bond filled with love and courage and the chemistry
played on screen between Arnold and Abigail was fantastic. Each
character showed great passion throughout the film and it was well
directed by Henry Hobson, his directorial debut. I recommend this film to viewers who are interested in character
development, great cinematography, a well written script, and a solid
meaningful ending. Please don't come into this movie expecting The
Walking Dead/ Zombieland type of action film because this isn't it.
Hopefully Arnold will take on more of these roles in the future and
from what we saw in Maggie, Abigail has a great career ahead of her.
9/10
