Disappointed

I love all the Underworld movies. Awakenings was okay, but not great.
There was a lot of action, but there were a lot of missing details and
chronologically it did not make sense. If Selene was pregnant, she
would have known it. It seems to me that the uprising against the
lycans and vampires did not happen straight after the last movie. There
would have been a lag in time. Also, if her daughter was cloned, the
writers did not explain any of that. Also, just even alittle bit more
of the history before mankind started to "cleanse" the world would have
made more sense. The other movies were much better than this one at
giving more detail. It appears as though Michael is back and that there
will be a next Underworld as per the ending of this movie.
