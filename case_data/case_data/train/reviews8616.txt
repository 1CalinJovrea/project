I walked out after 1 1/2 hours!

This is *not at all* the movie they're advertising.I expected a hilarious, raunchy romp. What I got started off gross,
although not very funny, but then it slowed down. Before long it became
tedious, with some touching scenes with the father, which carried it
along for a while.By the 1-hour mark I was willing to stay but waiting for it to end.
Then it really started to drag. It's like somebody said, "Let's make a
really, really bad imitation Woody Allen movie without the comedy or
the genius."When I finally just couldn't stand another minute I got up and got out.
I knew it must be near the end, but it didn't matter. I did not care
what happened to the two protagonists *in the least.* UGH! LEMME OUTTA
HERE!***SPOILER*** I don't actually have a spoiler, my whole review is a
spoiler. The movie makers seemed to get desperate after the 1/2-way
point. They threw in random scenes, apparently trying to spice it up,
but oh, my, are they dumb.Lebron James is a big surprise. He is good, and funny, and fresh. Tilda
Swinton's prodigious talents are curiously wasted. Marv Albert, Chris
Evert and Matthew Broderick must cringe at the very thought of what
they had to put on the screen to get their paychecks.Trainwreck is a very surprising huge disappointment.
