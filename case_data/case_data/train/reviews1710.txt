End of the original 300 legacy!

The film is based as a backdrop to the original 300 storyline and paves
a wave for the next part in the franchise but all the way it just
drained the legacy of 300. The hero gives uninspiring talks with beats
in the background score rising to make the army automatically charged
up to start fighting and die... its very nonsensical just like
Themistokles saying " Today is the day we water the plants" and with
rising music the army responds hu rahhh and they get into the battle. Zack Snyder after delivering the man of steel just seems to have
treated this franchise as a step son by doing the screenplay but giving
away the direction at Murro's hands who just couldn't pull it off. The
casting of suvillian stapleton as a lead actor who clearly fumbles in
dialogue delivery and acting was the biggest stupidity. The only silver
lining was Eva Green and she delivered right on the money as expected
with lena heady who just has a few scenes. guess people will just have to watch this part hoping something better
will come in the third. So in all a disappointing experience for one of
the awaited films in my list of 2014.
