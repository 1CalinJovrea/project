A lesson of how unique and quite fantastic minimalist cinema can be.

A surprise at the 57th London Film Festival. A film where the whole
story takes places inside the confines of a car, and with Tom Hardy as
the one-man star. But just how well does it work?Tom Hardy, known best for majors roles in The Dark Knight Rises and
Inception drops the theatricality and larger than life appearances and
takes on the role of average man Ivan Locke, a building site manager,
who over the past nine years has made his life as solid as the concrete
he is in charge of pouring. Concrete is his religion. On the eve of the
biggest job yet, also Europe's largest ever - we follow his car journey
from Brighton to Croydon as the world around him slowly crumbles and he
loses it all.British Screenwriter and Director Steven Knight, brings us yet another
gripping British drama, after previously making Hummingbird starring
Jason Statham earlier this year. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes,
Locke is refreshingly short and never over stays its welcome. The
narrative is actually so constant that even when Hardy is not in hands-
free phone switchboard mode, we capture another underlying story. Locke
provides just as much a character journey as it does a car journey.During the recent UK Premiere, producer Paul Webster recalls his
initial talks with Steven Knight, in which he said; 'I want to do
something quite different, in a confined space, about a guy whose life
changes during the course of one car journey. And we never leave the
car.' And that is literally what happens. Bringing an ideal mix of
humour and emotion to the project, Hardy's taunt performance is
mesmerizing. The put-on Welsh accent is pretty decent also. Filmed in
just eight nights and with very low budget, the film is literally a
lesson of how unique and quite fantastic minimalist cinema can be.
