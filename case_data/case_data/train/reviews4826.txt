Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable.

Quite predictable, pretty unrealistic and still very enjoyable. That
being said, this movie is everything you can expect it to be. Quick and
interesting action and even if you can predict what's gonna happen next
(sometimes precisely to a second) you still will enjoy seeing how they
made it happen. As for acting: Rebecca Ferguson's lovely, Simon Pegg'g
good, Ving Rhames Jeremy Renner and Simon McBurney are adequate for
their characters, and Tom Cruise... well he's the way he is, if you
love him you'll love him here and if he annoys you... ;) All in all
it's an action movie and if that's what you expect than you surely
won't be disappointed.
