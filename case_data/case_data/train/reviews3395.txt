Movie is amazing!

Just seen it with a bunch of friends and it was amazing. My friends who
came with me aren't even Warcraft fans and they even said they can't
wait for a sequel, they said it was nothing like they expected, which
is another shitty fantasy movie. They were on the edge of their seats
the whole time and wanting more! Whenever they'd show Easter eggs in
the background i'd go nuts and they had no clue why but they were too
busy being into the movie to care to ask. I CANNOT WAIT to see another
one of these movies!!! I even noticed a lot of people outside the
theater who have never played the games or know anything about it,
loved it. I even talked with an older couple for a good 10 minutes who
loved it but didn't understand a few things and i cleared it up for
them, they were very thankful. They were excited for another movie too!
