OK if you haven't seen the older versions

I am a huge fan of the old Dark Shadows shows. I liked the old series,
bloopers and all. I liked the films House of Dark Shadows and to a
lesser degree Night of Dark Shadows. I liked the 1991 revival series of
Dark Shadows. This new Tim Burton/Johnny Depp version has some good
elements in it, like the costumes, soundtrack and special effects, but
the problem here lies in the written word. The script relies too much
on gags, some funny and some rather lame. The basic characters are
mostly here with the exception of the melding of Maggie Evans into
Victoria Winters, and the actor playing Willie Loomis does a better job
with the character than did the one from the 1991 revival, who chose
(or was directed) to play the role as a half-wit.(The one element I
disliked about the revival). The 1970s music, cars, costumes and
hairdos are spot-on and add to the comfy 1970s feel of the piece. The
climax is all special effects and one "revelation" of the plot is so
absurdly done here that it is (unintentionally) laughable. In all, I
would say that this film may appeal more to those who never saw any of
the original versions of this than the fans of them. I didn't hate this
film, I just didn't love it either.
