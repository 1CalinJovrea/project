I'd rather jump in front of a U-haul than watch this film

Why did I waste my night watching this film? Lets see, "Growing up is
hard" and for most parts of Nadines life I agree, bullied and losing
your dad is hard. But what for some reason takes the cake is when her
friend starts dating her brother. We already know That Nadine is whiny,
selfish and annoying, but she just takes it to a whole new level. Not
able to act like a normal human being... Until she gets a boyfriend her
self. Both Krista and Nadie are the kind of girls that have no life, no
personality or anything going for them until they get a man by their
side. After that life is peachy, such a great story for young girls.
You don't need friends, you don't need friendship, what you need is a
man on your arm, and life will sparkle. Your other alternative is to
claim that you will kill yourself as the drama queen you are. Besides
this movie is formulaic and obvious, I seldom watch movies where I hope
the main character will jump in front of a U-Haul. But that is the only
thing that could have made this film worth finishing This is the worst
film i've seen in 2017.
