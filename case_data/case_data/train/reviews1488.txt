Bland and Innocuous

While many people attend movies for intellectual stimulation, and
consider a trip to the Cineplex the equivalent to attending an exhibit
in an art gallery, an equal number of people see movies as an agreeable
waste of time, an alternative to a jigsaw puzzle or the newspaper
crossword.If you're among the latter group of people, "Home Again" is the movie
for youa pleasant-enough but trivial piece of fluff, as insubstantial
as a helping of cotton candy.In "Home Again," the privileged wife of a successful New York City
record producer experiences a midlife crisis, separates from her
hard-partying spouse, and moves with their two precocious daughters
across the country to the Los Angeles estate she inherited from her
late father, an Oscar-winning motion picture director. There, in a bar,
she meets three struggling young filmmakers. And as a means of
subsidizing the overburdened financial status of the young auteurs
until their movie deal comes through, she invites then to move
temporarily into her guesthouse. Naturally, she falls for one of them."Home Again" is the kind of movie which during the early 1960s would've
been performed to perfection by Doris Day, Rock Hudson, and Tony
Randall. In "Home Again," the roles are filled by Reese Witherspoon,
Michael Sheen, and Pico Alexander, standing in for the classic trio of
stars of "Pillow Talk," "Lover Come Back," and other classics of the
early-sixties romantic comedy genre.As such, "Home Again" often feels like a fairly decadent anachronism,
one which seems as if it might've been financed on the familial
heritage of its writer/director, Hallie Meyers-Shyer. Young
Meyers-Shyer is the daughter of two experts of this once- lucrative
style of motion pictureNancy Meyers, the director of "What Women Want"
from 2000 and "Something's Gotta Give" from 2003, and Charles Shyer,
the director of 1980's "Private Benjamin" and 1987's "Baby Boom." Mother Nancy Meyers' name actually appears in the credits of "Home
Again" as a producer, and the family connection is emphasized in the
film's advertising, with the writer/director's name featured
prominently on the poster-art, even though this is the 30-year-old
director's first filmmaking effort."Home Again" is amusing enough, if you're in the mood for a superficial
examination of the lives and worries of the veddy, veddy rich. The
problems depicted in this movie seem almost to be like good ones to
have, especially to those souls among us who have trouble getting
together their rent and food money.But for others, "Home Alone" is a reminder that in Hollywood, talent is
not necessarily a hereditary commodity. And that in certain quarters,
nepotism is often still a more desirable quality than actual artistic
ability.
