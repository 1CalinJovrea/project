stupid

how low have the American populace become to think that we are as
stupid as the characters in this film? The entire film is just an
exercise in hoping the mains get killed because they are so stupid and
idealistic.. and the end is even more disappointing. I found myself
actually cheering the savages when the were eating the idiots... Thank
you for making this world worse by promoting this crap.I am not sure how to explain how much this movie offended me and my
sense of common sense. The idiot who was to scared of snakes to urinate
or his efforts to avoid the flesh eating disease that was infecting the
gun he was given to ward off snakes. Or the idiot who ran his face into
the still spinning aircraft propellor. These were a bunch of starry
eyed college idiots trying to change the world with cell phones rather
then something real.I hope the average American is not as stupid as what is portrayed in
this film.This movie is stupid...
