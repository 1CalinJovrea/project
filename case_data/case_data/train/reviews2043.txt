Not what I was expecting

Not what I was expecting, *spoiler alert* franchise killed lightning
McQueen, he never recovers to race again. Huge disappointment for my
son, it was literally the death of lightning McQueen.Lightning McQueen then goes on to become the youngest trainer in
history bringing to an end his career as lightning McQueen. McQueen
gives his position to a trainer that is older than the newer model
Jackson Storm, she happens to be a girl. So my son is waiting for hero
to pull through and then gets shot down by McQueen giving up. The spot
McQueen gives up is won by a trick and not by speed. My son is not
going to cheer for a new when the old is no more. Definitely early
death of number 95. Very depressing movie. The trailer was definitely
misleading.
