The Desolation of Culture

I watched this film for entertainment. I had no expectations. I don't
mind if a director deviates from their source material, provided that
the film works. However, I felt, as I watched, as if someone was
patting my back, and picking my pockets.There are some beautiful scenes: butterflies flying from the treetops
of Mirkwood, Smaug gradually revealing himself, etc. Nevertheless, the
visual virtuosity is wasted, because the scenes have no emotional
impact. The characters are undeveloped, and barely interact with each
other. There is no tension, no texture, no warmth. The story feels as
fake as the over-the-top special effects.The screenplay is insultingly bad by any standard. If you consider that
it was adapted from the masterpiece of a world-class philologist, it's
a crime against culture.If I had to summarize the film, I would call it a juvenile, tasteless,
video game-like action sequence. Take the barrel riders scene. A dwarf
rolls along the shore in a barrel, knocking orcs off the screen,
exactly like in the Donkey Kong Country games. Meanwhile, Legolas and
Tauriel, in god mode, with unlimited arrows, and a perfect aim, are
slaughtering hundreds of orcs. I felt my brain cells dying as I
watched.In conclusion, I left the theatre feeling violated. The film, to an
even greater extent than its predecessor, embraces three things I
despise about Hollywood: catering to the lowest common denominator,
showcasing special effects at the expense of storytelling, and
blatantly treating filmmaking as a business rather than as high art.
