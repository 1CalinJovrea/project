Good idea, but not executed very well

My friend and I wanted to go see this for Halloween. We liked the idea
of a hotel for monsters. We both hated it. The characters moved in very
OTT way and it was distracting. Every shot was a close up on someone's
face, I just wanted to push them away from the camera. The jokes
weren't funny, it has the typical Adam Sandler toilet jokes that just
make me groan. Jonathon was REALLY annoying. He was this films' Jar
Jar. But worst of all we have the "Liar Revealed" clich√©. Dracula
pretends this human is a monster, they keep the lie up, at the end
everyone finds out, they banish the human but then they realize they
liked human so they want him back before he gets home.We've seen this MILLIONS OF TIMES!However, there were a few things I liked about it; the flying tables
scene was very creative. It was like a Terry Gilliam scene, Steve
Bucemi's wolfman was funny and there were a few good gags. The
animation was nice and Mavis was cute in a very goth way.I hated it, but I'll give it a 4 for at least trying.
