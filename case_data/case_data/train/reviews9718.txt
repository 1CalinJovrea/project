Shyamalan is getting back to prominence.

Split is the new film by M.Night Shyamalan, it is a film that promises
to be the director's return, Split is a very interesting film, and very
strange also, that has as "protagonist" a face that has several
personalities, interpreted impeccably by James McAvoy who deserves a
very pro-Oscar nomination so far, is without doubt top 5 best
performances of the year, the film is intriguing, full of mystery,
Shyamalan's direction is very good but the script has some problems, I
missed exploring more of the main character's personalities, if I'm not
mistaken it just shows 7 of 23, maybe in the continuation have the
rest, the rest of the cast has Anya Taylor-Joy who was already in
pretty good The Witch, and she does more a good acting o the other
actors are very well, and the end of the film is very good and links
with another Shyamalan movie. Note 8.2
