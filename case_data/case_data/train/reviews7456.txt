Bryan Singer's magic flourishes on screen..... X men beats everything else!!!!!!

OMG!!! This movie cannot be simply described in words. If you loved X
men first class then this movie is a treat for you. This is a movie
even non-x men fans will enjoy. Go see this movie guys. Your mind will
be blown. I've already seen this movie and looking forward to see it
again. Hugh Jackman does the best wolverine ever. He became the wolverine i
wanted to see on screen for ages. The interesting chemistry between
James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender is more enjoyable than ever. But
jennifer lawrence and Evan Peters at Quicksilver steal the movie.
Quicksilver may not look so cool but he is the coolest guy in the whole
movie. Believe me, this movie is worth your bucks. Moreover there are a bunch
of new x men characters introduced in the movie which make it more
enjoyable.Bryan Singer has done complete justice to this movie. And
there is one scene just halfway through the movie which is worth
watching fifty times. I am thoroughly excited to see the next entry
entry in series which is being called Apocalypse.The only shortcoming in the movie is the runtime which feels a little
less being only 130 mins. Rest of the movie is a jigsaw which fits
together in a wondrous puzzle.So you must go to see this movie. Every element is in a balanced form.
Even the soundtrack is fitting. Happy watching !!!!
