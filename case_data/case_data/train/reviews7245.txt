Great horror movie!

This movie is what the original Amityville Horror could have been, but
wasn't! It is a nail biter, because Ray, despite how easy it is to feel
sorry for him, is a very dangerous individual! I felt so scared for
Zoey from the moment Ray showed up at his childhood home, pathetically
asking to be allowed to live there again! Jesse is a great dad, who
truly loves his daughter, despite his love for his art, and always
tries to be there for her! I loved this movie from beginning to end!
