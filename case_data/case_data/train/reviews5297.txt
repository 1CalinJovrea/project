Emily Blunt worth an Oscar!

I read some of the reviews here, and came with very low expectations to
this movie, and WOW, what a pleasant surprise! Blunt gives here the
show of her life, way above the level of acting in "edge of tomorrow".
The story itself takes time to build but it all adds to the atmosphere,
and finally you get a fair amounts of twists and turns. Bennett and
Ferguson also acting very well, which all adds (to my opinion) to a
great film. And to all the men that say it's a "men hating" film, I say
that you really have a low self-confidence to come up with such a
statement... I would risk to say it's one of my 2016 best films, and I
will be surprised if Blunt will not be an Oscar nominee for this film.
