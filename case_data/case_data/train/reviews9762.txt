A great western take on a Japanese classic

I've watched both GITS films, Stand Alone Complex series and read the
manga. As expected, things didn't reach so far into a philosophical
sphere and at times spelling out the "dilemmas of existence for
dummies" took a little from the atmosphere of the film.But, as far as bad things go, that's about it. CGI were mostly spot-
on, only one or two scenes pulled me out of immersion. As a big plus,
the film took some time to actually present the world itself without
jumping to action. Side characters were great, I enjoyed Aramaki and
Batou the most, Togusa, Saito and Ishikawa didn't have much screen
time, but still delivered. Now, Johansson as the Major, I know a lot of fuss was there about
whitewashing, I don't care about SJW thing, what matters to me if an
actor/ess can act the role and IMO she was a great choice. In most
scenes she behaved exactly like her character should, it didn't feel
forced or overacted to me.And for the plot itself, I'm not saying it was fresh or never seen
before thing, but it was a nice take and it brought something to the
franchise. IDK if it makes official canon, but in my head it already
is.I hope this review helps you, it is my first and I've done it because I
feel that 6.9 stars is a lot less than this effort deserves.
