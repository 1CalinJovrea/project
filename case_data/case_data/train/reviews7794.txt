Seen one Rocky movie you have seen them all..;..

Why is this movie getting such good reviews? There is nothing here. The
plot is just like all the rest of the Rocky movies, they even bring
back the poor chickens. Lots of jump rope too. Oh, sorry not exactly
like the other Rocky movies, nobody died in this one, but he did visit
the cemetery. Some stupid love interest that never went anywhere. An opponent that
didn't even look like a boxer. Not enough boxing, probably because
Stallone thought he could act well enough to carry the movie.Creed: Please Rocky, come back and train me. Critic: Please Rocky, just
go away.
