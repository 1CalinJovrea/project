That one guy who told everyone to **** themselves

F*** this IMDb rating. I haven't been this entertained in 90 minutes
since Pan's Labyrinth. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets 8 stars, and
everyone is attacking the science of this film... f*** off. This movie
is fantastically cool.Remember, critics and joes thought Boondock Saints, Donnie Darko, and
Star Wars blew... yeah. Watch it for yourself. If you're a Luc Besson
fan, you won't be disappointed.Bad-*** car chase, science-fiction, sex appeal my goodness, Morgan "the
man" Freeman, Chow Yun-Fat worthy shootout, visuals that will blow
your-effing-mind, and it didn't even take 2 sequels and a prequel to do
it. What happened to people that used to enjoy movies?
