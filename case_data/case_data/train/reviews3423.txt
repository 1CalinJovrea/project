THE END didn't come quick enough for me

I don't want to waste time dragging down this review like the movie
did, so I'll mention some key elements.Most of the movie was ad lib, they've admitted it. These are not
theater actors, they're film actors. They're not trained to be good at
doing things "off the cuff." There WERE parts that were funny, but they
were too few and far apart. The humor was sort of a slap in the face to
my intelligence. I was more offended that I was expected to be
entertained than I was the actual raunchy jokes. It was like a high
school project with a really big budget.Slap in the face #2. It was like watching a really long commercial. The
characters actually fight over who gets to eat the milky way and
describe why they love the product so much. Seriously? Aside from those
things, there were a lot of little crappy plot devices that were way
too forced. Why is Noah suddenly getting raped by Satan? Why does
Franco's new multi million dollar concrete "fortress" home collapse
within minutes catching fire, and why does it have a basement you can
only access from outside? The overwhelming success of this movie in
only its second week is proof that the standards of young movie goers
is almost non existent. Better movies get drowned out because the
industry is so over-saturated by crap like this, so in a sense, you can
say that movies like this really are actually part of "the end."
