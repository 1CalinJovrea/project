not as good as the original

In this sequel, the guys (Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Dale Arbus) have
invented the Shower Buddy, which shampoos your hair and washes you at
once. The son of a huge catalog company, Rex Hanson (Chris Pine) calls
them in and makes an offer - a one time fee and their company takes
over the product. The guys refuse, then find out the offer was for $3
million and is now off the table.Then Rex's dad (Christoph Waltz) enters the office, orders 100,000
units, and gives them the name of his bank so they can obtain a loan
and get started. After they have manufactured the units, daddy totally
screws them over, as he planned to all along. The guys find themselves
out $500,000 and have lost rights to their product. It's time to take
their usual ineffectual action. And this time, they have an unlikely
ally.The usual suspects are back - Jennifer Aniston. Kevin Spacey, Jamie
Foxx, and they're all very good. The humor in this film seemed even
raunchier than the first, unappreciated by yours truly, which is why I
hate these comedies.Chris Pine was hilarious, and Christoph Waltz was excellent as well.The best part? The outtakes during the closing credits.
