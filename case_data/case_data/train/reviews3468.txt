8 on the Gearstick

The Wheelman. that's his name. Think Phone Booth but set inside a car
for 1hour and 22 minutes. When the phone rings he must answer.. and
answer to no one else!It is edge of your seat stuff and Frank Grillo is excellent as the lead
cast.. (he is literally in EVERY scene) How he copes under pressure
with his ex wife and 13 year old daughter who are in danger while
taking orders from a faceless and nameless caller on the other end.highly recommended.
