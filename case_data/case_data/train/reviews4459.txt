Wonderful

Once again, Emilia Clarke does not disappoint. The acting truly was
brilliant. Both on her part and on Sam Claflins part. The film reminded
me of The Untouchables a bit. It was a very pleasant sight to the eye
to see the bond forming between Will and Lou. Decent amount of humor as
well, found myself laughing quite often in fact. It is nice to
sometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can't
really think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that most
of the movie was kind of predictable. The ending, however, might not
have been as predictable. I didn't want to go to this movie myself, but
was asked to see it. In hindsight I'm glad I tagged along, because I
did really enjoy watching it.
