Tedious and disappointing

How I managed to get to the end of this movie, I don't know. A lot of
people gave it a high rating - they belong to the pseudo intellectual
crowd, probably influenced by the rackets that are postmodernism, post-
structuralism and of course semiotics. People who know something about
movies gave it a low rating - they are the 'call a spade a spade'
crowd. The movie was slow, and the subject matter, well just boring.
Why make a movie about a comfortable middle class professor and his
trying to forget his past lover when there are so much more interesting
things happening in the real world today. And the spider thing - yawn.
It was just trying too hard to be something clever, but ended up saying
very little. Give it a miss.
