A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Chan-wook Park's ode to the Master of Suspense, Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock

Stoker, celebrated Korean director Chan-wook Park's English-language
debut, is a dark, disturbing and diabolical film about an introspective
young girl named India who witnesses the loss of innocence following
the sudden and untimely death of her beloved father. In Stoker, Park's
fixation for the bizarre and the morbid is once again on full display.
But, he is clearly a bit more cautious than usual. He seems to keep his
characters on a tight leash for a much longer duration, and this makes
the movie's first half appear much slower and less hyper than a typical
Park film. But, once the dust settles down, the viewer is treated to
sheer mastery of Park's craft. In Stoker, Park pays homage to the master of suspense, Alfred
Hitchcock. Those who have seen Hitchcock's 1943 thriller Shadow of a
Doubt wouldn't find it hard to draw parallels. Park limns a colorful
canvas like only he can and his characters tread it like spirits caught
in a limbo. While the characters are highly emotional, their strangely
selfish actions make it difficult for the viewers to sympathize with
them. Chung-hoon Chung's alluring cinematography gives the movie a
hypnotic feel. The acting of movie's three lead characters viz. Mia
Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, and Matthew Goode is quite brilliant and in
that order. Overall, Stoker is an intriguing work of cinema that despite managing
to stoke the fire of curiosity may still leave any keen-eyed,
intelligent viewer high and dry. Those accustomed to watching the
quintessential Hollywood product are likely to find Stoker very strange
and deeply disturbing. But, if you are looking for something different
to break your monotonous daily routine then Stoker will surely not
disappoint you. 8/10For more, please visit my film blogsite:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/
