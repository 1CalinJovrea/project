Stephen King has forgotten the face of his father.

I'm not exactly sure what I just saw. The only thing I do know is it
wasn't The Dark Tower. That wasn't the Roland Deschain I know. It
wasn't Jake Chambers either, or The Man in Black. Other people I
expected to see weren't even there. Important people like Cuthbert,
Alain, Eddie, Suzanna... none of them were even hinted at.I wasn't taken to the world I expected. It was an odd place with a few
elements of Roland's world, but they were strangely distorted. Portals
are now transport machines, left behind by the old ones it seems,
rather than magical things controlled by demons. And yet the house is
still a demon apparently - but just because it offered a good chance
for fancy graphics. Without a Suz to meet up with a demon while the men
get Jake through where does this story go? It certainly doesn't go to
The Dixie Pig because Roland has already destroyed it. It doesn't go to
The Dark Tower, because Roland and Jake have already been there too and
saved it.It's like this was some weirdly condensed version of books 1, 2, 3, and
7. Except It only took tiny bits and pieces from the books and created
a whole new story that really didn't resemble the epic Stephen King
wrote at all! I feel cheated and betrayed. I just don't understand how
King let this happen.
