V/H/S (2012) Review

What has happened to the good old suspenseful hair standing up on the
back of your neck horror movie? I watched approximately twenty minutes
of this film before turning it off. I am sorry but it is just pure
dirt. I cannot believe how low the horror movie industry has gone. The
freelance camera work is so tired. It just runes the quality of the
movie. You may as well have the video camera tied by a piece of string
to the end of a stick. I find the graphic content appalling the way
both men and woman are degraded is disgusting. There is no need for it.
It extremely distasteful.I would hate to think that teenagers are watching this filth. What is
the world coming to at all. I thought horror movies were supposed to be
scary. This was a yawn fest. I was genuinely so bored I had to turn it
off. I could not connect to any of the caricatures and the story line
or lack of it was going nowhere. If this is, were horror movies are
going it is a travesty.This is only my opinion of what I thought of this film. Everyone is
free to voice there own. I have always been a lover of a good horror
movie. However, this one just does not make the cut. That is why I am
only giving it a 1-10 unfortunately. I think the word beside the number
speaks for itself (awful).
