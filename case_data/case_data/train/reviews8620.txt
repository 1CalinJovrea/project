Best movie of the year? More like rank #68

This is the 68th best movie from 2016 that I saw. It will only go lower
as I watch more.This gets a low rank because the story is awful. Like really, advanced
awful. That's how awful it is. The characters are also awful and
annoying too. The "smart" autism feature doesn't add anything to the
movie as the mc is a gary stu anyway. Ben Affleck is also really bad
for his role. It's almost as he forgot how to act. Anna Kendrick still
can't act.Only casual viewers who don't watch movies could find this entertaining
and "smart". I guess some connoisseurs can find some enjoyment in it,
but I only came to hate the lead actor and actress more than I already
did. There is surely over 100 better movies from 2016. Go watch
anything else and skip this. Even I can name 67 movies from 2016 that
are better than The Accountant.
