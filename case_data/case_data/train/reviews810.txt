Creepy, Claustrophobic and Scary

While investigating the murder of a family, Sheriff Sheldon (Michael
McElhatton) and his team are puzzled with the discovery of the body of
a stranger buried in the basement that does not fit to the crime scene.
He brings the corpse of the beautiful Jane Doe (Olwen Kelly) late night
to the coroner Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and requests to have the cause
of death until the next morning to have an answer to the press. Tommy's
son and assistant Austin Tilden (Emile Hirsch) is ready to go to the
movie theater with his girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond), but he
decides to stay to help his father in the autopsy. Along the stormy and
tragic night, they disclose weird and creepy secrets about Jane Doe."The Autopsy of Jane Doe" is a creepy, claustrophobic and scary low-
budget horror movie. The screenplay is very well-written and the
tension increases as long as the mystery about Jane Doe is discloses by
the coroners. The limited use of special effects is another plus in
this little gem. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available
