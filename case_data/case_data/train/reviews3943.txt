Now here's a horror movie

This one scared the hell out of me. With the eerie music to accompany
the film it sure made the movie creepy as hell. The opening sequence
felt so real that it got me hooked to know just what the hell is going
on.I was watching it alone on Friday night after work and sure enough
there were about less than 10 people in the theater (all of whom were
couples). I could bet with my bottom dollar that with this movie they'd
be so engaged in the film that they wouldn't dare to think about making
out.It is THAT SCARY!!!The film was directed by Scott Derrickson, the same guy who made THE
EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE; and he collaborated with the composer,
Christopher Young, on that very film. I am quite familiar with Young's
music score from his composition for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 and it
was creepy; also he did the score for Sigourney Weaver's serial killer
film, COPYCAT.I'm telling you if those two managed to bring out the spine-chilling
factor in EMILY ROSE, in SINISTER they really sealed the deal in being
the potent filmmakers in the exploration into the paranormal and
supernatural. It gave me goosebumps just thinking about it.One thing that I feel about SINISTER was that Derrickson (together with
Young) brought us back to that atmospheric terror of the unknown that
is truly nostalgic of horror films of the 70s.The feel of the movie was so scary that this was how THE AMITYVILLE
HORROR should have been remade.In short, I'd highly recommend you (or better still DARE YOU) to see
SINISTER. This is one good date movie if you want your date to crawl
under your shirt; or just bring some best buddies to scare the crap out
of you. I mean it may not be INSIDIOUS, nevertheless, if you love that
then you'll love this.
