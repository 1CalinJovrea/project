The synopsis of this movie here is that it is a revenge thriller or
sorts which it only becomes in the last 25 minutes of the movie.In short, this movie has no idea what it wants to be as it meanders
through one and a half hours of promise with not enough acceleration at
the critical moments. Even the stellar cast doesn't save this one and
how on earth the synopsis writer gives 9/10 is beyond me.Bale is pretty good, Harrelson menacing as always in these types of
roles but Defoe is wasted here and should be holding down his own
movies and Whitaker is completely miscast in my view ( what happened
after The Last King of Scotland??). Saldana is very good as Bale's ex
and usually is I might add.As a silly small point, at just after 1hr 38 of the movie whilst Bale
is moving through the office, a man in a suit with grey hair can be
clearly seen right behind Bale on the right hand side trying to move
out of the way. Pretty amateurish really.The attempt to merge small town heavy industry with hillbilly mentality
doesn't really work for me and I believe didn't work for the local
people too who are quite upset with the portrayal of people in their
area.
