A man among men

Here I am, giving lectures to fathers about maintaining the different
relationships in their lives. But alas!, how does one demonstrate the
ideal, even if you might know such a person?In comes this film Locke, demonstrating integrity, responsibility,
caring, loyalty, firmness, perseverance, plus some more good things
about being a man among men. Forget about Hercules, Braveheart and so
many attractive and well muscled heroes. Here is a man who knows how to
be alone, how to overcome rejection, how to lead colleagues, how to
embrace his children,how to accept his wife as a person even when she
acts unfairly, how to be fearlessly honest.And yet he is not some miracle. He gets extremely frustrated an angry,
but he can allow it to happen without picking on someone else.What a movie!!
