A memorable sci-fi fantasy world with a human heart at its core.

If there is a soul, it is made from the love we share. There are many ways to describe Oblivion, but the softly spoken
afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human
heartbeat of this sci-fi epic. As always, the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion
the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and
characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny, I
found much to enjoy from Cruise, Riseborough, Freeman and that Nordic
guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood
blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screen-time, Morgan and
other supporting cast are effective and memorable. The threads of the plot are well-woven and I won't give anything away,
so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the
unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a
backseat for sci-fi philosophy with twists to spare. Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and
establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the
credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely
abysmal offerings of 2013 so far, don't miss it.
