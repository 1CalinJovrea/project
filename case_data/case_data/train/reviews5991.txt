Excellent Film!

I absolutely loved this movie. This isn't going to be an Oscar winning
movie, so don't go in expecting that! If you are in the mood for just
mindless good entertainment, this is the movie for you. It is somewhat
like the show Supernatural if anyone is familiar with it :). Two badass
siblings ridding the world of evil witches after their parents
abandoned them. (you find out what really happened during the film). Jeremy Renner is phenomenal as always and this was the first time I
have seen Gemma Arterton but she was awesome in it too! It was
refreshing to see a female lead who is a strong kick-ass lady who
didn't have a romance attached to her in some way. It was a clever, new take on a classic tale. I think the Grimm brothers
would be proud. 10/10
