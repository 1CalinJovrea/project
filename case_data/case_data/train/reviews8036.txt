Disturbing, powerful, honest, thoughtful and awkward.. .  Loved it

Its really seldom these days that i feel something while watching a
movie. We have really probably seen almost every type of story there is
to see, it really comes down to the writing and acting to make a movie
special. This movie is that for me. Yes its not really a comedy
although some of it was funny. If you really understand this movie you
will feel all the characters emotions even when he feels nothing at
all, you feel it. I've read someone saying its slow and that was a
negative for them. For me it's a positive, it needs to be slow, you
need to see everything to understand Davis and his thoughts and
emotions. I can't say more you either love it or you'll fall asleep.I hope you love it as much as i did.
