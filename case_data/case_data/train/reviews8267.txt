Slow, poorly motivated

The real chef behind Chef was outstanding, producing food that was
amazingly scrumptious to look at. Too bad the script didn't match it!
The movie began quite well, but soon ran off a cliff when Casper went
on his rant. Until then, I felt compassion for him, but completely lost
it at that point. No longer could I see myself in his position, because
he behaved like no rational person would. Every plot point from then on
seemed unnatural, purely manipulative and largely predictable. Faced
with insurmountable adversity at the restaurant, a rational person
might have invited the food critic to dine in his home or sought a job
elsewhere, instead of burning all his bridges.Unlike the tasty, wholesome foods displayed, Chef the movie is chock
full of fillers, such as unnecessarily lengthy musical interludes and
other scenes that just go on way too long. The film could have been
improved a couple stars just by cutting 30 minutes. Clearly Favreau has
many talented friends, but that's not an excuse to go overboard with
their promotion. The dialog is dreadful and the cornstarch in the
crotch scene was a real head slapper. Emjay Anthony was the one bright
star, only hampered by the script.
