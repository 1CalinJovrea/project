Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness

Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews
and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint!
Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life
growing up, as a lot of "what ifs" came to mind. "What if" I went to
church every Sunday..."what if" I was gullible enough to have a priest
lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this
amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church
and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims.
The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that
I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that
makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that
this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The
exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told
the rest of us "...I am a survivor..." WOW...
