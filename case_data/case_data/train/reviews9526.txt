New York Indie Film

I get the mixed reaction of the audience. It's definitely not for
everyone. I couldn't imagine trying to site through this film being
under say 38 or not having lived in a New York like city. I commend Netflix for investing on non traditional movies and taking
chances. They cater their work projects to the young, old, and in this
case in between age. There are quite a few good New York conceit movies
in recent years, this is no Royal Tennenbaums, I Heart Huckabees, Squid
And The Whale, New York Stories, 5 Flights Up, and its not quite as
good as say Listen Up Phillip. Much like Noah Baumbach's previous film
Mistress America, this took more of an Art House approach. A huge manic performance by Dustin Hoffman and a lot of the more
sedated Adam Sandler screen time. Adam Sandler's character is so
depressing to watch, you hope to get one happy moment out of his
character in contrast to his father. Is Maureen really played by Emma
Watson? She played the strange role of the StepMonster well. Another
mentionable actor was Judd Hirsch. Perhaps Ben Stiller, but he played
the usual role. There are some great moments in this shallow New York
dysfunctional family. There's the most unusual StepMonster that I've
ever seen in a movie, she's like something out of a Cassavettes film.
It asks some bigger questions about life and family through some
one-sided characters. I'm tempted to summarize this as The Squid And
The Whale thirty-three years later. There's some likeness in Noah
Baumbach's work, of course he wrote and Directed both works. This film
has its own merits and its lowbrow art house feel. Some great actors
and an unusual script.
