A Total waste of Time

This Movie, on the surface had the potential to go somewhere and to be
intriguing, but just falls flat on it's face, becomes extremely stupid
in spots and drags horribly. Worst of all, it leaves you without an
ending.It's one of those movies where the viewer is left to make up their own
ending. You are left with no satisfaction after sitting through slow
dragging torture.I will give you the obvious ending that the movie's producers never
did. In the story, the missing girl had sex with her teacher but the
teachers wife never left him for his act of betrayal and pedophilia and
instead blamed the girl for seducing her husband. So, the teacher's
wife abducts, murders and buries the school girl in the outback.This would have explained why the girls mother received the phone calls
where the women on the phone says, "your daughter's a whore". This, however, still doesn't work as and ending because there is no way
the teachers wife would have just randomly found the missing and her
bother wondering in the wilderness.We are just left with; she got into a car and disappeared, I guess to
head of to the big city to become a professional whore?My conclusion; this movie is just plain stupid and a BIG waste of
anyone's time.
