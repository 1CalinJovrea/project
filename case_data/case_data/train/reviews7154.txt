Beauitiful and mesmerizing work of art.

I never cry. Never. I sometimes feel like I got no emotions in me. But
this, this movie, oh, how to explain it. Beginning was beautiful, slow,
accident seemed like a dream, I waited for her to wake up and rejoin
her family, but, what I got was my own life going fast forward in front
of my eyes, and I felt every her word resonating somewhere deep inside
me, her grandpa's words hitting me like a train, and I sobbed. Couldn't
stop myself, just couldn't, just didn't want to. It felt good. To feel
the pain. And not every movie could do that. Not every actor could send
me back to somewhere I thought I forever left behind. And entire cast
just created perfect medium for me to feel something. I can't be objective here. I don't even know if I am reviewing the
movie or just trying to share how I felt for almost an hour, I don't
know, but what I know is that I can't recommend this movie to those who
are unstable and still in process of healing, because as Tom Odell
would tell you, if you don't break down before him getting a chance to
tell you that, "Take my heart and take my hand, Like an ocean takes the
dirty sands, And heal...". When movie finished, and Tom began singing,
I just had to give up and let my tears go as they wished. As much as I
hated myself for letting go of my self-control so easily, I felt alive
and I would never give up experience of watching this movie.Sorry for being overly pathetic, but I had to be completely honest.
