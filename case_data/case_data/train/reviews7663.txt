Worthwhile light historical  thriller.

6 Days is the story of the Teerorist takeover of the Iranian embassy in
London on April 30, 1980. Then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, newly
appointed has the difficult decision of whether or not to storm the
Embassy to rescue the 26 hostages.The story revolves around a team of SAS members and a negotiator,
played by (Mark Strong) and news coverage of the event played by Edie
Cornish. Both terrific actors IMO.I would have liked to see a bit more action and tension given the
circumstances of the takeover and the air of politics at the time given
the rise in terrorist events around the globe as well as the Hostage
situation of 52 Americans in Iran. I do believe, however, the film
portrays the event honestly and with a string degree of accuracy. The film is not a fast paced thriller nor was it intended to be. It
was, as mentioned, an honest depiction of what happened during those
harrowing six days and how well the planning and execution of the SAS
team handled the rescue of 24 of the 26 Hostages. The two hostages that
were killed happened before the raid happened.A very well acted and worthwhile film that does not overdo or Glorify
this terrible event and illustrates excellent military type tactics
still used today in similar situations.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys nonfiction relevant
historical dramas.
