The Sequel That We Needed

When I heard that they were making a sequel to this, I was both
over-hyped with excitement and very nervous because let's face it,
sequels rarely live up to the expectations of the originals. Thankfully
though, this one did not disappoint.It starts off directly where the original left off, which is nice
because there is not a huge time gap in-between. Not only do they
continue chapter 2 right where the first chapter left off, but the
story also goes more in-depth with Josh's past. Will every hard-core fan of Insidious be impressed by this sequel? Of
course not. Insidious: Chapter 2 felt very different from the original.
It was mostly because Insidious seemed so unique at the time when it
came out, and now seeing chapter 2, it is just more of the same except
now people are getting possessed by the ghosts. Without giving any
major spoilers away, I will say that the last 30 minutes seemed more of
a "slasher" movie than a paranormal movie, which may turn some
hard-core Insidious fans away. I really enjoyed how the writers tied the first movie into this one
(you will see what I mean when you watch the movie). Overall, was it as scary as Insidious? I think so. The scares seemed
forced at times due to the fact that they probably tried too hard to
make the sequel as good, if not, better than the original, but it was
definitely still suspenseful.Overall 8/10. -2 stars due to the scares seeming too forced at times,
which caused the movie to drag on.
