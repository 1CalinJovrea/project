If u r too young to love this movie just wait.....

Lost Vegas was the most uplifting movie I have seen in ages. Being of
that 'certain age' I found it poignant and refreshing.All the cast were magnificent. Mary Steenburgen was a pure delight. I
know she has taken up music lately and brought it to the screen! De
Niro was great as the crusty widower with a chip on his shoulder.
Morgan Freeman was, as usual, bigger than life. Kevin Kline is always a
joy to watch (I've never forgotten his roll in A Fish Called Wanda!).
And last, but certainly not least, Michael Douglas was spot on with his
depiction of a person resisting the aging process. If you think this movie is not perfect, you are probably too young to
appreciate getting older. Buy the movie and hang on to it until you are
in your 60's...you will appreciate it then, for sure! All in all, if
you want to feel good, really good, after seeing this movie head out
the door today and enjoy the ride!
