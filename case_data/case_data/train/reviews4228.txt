worst movie ever

I love car movies, Im a car freak and love cars in general. I loved
Ronin with some crazy race scenes, I even enjoyed the first F&F movie
when it first came out but this thing is horrible. they didn't even try
to make it realistic. I know usual would be boring but this is beyond
boring, following someone delivering pizza would have been more fun.
drivers are almost never buckled, and even if they are they are using
stock seat belts from the kit cars they used I assume. most of those
cars have at least 5 point harnesses. and so called race car drivers
are holding the steering wheels like they are sitting at red light
going to morning commute. engines sound very much fake, could have done
much better with this. if they wanted to make a movie around super cars
and racing they should have listened to some pros and got some facts
before they made this, its garbage.
