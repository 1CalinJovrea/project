Too Cliché

Well, the movie does start great. It showcased the main character as
someone who is trying to find and experience true love. The chemistry
that happens between the main male and female character is really well
acted, both the actors are very good in acting the attractions. The
story was great until it comes to the conclusive part of the movie,
where the cliché "happy ending" for the viewers everywhere. I mean come
on, is this movie supposed to promote cheating? The ending was so
abruptly unrealistic. It would've been better if it is not all about
being happy in the end, cause we all know it's not always roses. It
would be more meaningful if it ended differently, like how "500 Days of
Summer" ended. Even though it's not happy ended, it gives the viewer a
really meaningful ends, where we could learn something from the movie.
5/10 for the great cast but not so great script.
