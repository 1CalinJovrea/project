Proof that an "Indie" Doesn't Have to be Bitter to be Good

After reading several reviews about Ruby Sparks, my observation that
many think that an indie film somehow must be bitter, jaded or even
downright mean to its characters to be good was reinforced. Well, I
suspect it's those reviewers who are jaded.Ruby Sparks is romance. It's funny in places, it's quirky (and has its
flaws, sure, but they're easily forgiven). So don't watch it under a
microscope. Watch it for what it is: a mildly oddball romantic comedy
with a nice, superbly-refreshing twist.Don't watch it if you simply can't stand sweetness in an "independent
film." It's not sappy, it's not laid on thick. To me, it was just the
right amount. And left me feeling warm and good inside.Performances are excellent. The story line may border on formulaic...or
APPEAR to. Give it a chance to break away. Sweetness is NOT a bad
thing. Enjoy.
