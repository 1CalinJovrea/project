So far one of the best horror movies this year

My title says it all. No other words best to describe this movie other
than to say that this is the best horror/western movie this year and i
would venture to say that this movie probably has taken the cup for
being the best this year. If you are a fan of horror or western movies
then you should definitely check it out. Kurt Russel, Patrick Williams
give strong performances. All the four main characters describe one
simple notion throughout the movie. Russell--A town sheriff who would
do anything to fulfill his duty as a town sheriff and bring the
criminals to justice. Williams--A loving husband who would do anything
to bring his love back even in the face of immense odds.There are some scenes in this movie which will definitely shock you
being so gory and violent and this is coming from me being a long time
horror movie fan who is not easily shocked. To give you an idea how
certain scenes will be imprinted in your mind for some time is like
when you watched the movie Sinister and there were some scenes that you
could not forget for a while.Finally do not take my word for it or someone else's and give this
movie a try and then decide for yourself. You ll not be disappointed.8/10
