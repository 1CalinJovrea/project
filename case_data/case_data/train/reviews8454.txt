Agatha Christie Would Be Proud

A riveting thriller, written with wit, precision and nerve, directed
with great visual flair, and acted by a group of actors who must have
loved every ambiguous note in the roles they played - and played them
to perfection. With plenty of flashbacks within flashbacks and
narratives within narratives, but always perfectly clear and taut, this
movie is everything a mystery should be. Personally, I love whodunits. I especially love them I know I can't
trust what I'm seeing and when I suspect the answer is being flaunted
right before my eyes but I'm so engaged in the story I don't have time
to figure it out. Well, this is it. Absolutely engaging from the start
and with the kind of ending you never forget.A 10. Not to be missed.
