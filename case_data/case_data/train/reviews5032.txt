Good, but could easilly be better

Although The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen,
it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is
intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story
itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such
movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about
what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan
O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain
of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the
meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless
for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at
the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great
scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring
this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those
Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait
sequel with great interest.
