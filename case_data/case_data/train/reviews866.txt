Love.

Amazing... Like this movie very much. Well played actors, especially
liked the game Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey and Brit Marling, which is known
to me yet another fantastic film Another Earth. Very emotional film,
perfectly matched music. It was hard to break away from the viewer.
Indeed, the theme of which is shown in the film, reincarnation, yet
little is disclosed. Therefore, only a good director and actors, even
when the budget belt can create something beautiful, the food for the
brain, which happened to this movie I also want to pay attention to the
little actress who plays Indian girl - she is beautiful, and her eyes
... P.S. I thought that the man in the elevator (cowboy) with which the
main character is found at the end of the tape wants not prevent
disclosure mysteries of reincarnation protagonist, his words to me
pushed this idea, maybe this is so ... P.S. Sorry for my English. This
is my first review.
