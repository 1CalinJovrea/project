This is an AMAZING MOVIE!

Ironman 3 was a cinematic experience. So many people bash this movie
because they didn't accurately represent the Mandarin character like in
the comics! The hate is absolutely ridiculous! This movie has a great
script, witty dialog, breathtaking action, an amazing story and dives
deep into the Tony Stark character. Ironman 3 is a very Tony Stark
driven movie. It brings back some of the magic from Ironman 1. The
movie shows Tony's intellect and how smart he really is. It shows that
he's not just a man in the suit, but a great intelligent person. The
movie still has all the great action that you come to expect in an
Ironman movie, but still takes time to develop a great story and
characters. The twist with the mandarin was brilliant and I didn't see
it coming. Many people hate on the movie for this, but I found it very
funny and clever. It was a very ballsy move by marvel, but paid off in
the end. The movie also does an okay Job of blending dark themes and
the humor together. I will admit not all the humor land with you, but
works for 90% of the time. In the end had so much fun with iron man 3,
it wasn't as good as the first, but was still a worthy sequel
