Extremely well done

We watched LUCY about on DVD February this year. I usually don't like
the typical shoot- them-up or speculative-futuristic or robotic movies,
they turn me off because they are predictable and way over the deep-end
of ridiculousness in their violence, special effects, contradictions
and same-old-same-old tin spaceships, weaponry galore, and silly story;
like the script and story were just thrown together for the sake of
selling something at the box office or TV. LUCY, is excellent, credible
beyond the usual mush and the action and actors are great. If you like
a good story that will touch your heart, make you cheer and hope, take
you to possible scenarios and just enough chaos to make it interesting,
good actors and a great story, then you most like will like LUCY. My
husband and I often have different likes and opinions but our
differences came together in appreciation of LUCY.
