An Intoxicating Thriller. Incredible.

Sometimes I cannot understand the dissonance between me and a great
number of movie reviewers on this page. I had not seen any trailers of
the sort because I didn't want to preview parts that may spoil he
movie. With that said, I'm so glad I watched this film. This ranks with
Green Room as a real edge-of-your-seat kind of movie but for entirely
different reasons. While Green Room is just a unhinged speed chase
offroad in complete darkness, leaving you dizzy with blurting holy sh't
every 10 seconds, The Invitation takes it's time while not letting the
story flatline. The use of ominous shots and reverberating violins
really give you that sense of unease. The buildup, the paranoia, the character-structuring, the heavy
atmosphere all build up to a short and worthy second half of the film. Honestly, it's frustrating to see so many people give this movie a
criminally low rating because 'nothing happens'? Was I watching the
same movie? Because what I saw building up to the climax was some of
the most gorgeous shots with very grounded characters that immersed me
into the story. People react to a movie that they were expecting and it
wasn't, so they rate it a 1. Really? This is a quality thriller that I
recommend everyone check out.
