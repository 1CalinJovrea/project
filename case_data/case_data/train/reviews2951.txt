Most boring movie EVER!

The simple rule that says if professional critics are prizing a movie
that means it sucks, it worked again. This movie SUCKS - big time. It
is boring to the degree that your brain is calling for help. The main
actors did a lot of great movies but this is not the one. Not worth
watching at all.
