Entertaining without being over the top!

TL;DR: Visually stunning, action filled and down to earth action
sequences (no over the top BS). Storyline with nice twists and pretty
good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting
to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around).**spoiler-free**Rogue Nation, like the latest movies in the franchise and others in the
spy/action genre, starts with a small crew, with little support,
against huge odds, having to deal with challenges that seem impossible
(no pun intended). What makes Rogue Nation better than most is that it makes it all
plausible without super-human characters, crazy gizmos (except one that
I shaw not mention, but it is not overused like in M:I II), and
brilliantly made down-to-earth action sequences. The latest 007 movies
are following the same ideals, but M:I has made a solid choice of
supporting actors (specially Simon Pegg) that add a subtle layer of
comedy and improvisation, which helps a lot into building some suspense
in the audience - it feels like as if they are as clueless as we are of
what is going to happen.Another great aspect that sets this moving apart are the terrific
action sequences which are paired with outstanding sound effects and
music score (without spoiling, there is an entire action sequence that
plays with this very aspect). Was lucky enough to watch a pre-screening
on IMAX, and strongly recommend watching it on IMAX or a theater with a
good audio setup. The storyline, while not hard to follow, benefits from having watched
at least Ghost Protocol, since key characters are back and lack some
introduction, and the story somewhat picks from what took place in the
last instance. Much like Ghost Protocol, the storyline packs some
interesting twists and doesn't seem obvious - even though we all know
that the good guys win, Rogue Nation adds some shady characters which
are not as black and white, making for some interesting development.Overall a highly entertaining movie, packed with stunning action
sequences and a storyline that is well thought-out and manages to keep
the audience hooked until the end. A solid addition to the franchise
that keeps one-upping itself on every new release.
