this is not a reinvention

this is an insult to the original series in so many ways ... a love
affair ? romantic Yagami ? American cheerleader misa ? no REM, no M ...
i could go on but, im gonna try to forget it. IT HAS ROCK BALLADS FOR A
SOUNDTRACK ... its like what shyamalan did to airbender but 100x worse
... thats not just what you get trying to push a whole series in a
short movie. This is downright ... Whats that rating ?
