I enjoyed Pixels for what it was

Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had watched
this before and enjoyed it. I did too, though I knew this wasn't gonna
be any greats shakes and it wasn't. There were some funny lines at the
beginning and some of the video game gags did go a little well. Adam
Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan
did well with their roles. When I saw the arcade and all those video
games during the 1982 sequence, part of me felt some nostalgia for the
times I spent with my brother and his friend playing those games at
that kind of place. About the ending sequence taking place one year
later: lame. Though really, this was pretty enjoyable so on that note,
Pixels is worth a look.
