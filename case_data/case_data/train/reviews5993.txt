Propaganda Meets Pavlov the Dog

Every scene within this "film" was finely tuned, most likely by a focus
group to trigger the desired uplifting emotional response. I left the
movie theater with a uplifting feeling and then about five minutes
later I realized that I was had tricked and duped. I was played for a
sucker because I had drooled on cue just like Pavlov's dog. I am positively sure in retrospect that events, people, fact, time,
effort, and proportion were all distorted and sacrificed to produce
propaganda. When I dug a bit deeper to find out more about this story it came to
light that the book on which this "movie" was based was sponsored by a
major nonprofit corporation, the Alfred P. Sloan Fund for Research.NASA, during the Mercury project, had thousands of talented employees
who will ever remain "invisible figures," to them this movie does an
injustice.The people I saw the movie with will never know that they were had by a
propaganda piece.
