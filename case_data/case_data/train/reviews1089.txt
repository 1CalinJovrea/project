Disappointed.

Good: Great use of real Scottish people doing the voices.Looked nice and authentic.Bad:The plot is just too thin. I can't give it away, but you'll know what I
mean when you see it.I didn't laugh as much as I thought I was going too.Yet again, another 3D movie that has been produced WITHOUT increasing
the brightness because when you view it with the 3D glasses, it dims
the picture. A lot of the movie was shot in dim light, so watching with
the glasses you just can't see what is going on or at best cannot see
the detail of the sets or characters. Don't they think about this when
they produce the final edit? I took my glasses off for the last 10 minutes because I was fed up
struggling to see the detail. I could see the movie was properly lit
without the glasses on. Going to watch movies in 2D from now on.Disappointing.
