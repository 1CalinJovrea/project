Shoot the boredom.

If I was a critic I would have written this movie off. Saying that its
just one of those movies with the same old plot with a bit
modification. This is true, but as an audience I thoroughly enjoyed
this movie.The best thing about this movie is its pace. You won't know how fast
the 110 minutes go. There's not a minute you feel bored. The attack
sequences are bit over the top, but if you are a drama lover, you won't
be disappointed. The storyline isn't much to think about but the
screenplay is apt. Its a good thing that the director Antonie Fuqua
keeps things simple, doesn't dig too much into the conspiracy stuff and
also doesn't include any unnecessary twists.Gerard Butler does what he does best, fight bad guys. Aaron Eckhart as
the stern faced president reminds you of Harvey Dent. Morgan Freeman
probably is there to strengthen the star value in the film. But its the
villain Rick Yune with his evil smile who impresses.This is an out and out entertainer, don't think too much, just be in
the moment and watch this movie.
