Boring

Boring, dull and full of unnecessary parts till the last part where the
disaster struck on the way back. Jake Gyllenhaal was just grinning at everyone who says anything to him,
and lying down topless at the base camp at EVEREST. I think that sums
it up. Cannot believe Rob, the lead character, ignores everything he knows and
succumbs to his emotions and dies as the result of his illogical
actions. Probably the best part of it was to see the real characters
that lived through (or could not unfortunately) the disaster that took
place in 1996.
