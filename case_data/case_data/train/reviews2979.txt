Beyond disappointed!

I cannot stress how disappointed I was with this movie. I expected a
powerful, raw and real view into the true story of the revolution of
hip hop/rap. I was quite young when all of this actually occurred but
(growing up in the 90's) music was evolving in new and significant ways
that was truly exciting. As far as the stories behind the music we were
left with what little we heard on MTV news, read in the few gossip
columns of magazines and word of mouth. That's why I was eager to see
this movie. With social media now we know every step everyone takes-and
they are aware of that-so I was looking forward to seeing a depiction
of a time before that. A behind the scenes look at what really went on
when nobody was looking-because then compared to now-nobody was....Instead what I got was 2 1/2 hours of horrible acting! I've seen
more character in infomercials than in this movie. Seriously I'm more
emotionally invested in if Bob can get that burnt cheese off his
non-stick pan than I was of the deaths in this movie. The actors seemed
as if every single blink was scripted, nothing seemed natural or real
at all-which to me is important when you're portraying something that
actually happened! If the intentions of this movie were to take a real life, hard,
emotional yet exciting revolutionary story and make it seem fake and
drab it gets 10 stars. But it wasn't, therefore I give it 1. It
could've and should've been something great.
