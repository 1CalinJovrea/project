An all time new low for all involved

Jesus, where to begin. Completely juvenile, rabbit trails galore, slow
moving, get to the firkin point. The way the scenes drag and the
endless explaining and talking. This movie was so distasteful,
predictable and irritating. First of all, Foxx was miscast, he does not
do period well, at all, totally unbelievable here, after years of
slavery he's suddenly the fastes gun in the west, PLEASE! The music, what are we to make of the modern day music with the period
events here, you can't take any of it seriously. I had to laugh was so
absolutely silly and out of place. I have lost all respect for
writer/director, the actors I can only hope were in it for the money,
but they lose my vote now too.Open your EYES folks, for god sakes this is all about bringing
division, "I wanna shoot white people and get paid for it". WOW, talk
about the globalist elite wanting to distract and divide, this is one
of their vehicles. Good for you Hollywood and Washington DC, add
another notch to your ugly crown.
