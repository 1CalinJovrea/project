Cowabunga a shell of a good time Turtle Power

While I was really mix on the 2014 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie
because I grew up a fan of the series I got to say this movie did a lot
to make it up to the fans.I saw this one twice in theaters once in 3DTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadow really feels like the
classic cartoon coming to life on the big screen with The Turtles
returning along with the big screen debut of Krang, Rocksteady and
BebopIt really felt like they wanted to make up for what happened in the
first movie and I have to say this one really gave us the feel and
thrill of what the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are all about.The action in the movie is pretty balance out and you won't be
disappointed they really took it up a notch with the fights.The music in the movie really helps bring the story and the emotions
out because music is part of what makes a movie important otherwise
it's no fun.The story of the film really works for fans of Turtles old and new they
made it work out for a win win for all generation of Turtle Fans. The acting is actually good the cast did their part to make the movie
work and did their best plus you can tell that they are fans of the
series even some of the cast said so which really is a plus in my book
you can feel the emotions from the characters that you grew up a fan
of. It really shows what emotions can do for a movie like the Turtles. Comedy in the movie is much better everyone in the theater were
laughing so hard and they actually clean up the comedy a bit to make it
more funny which helps from the last one.This Turtles movie really redeem itself from it predecessor and being
that I saw it twice it was really worth the price of the ticketTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of The Shadows really deliver in more
ways than one and much improve sequel I give Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows an 9 out of 10
Heroes in a half shell Turtle Power!
