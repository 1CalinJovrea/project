The storyline is horrible

The story sounds interesting Â— but bear in mind it is not. It's a sh*t
but the beauty of the protagonist made it a good sh*t. How do they fall in love? a 100 year old person is THAT easy to be
moved? Assume she is, how is it possible to remain calm and peace when
found out the father of whom she is dating to is the guy with whom she
had a close relationship and who even attempted to propose.She just revealed her identity so easily without hesitation. The only
evidence the father had is the scar, and he didn't even have the photo
of the scar. All he know is Adaline had a scar on her hand! I was
thinking he is finding something to perform a blood test or something
more convincing. But as a 100 year old women, she gave in so quickly
without any attempt to make further excuse.In addition, director tried to make it scientific by describing the
process of becoming unconscious and approaching death. But the
explanation of how she stop aging ruined the effort: unaging by
electric shock is by far the most ridiculous explanation I even heard.
Consider agents of shield an example of how to explain the impossibles:
quantum bridge for teleport and vibrates with interior rate sounds a
lot more convincing All in all, if you ask me one story I got from this movie, that's WATCH
THE ROAD AND SLOW DOWN WHEN YOU CANNOT SEE CLEAR
