Blended is blanded.

A bland movie! My wife and I drove out of town to one of the last
drive- ins in our area. The Drive-In gets the B movies. Sandler makes
many B movies. Sandler's funny days of Happy Gilmore are far behind
him. The last good movie Sandler made was Anger Management. Blended is
an example of Sandler's stalled career. The material is dated, and
stale. Whatonce was shocking or over the top for Sandler is now
redundant material! Embarrassed, overly stupid, and weird situations is
all of Sandler's comic delivery. Blended is a cutesy love story with a
few laughs. Watchable movie, but noting special. Blended would be the
second feature in the Drive Inn after the main feature is shown. If the
out of town drive-in had a double feature. Five stars out of ten.
