Hand-Crafted Scandinavian Noire

other reviews critique based on Hollywood tropes and complain because
they are missing. Instead the film strives, successfully, to evoke the
atmosphere of Scandinavian Noire, while employing the story telling
techniques of Knut Hamsun - no character development, no exposition,
and entering the story mid-crisis. I wish it had been recorded in
Norwegian so we could appreciate the conflict between Bergen and Oslo,
so integral to the books. it's a mood film, not simply a whodunit.
bringing in familiar USA actors was a clever red herring, but probably
won't be appreciated, and instead some will complain these actors
didn't get more screen time. finally, the anti-tourism photography of
winter instead served the story and was worth the price of admission to
the big screen view. Overall a needed antidote to the last 20 years of
execrable USA superhero fare.
