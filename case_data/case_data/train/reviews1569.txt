10
Iconic

I have given this a "10" rating. There was one minor issue I had with
the movie that would make it not quite that in my mind, but a "9"
rating would be an injustice to this extraordinary film and, since I'm
unable to give it a 9.75 or something like that, "10" it is. This movie strikes an incredible balance between indy/art-house and
Hollywood epic. The pathos of the main character is well-captured in
subtle ways, as are the feelings of triumph when he is able to go
beyond his own self-imposed limitations. The cinematography is
extraordinary-- this is a drama that *must* be seen in theaters. I
expect that most adults with any sensitivity at all will find this a
highly satisfying experience that speaks to their very cores. My wife
and I were privileged to see it in an advanced screening, and can't
believe we have to wait another couple of weeks for the official
release to go back and see it again.
