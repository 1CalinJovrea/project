Potent and powerful ... and real.

Once in a while there is a film that shows some courage to tell events
of a true story ... Oliver Stone, is a director who continues to
highlight the injustice of the American government and the lengths it
goes to. Snowden is a hero and will be remembered as such, when those
who tried to tarnish him for speaking the truth, will have their legacy
crumble.The man is a hero.I recently watched "American Sniper" and was blown away by the
'patriotism' bullshit propaganda that was almost on par with the the
nazi propaganda scenes from Tarantino's "Inglorious Bastards".This however, is relevant, important to us all ... and above all ...
continues to happen, without our permission or knowledge.I urge people to watch the film.
