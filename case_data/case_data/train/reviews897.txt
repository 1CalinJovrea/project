What a sad and pathetic attempt to re-start a classic. This movie was
written by morons. Those in Hollywood who produced this crap should be
run out of the business. They had some quality actors but even they
couldn't save the script. It had none of the qualities of the original.
Chevy Chase should have refused to be in this movie and put his stamp
of approval on it. The casting of the two kids was awful and there was
no chemistry at all. If you think watching a 10 year old kid dropping
F-bombs in the presence of his parents is cute, and the constant
reference to body parts is your kind of humor then we have a sad state
of affairs in our culture. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
