The spirit of the book is completely gone: a boring movie.

I will try to be as short as I can be in my review, but I am just very
surprised about the very positive reviews on IMDb. For me this was
another huge disappointment. yes there are great landscapes, the
photography is nice and the actors surely are OK, the music is often
inspiring, but even if the movie basically tells the same events as in
the book, I found it pretty boring, and above all the spirit of the
book, about freedom etc, was completely gone. Too many scenes are just
taken inside hotels rooms, houses etc, isn't this movie entitled on the
road? Again, regarding the spirit of freedom, in the book surely wasn't
all about sex and multiple partners etc, because that's not at all the
freedom Jack Kerouac was talking about when he wrote it, these
components have been way too much highlighted. I am sorry but I left
the cinema pretty disappointed, if we had to wait all these year for a
version of the book, and this is the result, well it would have been
better to only have the book.
