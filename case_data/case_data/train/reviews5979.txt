Superb experience & 2nd best movie in the franchise

Almost a masterpiece.It contains everything you love about the movies. Suspense, mystery,
drama, intelligent action & plot.I did not expect the experience I got. A start to finish thrill ride
which also contained intelligent characters & plot. Christopher
McQuarrie has crafted a superb movie which moves at a fast pace but
also slows down when it has to for some intelligent character
interaction.Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances & is in almost the entire
movie. The rest of the cast are all great. Rebecca Ferguson is a strong
character & female equivalent of Ethan Hunt.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner & Alec Baldwin all give great
performances & have about the same screen time.The villains lead by Sean Harris are effective & chilling & also a
little mysterious.Music is superb with many subtle bursts of the MI theme. The film does
not contain hardly any CGI its nearly all practical real stunt FX.Overall it just works from start to finish & Christopher McQuarrie has
created a superb film experience which does not fail to entertain &
deserves repeat viewings to enjoy the experience again & again.This mission should you chose to accept it is to enjoy the movie &
watch it at least once more at the cinema the way its intended to be
seen on a massive screen with loud sound.
