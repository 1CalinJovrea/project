I tried my best to like it.

I rather like watching sci-fi movies. This is the genre I prefer
watching. I watched the first one and it was really bad. Since I like
watching sci-fi movies I decided that I should give this movie series a
second chance. Boy was I disappointed. The second one was just as bad
as the first.Really boring, predictable, bad acting, weak plot, etc. are all the tit
bits you will find in this movie ... guaranteed to irritate when
watching through it all. To say it was really, really bad is an
understatement. It was so bad that I felt inspired to write this really
bad review about it. A true shame. I'm sure it could have been much
better.
