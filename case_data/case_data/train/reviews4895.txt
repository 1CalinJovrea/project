An end to "The Suckfest Saga", and I'm not referring to the vampires

Well, it's over. For some it's sad. No more shirtless Taylor Lautner
(he strips all the way down to his skivvies in this one). No more
cheesy- looking CGI that laughably tries to convince us that these
vampires are kin to The Flash. No more horrid acting. No more horrid
writing. Yes, gone forever is the cheap-shot money-maker that is "The
Twilight Saga" soap opera. In the latest episode, which amounts to
nothing more than an unenthusiastic excuse to showcase every person who
was ever in these films and convince us that the "saga" was something
bigger than it was (it's not), we wave goodbye to all of these things
one last time. Sometimes, what looks great in your head as you read it
in a book just doesn't work as well on the silver screen. This is a
prime example. But sadly, no one really cares. This meritless movie
franchise made money off of a brand, and that's all. What a waste of a
pop-culture phenomenon. Oh well, I hear they're already rebooting it.-Thomas Bond
