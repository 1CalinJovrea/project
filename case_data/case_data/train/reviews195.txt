Misunderstood

I am not writing a review because unlike the others (not pointing
fingers and i apologize if i offend) i don't want to spoil anything and
don't want to say anything majorly about the story I see that people
rate it for something it isn't and i feel like that is a problem. I
just feel like people should know at least what I gathered from this
film. I have not watched the original but what i have understood is that
people seemed irritated that some "proffesional" reviewers wrote it off
as a women hating, violent movie and nothing more.Now i have read some of the reviews for this and a lot of people say
the same thing. Just a violent nasty and judges/rates it on that. IT
Isn't. In fact this is one of the saddest movies i have seen. I think
its wrong to say that it isn't violent. It has violence that makes you
want to turn away. But its not about that. It doesn't rely on violence.
The main character is a troubled man that tries to live his life,
dealing with his issues. He doesn't have anyone and doesn't know how to
deal with them alone.Its a 1st person drama/thriller with a sad but beautiful techno music
to blend in with the neon lighted feel of this movie. The acting of
Elijah wood is brilliant in that he mostly needs to act with his voice
and not his face. The story is sad and i cant help but feel sad for the
main character much like The Voices staring Ryan Reynolds. The movie
focuses so much on there psychological problems that it just comes of
as tragic and sad. This isn't a horror movie with no story and disposable characters. This
is a character built, character driven sad movie that is beautiful both
visual and story wise.
