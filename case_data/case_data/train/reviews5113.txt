The best movie of Berlinale 2013

I watched 12 most promising movies at recent Berlinale, and this was
ultimately the best one. The movie is breathtaking and captures you
from the first seconds. Mr. Rush acting is superb, as are the art
direction, cinematography, score and of course, the plot. Film is full
of beauty, emotion and humor. It feels like a united whole from
beginning to the end and leaves a great impression. I was also
surprised later, when I found out that it was shot digitally with Arri
Alexa Studio - I was sure it was shot on film. This really is a camera
which will finally kill film, although I love film so much. Ironically,
film may remain the medium of choice for low budget productions, who
can not afford renting this Arri beast.
