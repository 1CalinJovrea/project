Trash - Ridiculous Casting

This isn't Denzel being transformed in The Hurricane. This is garbage.
Might as well have cast a White person or Asian to play Thurgood if
Boseman is supposed to look like him even remotely. This is the product
of racist producers who think all Blacks look alike casting the wrong
performer. Supporting this type of horrible racist film just
perpetuates the deformed creature that is Hollywood. Would anyone cast
a tall Nordic blonde to play Einstein? No. It would be ridiculous. But
this is acceptable because? Pretty disrespectful to a great man's
legacy as well. I guess Boseman is the only Black actor available.
