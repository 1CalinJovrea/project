Funniest film of the year (so far!)

Keeping this brief, this is no doubt the funniest film I've seen since
the turn of the year. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a great
bromance couple, and although appearing in the disappointing "Ride
Along", Ice Cube too is brilliant in this film.Expect non-stop entertainment as excellent humour is mixed with an
interesting yet simple plot, heartfelt moments and exciting action. My
only complaint would be that at times it felt a little recycled from
the first film. Though having enjoyed that I wasn't too fussed. More than worth your moneys worth. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, then
you'd be mad not to see this.
