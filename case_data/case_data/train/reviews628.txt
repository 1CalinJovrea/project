Just a pure waste of time

Ron Howard needs to give up making movies. This is a particularly dull
and uninspiring attempt at film making. It is just awful and extremely
boring. Brendon Gleeson and Ben Wishaw are brilliantly gifted actors
but are completely wasted in this bore-fest. There was nothing exciting
going on and the CGI of the whales was totally laughable. I'm sure Ron
Howard will be a laughing stock because of this utterly uncompelling
nonsense. I have recently watched The Revenant and was totally sucked
into it and truly wide-mouthed at how brilliant it was, whereas with
this pile of junk I could easily have fallen asleep. I really don't
understand why directors like Howard are allowed to make movies as bad
as this. No film should be as boring as this drivel.
