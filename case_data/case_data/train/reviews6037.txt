The Green Room may not be the best movie I've seen this year (although it also may be). It is the most entertaining and thrilling one by far though, that's for certain.

A punk band made up of poor friends tours in a broken van, playing
their songs at hole-in-the-wall places. They unknowingly are sent to
play a gig at a neo-nazi commune. It goes "OK" until they accidentally
enter a room where a girl has just been murdered, and are locked inside
by the neo-Nazis. A mostly-enclosed game of cat- and-mouse ensues
between the band members and the skinheads. I liked so many things about this film, I will probably forget to
mention half of them. The slow beginning which really lets you get a
feel for the characters, the progression into an enclosed-location
movie for a lot of its running time (I love one-location movies), the
"opening a can of worms" moment that just makes everything descend into
chaos, and the very funny one-liners which are fortunately very
infrequent so they don't hinder the serious mood one bit (quality over
quantity). It tried to circumvent some genre conventions and
expectations, while still staying true to itself, with thrill scene
after thrill scene. It was just flat out entertaining but also very
well-made, with unconventional editing between scenes, very interesting
sound design, and amazing acting by every cast member. They were all so
likable!I can't really complain about anything on display here, just see this
film, it deserves it.
