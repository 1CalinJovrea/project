A Movie To Be Remembered

This movie touch me. The story line is amazing and at the same time
lovely as u guys know already that basically that the plot of How To
Train Your Dragon 2 is about Hiccup reunited with his mother, Valka.
While Stoick The Vast will continue his love to Valka as he thought
Valka was dead. The voice actor for Valka, Cate Blanchett. Her voice is
just perfect for Valka character. The drama for this movie is really
touching as the family go up against the enemy,Drago BloodVist. The
graphics for this movie is incredibly stunning. For those people asking
whether to watch in 3D, My answer is yes it is definitely worth your
money. I think this movie is suitable for people in the world as it is
one of a kind movie. So just relax enjoy your sit and your popcorn and
enjoy watching the movie.
