Spider-Man's back

I loved the original spider-mans but I really do prefer Andrew Garfield
as the main man, he plays the character a lot better than Tobey
Maguire. First things first this film was great, plenty of action,
romance and drama. The CGI was fantastic and what they did to Jamie
Foxx's character Electro was amazing it was like he was a complete
different person! You learn a little more on peters parents and were
introduced to Harry Osbourne Aka Peters best friend (well in the
originals he was) this was a great marvel film made and I will always
watch the new spider man films until they stop making them because
they're brilliant.SPOILER ALERT! The only thing I was disappointed with in this film was
that Gwen Stacey dies *sobs* I heard that she was going to be killed
off but I wasn't sure that it would be in this movie. I did actually
cry a little because I loved her character and the chemistry between
her and Peter (The real life couple) was spot on. I really wished they
hadn't of killed her off because Emma stone played that character so
good now we have to see peter fall in love all over again with Mary
Jane (that's if they bring that character into the third movie) but all
in all this film was a 10/10
