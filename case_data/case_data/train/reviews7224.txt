Oblivion movie review- beautiful, stylish, fantastic

Granted Oblivion takes inspiration from countless sci-fi classics, 

granted that it lets a larger than life star consume it, granted it 

lets visual flair and elegance triumph mind bending probabilities, but 

there is no denying the fact that it is one hell of an entertainer, and 

probably THE sci-fi vehicle that Tom Cruise wanted all his life, 

Spielberg aside.



A long preamble sets the dystopian background- it is the year 2077, and 

the earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the 

moon, thus destabilizing the earth, causing earthquakes and tsunamis. 

Nuclear annihilation followed, and as the earth became inhabitable, the 

surviving humans moved to Titan, a moon of Saturn, while alien 

scavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the 

earth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by 

drones, which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a 

stylish, minimalistic floating facility in the clouds, with wiped out 

memories- Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea 

Riseborough), who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is 

this the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have 

haunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won 

the war?



"Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you 

never lived?"



Oblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I am 

legend, Independence Day, @Moon, Star Wars, Total Recall, The Matrix 

and of course, WALLÂ•E to create a striking, visually resplendent 

feature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi (film), Claudio Miranda 

creates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and 

visual effects- an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked 

with craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it, and lush, 

unspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective, not 

overpowering, and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt 

with. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters, a 

dreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence, taking direct 

inspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As 

revelations unravel, he gets into superstar mode with minimal 

fussiness- cool vehicles, check. Weapons, check. Beautiful babes, 

check. Mission to save the world, check. Risenborough is superb as the 

icy cool, rule following partner, Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an 

essentially damsel in distress role, while Morgan Freeman is his usual 

solid self in a cameo. 



Director Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the 

proceedings, and like his previous effort Tron Legacy, gives a solid 

bonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum 

up, Oblivion may not be terribly original, but it is stylish, well 

written and got performances to boot- especially Cruise who is in red 

hot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve, but in the immortal words of 

Roxette- it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and 

enjoy a summer spectacle.
