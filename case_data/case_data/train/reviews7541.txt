Not the worst but seriously unsurprising

"Would You Rather," is a decent, low budget. thriller about desperate
people put in horrible situations for the entertainment of a wealthy
sadist. Brittany Snow is a decent actress, but this definitely wasn't her best
effort. The movie plot was OK, and I did appreciate that they didn't
just go with the usual copy "Saw" plot that most of these movies use.
That being said, the things that happen in this movie are just a bit
lacking in creativity. The script was pretty lame, and there was
generally a lot more needed to build some suspense and really make it
memorable on any real level. Ex pornstar Sasha Grey is in this movie.
She looks beautiful, but again the script was just way too lean to see
if she could really act (I give her a pass on the bad reviews of "The
Girlfriend Experience" because it was a Soderbergh movie, and I hate
his movies anyway). All in all, I give it all a 5. To me Brittany Snow and Jeffrey Combs
are good enough actor that could have made it decent with a good
script, and a bit better writing. The twist at the end was pretty
standard and not surprising at all. It's decent if you have nothing
else to watch.
