This is as close as you can to history without being there.

My mother was born in a sod house on the prairie of North Dakota and my
grandmother was the town mid-wife and abortionist. Homesteading was
hard and demanding and Tommy Lee Jones has captured the the gut-level
struggle that came with 160 acres and the nearest neighbor five or ten
miles away. It drove those without an iron will to insanity. If you are
looking for a shoot-um-up western, this is NOT it, but if you love the
history of the frontier, and want to get a feel for its tragedy and day
to day fight for survival, this is a great movie. Beautifully filmed,
expertly acted, wonderfully scripted, I could not have asked for more.
I have never liked Hillary Swank, but this was an incredible
performance. Tommy Lee Jones was his beautifully curmudgeoned self. I
especially liked the accurate use of period firearms and I will not
quibble over the availability of 1851 36 caliber paper cartridges in
end of the earth Nebraska Territory nor Ms Swank having a wardrobe of
new dresses through out the film. The film accurately captured the
ethos of the western prairie and gave me a look and a feel into my own
grandparents. Thank you Tommy Lee Jones for a classic.
