Amazing!!!! Excellent!!!

I unfortunately first read some of the reviews before I watch The
Captive. I will never do that again. After watching this film the only
thing I am wondering is what the critics are drinking and what
profession they should switch to. Look at the director and it will make
sense on how prejudice critics actually are.This movie made me sit on the edge of my seat the entire time like no
other has got the longest time. Just wow and an the writing was
perfect. Good job.to everyone thanks for entertaining for 2 hours.
Being a patent it hit me hard and even if your not a parent you'll love
this one.
