An exciting adaptation true to the story

Ender's Game is not a perfect film. It rushes through certain important
points, and leaves out other parts altogether, instead what you get is
a flawed but enjoyable movie that ultimately succeeds, because it
always keeps its goal in sight.Certain things about this movie such as the justification for child
soldiers, Ansible Technology, and the Genius of the main group of Kids
will be best understood by the book readers.The film has wonderful visuals with exciting CGI to showcase the
important Battle Room.The Acting by Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield is one of the strengths
this project has. They maintain a tense and believable relationship
that is very much like the original story.Ultimately the climax of this movie and its main message is what sets
it apart from many other Sci-Fi films. The emotion is very much there,
and anyone willing to give this film a try will not be disappointed.
