A Complete Fraud of a Movie

Everything you read about this one is a lie. It's not a masterpiece, 

will not "open your eyes". What we have is a man-on-man love story 

about a boy called Little who suspects he's "different" and is told so 

(in no easy terms) by his classmates. When he slams one of these guys 

in the head with a chair his life of crime begins, as he evolves into a 

successful but lonely drug dealer (Sweet!). When he reconnects with the 

guy who seduced him it becomes a happily-ever-after affair. As a Street 

Drama the movie is lame. The makers of this film, and the reviewers, 

are spineless deceivers. If they had the courage of their convictions 

they'd be up-front concerning what the movie is about.
