Now THAT'S how you make a Thor film!!

Out of the MCU films, I felt that the first two Thor films were among
the weaker installments. They took them a little too seriously and they
were a tad grandiose, full of Shakespearean overtones.This film goes in a whole new direction though. The humour throughout
is pitch perfect and there is much-needed levity over the course of the
motion picture. The lack of Natalie Portman and her scientist friends
is a massive bonus and allows the story to flow rather than being
bogged down with Thor's forced fish-out-of-water/romance story from the
previous two films.Cate Blanchett comes to the forefront as Hela, the villain of the
piece, hell bent on conquering Asgard. Blanchett is having the time of
her life portraying the malevolent Goddess of Death. Thor and Loki must
put aside their differences and try to stop her. Hemsworth and
Hiddleston are on top form as ever and the added humour makes their
dynamic more enjoyable.They end up getting sidetracked and captured by Jeff Goldblum, playing
the Grandmaster (but really it's Goldblum playing himself) who forces
Thor into fighting Hulk/Banner in a Colosseum-like arena. Thor gains
the trust of Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and from there, it's your
classic good fights evil scenario.Taika Waititi pulls out all the stops here, as director, adding a lot
of charm and fun to the film. The set design and overall aesthetic is
also great as well, a real '80s neon feel. And the music...the music
was brilliant! Who would've thought that the composer for Rugrats would
deliver such an awesome soundtrack!I left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Great return to form for
the God of Thunder!!!
