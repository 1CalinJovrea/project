Amazing action film! Stallone and Arnold delivers!

I watched Escape Plan yesterday in a preview screening and let me tell
you: this movie rocks!The first co-leading partnership between Stallone/Schwarzenegger is a
great flick.Very good story, a very good villain, good action scenes and a perfect
chemistry between the two action stars!The supporting cast, in special Jim Caviezel, is one of the many
highlights of this movie.For action fans and people who want to forget their lives for a couple
of hours and have a film fun, I highly recommend it!Salute!
