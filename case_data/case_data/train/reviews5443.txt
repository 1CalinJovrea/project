This was so bad

Words fail both me and my girlfriend in describing this awful piece of
digested food. This movie is bad even by kid standards and, frankly, I
don't think they could've managed to ruin the Minions any better. Half
the dialog in this movie is in Minionese, of which nothing can be
understood. The jokes are so bad, all they managed was get a single
l.o.l. out of us. Nope, not a laugh, a l.o.l. The "villainesse" is
boring, overdone and, frankly, unforgettable for how bad she is. Even
the Minions are boring (how they accomplished that is beyond me). To
say nothing of the way they portrayed the Queen of England and England
itself. I'm Romanian and it still made me angry! If you want to watch
this, just don't. Spare yourself the time, boredom and probably money
and SEE SOMETHING ELSE.
