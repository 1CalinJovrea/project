Good battle!

The directing duo team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris played a
nice game of doubles in helming the true-based story "Battle of the
Sexes" into cinematic screens. The film is based on the infamous tennis
match in the early 70's between sweetheart female lib tennis great
Billie Jean King and the male chauvinistic retired Hall-of-Famer Bobby
Riggs. But the movie is much more than that, it also stages themes of
gender equal rights, estranged marriages, sports management, and scores
as a LOVE letter to the early 70's. Emma Stone serves up another ace
performance, here as King. Steve Carell was a bit outlandish, but still
returned serve with a sound performance. The film also had an advantage
of very good supporting performances from Elisabeth Shue as Riggs'
wife, Sarah Silverman as King's manager, and Andrea Riseborough as
King's lesbian lover. "Battle of the Sexes" matches up quite right, and
was not "rigged". Give it a try! **** Good
