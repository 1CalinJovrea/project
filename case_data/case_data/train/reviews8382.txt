Very disappointing

I have to start by saying the first film was my favourite film of the
last few years and I'm a huge fan.But let's be honest, this was a huuuge let down of a sequel after an
amazing first film. The first had a good story, fleshed out characters,
believable villains, genuine affection, drama, tension and a soundtrack
that was original and used brilliantly.This film had a weak, bloated story. Almost every scene filled with
forced, cheap gags. Unbelievable and disappointing bad guys who tried
to wise crack their through and lost any menace. Acting was poor apart
from Yondu and Nebula who was woefully underused.This was was like a comedy parody of the first film. A goofy, TV sequel
that had none of the magic of the original blockbuster.At one point Drax wisecracks that he does big turds. I'd venture none
as big as this one.Avoid
