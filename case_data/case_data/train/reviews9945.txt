A Refreshing Break From CGI Overload

My wife and I saw The Age of Adaline on our 32nd anniversary. We both
enjoyed and appreciated the acting talents of Blake Lively, Michiel
Huisman and Harrison Ford. The love story still lives on and this movie
underscored the fulfillment of a life worth living and the thrill of
rekindling love, a powerful human desire.I kept looking at that "familiar" face, Adaline's daughter, who turned
out to be Ellen Burstyn. Who woulda thunk it after all these years,
still having images of youthful beauty develop into aging gracefully?
And, still acting.The ending was grand. All's well that ends well and it reminds us of
that old clich√©, "Hope springs eternal."
