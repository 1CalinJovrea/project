Could be worse, but it would be a total disaster

The movie is nothing more than an horrific experiment: is the audiences
taste is nonexistent? Are they so simple that they'll like a shallow
story and same 'ol jokes for dummies?Horrible Bosses 2 is not dumb, it's dumber. The humor is immature (I
guess, that's a standard for nowadays so-called-comedies), plot is flat
as an hand-egg field, but the worst part is the yelling and the
"idiocracy" of the main characters. They yell almost all the time,
talking all at once, screaming words and dancing their erratic dance of
"having nothing better to do with themselves cause of that nonexistent
quality of the script"*. So they yell, scream and... And they are
dumber then Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne from "Dumb and Dumber". But
Lloyd and Dunne are likable - they are just two heavy cases of idiocy,
of being dumb - two dumb chumps, funny and sweet in their dumbness,
with some characteristics, a soul - one could say. What about Nick,
Dale and Kurt? Nothing. They are soulless and mindless, without the
spark of life - characters that you'll forget in no time cause they're
like thousands more produced by so many. And I guess it's not entirely
actors fault, no. It's the script, the director and so on. This movie
is almost as bad as Jack and Jill, but less entertaining for sure.*that's the name of the ancient Indian dance
