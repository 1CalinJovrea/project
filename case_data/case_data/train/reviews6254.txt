Loved This Movie and Did Not Want It To End

This movie is super fantastic! I totally loved it and did not want it
to end. All the actors are amazingly convincing and talented. Both
little Mckenna Grace (who plays Mary) and Chris Evans (who plays Frank)
are absolutely perfect for their roles. Mckenna Grace is extremely
talented for someone her age. I LOVE their natural chemistry in this
movie. This movie held my attention and warmed my heart! This is not a
shoot-em-up, action-packed movie, there's no nudity. It is a
wonderfully warm and fuzzy family movie. Excellent acting and editing.
I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.
