A Sprawling Stoner Epic

Those who don't get it, will never get. Those who do get it, will have
a ball. Inherent Vice is the most psychedelic film since Robert Downey
Sr.'s "Putney Swope". It doesn't make sense.... It's really not
supposed to make sense. It's delightfully confusing and eclectically
bewildered in the fumes of it's own bong water. This isn't the same
P.T.A. you knew from "Boogie Nights" and "There Will Be Blood". Here,
he slams down on our heads a Thomas Pynchon book, and laughs at us for
not getting it. It's a delicious assault on filmmaking. It's also a
genius, loving tribute to the end of the Hippie revolution of America
in the early 1970's. It may never win an Oscar, but it ought to be
tried for the Palme D'or at Cannes. Uncompromisingly, I loved it.
