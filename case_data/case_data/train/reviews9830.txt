Very funny!

I really enjoyed Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work with Borat. I came
in to The Dictator with relatively high hopes for some good laughs.
I'll say that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Cohen gets some
great laughs on politically incorrect humour in to this film, and it's
well done. In the first 10 minutes of the film, I was laughing my head
off with the consistency of the humour, but I can see why in the later
half this can not be abundant. However, sometimes this film falls flat,
with a lot of humour being delayed in the last half of the movie.
Sometimes it (but very rarely) feels like it is not Cohen. However
these jokes are still a bundle of laughs for the right people. Overall
it's a great film if you're familiar with Cohen's other work.
