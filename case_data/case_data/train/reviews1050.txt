Stunning picture  with a glamorous feel and great story on Romance.

Overall,it's a pretty good movie.I just love the style of the picture. Generally that World War 2 era
has that glamorous style to it, and leave it to Robert Zemeckis to add
that extra kick.Although I've Seen better costumes but this maybe because Canada did
not have the best uniforms out of the WWII crowd.And that made this movie strangely interesting. The 1st movie I ever
seen about Canada's involvement in the War. Maybe I have seen others
but it's so rare that it makes this movie seem unique that the story is
about a Canadian wing commander who falls in love and builds a life
with a woman who may not be all that she claims.Speaking of which, The best part of the movie is that drama. Though I
love the art direction as it puts me in That WWII setting, the visual
effects do a good job of placing you right there, but the drama coming
from Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's connection on camera. It's this
connection that's the most important and makes the movie what it is,
and the emotion baggage is well worth it.So not much of a war epic or an espionage movie as I went to see if for
but it's a great love story set perfectly and beautifully in a
different time and place worthy of checking out.
