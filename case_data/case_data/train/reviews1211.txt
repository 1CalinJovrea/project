Love the original and love the the remake

This is a rare beast a remake that is actually pretty good. Although it
it isn't as good as the original, lacking the slow burn nature of it,
it's still a well made and entertaining film. It's pretty similar to the original but the shorter running time means
it's faster paced which does diminish it's substance. What makes this worth watching even for those who have seen the
original is the acting. It boasts a top rate cast with Chiwetel Ejiofor
and Julia Roberts particularly good. For those who have seen the original this will hold no surprises but
for those who haven't seen it, it is well worth watching with a great
ending.
