Might have been good.  Photography is good - sound is PTUI

Terrible sound track. Either the sound engineer was asleep at the
switch, the Director didn't listen to the dailies, or the actors never
learned how to enunciate or modulate their voices. As a result, this is
a total snorer which makes you want to slap the characters silly until
they learn to speak clearly.
