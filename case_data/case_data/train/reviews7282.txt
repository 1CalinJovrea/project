Really thankssss.............

A mixer of war, drama and pure adventure. The movie is a ballance
equillibrium of all these aspects. The movie starts with the early war
actions of military personnel in iraq. But they return after war and
haunted by those memories.Those memories shattering their personal
life, their dreams and emotions, their surroundings...This movie is a different genre movie..not a typical fast action or
mysterious thriller movies...not an excellent dreamy sci-fi
movie...rather it is a movie of true passion of life..A movie
containing real life drama..real heart and mind...real flesh and
blood..slow but steady..Acting is superb.Most of the movie is full of nostalgic scenes of
battlefield.They are true colour of life. Most members have acted well
enough to visualize the full drama.Critics may have many opinions of their own. I don't know what they
will say about the film. But i have enjoyed the movie very much.Now
it's your turn.
