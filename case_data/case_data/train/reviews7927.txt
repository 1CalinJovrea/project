Up in the list of most terrible films I've ever seen.

This film is truly terrible. Firstly, let's talk about the script. There is not one ounce of wit or
intelligence in the humour here. It's actually so stupid that it
constantly borders on racist, even for somebody with a less PC centre.
The jokes feel like they're from the '90s, before deliberate political
incorrectness was swapped for subtlety and charm. It's like watching a
film being released 20 years after it was made. This film is NOT funny.
Maybe if you're below the age of 12 or you've never watched a good
comedy you'll find it amusing. There are three nipple jokes, poo jokes
and a hoard of cheap modern jokes that don't fit in with the
time-period, completely bringing you out of the story every time
they're spoken. As could be expected from an Adam Sandler film, the acting is dreadful.
There's no attempt from the actors to provide something more than what
the script reads, and everyone plays the blandest characters they
possibly could. I don't think this movie warrants much more than that. If you have any
taste. Don't watch it.
