A medical student with financial problems finds her way into the "field" of body modification.

American Mary is a strange story of revenge and finding one's niche in
the world. It's easy to dismiss as a hack/slash piece of pulp, but I
have to admit I enjoyed the film for its weird elements. It provides
antagonists who are easy to hate and a protagonist who has a
questionable lifestyle, yet is still very likable, due in no small part
to actress, Katharine Isabella. She's smart, funny, and does a nice job
handling a really bizarre story line. BE WARNED, this story is NOT for
everyone. It has some very disturbing elements and is highly graphic in
nature. That being said, the movie combines drama, dark comedy, and
gore in a way I, as a viewer, found interesting. This is not a horror
movie. Viewers going into the film with that notion will be
disappointed. Again, this is a weird and graphic film and not for those
who are easily (or even not so easily) disturbed. It has a questionable
message and is weird in ways one may have never considered. It thought
is was inventive and strange and I enjoyed the unexpected trip.
