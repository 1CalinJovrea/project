Pure Hollywood Garbage.

This remake of the 60's classic is enough to make any serious movie fan
vomit in his cowboy boots. It fails on every possible level,
bastardizing every cliché in the business just to generate business.
Unlike the fabulous score of the original, even the music sucks
(evidently an unimaginative regurgitation of bits and pieces of
everything James Horner had ever heard), none of the actors could
actually ACT, and the storyline was a total desecration of the
original lacking the story, heart, and soul of perhaps the single
greatest Western action/adventure film in history. The only reason I'm
giving this turkey a "1" however, is the a accurate use of character
types in the movie, wisely choosing to use talent that actually looked
the part... dirty. But I'd rather take the Hollywood movie stars of the
past over the bored, uninvolved actors riding roughshod through this
cinematic misadventure, especially the brain dead producers who
actually believe that mindless revenge and violence will ever make up
for a decent script, turning good filmmaking solely into a creation for
corporate profit.
