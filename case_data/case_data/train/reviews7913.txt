Extremely annoying characters

I usually don't write comments about movies since there is a lot
already. But this one made me so angry even after only 20 minutes
watching it. And I NE VER not finish a movie, but I could'nt go on with
this one. The characters (especially Charlie Day (Dale)) are so
annoying, it made me furious and I never finished the movie. I know
mentally challenged people that would'nt act this stupid in these
situations. Shouting for no reason, talking over each others and doing
stupid jokes. (ex: when dale starts screaming Rex's name in the house
for no reason). Seriously, this is when I stopped it. I enjoy a stupid comedy, but this is going too far and I can't even say
that I had even a smile once in the movie.Poor bateman who has a good strong character that has to put up with
this stupid stuff.
