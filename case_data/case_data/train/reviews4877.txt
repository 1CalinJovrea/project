A potentially-great movie that ultimately lets you down.

What can I say about this odd movie, other than that I was absolutely
captivated for the first hour or so. Visually stunning, images that
will live in the memory for some time, great editing, superb camera
work, stunning scenery and background, and a plot that captivates and
keeps you guessing.But what a letdown the ending was! It was like the director chickened
out, and went for the boy-gets-girl, American apple pie conclusion,
instead of creating a Gothic masterpiece. I would have sooner left some
of the plot threads unresolved than to have inflicted on me such a
silly and B-grade alternative, that ultimately left a bad taste in my
mouth. If that sounds harsh, it is only because the rest of the movie
was so mind-blowingly stunning, at least an 8 or 9.One reviewer called anyone who didn't like this movie a moron. We can
do without patronising opinions like that. I'm not a moron, just
disappointed. Go and see the movie? Yes. The visual elements are worth
it. Will you experience the catharsis of a great movie experience
afterwards? I doubt it.
