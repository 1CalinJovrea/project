Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse

If you are a fan of comedy horrors then I'm pretty sure you will like
this film, although it is very entertaining it is certainly nothing we
haven't seen before. The film follows three scouts (Ben,Carter & Augie). Ben & Carter are
embarrassed to still be scouts but still do it for their friend Augie.
Ben & Carter have had enough one night and decide to leave Augie alone
in the woods as they head out to a party, unaware that an apocalypse
has just broken out which is why their camp leader has not arrived. The 3 lead characters are all likable in their own way and I really
wanted their friendship to work. The film has some funny moments in the
first half hour or so but it's once the apocalypse starts when the fun
really gets going. Ben & Carter have teamed up with Denise (a really
cool character, takes no prisoners and eye candy) but they are stuck in
a prison cell surrounded by zombies until Augie comes to rescue them
and the adventure really begins at this point. There is tons of zombies
and the way in which some are killed is hilarious. In particular I
found the trampoline scene to be one of the best. Carter was the
character who made me laugh the most, with a memorable zombie boob
scene and also a great one liner when they run over the deer "hood
f*#*~d Bambi". The film also has a good soundtrack which makes certain moments even
more hilarious. The cleaner guy at the beginning deserves a special
mention for setting the mood with a barrel of laughs straight away.Overall a very fun film which I would highly recommend. This one came
out of the blue for me and as it stands right now it has a good chance
to make my top ten for the year. If you enjoyed this film then I also
recommend Shaun of the Dead (2004) & Cockneys vs Zombies (2012).
