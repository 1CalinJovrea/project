Visually amazing, otherwise disappointing.

Decided to go see after reading so many user reviews of 8, 9 and 10.
Absolutely love movies in this genre as well other movies that Del Toro
has directed (e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, the Devils Backbone, Hellboy) I was
expecting to be blown away - and yet, at one point during movie husband
and I contemplated leaving. I don't understand how so much money can be
spent and effort not made to create coherent script with believable
characters. I can accept campiness if its done well - but the two
scientists for example were just ridiculous.The amazing visual effects were what kept us in the theater - but just
barley. Could clearly see Del Toro's mastery in the creation of the
aliens and Jaegers.
