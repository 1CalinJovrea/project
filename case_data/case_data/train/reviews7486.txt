People are really stupid. Great movie for it's category

Reading some of these reviews and I find myself looking for a pair of
pliers to help some of these people remove the stick out of their ass.
To note, I only made an account for this review because I was afraid
some people may get the wrong idea about this movie. No, it will not
win an Oscar, no it will not have an Oscar winning actor. Was Chevy
Chase, Chris Farley, Eddie Murray, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Bill
Murray, Mike Myers, Will ferrel did a any of them win an Oscar? No,
however were their movies not one of the funniest of their time?
Exactly. Seth and James will not win an Oscar because the committee
doesn't rate comical aspects. However this movie is hilarious. Without
being one of the "typical" comedy type movies that have come out
recently. It's different comical aspects then what has been common in
movie cinema in the past year. Obviously it's a comedy, and in the
category of comedy movies it will rank as one of the higher ones. When
you watch this movie you expect that. It's not a Beautiful Mind or
Titanic. It's a comedy, and a damn funny one at that. When you watch a
comedy you want to laugh, and this movie will make you laugh. End of
story. Please don't listen to those who critique this movie as if it is
a nominees for a best movie award.
