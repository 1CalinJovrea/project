Another excellent work from Allen, with a magnificent performance by Cate Blanchett

Just saw Woody Allen's latest film today in theaters and after all
these years, he still hasn't lost his touch. Cate Blanchett completely
steals the show here, being the most interesting character by far. What
a powerful and emotional performance (the best I've seen from her)!
There are several hilarious moments involving her, but you will also
feel the state of depression she's in, even damaging her mental health.
In addition, I really enjoyed the way Woody tells the story, always
going back and forth in time. The ending was truly devastating and as
usual, the dialogues are some of the highlights in this film. Blue
Jasmine is definitely much better than Woody's previous work, To Rome
with Love, which I thought it was pretty weak overall. I'm glad to see
this great director back in top form, with another remarkable film
again.
