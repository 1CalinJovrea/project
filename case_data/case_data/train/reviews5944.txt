"Poor Man's" version of the cult classic "Before Sunrise"

If you haven't seen this movie yet and you are interested in seeing it
and would like to know the opinion first of people who have seen it
before you actually watch it yourself, I'll make it simple for you.
Imagine a movie with a storyline that's similar to "Before Sunrise".
Then -- assuming you are a big fan of the "Before..." trilogy like me
-- imagine how "Before Sunrise" would be if it was directed by a first
timer like Chris Evans instead of the multi-awarded Richard Linklater.
Then imagine again if the main characters were portrayed by another
pair of young veteran Hollywood actors instead of Ethan Hawke and Julie
Delphy. Now lastly imagine all of those elements put together in a
movie that's similar to "Before Sunrise" BUT with VERY LITTLE of the
chemistry that Hawke and Delphy produced on screen. One thing that was amazing about those Linklater movies was the
undeniable on-screen CHEMISTRY of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy. And
chemistry is something that can't be taught; it just comes out
naturally. I'm sure that Evans & Eve tried their best but sadly they
weren't able to produce that on-screen chemistry that is essential in
every romance film. I think the biggest mistake Evans made in his directorial debut was
doing a movie similar to "Before Sunrise" because in the end, viewers
were left with no choice but to compare his directing to Linklater &
his acting to Hawke. And he pales in comparison to both---if he is to
be judged based on this movie alone.Although Evans still has a long way to go as a director (and actor,
too), I'd give him a passing rate for "Before We Go".
