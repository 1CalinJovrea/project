Decent good budget sci-fi effort

This movie has decent acting for the most part, very good effects and
CG, a good score and a reasonable story - you get involved, care
sufficiently about the characters and so forth. Its not earth-
shatteringly original, but I didn't feel short-changed at any point.
There is a lot of attention to detail, nice shots, some really nice
sci-fi ideas (Love the perpetually revolving prison cells, for
example...). Some bits are a little annoying, like the daughters diary
voice-overs, a bit Terminator rip-off, but the whole thing works well,
looks good and feels suitably polished to warrant your time. Its not
going to break any new genre ground, and the gobby title will put off
some, but this could easily be a decent pre-marvel cinema release, and
I enjoyed it a lot. Some other reviews here look like shills, but it
really is head-nodding-at-the-end decent.
