Great film - deserves to be a big hit

I really enjoyed this film.There is real chemistry between Bill Nighy and Daniel Mays. Nighy is
electrifying as ever. Most of the supporting cast are great. It has a
gloomy atmosphere and the music hall setting works well (albeit a music
hall with lots of music and absolutely zero musicians!).Its not overly gory - this is a good thing as its the plot and
character interplay that is strong here.The ye olde London Town setting is well done.The story moves along as quite a pace with red herrings and twists
galore.We guessed whodunit 2/3 of the way through - but it was an entertaining
ride nonetheless.This film is a cut above much of the generic and formulaic Hollywood
fare we are fed these days.Go see it quickly while its still in cinemas - its not nearly as big a
hit as it deserves to be.
