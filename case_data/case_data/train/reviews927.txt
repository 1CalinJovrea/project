Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year

There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To
start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy
and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea
enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding
performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher
Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies
also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer
Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the
iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of
a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any
other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be
stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there
like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music
film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the
intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem
slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss. I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy
but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense.
The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this
one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this
same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm
talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in
some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't
read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed
similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying
you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as
I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy.
