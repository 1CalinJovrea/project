Some jokes, zero plot

To make it simple, Grown-Ups 2 felt like the first, if you enjoyed the
first one you will probably enjoy this. I would consider it a mediocre
movie if it had of been released in the 90's, but Sandler's movies are
becoming extremely repetitive, and I think people are beginning to get
fed up with Adam Sandler if they weren't already, I think it is time he
gives it a rest. Grown-Ups 2 has some jokes that made me crack a smile,
or chuckle, but has absolutely no plot, it's like watching a mash-up of
jokes play out in front of you, rather then watching a movie thats
funny. Not worth watching in theatres, rent or watch it online.
Hopefully this will be Sandler's last movie for a while, and this is
coming from a person who enjoys some of his movies.
