Loud, Dumb and Overlong

Now, this seemed like the perfect summer blockbuster. Two huge stars,
an expensive budget and a director with a knack for action. What could
go wrong? By the end of it, instead of what could go wrong, you'll be
asking yourself what went right. The answer....barely anything. White
House Down is not only dumb, it is downright idiotic. The plot is
preposterous, the action sequences sub par and the acting is atrocious.
Channing Tatum does his best Bruce Willis impression while Jamie Foxx
turns in the worst performance of his career. The supporting cast lead
by Maggie Gyllenhaal saves the terrible leads and are the sole reason I
am not giving this a 1. Overall, this film is loud, long and boring, so
much so, I can't imagine any adult with a functioning brain to enjoy
this. I highly recommend to stay away from this stinker. If you want a
great action film featuring the destruction of the White House, tune
into Olympus Has Fallen.
