Destinations are overrated

Everything magical happens in Italy, if you're American. OK, I was a
little mean, the movie was actually pretty excellent. It's just this
new clich√© that if you want to become a vampire or meet some strange
creatures you have to come from America to Europe, preferably Italy. I
live in Italy and, except getting my soul sucked out of me at work, no
vampires yet! Some zombies, though, especially in the morning.Anyway, the film is a combination of sci-fi, romance and melancholy,
and a successful one at that. Usually when people mix things up the
result is either something too artsy or deep for its own good or a
jumbled mess. Spring manages to balance everything: you have beautiful
characters you can sympathize with, a story that allows you to explore
the beauty of nature and sunsets in Italy and crap like that as well as
the feelings and experiences of the characters, some strange stuff to
give it a little spice.No need to describe the plot to you. As one of the characters says in
the end "destinations are overrated" and I think it was a line
expressing the desire of the writer to make a story that you can enjoy
without it having to reach some climax. Personally I thought the ending
was kind of cheap, the only thing worse being the scenes with the
stupid American guy. But, hey, love conquers all, right? No need to
think of what the other person gives up for you. Heh.Bottom line: a very visually pleasing film, well directed and shot,
well acted, with an original story. It is kind of long, though, at
almost two hours, giving it a kind of slow pace. Also, if you do not
appreciate the small things in it, the ending is not going to make you
like the film any more than the middle.
