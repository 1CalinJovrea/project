Even more shallow than the first.

The plot barely exists for this film. Generic evil people try to take
over universe, Thor stops them, the end. Which might have been alright
but there was very little action in this mindless action film. What
little fighting we got was poorly orchestrated and repetitive.The dialogue is wooden and adds nothing. The characters with the
exception of Loki have no depth and only exist as an assortment of
clich√©s. Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the
only good or interesting thing in the entire film.Thor continues to be the worst Marvel movie franchise and Hemsworth is
possibly the worst actor to ever star in multiple major movies.
