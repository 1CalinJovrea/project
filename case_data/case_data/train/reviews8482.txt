A Resonant Sequel To A Classic

After 21 years of waiting, the sequel to 'Trainspotting' has finally
become a reality, and what a fantastic ride it is. Sure it lacks the
flare that made the original the classic it is, but with new ideas and
a worthy plot that wraps up the original's ending, 'T2 Trainspotting'
finds inventive ways to allow us to love the characters we grew up
with.Returning to Edinburgh after 20 years in Amsterdam, Renton tries to
re-connect with his former crew (Spud, Simon and Begbie) despite
leaving them robbed at the conclusion of the first film. With a mix of
black comedy and emotionally resonant drama, we are launched back into
each of the individual's lives as their past comes back to haunt them.
With beautiful cinematography, a fantastic soundtrack that once
famously featured Lou Reed's 'Perfect Day' and Iggy Pop's 'Lust for
Life' and a rather intense conclusion that leaves us on the edge of our
seats, a very worthy sequel.
