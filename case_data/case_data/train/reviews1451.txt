Public Service Review

All of the viewer reviews I read about this movie were glowingly
positive. And with an outstanding 7.9 rating, how could I go wrong
going to see it? Woody Allen used to make good, clever funny movies.
Big mistake.I'm here to tell you this is an awful movie. The characters are boring,
irritating, annoying stupid creatures about whom I could care less.
Even the ones that started with some credibility, lost it. The actors
all did a decent job of playing the rolls they were given, but the
script was uninspiring and the story just lame and pointless. One of
the other reviewers mentioned how when the movie ended the audience sat
in stunned silence. I took it to mean from awe or reverence. Now I know
it's because the movie has no ending. If the projector broke with
thirty minutes left to go in the movie, people would be howling with
anger and demanding their money back, but if the writer/director leaves
out the last 20 or 30 minutes of the story and then tacks on the
credits, everyone thinks this is cool and clever and innovative. I feel like a guy standing in the crowd watching the emperor strut down
the street stark naked and all around me the people are oohing and
aahing over his beautiful royal garments. What garments? The guy is
jiggling, hairy, stark naked, for crying out loud! This is not a
wonderful movie. It was a potentially interesting story that got lost
somewhere along the way. Don't get sucked in by the hype.
