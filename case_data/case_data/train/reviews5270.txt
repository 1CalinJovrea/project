The desolation of the Hobbit

After a disappointing AUJ I really wanted to like this film.
Unfortunately I've now lost complete faith in PJ's magic. There are so many flaws in this film I don't even know where to start.
From characters that are invincible (fighting barehanded giant spiders
or Orcs !) which removes all tension from the film to utterly
incomprehensible and unconvincing scenes (creation of giant dwarf gold
statue in 5 minutes while a fire breathing dragon is on a rampage) this
movie is just awful. Dialogues seem to be written by a 10 year old and
the behavior of the protagonist contradicts what is expected from them
(Why does the king of dwarfs threatens Bilbo despite their bond in AUJ?
Why do the dwarfs leave one of theirs sleeping in the village? Why do
the dwarfs leave so quickly the mountain once they realize that they
can't find the keyhole?). The village scenes add no value to the story
(fillers) and the love triangle is forced and unconvincing. Worst, Smaug which seemed to be an eloquent and highly intelligent
character in the first five minutes of dialog with Bilbo is then
transformed into a stupid creature who can't find slow-paced and pudgy
dwarfs in his lair. What a waste of material - Smaug could have been
one of the best villains coming out of Hollywood. Now it's just a dumb
dragon which likes to talk like a posh Englishman. The 3D doesn't add any value to the film (contrary to Gravity) and the
CGI was poor (why make a horse in CGI?). LOTR was more convincing. In
the end neither my wife or I cared for any of the characters (existing
or new). This film was an insult to our intelligence. We deserved much
better.I've put 2 stars. One for the first five minutes of dialog with Smaug
(only real moment of the film with some tension) and one for the fine
acting of Gandalf and Bilbo as usual.
