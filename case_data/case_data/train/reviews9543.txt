An Exceptionally Poor Try

I was at first a bit hesitant to watch this movie, because the
description made it seem like torture porn. Only after seeing many
reviews that did not paint it as such, I decided to give it a try. In
retrospect, I wish someone would have called it torture porn to keep me
from watching it.Getting that out of the way, I am not labeling this movie as torture
porn, but it is the furthest thing from it. I have to commend the
filmmakers for taking a concept that screamed of a torture porn plot
but avoided making it such. The writers and directors tried to make
this film less about the body modifications as it was about the change
in personality of the lead character. However, they did such a poor job
doing this that they should have just made an idiotic torture porn
movie. "American Mary" is basically a film about a poor med student who begins
to take body modification jobs to keep her bills paid. At first she is
reluctant to do so, but this changes over time. When one of her former
professors drugs her and rapes her, she quits med school and after
beginning a long revenge scenario with him, she becomes a very distant
shell of what she previously was. The nice girl trying to get through
school becomes emotionally blank and immorally bankrupt.This movie fails because its plot is way too unlikely. Mary's change
happens too quickly and it seems to come about as the means for a plot
device and not her character. By the time you get half way through the
movie, any sympathy for Mary is gone. She has no morals and no
redeeming factors. This is a dreary and boring and terrible film I suggest you skip over.
