I will not blame anyone who has given up hope with this franchise and
passed on checking out this. I went because I am Sheilene Woodley's
number one fan and supporter (check my reviews of her films for proof
on that), so anything she does I will see, included this franchise
which for me, in the first two entries, proved to be a mix of some few
good elements, Woodley's performance being center on that, with some
bad filmaking overall and a story that was always so bad it made me
laugh.That element is partially back, once again through the entirety of the
duration of the film almost nothing makes sense. The story is just so
bol*ocks I am inclined to laugh at it. Yet this time around I didn't
even manage to do that. It just makes no sense whatsoever, nothing that
is going on on screen is ever motivated, but even worse, it doesn't fit
with the other two films and just emerges as an absolute mess.Even Shailene Woodley who in the past managed to elevate the non sense
that was going around her, with the help of Theo James' charisma, can't
do anything with this material. She isn't bad in anyway, it would be
impossible for her, but no one on screen manages to make heads or toes
of their character, simply because their isn't anything to be
understood, it is just a screenplay that mixes random exposition to
ever changing motivations because the story requires it. Even the
cinematography, for the most part, is as dull as it can be: basic
coverage of dialogue scenes and where it tries to do something new like
some good tracking shots it fails miserably because they look terrible.What remains good is the imagery that the series has offered
throughout, don't misunderstand me: for the major part the CGI is
mediocre and touches bad in many points, but the art concepts and the
visual ideas still work very well and provide that minimum flare that
mixed to some laughing at the story and Miles Teller not giving a sh*t
for the third time, which I must admit is the best part of the film,
manages to get you through the film indifferently.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you are a true fan of the
series, the film in itself is boring and uninspired with yet another
laughable ending.
