sexual coming-of-age

It's 1976 San Francisco. Fifteen year old Minnie Goetze (Bel Powley) is
overjoyed at losing her virginity to her mother Charlotte (Kristen
Wiig)'s boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsg√•rd). They begin a secret
affair. Minnie and her friend Kimmie Minter get into various adult
situations. Her stepfather Pascal MacCorkill (Christopher Meloni) wants
to stay in her and her sister Gretel's lives. She records tapes of her
diary and draws inspired by cartoonist Aline Kominsky.This takes a less conventional look at the sexual coming-of-age story
from the female perspective. It is not flowers and puppies. It is
highly sexual in nature. It is unflinching. My main problem is that Bel
is a little too old to play the fifteen year old. I rather have a
younger actress do the role without the nudity. There is a shock with a
man having sex with a young girl that is missing in this movie. She
looks 20s. I'm reminded of Heather Matarazzo in 'Welcome to the
Dollhouse' and the shock of that sexual subject matter. This movie has
the same shocking subject.
