Dreadful

Why did the lovely Amanda Seyfried get involved in this crass stuff.
Never saw the first one but because it was so popular picked up this
DVD. About 10 minutes into the movie I had to ask myself...when do I
laugh. It just wasn't funny...in my opinion anyway. It just tried to
shock. And it didn't do that to me either. I lie. I did chuckle at
least twice. Amanda, please find another agent. I mean, the whole idea
of a talking Teddy is nonsense so why involve serious issues like
acknowledging minorities etc. And how obvious was that Morgan Freeman
cameo. I doubt he was ever within 1000 miles of the furry hero when his
scene was shot.
