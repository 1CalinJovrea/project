Sprinkling Happiness at a Theater Near You!

Trolls is one of those animated features you may think you've seen
already, and don't want to see again...but, hold on; it's funny. If you
can hark back to your own childhood, you'll remember this, and want to
find a piece of it again. Releasing it at the start of the holiday season is a smart box office
move, but if families actually take their children, a good time will be
had by all. I promise you'll be happily humming this soundtrack for
days before you break down and buy it because, well, you liked the
songs, too. They won't drive you nuts like some purple dinosaur music
you may recall with disdain, and you may find them creeping up on your
own "most played" list.The story is good, with relatable characters and situations, and some
you'll be thankful can't happen in real life. Yes, there is bathroom
humor. Get over it. Kids love it. Children have so little actual power,
living vicariously through the antics of Branch (aptly voiced by Justin
Timberlake) is the least you can allow. His singing, along with Gwen
Stefani and the others make this musical journey a joy to behold, and
one you'll want to see on the big screen with the whole family.
