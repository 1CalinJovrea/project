Lost my time and self respect as a girl by watching it

Frankly, do you call this a movie or soft porn that promotes male
domination and humiliates women? Wasted my money and time by watching
this movie just because some of my friends wanted to watch it badly.
This movie just pollutes the minds of our younger generation.
Everything from dialogues, sex scenes and acting is poor. The music was
a bit good for which I gave one star. Honestly we women are not like
this. We also like to have good, clean and natural relationships in our
life. We don't always want to get wet and indulge in a submissive
relationship. Fifty shades of grey started it and now this title made
it worst further. Please come up with some good story-line. Thumbs
down. It only frustrated me and nothing else.
