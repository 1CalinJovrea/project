Needs Philosophical and Psychological discussion

There is a problem with psychological reality with this movie. The fact
that it is presented as entertainment for children is an extreme
negative. One of the most important thrusts of human evolution has been
to free humans from the former mental encumbrances of past centuries.
In this Movie the child is depicted as controlled by a number of
entities, the child is in fact insane but depicted as normal. I am
concerned as to the sanity of the person(s) who wrote this script. Such
a movie disserves the bonfire. I am amazed that our Psychologists are
not protesting the showing of this movie which demonstrates only the
origins of western psychology - the cocaine importer and addict Sigmund
Freud.
