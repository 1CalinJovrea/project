Horrible X-Men Movie period ...

I went in with an expectation of a "typical" X-Men movie, without
reading the reviews here ... Just saw the "Star" ratings. I don't know
who these people are give 10 stars, for sure either they had very a
very low expectations from this or are paid raters. My problem with
this movie is that you cannot take a total fictional Sci-Fi character
and put him in a real life situation, where he is a beat up limo
driver, fighting the Mexican thugs trying to steel his Limo's "Chrome
plated rims" ... from the start I lost interest in it, after that it
just drags, extra long scenes and not to mention that this movie
happened in future, where all the mutants are gone/hunted down, yet no
real advancements, people still shooting with 12 gauge shotguns
...There are No Mountain Range North Dakota bordering Canada .... Guys
if you wanna make a movie about reality ... it should have some reality
for a fictional Character ... It Just Sucked
