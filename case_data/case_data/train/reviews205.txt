Who the hell approved this piece of crap?

- Story line: what story line? - Wasted really good characters.
Literally just threw them in this big pile of crap. - Should've just
made the movie about the joker and harley quinn. Perhaps a cameo by
deadshot instead of this 123min waste of time and money. - Joel
Kinnaman... why? seriously, who the hell put this guy in the movie? -
clichés. clichés everywhere. - the ending was good. because I finally
got to go home, watch netflix and forget about this horrible, horrible
thing.Please, do not watch this movie at the movie theater. Not even at home.
Just make a new movie in your head and pretend that this one does not
exist. Trust me, whatever you imagine gets an Oscar compared to this
thing.I love movies, and consider myself with a decent amount of knowledge to
rate a movie and this, my friends, is a total disappointment.
