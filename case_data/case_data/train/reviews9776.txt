artistic movie with plot

Too long I am bombarded by TV shows that attempt to create drama within
drama to prolong their lives. Too few movies I have seen that are so
beautiful and yet have a good roller-coaster plot. "The best offer" seems too good to be true. The music, simple,
classical and with taste. At times, two channels are separated so that
my attention was drawn and I can't stop enjoying the music. The
sceneries, full of sculptures, paintings and other sorts of art works,
combined with the view of Italy, are mesmerizing. Sylvia Hoeks is just
so breathtakingly beautiful. The scene where she submerged herself
under the bathtub water was just so picturesquely capture that it
itself constructed a french portrait of a girl. The story is just too
good to be true, the atmosphere was built up to climax so perfectly
that you can sense the doom is imminent. It left me wonder, isn't it
too harsh in the end? But It is a Geoffrey Rush's show. But don't forget, it was Giuseppe
Tornatore who put all these pretty things are put together.
