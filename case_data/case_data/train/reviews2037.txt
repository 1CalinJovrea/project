Nearly Ridiculous...

Two adrenaline bursts in this movie... one star for each. I secretly
love MM, but when the writers, producers, and director take on a
project like this (diving w/ sharks), they really need to AT LEAST have
an inkling about how diving affects people and shark behavior... I was
snickering throughout instead of gripping my arm-rests like I should
have been: #1 47 meters is the threshold of "maximum safe depth" for (deep)
recreational divers and since not all divers have exact physiology and
these characters were novices and freaking out, being at that threshold
itself would have killed them quickly.#2 Sharks in general are not attracted to iron-based "aka human" blood
(they are attracted to copper-based blood "mainly fish") - they will
attack regardless on occasion but not because they heard your heartbeat
and thirsted for your blood even from 5 feet away.(I'll limit this list to 3 items) #3 Sharks do not like the sound of
bubbles in the water... in fact it scares them and is akin to the sound
of fingernails on a chalkboard (for us) so 100% of them leave the area
when they hear it. No, their hunger does not counteract their
discomfort.But I get it, you can't make a movie about terrifying sharks that
behave in their natural, unobtrusive ways - the movie needed shock
value. It's just that experienced divers like myself are lost on the
ridiculousness of the action and those who don't dive now won't go near
the water in fear of marine dangers that aren't real, at least as were
portrayed by this film.Still, it wasn't a complete waste of 89 minutes... MM is still
gorgeous! And who's this Stuart guy anyway!?
