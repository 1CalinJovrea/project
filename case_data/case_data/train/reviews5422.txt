As good as a high school rom-com gets

I really liked The First Time. I don't feel the need to summarize what
the movie is about, as the other reviews and the summary does that job,
but I really enjoyed this movie. The writing for this movie really
stood out to me, as the conversations felt so real between characters
because of subtle little things that happen in most conversations in
real life. That's a credit to the actors as well, but when you see the
movie, especially the first time the main characters meet, you will
understand what I mean.It's a shame this film didn't get a bigger release in theaters because
Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson are both terrific. They make the two
characters blend so well together it's hard not to root for them to
wind up together. The supporting cast does a great job as well, but
this movie is all about Dave and Aubrey so there wasn't a large chunk
of material for any of them.The only thing I can suggest for this movie is don't go into it
expecting to make you laugh hysterically. Don't get me wrong, it's a
very funny movie, but it's more of the type that makes you smile, grin,
or giggle. Can't go without mentioning the soundtrack either, its
phenomenal and every song goes with its moment.Overall, I highly recommend this movie. The only way I could see
someone disliking the film is if they are not into rom-coms or high
school movies, but if you are then why are you even watching it in the
first place?9/10
