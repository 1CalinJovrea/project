Looks nice but feels hugely insubstantial and unsatisfying

This film feels like a Black Mirror episode - but one that treads water
for almost two and a half hours without ever reaching its main idea.
250% longer, but only a fraction of the satisfaction. I really wanted to immerse myself in its atmosphere and ideas, the idea
of a David Lynch/Cronenberg style Shining/Shutter Island film seems
great. But the film really tests your patience. The main character is
icy and unlikable, the other characters are similarly distant. Stuff
happens, a lot of stuff, some of it great looking, but with nothing to
tie it together or the any character depth to engage with, it ends up
feeling like you're being taken through a film students visual
exhibition that doesn't end soon enough. It really doesn't live up to the amazing film that the trailer
suggests, a pattern that seems to be more and more common with films
these days. Similar to Passengers, I wonder if moments were shot just
to make the trailer more powerful in selling the film.
