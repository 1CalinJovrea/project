Superb tongue in cheek Fantasy Sci Fi 9/10

I have to admit this blew me away , I wasn't expecting to enjoy it but
this was a really funny enjoyable piece of entertainment. Definitely worth seeing . This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films like
the LOTR trilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians of
the Galaxy . Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As well as the Stone
revolutionary South African gladiator . Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role for
Scarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble . As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about the
franchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk )
mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by an excellent script and
great comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Banner
and Valkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performance
was below par for such an excellent actor . Plenty of action and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .It's a film I'd definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the reclining
seats :) Pad.A 9/10
