The Expendables 3 is not for the cerebral it is full of blazing action
scenes, comfortable humour and a plot that is held together by duck
tape but it delivers in spades. OK Harrison Ford is his usual gray self
but Antonio Banderas shines in every scene he is in mixing pathos and
humor in a heady mix of, "why has he not been the lead in anything more
than the cat in Shrek", for so long. Also Wesley Snipes has his moment
in the sun as a quipping killer whose knife prowess and capability
makes Stratham's character step up to the plate.The character list is a who's who of action heroes and the in jokes
keep on rolling. If you love tanks, guns, huge explosions and larger
than life characters you'll not be short changed.Personally I think this is the best of the three and I say look past
its flaws and just enjoy the ride.
