'CULT OF CHUCKY': Four Stars (Out of Five) The 7th installment in the Chucky horror movie franchise, which brings
back cast members (and their characters) from all six previous
installments. The story deals with Chucky now having the ability to
possess multiple different dolls, and he uses them to torment the
survivor of the last film, Nica, who's now living in a mental
institute. It was written and directed by the series creator Don
Mancini, who's written all seven films and directed the last three. The
movie once again stars Brad Dourif as Chucky, and it costars Fiona
Dourif, Alex Vincent, Michael Therriault, Adam Hurtig, Elisabeth Rosen,
Grace Lynn Kung, Marina Stephenson and Jennifer Tilly. It's received
mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was released directly to
video and VOD. I'm a fan of the series and I enjoyed this installment
as well.Nica (Fiona Dourif) has now been accused of the murders of her family,
and is living in an asylum. She's also been hypnotized into actually
believing she's responsible for their deaths, and not Chucky, by an
abusive doctor (Therriault). The doctor also starts bringing a Good Guy
doll to therapy, and Nica, and other patients, are deeply disturbed by
it. Grisly deaths begin occurring as well, and another doll shows up
too. Nica soon starts to believe it was Chucky that killed her family
after all, and he's now tormenting her again.I'm a pretty big fan of the franchise, and the Chucky character, and
I've actually really enjoyed every installment (to varying degrees).
This new chapter takes the series in some interesting new directions,
and it looks like there will probably definitely be more sequels. For
me it's not quite as good as most of the other Chucky films, but it's
still better than a lot of other B slasher movies. I think fans of the
genre, and Chucky, will probably enjoy it too.
