Dreadful addition to the series.

The first movie was by no means a masterpiece but it was a decent
enough horror movie, but it seems after part 2 the sequels are just
getting worser. This series of films should come to an end now,.6 is easily the worst entry in the series,the story is boring and
uninteresting. What happened to Doug Bradleys character from part 5?.The inbreds themselves are barely in it. This looks more like a fan
film, the make up effects look cheap and Saw-tooth and One- eye look
identical. This strays away from what made the first one entertaining.It wont be long now before they make a part 7 which will probably be a
found footage movie.
