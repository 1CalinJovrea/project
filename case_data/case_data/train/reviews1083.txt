I actually really liked it.

This movie has garnered a lot of criticism, and to be honest, I'm a
little surprised. The plot and CGI were good. The acting and casting
was excellent. Some parts of the movie felt really similar to The
Exorcist II (Boorman), and I appreciated the lucidity and metaphysics
embedded in the plot. I felt like the scene changes and juxtaposing
modern/mythical images did a good job of sliding the viewer into the
otherworldliness of the script. Most of the criticism seemed to revolve
around expectations of Vin Diesels performance. The Character is
written tersely for a reason. Why do people expect someone to be
Shakespeare, simply because they lived 800 years. That experience might
make some people very quiet, and I found Vin Diesel's interpretation
believable and appropriate. He isn't portrayed as a scholar or wizard:
just a good man who happens to be cursed. Frankly, I don't think most
of these people would have been happy with a 20 min monologue by Alan
Rickman. The movie was a good fantasy/action movie with some clever
plot elements and creative representations of traditional magical
elements.
