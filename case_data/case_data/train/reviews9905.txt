Most Negative--"critics"-- Reviews Tend To Be Wrong

Another hilarious Cameron Diaz movie. I loved it! As much as some or
many "critics" can go on about not liking this movie, so can those who
liked it, so we'll stop there. WATCH this movie. The other hilarious
one was Bad Teacher. Both amazingly funny movies. I tend to see a lot
of dislikes on movies and music where a Hispanic (an obvious Hispanic
or those with an obvious Hispanic name) is the lead star (tho not many
Hispanics have lead roles) or singer, both from "critics" and/or
"professionals" and the mass population. I just watched it and felt
like saying what actually is vs the "critics'" usual arrogant and
ignorant views. Watch these movies: you wont be disappointed. (I
actually like Cameron Diaz' body over Uptons)
