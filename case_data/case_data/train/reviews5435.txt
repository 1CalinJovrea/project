Wanna Kill Your Libido? Call The New GHOSTBUSTERS!

What was this? Was this like a dare or a social experiment???Well, it failed, we pass. We are not going to go for it.I mean sure I am already prejudiced because it is a reboot, which
remake worked out there? What? none of them? Well, then. Star Wars TFA,
Superman, Star Trek all sucky suck reboots? Then this fails doubly hard!By the I thought the '90s are over and we are over this whole smart,
witty, clever female/idiotic bumbling male sexism. Give it a rest. I am
a man and no matter what you say or do I like: thin women, long hair,
flaunting bodies and nicenessI do not like: gross women, rude women, lard, farting women, etc.Kapisch?
