The surprisingly likable soldier.

Suite Francaise poses a big dilemma during German-occupied France in
WWII: not all Allied forces are good, and not all Nazis are sinners.
For example, Matthias Schoenaerts' soldier Bruno is admiral, calm and
polite, especially towards village girl Lucile (Michelle Williams),
with whom he's staying with. Their feelings for each other grow, much
to blah's disgust. Schoenaerts and Williams are on fine form,
especially the former of the two. Lucile is a little too callous and
hostile, but not as much as Kristen Scott Thomas, who plays unlikeable
too well. Schoenaerts I weirdly felt is the one to route for. Suite
Francaise is more village drama than history lesson. It's a love story
without much heart, a bit of history and a rocking cast.
