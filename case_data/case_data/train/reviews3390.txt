Single handedly the best Action/Sci-Fi movie in 2014 and the most underrated.

It is deferentially the best Si-Fi, Action, Drama and even comedy movie
of the year ... amazing story, connected plot, unexpected satisfying
ending. The storyline is so thrilling .. every scene is intriguing in its own
way ,, even if they give the same story in the scene, its repeat will
have this small tick that makes it different.Tom cruise did a hell of job, his face expressions on the movie just
memorizing, makes you be in the movie itself. and those comedic, ironic
bits on the movie made it more attracting. If you watched it once you will definitely watch it again and again ,,
then again some scenes !! ;) the screenplay writers are geniuses they
made hell of twists all along the movie and bravo for Doug Liman for a
fabulous directing. not being nominated for two academy awards minimum
for best actor and directing or writing was just totally unfair !! well
since we're here i'm off to watching the movie once again ;)
