Turkey of the year

I rate this the worst mainstream movie I've seen since 'Ashanti' back
in 1979. Indescribably bad in every department. The sub James Bond plot
is barely comprehensible, the acting all round is atrocious, especially
that of Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen; the script - risible. Even
setting the movie in Florence, Venice and Istanbul is a waste of time
since the camera barely lingers long enough for us to appreciate the
beauty of these locations. There is a total absence of suspense and we
care nothing about any of the characters. This film exhibits everything
that is wrong with modern cinema - rapid editing, shaky
camera,meaningless noisy soundtrack all designed to create an
atmosphere of fake excitement where nothing of any substance exists. It
actually occurred to me halfway through that the entire movie was a
spoof.
