A joke on Star Treck

Yet another 3dFirst of all, I do not care about graphics. Graphics are not the reason
I watch a film. I rather enjoy a good story, consistency, engaging
action, drama, a nice plot - none of witch the subject in hand has.Story:Well, if you know Wrath of Khan, then do not bother, just imagine Spock
instead of Kirk.Engaging action:Wile there was action, plenty, I was struggling to see reason - this
makes it non engaging. It does not matter that they are in trouble
running from indigenous people if they should of not been there in the
first place, nor Enterprise under water, nor Kirk on the Kronos planet
fighting inconsistent looking Clingons! DramaKirk in Spock running in the woods in opening scene - why?Prime directive trashed for no good reason - huh?Spock relationship issues during mission - really?Kirk revived by Khan blood - no one saw that coming?Big/mean Enterprise is faster and more powerful that small/peaceful
Enterprise - oh no!Kirk and Khan are buddies (temporary).Plot:Still unclear who wanted to do what.Slow, predictable, dialog really lame (school like)Khan never reveal his ultimate goal.Kirk was pretty much a dice (remember his captain of Enterprise) -
slightly constant was his need for mindless vengeance - nice touch.The only one actual important element to the story came in the form of
a paranoid admiral that wants to fight Clingons in a improbable vessel.In the end it all proves that Kirk is nothing more that incredibly
stupid, vengeance indulging, risk freak Enterprise CAPTAIN - we all
like that don't we?. And there are 72 more reasons in form of "manned" photon torpedoes -
OK, so that is more easy to do then to just kill them - sure I got it.Consistency:Lately, warp drive creates magic dust.Clingons had collectively changed as a race.Enterprise can swim.Cardasian beverages can travel time.Kronos planet has no defenses.If this would of been shoes, I would of taken them back to the store
and ask for my money back! But it was in 3d, I mean that is all so cool!
