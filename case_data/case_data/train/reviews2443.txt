Ignore the critics- a great movie with lots of suspense

I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed
this movie more than most of the "critically acclaimed" films I've
watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama,
philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments
(and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good
(never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the
trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe
would be about the ending, which was still fine.Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really
enjoyed it.
