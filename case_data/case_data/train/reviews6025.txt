not worth the time

spoilers may occur, but i'll do my best to prevent them.This movie has so little to do with the traditional legend of Arthur,
Excalibur and Camelot, that it seems eminently appropriate to direct
those viewers who have an interest in better deliveries of the legend
to John Boorman's Excalibur.This current treatment is ideal for those whose experience of cinema
began with the advent of gore as the central factor of cinematic
experience.That, in itself, is simply an historical development that has to do
with audience expectation and would not, in itself, be so
disappointing, if it were not for the fact that The Legend Of The Sword
has absolutely nothing to do with the legend that has been preserved in
poetry, prose and film over generations--rendered in it's best cinema
representation at the hands of Boorman, in Excalibur.The "modern" or relevant source of the legend has always been Mallory's
Morte d'Arthur, and that work drew its strength from a legend that was
shared across the Celtic world (yes, the Britons were also Celts) about
a redeeming king or savior who would draw his strength from magical
sources. That's how the world was at one time. I'm not too sure that
it's very different, now.Mallory's original work is actually a study of human behavior in
pre-Christian time, a quasi analysis of pre-Christian morality that
suggests an inevitably necessary investigation of the validity of the
impending new belief in a single god.That idea was the central philosophical principle of Boorman's
Excalibur. The current treatment, The Legend Of The Sword, has nothing
to do with that. It is simply a Quentin Tarantino similar gore fest,
and actually not even as entertaining as Tarantino might have achieved
with the same material. In short, it's ridiculous, unfortunately
ridiculous. It's an embarrassment, given the legend on which it is
supposed to be based.in all honesty, it was a waste of time.i like Charlie Hunnam--he was great as a hamlet on a motorcycle--but
this garbage is something that i hope he becomes famous enough to
publicly regret.Perhaps the worst thing of all was having to wonder about why Jude Law,
who has delivered some very worthy performances, and, here, provokes
nothing but audience remorse about his career.Maybe those who've never known anything about the legend might find
this movie interesting, but i would worry about the amount of illicit
influence they would have to ingest to make that possible.honestly, it's, unfortunately (given the potential actor talent
involved) not worth the the time. it's garbage.All in all, don't waste your time on this.
