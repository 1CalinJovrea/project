Awful

Where do I begin? Of course the length. It's just ridiculously long,
without anything that would make the viewer interested in, without
principles or a cause. The main protagonist is a dumb little girl who
can't even fathom her convictions, let alone hold on to them. She has a
guy loving her, working in the MINES, while she's pretending not to
like the parade of her and her "victorious" boyfriend from the games
and all the posh show-off that happens. When the guy opens up to her
and shows her that more than *she* matters, and the fact that he won't
just run off with her, while all the rest stay in misery, all she can
do is just leave. Then there's the other (long) part of the movie where
she just starts to create this whole different relationship, while her
lover is left behind the screen. What sort of morality is this movie
trying to portray? Is this what the western world is moving towards to?
Just awful.
