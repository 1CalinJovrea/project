Amazingly Overrated!

I may be acting a bit rash in rating this film at 2 stars, but at the
time of my writing, there are just too many shadow marketing reviews on
this site to ignore. In a different situation, and if the first 2(3)
underworld movies were not so good, I might rate this a 5.New writers, new director/directors, different movie.If you just want to see some cookie cutter CGI 'action' movie, then
give this a look.If you are a fan of the earlier movies, if you know the story of
Selene, Viktor, Corvinus, and the rest, you will be disappointed. It is
not as bad as the crazy changes they made to the highlander movies, but
they just decided to forget the past films and do something new.
Actually they decided to rip off a few other stories, none of which
were good the first four times you saw them.I am not going to go into every detail of what is wrong with this
movie. For the most part, it is bad because it must be compared to the
earlier films in the series. It just does not compare in any way.
Acting, scenery, sets, writing, story, effects, all better in prior
underworlds.Aside from all I have said, the production value is high, and the movie
is watchable.
