Nicely Made but Confused Message Film

A "message" film that is confused. Tom hanks is wasted and barely used.
The main character, Meg, often does illogical and really stupid things
(connect ALL of your personal social media with your work's personal
account? No. Go completely transparent so everything u do is record and
viewed? No!Involve your close friend and family with this invasion of
privacy without asking? NO!) but Meg does dumb stuff like this again
and again through out the movie! Then you have it seem like the film's
message is a transparent life style is bad! But nope, even though Meg
gets her friend killed and alienates her parents, she gets even with
her employers for her friends death, then proceeds to continue working
for the company(? HOW?) and ends with positive note that privacy is
bad!?! Confused? So am I am. Look at all the bad stuff happening
because we no longer have the same amount of privacy we used to have!
How can some one write an anti privacy film, muddle it til its
illogical and confusing - then try to say privacy is bad at the end
without laying any real argument? Do not waste your time!
