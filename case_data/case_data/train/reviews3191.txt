amazing!

I didn't think I would like this film! But it was just brilliant! John
Connors was amazing in it. Edge of your seat stuff but also emotional
and raw at times. Some funny moments too. The best film I've seen this
year! A must see. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! This is my
IBDb review. It was THAT good!
