Not worth your time and money, depressing

I am 39, so I could relate to this movie. There were many fun "lines"
but they way they were delivered falls flat. Instead of being funny and
showing us relevant insights to turning 40 and life, all this movie
demonstrates is a depressing view of angry bitter people who hate each
other. Scenes were just thrown together, stitched up and made into a
movie. The beginning of the movie shows you that both their birthdays
are close together (weeks), but the movie implies that a lot of time
has past. What was that bit about them going away? I'm sorry, but if
you are so broke you have to sell your house, you would not run off for
the weekend. They were all happy and stoned, then what happened to
that? I guess they needed something funny to show in previews. And I
was thinking wasn't it his birthday party? There were many funny parts,
but in between I was thinking, I'm bored and want to leave. Too bad.
This movie made me angry, depressed and wanting to run as far away from
these people as possible. The only really good part was during the
credits when Melissa McCarthy has a bit from their outtakes.
