Charmless, unredeemable.

Let me start by saying that I enjoy crude humor. I loved The Hangover,
Old School, SuperBad, etc. But "Vacation" is flat out obnoxious and
unfunny. Not a single laughable moment. I didn't even find myself
smirking at any point. It was that awful. Not even the nostalgia of the
old "Vacation" movies could save this atrocity. The script seemed like
it was written by spastic 13 year old juvenile delinquents. When the
script wasn't obnoxious it was simply just uncreative. The car was so
over-the-top that it was eye-roll inducing. The angry Korean voice on
the GPS was unoriginal and clich√©. Helms and Christina Applegate should
quit acting, out of shame.
