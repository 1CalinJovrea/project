Both Portman and Jackie Beautiful in Subtlety

I saw this movie at TIFF and haven't been able to get it off my mind
since. Natalie Portman is brilliant in her portrayal of someone who is
both uniquely strong-minded and painfully insecure. The portrayal of
this type of personality at a time (the 2-3 days following JFK's death)
where personal and national perception was everything is unlike
anything I have seen in film.Between script, art direction and cinematography, this movie is equally
brilliant in its ability to say everything without saying anything. I
can't recommend this movie enough. I don't doubt that we will be
talking about it come Oscar season.
