A Big Hit!

I thought that Iron Man 3 was a smash hit! The movie shows that Tony
Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr. is truly a superhero, and shows that
he does a lot more heroic qualities of Tony Stark. The previous Iron
Man films were shown by the perspective stand point of Iron Man, but in
this film shows a lot more of Tony Stark. The special effects of IM3 was amazing! It made everything just come to
life, it made me feel like I was right there in the middle of the
movie. The special effects also made the movie so much more suspenseful
and intense, I didn't want to stop watching it! This movie is now one
of my favorites!
