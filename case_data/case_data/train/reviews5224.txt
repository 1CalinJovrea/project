Denzel is fine but the movie disappoints

If it was not a Denzel Washington movie; it could easily pass for "B"
direct to video movie. Low production values; not outstanding
characters or actors (aside from Denzel and little used Cloe Moretz), a
quite predictable and lazy written story, several "USA POLITICALLY
CORRECT DETAILS" **spoiler follow** Denzel never kills a cop **end of
spoiler** This is a movie Denzel can do it while sleeps and he is
really good; but it is not a good movie by far. Too long for his own
good and cheap special effects, uninteresting final showdown. Antoine
Fuqua made the mid budget "Olympus Has Fallen" last year and the looked
far more expensive that this one (which reportedly cost over 50M) In
brief; if you are a fan of Denzel; get "Training Day"; this one is not
worth the over two hours spent.
