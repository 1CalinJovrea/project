An OK thriller with some interesting aspects.

Let us start with the fact that this is not a horror movie. It's a
thriller, with some interesting unusual aspects, as well as a few
cringe-worthy flaws (in character logic, as the case always seems to
be).So what makes this movie stand out and feel almost fresh? The obvious
first is that our protagonist is deaf-mute. Not being an expert on deaf
people, I still believe this was played quite consistently to the
movie's credit. It is interesting to occupy the head space of someone
missing such an important sense in a frightful situation.Another thing I noticed is the total lack of jump scares. There isn't a
single jump-scare in the movie, which only further distances Hush from
being a horror movie. In fact the usual creep factor as a whole is kept
to a minimum. It quickly becomes a cat-and-mouse kind of battle of wits
more than anything else, which I found a pleasant surprise, despite
being more of a horror fanatic.The third curious thing is that from the get go it's made clear that
the killer is very much human. We don't know what his motivations are,
he's just out to kill and doesn't give much of a s*** about anything
else but his upper hand. He doesn't have much of a plan and has to
improvise, as does our protagonist to survive.I found the thrill in this movie to be more intellectual than primal.
The gore is neither profuse nor lacking, it's there when it's needed.
It's well shot, acted, directed and edited, considering the modest
budget, and doesn't overstay its welcome. I'd recommend it for a rainy
evening if you want to see the thriller genre try something new.
