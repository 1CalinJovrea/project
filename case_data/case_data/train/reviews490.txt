Don't really care for it

Every year when the best movie nominations are revealed, I watch all of
them to decide if they are worthy. I was surprised that Brooklyn is
nominated because I have no idea why. The acting is good from every one
involved. Saoirse Ronan as usual shows her limitless talent. However I
have trouble caring about the events in her life or the characters.
These events are meant to be extraordinary - migrating to a foreign
land, overcoming homesickness to thrive in the new environment, falling
in love and marrying someone from another culture as well as losing a
beloved family member back home. It seems like they are just glossed
over lightly and at a rather slow pace. There were some inspiring words
narrated over but it still feels like a TV movie rather than one for
the big screen hoping to win big awards.
