A welcome family friendly Halloween movie.

After seeing some of the other movies offered up for Halloween, I found
this one to be a refreshing addition to the holiday fare. Jack Black
was good in a subdued role. The story was solid. The C.G.I. was used ,
when necessary . I found what I thought was going to be the most
obnoxious character, the kid with the teeth, was not so bad too. The
movie also had an some what interesting mystery in many ways. There was
no unnecessary violence except maybe against a werewolf or two. The
film was definitely not a award winning horror, drama, winner, but it
was a good popcorn companion. The scares in the movie fall upon the
action adventure kind also, so it is pretty safe for the young ones.
