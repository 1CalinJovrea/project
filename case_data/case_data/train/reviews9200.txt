Exceptionally created

A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending, soul imploding film.
Although the first scene is action packed, not much is understood as to
the who's and why's. After that, and for only a few minutes, the movie
seemed slow and without direction. Soon after it becomes intriguing,
suspenseful, and where the direction of the film is going (although not
yet understood). The Director was able to clearly explain the
unexplainable at the very end of the movie. So, for those that
sometimes walk out of a movie not understanding what happened, I can
assure you that will not be the case here. I give many kudos to the
original writing, screen writing, directing, and acting. This movie
will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever.
