A mix of science and fiction?

I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how
good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise
that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this
barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv
was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically
inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know
physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in
pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from
magic. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
magic." I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me
to a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their
humanity and become real Gods.Enjoy this film and let your mind explore the impossible.
