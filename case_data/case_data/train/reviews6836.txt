These Characters Are Troubled!

"Diary of a Teenage Girl" is a disturbing story of a 15 year old girl
who starts an affair with her mother's boyfriend. From reading another
review I learned that this film is from a book by the author Phoebe
Gloeckner. I don't think I'm going to read the book anytime soon but
from how this film is I can tell that it must be a very good book. This
film has a great story-line and in it are some disturbed characters.
Minnie, played by Bel Powel, is the teenage girl who loses her
virginity to her mother's boyfriend. From this event she mistakenly
thinks she's grown and that starts a pattern of destructive events in
her life. Monroe, who is played by Alexander Stargard, is the sicko who
takes advantage of Minnie (Bel Powel). He continues the sick affair
behind his girlfriend's back (Charlotte), who is played by Kristen
Wiig, who has her own problems she's dealing with. One thing I didn't
like about this film was the animated sequences that were incorporated
into the film. I think it could have done without that but I guess it
was good to display the main characters thoughts in that way. Over all,
it's a nice film and I would recommend it.
