Great, Tropper gives us the perfect film version for his book.

I would rate this movie an 8 or 9 out of ten because I am part of the
target audience. I read the book, Tropper does a great job of
translating that to the screen with the right blend of people.Bateman is fantastic. One reviewer said that everyone is filled with
flaws, but I thought the characters seemed extremely real. Imagine a
member of your immediate family passing, and then sitting in a house
with everyone else in the family for 7 days. Flaws are going to be
shown. They will be plenty. This movie is about love. But it is about
love for people that matter, even if you forgot who they are. Go see
it!
