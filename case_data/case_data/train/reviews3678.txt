That's four hours of my life I'm never gonna get back! Felt more like five!

Self absorbed, self obsessed, pretentious luvvie sh*t. "Look at us, we
are actOrs and you're not. We shall shoot this one take. We, are,
going, to, show you, just how clever we are." I could have stayed at
home and gazed at my own navel. I really can't see why we have to write a minimum of ten lines. Surely
short, succinct reviews are easier to read, but I'll continue in an
effort to save other people from wasting their hard earned on such
luvvie drivel. If you are pretentious, then please go and see this
film. If you aren't........then don't. Spoiler alert! If only Lindsay
Duncan's character could have reviewed the film instead of the play,
she could have saved us all a lot of trouble. Ten lines, I'm done.
