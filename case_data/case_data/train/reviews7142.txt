So much fun for all ages - great family movie!

I saw the trailers for this way back and thought the concept sounded
like a good one, but Disney don't always deliver well on the promise of
a good concept. This time they did it really well, this movie is fun,
not too long, has likable characters, humor and a really nice story
with a message that isn't preachy at all about how people get put into
a little box in life and it's really hard to get out of it.We all know that feeling, and Ralph knows it only too well. You've seen
the trailers, he's supposed to wreck stuff and only do that, but he
wants more than that.I won't give you any spoilers, I will just say the screening we saw had
kids of all ages in it from toddlers to teens, and parents,
grandparents and some adults without kids with them at all.John C Reilly is great, Sarah Silverman (who I don't generally like in
live action stuff), is brilliant, and the voice talents chosen were
spot on.It's not Pixar, but it's the best animated original story Disney has
produced in years - take your family, you'll have fun! *** One note *** The Wii game of the same name is NOT good - it does
NOT follow the movie plot and it's just a bad game.
