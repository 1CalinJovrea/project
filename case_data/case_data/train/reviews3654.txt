Atmospheric, but if you think about it it's no more than poor man's "The Shining"

The Blackcoat's Daughter is one of those slow-burn, but creepy and
atmospheric horror movies. It's about these two girls who stay over
winter break at their boarding school, one of them descents into
madness and gets possessed and there is also this girl who escaped
asylum played by Emma Roberts who tries to get to that school. How it
all comes together, see for yourself.Starts off very creepy and gets under your skin, so I was really
looking forward to seeing what it was gonna become. But it just kinda
falls apart and doesn't tie together so well (for example, the
possession felt really random). The story is essentially a poor man's
version of The Shining with some other random stuff thrown in the mix.
The performances are good and the mood is pretty nice, but with a poor
script, it just doesn't work as well as it could have. A slow-burn creepy horror movie is always a refreshment to see in the
sea of lazy jump-scare cash-grabs, but this isn't one of those great
indie horror movies. It has the feel, but not much else.
