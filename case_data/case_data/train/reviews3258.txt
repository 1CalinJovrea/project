Thank God for the last 20 minutes

It is actually impossible to rate a twilight film as "good" because
it's an established fact that those films make zilch sense and do not
provide any remote sense of satisfaction to the general moviegoers
apart from the amazingly passionate legion of fans called "twihards".
So when a person who is not a fan of the series says a twilight movie
is good, it means that it is still terrible but not as terrible as the
other ones.The final instalment of this outrageously successful series, called
Breaking Dawn part 2, tries the patience of the viewer for the first
30- 40 minutes. There is hardly anything that happens apart from the
trademark Edward and Bella moments and a little bit of shirltess Jacob.
There is also a poorly done CGI baby which is called Renesmee, Edward
and Bella's daughter. Just when you contemplate walking out of the
cinema hall, you get to see something that can be perceived as a
successful attempt to placate the disappointed audience. There is a
very well-executed battle sequence with a clever twist that makes you
wonder why such scenes were so sporadic throughout the series. Yes, the
battle sequence was effective damage control.The performances were mediocre as opposed to the hitherto awful
monotony that the cast put up in the past four movies except
Pattinson,. who still continues to look jaded, but you can't really
blame him. On the whole, for an non-fan, this movie would visually punish you for
a while and then give you a breather during its last 20 minutes. If you
think the ticket cost is worth those 20 minutes, I suggest that you
watch it. Bland film otherwise
