Surprising in the Most Delightful Way

i attended a pre-screening of "Saving Mr. Banks" last night in Dallas.
while i had been looking forward to the film, i had my reservations.
after all, Johnny Hancock (director) was behind "The Blind Side," which
i found much too schmaltzy and watered-down for my taste. also, this
was a movie about Walt Disney being produced by his company - so how
honest would it be about the story behind the making of the masterpiece
"Mary Poppins"? would it settle for predictable mellow-drama (yes, i
meant to spell it that way) and glorify dear Uncle Walt as perfect and
demonize Mrs. Travers as a cold, soulless spoilsport? thankfully, the
answer to that is a resounding "no."while it surely takes artistic license with history, the film as a
whole is surprisingly great. there's not a weak moment throughout, not
a second where i wasn't entertained and wanting to find out what would
come next. this film (rated PG-13) surprises with many of the thematic
issues it tackles, including alcoholism, loss - and we even get a brief
glimpse of a smoking Mr. Disney (hey, it was the 60s).Emma Thompson has always been a strong performer though her screen time
has waned over the last decade and a half, but here she gives a
performance that is worthy of awards attention. As Mrs. P.L. Travers,
she is an author as protective as her life's work as a mother is for a
child and is dealing with demons nearly forgotten. Mr. Hanks too
carries his own playing the iconic and visionary Disney at the top of
his game, trying to honor a promise to his daughters while also add to
his impressive repertoire of cinematic achievements.this is not really a film to take your Poppins-loving tykes to. this is
the Disney film for mom and dad to enjoy. "Saving Mr. Banks" will
probably be remembered as one of the best films of 2013, and for good
reason.
