Very enjoyable fantasy romp

Jack, magic beans, beanstalk, giants, Fee Fi Fo Fum - if you ever had
bedtime stories read to you when you were small, there will be no
surprises here.This is a romp, plain and simple, and by far the best of the recent
spate of re-imagining fairy stories - this one is hardly reimagined at
all, it simply fuses Jack (of beanstalk fame) with Jack (of
giantslaying fame). It does add in a slimy rotter (Stanley Tucci having
enormous fun with Duston Hoffman's old teeth from Hook) and a rather
anonymous princess (with a much less anonymous dad in the form of Ian
McShane), and a host of expeditioners up the beanstalk, all of who are
available for slaughter, and not always in the order you expected,
either. Nicholas Hoult is a personable Jack, and Bill Nighy, as the
Giant General, gives his Davy Jones voice from Pirates another outing,
albeit with an Ulster overcoat replacing the kilt.The special effects are terrific, the 3D less so: like so many 3D
movies there are some shots which have a "Wow!" element, but the 3D is
hardly noticeable through much of the movie.Some of the violence is such that I would not recommend this for small
children. Otherwise, this is a terrific fantasy movie, the best of the
recent bunch.
