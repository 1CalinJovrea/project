Anna Karenina movie failure

Unfortunately it is indeed out! I have been waiting to see this version
of Anna Karenina forever. I have recently read this book, and this
version is the worst production. I said OK, Keira as Anna, it will be
difficult to watch, her being such an inappropriate actress for this
role, but in the end all the other parts of the movie made me say this
is a huge waste of time... If you haven't read the book it will be very
difficult to understand what this movie is about. The actors are poor,
except Jude Law, their accent is also bad. The fact that they turned it
into a low-budget movie just makes me really upset. It is
over-directed, it is a kitsch.
