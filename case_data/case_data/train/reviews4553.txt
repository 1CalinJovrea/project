Well scripted, well acted

Well written but even better scripted. I know some may see this movie
as some type of homo-centering self-destructive screenplay. I will say
to you viewers get your mind out of the judgmental and see this movie
for what it is. This movie is real life. This movie is about closure
and telling it as it is. If we all just let go of our insecurities and
were broken down to the bare necessities, what would we really care
about? Thought provoking? That's the whole point. Get you to respond.
Be engaged. The cast were just right. And you may not be able to relate
but you definitely can empathize with each character. Jake Gyllanhall
and Naomi Watts are great here. Watch a couple of times. Then go be a
metaphor or find your metaphor.
