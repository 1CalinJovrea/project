Please Stop Singing

Another typical Disney movie of princess, magic, spells, curses, and
CONFUSION. I wont spoil it but if you like musical girlie types like
FRozen then you'll probably love this. Otherwise, trust me you will be
like whats going on? Why is this taking so long? get to the point
already. It just drags and drags and drags. It is also somewhat
predicable..you'll see what i mean if you go see this. But i HIGHLY
recommend you Don't waste your time and money on this movie. If you
really want to see it that bad..wait for the DVD...trust me it isn't
worth it. At one point in the movie even The Rock says please stop
singing. Two good things i can say. The short story before the movie
started was outstanding. Its called Inner Workings. Absolutely amazing
and well done. Moana also exhibits incredible computer animation. Other
than that IT IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I warned you!
