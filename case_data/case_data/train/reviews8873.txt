This film is an insult!

I am completely honest and not exaggerating, this must be the worst
film I've ever seen! It is a romantic comedy made of randomly patched
clich√©s and some very cheap humor. There's no plot cohesion, and
whatever happens in the movie lacks a development, it's there to be
just a filler. The protagonist is a cynical woman who happens to be a
very one- dimensional character too. I guess that's all about it. I was
sure the movie must have been universally panned. And then I was
stunned to realize the film holds a score of 6.8 in IMDb and 85% in
Rotten Tomatoes. I didn't know anything about Amy Schumer so I Googled
her and I understand now she is a successful stand-up comedian in USA.
Could this be the reason why people liked the film? Or am I a hater?
