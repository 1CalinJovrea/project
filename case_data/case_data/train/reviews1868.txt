In a word - it's awful

EXP1 was bad, and EXP2 is no different. Just another lame
Stallone-ego-fueling mess of a movie. Watching these old losers taking
out scores of fodder with silly unrealistic gunplay just plain gets on
the nerves. Big budgets should be reserved for movies that actually
have plots and characters that you care about, and not feature has-been
actors that can't give up the fact that no amount of HGH and elevator
shoes will save them from irrelevancy.I give it a 1/10. I even like 80s and 90s action movies, very much.
Expendables does nothing to bring back the nostalgia of 80s and 90s
action glory - it's just another lame Stallone ego-fest.
