Just read the book- please

I've never written a review on here before but this was so incredibly
disappointing. Every nuance and detail that sucked you into the story
while reading the book has been erased and instead been replaced with
clich√© Hollywood hot actors continuously keeping at gratuitous
eroticism when the original was a bleak and hollow tale about human
relation. This entire film just tries so hard to be sexy and edgy as a
marketing ploy I'm suspecting but this was a bona fide mess. The stiff
acting, the weird casting ( the therapist- wtf?), the weird sexual
undertones, and please let's not even begin to start thinking about the
writing. Shallow, unrealistic, and lazy. Plain lazy. This was horrible.
Read the book- trust me.
