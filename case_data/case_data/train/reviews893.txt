Unflinching, underrated, original Western

I was very excited to watch this movie on the back of the trailer, and
particularly because I've almost always enjoyed anything Kurt Russell
has been in. I wasn't disappointed. Bone Tomohawk is a movie that has
been vastly ignored and underrated for it's originality and quality.
The acting performances are very good, and although it fulfills at
times the clich√©s of a western it showcases an originality to the genre
that is extremely welcome. For me, perhaps biased, Kurt Russell is the
outstanding performer. His portrayal is terse and unflinching. The
surprise in this movie is Matthew Fox. His performance is offbeat,
slightly creepy and somewhat intriguing. In this movie the western
genre is mixed with horror - to fantastic effect. It is otherworldly
action that exists outside of the norm and is all the richer for it.
There is plenty of action, and plenty of comforting camaraderie. The
horror is an added bonus that gives this movie a unique feel. One that
I have no doubt will be replicated in future.
