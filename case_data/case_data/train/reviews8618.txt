Excellent Adaptation. All the Hate is Unjustified.

I have seen both the original Broadway play and this film adaptation,
and I can gladly say that this lives up to the original's reputation.
The only major change is with one aspect of Rapunzel's storyline.There are 3 types of people who hated the movie: 1. Parents who thought this isn't suitable for kids. Well, this doesn't
say anything about how good the movie actually is. Yes, not all the
content is for kids; heck the original isn't meant for kids at all.
Even then, I don't think its that worrisome. If you think it is, just
don't let your kids watch it; but you can enjoy the story. 2. Fans of the original who are complaining about every little change.
People, its an adaptation; certain things need to be changed when
transitioning to a different medium of storytelling. And some of the
small changes are actual improvements to the original. 3. Those who weren't expecting a musical. I don't get this one. If you
don't like musicals, fine! But you can't rate it 1 star just because
its a musical!If you are looking for a typical Disney movie, look away. But if you
care about originality and want to witness familiar stories in a
different light, this is it. It has Disney characters but uses them to
deliver a more realistic and mature point of view about the world. The
story as a whole has some really good messages, but people seem to be
stuck up on the fact that it defied their expectations. As Into the
Woods points out, your actions have real consequences and sometimes
your wishes come true but not quite in the way you expected. Be ready
for an unexpectedly twisted journey..."Into the woods- Each time you go, There's more to learn Of what you
know."10 Stars!
