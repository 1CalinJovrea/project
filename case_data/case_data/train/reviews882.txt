This movie went quietly into the night

In less than an hour, reviewers from here will join others around the
world. And you will lose the largest battle in the history of movies.Movies - that word should have a new meaning for all of us today. We
can't be consumed by our petty cinema anymore. We will be united in our
common interests.Perhaps it's fate that today is not the 4th of July. Today, you will
once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression,
or persecution - but from annihilation of good movies. We're fighting
for our right to have good movies exist.And should we lose the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as
an American Holiday, but the day when the movie-going world declared in
one voice: WE WILL NOT GO TO YOUR CINEMAS IN THE NIGHT! WE WON'T BE VANISHED
WITHOUT A FIGHT! MOVIES ARE GOING TO LIVE! MOVIES ARE GOING TO SURVIVE!
BUT TODAY, WE WON'T CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY!-President Whitmore
