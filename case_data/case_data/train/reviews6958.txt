Was it Sweet

Wow! I struggled to give it a 4. It could have easily been titled Two
and a Half Men and a Truck. I thought the writing was weak, the acting
was average, and the ending was bad. Of course, I couldn't wait for the
ending.Why 2.5 Men with a Truck? Well, the chef, his son and a buddy build a
food truck that is an instant sensation. Do they stay in one place to
become successful? No! They head out across the country on a typical
buddy fantasy. The kid doesn't get lucky, but he gets his first French
donut.How did the truck become so successful, the kid can use Twitter on his
phone. Yes, it was amazing to everybody in the story. A twitter savant. I'm done.
