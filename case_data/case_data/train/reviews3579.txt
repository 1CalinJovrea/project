Aamir's best performance till date.. again.. and again...

I don't know whether most of the people actually knew the plot, but
surprisingly I did, somehow some brilliant guy about an year ago
already guessed or leaked the plot of the movie and I SERIOUSLY THINK
it must be some spot boy jerk. But anyways, despite knowing the plot I
still went to see the movie, that too First day first show. The moment
I saw the plot becoming real within the first 10 minutes, I was
skeptical whether I will like this movie. But to my surprise Aamir Khan
blew me away with his incomparable acting skills and cuteness of the
character. He will make you feel as if you are looking at a child who
has been introduced in the world for the first time but has a
consciousnesses. The main subject of the movie or so to say the "Strong
Message", has been adapted by many movies before but PK stands far out
from any of them. This movie will make you laugh but also make you cry.
My year definitely ended with such a present from Rajkumar Hirani.
