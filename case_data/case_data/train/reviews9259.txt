This depiction of The Three Stooges in a modern day setting portrayed by other actors is a fun tribute to them

You know, when I read that Peter and Bobby Farrelly were going to make
a movie starring actors impersonating The Three Stooges, I was a little
skeptical especially when the announced stars were people like Sean
Penn and Benicio Del Toro. But they calmed down and instead cast actors
like Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and Chris Diamantopoulos who did fine in
acting exactly like Larry, Curly, and Moe, respectively, when
portraying the legendary comics. And while there's somewhat of a
sentimental plot involving some orphan kids, it never goes in treacly
territory as there's always some wonderfully staged slapstick scenes
that undercuts that. Oh, and there's also some hilarious scenes
involving the cast of "Jersey Shore". In summary, this version of The
Three Stooges is highly recommended for anyone not minding seeing this
legendary comedy team played by other actors or anyone who haven't even
heard of them yet and wants to see more of them.
