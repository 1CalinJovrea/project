Why? A run of the mill, predictable, done before bore-fest, but not bad.

Who cares? That's the question I asked about halfway through Sully. First off, it's as predictable a story there is. It only occurred a few
years ago and in the first ten minutes, it's confirmed the story is
going exactly where you thought: there's no surprises. For
entertainment's sake, Eastwood effectively has to throw in a dream
sequence where the plane crashes into a building before Hanks wakes up. Plane crash movies have also been overdone. Wasn't Flight just a few
years ago? It was much more compelling and more unpredictable. But then
there's just been so many flight films. The one with Liam Neeson, the
Grey where the plane crashes, and too many more to name. The thing
about them though is at least they were about more than a predictable
plane landing. Hanks is, well, Hanks. He's not Sully, and is far removed from his
Oscar caliber wins for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. Wow, look at him
jog in those scenes! He's decent, but no way should he beat out Andrew
Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge. Speaking of Hacksaw Ridge, another biopic true story this year, it
actually has something to say and a reason behind it. There's no way
Sully should win a nomination over it in any competing category (voters
take note). It's not a bad film, but is incredibly "run on the mill", and like I
thought before watching it, I still don't know why this was made into a
big movie. It would've worked fine on Lifetime. The final half hour exits the clich√©s and saves it. 5.5/10
