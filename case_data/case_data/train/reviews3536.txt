Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original.

This Argentine film that found itself nominated for the 2014 Best
Foreign Language Film Academy Award comes to us from director Damián
Szifrón who has crafted a feature film comprised of a series of 6
vignettes/small stories about human beings from all walks of
(Argentine) life who are all tested and taken to their limits ... until
they finally lose control. While mostly disastrous the film is also
WILDly thrilling and wholly original in its daring cheekiness ... as
the film is a bitter dark comedy (with tinges of brutal drama).It is a film about a myriad group of people on a plane; a young
waitress who still finds herself grieving over a family tragedy of the
past; an encounter between two men from different social classes on a
desolate highway; a man growing tired of the rat race of life in which
we are all destined to lose; the aftermath of a horrible automobile
accident; and a wedding reception like none you've ever seen before.
All feature one or two characters taken to the edge ...It is how each of them handles their various situations that give us
our WILD stories. Fascinatingly grim at times, the film almost always
miraculously produces laughter and grins. Much of the laughter might be
heavily muffled as one chuckles under his/her breath as others around
them fail to see the director's (WILDly) wicked sense of humor come
into play in some of the film's intense situations; but the dark tone
pervades the entire film.While the film is most definitely tragic in many instances, Wild Tales
is a comedy of errors about human nature and who we are. Some can watch
this and most-likely not pick up even a hint of humor; but it is there
... and it is fantastically facetious.Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original. It is courageously wild.
