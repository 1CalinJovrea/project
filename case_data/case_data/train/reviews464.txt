One of my new favorite movies. I don't understand all the negative reviews

I honestly feel like this movie's rating should be way higher than what
it is. I thought that the movie was incredible and is definitely one
that kept me on the edge of my seat! From the beginning, you get great
character knowledge and some back story as to where things are going in
the story. The plot line is just amazing! I loved the whole inside look
at legal marijuana in California as well as the Mexican cartel portion.
Some parts of this movie were absolutely terrifying! And some were
quite heart warming.. Overall, it was just a great mix that really kept
me entertained the entire way through! I've always been an Oliver Stone
junky and he really nailed this one to the wall. I created an account
just because I looked up this movie and saw that it's rating was under
a 7! The problem with IMDb is right here, people writing their opinions
unknowingly persuading someone else to not go out and see an awesome
movie. People - if you haven't seen this, it is definitely worth your
time and money, at the very least, you will be entertained. With all of
the new movies coming out and worthless remakes appearing everywhere,
this movie restored some of my faith in Hollywood. Lastly, I thought
the cast was brilliant! Really liked John Travolta and Benicio Del
Toro's rolls in this! Please don't let the bad reviews fool you, this
movie is fantastic and a MUST-SEE!
