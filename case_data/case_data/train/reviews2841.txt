Dull

Very dull and boring movie. with a lot of forced jokes.not worth your time.10 years ago i would've been extremely surprised that this movie is
that bad with such a promising premise, however nowadays used to it and
this one simply follows the trend of bad movies.another bad Hollywood flick, made exclusively as a test for future
money grabbing franchise.the movie takes the "bad guy" clich√© to a new level.what more to say, well not much really, the action scenes are
pointless, there is no real danger, they simply kept trying to include
worthless punch-lines that deems Arnold's one liners Shakespearian in
comparison.
