Saw an early screening and was not disappointed.

So we all know the trend of video game movies being terrible. Well, I'm
happy to say Assassin's Creed BROKE that trend! Really quick one thing
to point out is that people complained that the movie was giving a
PG-13 rating. This is probably one of the most brutal PG-13 movies I've
seen in terms of violence. It was like they were going for an R rating
then at the last minute the studio was like, "You know what. Just cut
out the blood." Which honestly if that's how it went I wouldn't be
surprised. The choreography is fantastic and some blood is even shown.
Michael Fassbender as Aguilar was a great casting choice. His character
was well written and I felt a sadness for him (You'll know when you
watch the movie) All in all a great performance! Now is the movie
perfect... No. Of course not. Every movie has it's flaws. Some may say
the CGI is over used (Which I thought it wasn't) some may hate the
physics (But it worked for the movie) Again, little nit picks people
are going to say just because they can't have fun watching a movie! Let
me leave you with this. I had a blast watching this film and I highly
recommend it to even people who haven't played the game. 10/10
fantastic movie to end 2016 on!
