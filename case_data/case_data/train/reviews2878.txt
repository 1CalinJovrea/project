Boseman, Brown Can Do Anything

Very good and entertaining, and educational in illustrating who
Thurgood Marshall was and how he got involved in this real-life case.
Chadwick Boseman can do anything; he has such intelligent, sharp, and
sparkling eyes that bring you with him on any adventure. Excellent role
by Sterling K. Brown, who is also top notch. Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, and
James Cromwell were all likable, but a little distracting. I wished
they had picked unknown actors to handle these roles. Interesting
choice of two real-life cameos at the very end to tie this case to the
race relations and problems today. Which is sort of the point;
understand where we've been and how far we've come, but not far enough!
If it inspires many people to research who Thurgood Marshall was and
how he changed our country, it will have done a good job.
