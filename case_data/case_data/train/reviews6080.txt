Doesn't stand out

Although most reviewers on IMDb seem to be ecstatic about 'The Perks of
Being a Wallflower', I don't think this film really stands out. To be
honest, it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinion
it's a decent film, with some flaws, that could have been far better if
it wasn't so mainstream. I think most of the enthusiastic reviewers are young people, who
recognize themselves in this story about teenagers who choose to be
different from the rest. It's a very romantic story: a melancholic
teenager befriends a group of progressive/bohemian/intellectual
youngsters, who differentiate themselves from the rest of the school.
They introduce him to parties, drugs and music from The Smiths and
David Bowie. He falls in love with one of the girls, and another girl
falls in love with him. There are secrets to keep, memories to share
and experiences to cherish. This could have been the cinematographic equal to Donna Tartt's novel
'The Secret History'. But it lacks the dark, mysterious, Gothic aspects
of the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being a
Wallflower', but they are implied and not clearly explained. It's clear this movie appeals to young people, who perhaps can
recognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a good
movie in its own right, it should also be attractive for viewers in
other age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails.
