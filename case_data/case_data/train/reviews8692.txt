An Honest Film

This is an honest film.This struck me as an acid trip from the start, but I had a couple
glasses of wine (5) and stuck with it on NetflixxI ended up with this revelation--this is an honest film about the
ridiculousness of life and the consistent gnawing ache of gaining a sex
drive when you begin to grow.It's brilliant in its simplicity to just tell the truth exactly how it
is without worrying what we will think about it.I was reminded of that awkward feeling I would get as a much younger
child listening to teens talk about getting their periods and having
sex. Just this out of touch reality that I couldn't wait to dip my own
toe into. Exotic and pure and ridiculous.
