Waiting for the train

If an award were given for over-directing, this would win hands down.
it's a tribute to Tolstoy that his story came through the fog of
metaphor and clich√©, from the stage set play-within-a-movie (our only
guess as to meaning is that they were skimping on location shooting) to
actors twirling around each other to tearing up letters (and with them
any semblance of meaning to life) - to the point of tossing the scraps
up, only to come down as snow (could it get worse?).With a story like Anna Karenina it seems the director's only job would
be to decide which parts to omit; instead, Joe Wright has decided to
turn it into a soap opera. It's as if he were doing Shakespearean
sonnets and correcting the rhyme and meter.And casting Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky? When he first came out I
thought they'd done a spoof. He reminded me of Gene Wilder in a Mel
Brooks version of Tolstoy. On the other hand, Jude Law was perfect as
Karenin, as were Domnhall Gleeson as Levin and Olivia Williams as
Countess Vronskaya. Sadly, Keira Knightly seems to have thought she was
still doing Pirates of the Caribbean, as far from Tolstoy as you can
be.How two marvelously creative men, Wright who did Atonement and Stoppard
who gave us the incredible Coast of Utopia, could do this is beyond
comprehension.
