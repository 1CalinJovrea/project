Who's Mom did the CG for this film?

Honestly, I'm not a Twilight doomsayer. I found the first couple at
least fair to decent, but the series did deteriorate.When I watched and cackled during Breaking Dawn Part 1, I couldn't
believe how bad the film was, but my wife, in her wisdom and accuracy
said 'you shouldn't see part 2 then'. I responded with 'well part 1 was
terrible - generally without dialogue or direction and the CG that has
been awful through the other movies has continued the tradition in part
1.' Honestly, those wolves are so poorly modeled and animated, it's
painful.My wife looked at me and said, 'I really don't want to be in the room
with you if you watch part 2'. She was right. She didn't want to be in
the room.OMG, that baby was complete freakshow. I think Sharktopus on the SciFi
channel was built and rigged better. Baby needs bloom.Part 2 sadly is without dialogue or direction. The special effects
cause a migration in the film from just bad to humorous so that leaves
me with this rating.I might have rated it slightly higher if it hadn't cost so much. I know
where the money went in this film, but it wasn't in production,
creation, concept or detail.Enjoy the film if you can
