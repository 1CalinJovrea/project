An good and interesting prequel.

Apparently the minions in Despicable Me weren't created by Gru. They're
a group of being that date from prehistoric times to serve the most
evil people imaginable. From the Tyrannosaurus Rex to Napoleon
Bonaparte. But they find they always inadvertently kill their masters.
They feel depression and isolate themselves from the rest of the world.
Until one day in 1968 Kevin (Pierre Coffin) goes to the world again
with two other minions Stuart (Coffin) and Bob (Coffin) to find a
master. They get to New York, New York where they hear about Scarlet
Overkill (how subtle) (Sandra Bullock) who is aiming to be the world's
first female super villain. What follows is a big series of jokes and
quite the story line that makes this a great movie. To those reading
this review look at your schedule and make time to bring your family to
this film tonight. You won't regret it. It has fun characters, comedy,
and all the minions that made the last two films so great.
