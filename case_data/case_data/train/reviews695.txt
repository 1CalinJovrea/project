For fans of absurd plot-twists, a rich treasure trove.

I've played this game far too often. "Describe an idiotic thriller in
yet another review about an idiotic thriller" is a game I'm tired of
playing. Here's a disjointed list of most of the dumb things.1. The killer is immune to bullets. 2. Shue is immune to deep stab
wounds to the abdominal region. 3. The killer is a martial arts expert
 just because he was dressed up as a girl during childhood. 4. The
sheriff-was-the-boyfriend plot-twist is a hoot. 5. The killer's
childhood story is an even bigger hoot: kind of like a parody of
"Psycho", with crack cocaine thrown in for bad measure. 6. The utter
confusion regarding who was sneaking up behind trees, staring at
Lawrence. 7. The over-kill overboard mega-cliché teen-movie scene in
which the killer gets beaten up by a bunch of hormonal jocks. 8. Why
does the killer keep leaving the key on the door, when the captive
woman managed to escape several times already using that same key? 9.
Do regular injections turn every kidnapped girl into a mindless zombie?
10. Did the writer have a lobotomy or was he born that way? 11. The
less said about the various teen-movie clichés, the better.
