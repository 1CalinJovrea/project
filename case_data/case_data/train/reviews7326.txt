They Don't Make Them Like They Used To

While looking forward to seeing this film but having no real
expectations, the film was excruciatingly painful to sit through and I
like musicals. Being a former film student,I found this film slow,
boring, uneventful and at least an hour too long with unappealing
characters. At a point in the film, Ryan Gosling's character looks out
over L.A. and says "not much to look at". I said to my wife, "my
thoughts exactly" (referring to the film-not L.A.). This made musicals
like 'Lost Horizon' and 'At Long Last Love' look like cinematic
greatness (and I enjoyed those). They certainly don't make them like
they used to.
