Sci Fi? Would have been better as a simple romance film

In Spring you have all the makings for a stock romantic film on the
very romantic Italian coast. The movie is carried along well by Lou
Taylor Pucci, a fine young talent who gives a sincere performance to a
point...that point being the beauty and the beast climax which has the
female lead Nadia Hilker as both the beauty and the beast.Unfortunately this is where belief must be suspended. After a week long
relationship with Hilker, Pucci is so in love with her when he learns
she is some sort of a reptilian monster, he doesn't care. He still
wants her, even though she might kill him as she has done to other
people.Yet, the monster element does keep you watching in amazement until the
rather non eventful ending.
