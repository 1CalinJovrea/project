Solid drama

I haven't read the book so I can't judge if the movie is better or
worse. I can say though that Best of Me shouldn't be judged for plenty
predictable turns. It's a love story after all, no matter how hard you
try, it will end up as a story about love between two people. So it is predictable, but it's a well filmed beautiful love story, with
plenty of lovely shots and quite good acting. Still, I can't say that
the script was well done and here's why. (Be careful, huge spoilers to
come). We can predict from the start that this love story won't have a
happy ending. So many things in dialogs are completely unnecessary. For
example, when Amanda got a call from her son, we can figure out that
something is going to happen just because he calls. She doesn't have to
say anything about bad drivers and all that. Basically, in that moment
we can stop watching the movie because that's exactly the moment where
we find out the final, not in the actual end of the film. And there are
quite many moments like that, unfortunately. But all in all, it's a good drama, and I bet everyone with a heart
cried at least a bit in the end, no matter how much he figured out
before. And that's what this movie is all about, it's not a rule
breaker but quite solid film which honestly follows rules of classical
love drama.
