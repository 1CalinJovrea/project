Soderbergh Does Drugs and Does Them Well

Side Effects is a psychological thriller centered around the
pharmaceutical industry. I won't say much more for fear of spoiling
anything, but let's just say an experimental drug prescription goes...
haywire. ;)Steven Soderbergh crafts his suspense from the very first frame with a
perfect start for the film. The plot then pulls us in and keeps us
guessing as the mystery slowly unfolds. The cast meshes wonderfully.
Jude Law delivers a strong lead as the frustrated psychiatrist and
Rooney Mara is mysterious and unpredictable. My only complaint is the
performances were not as dramatic as they could have been. Mara was
excellent at portraying her character's cold and lifeless depression,
but I have seen what she is really capable of (Fincher's "The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo"), and she could have definitely reached those
heights with this type of character. Nonetheless, a fine set of
performances all around, but they take a back seat to the intoxicating
narrative.So is Side Effects Soderbergh's last hurrah? I certainly hope not, as
it's probably my favorite film of his. I do wish Soderbergh got more
range out of Mara, but the result is a satisfying and expertly-woven
psychological drama packed with twists and turns.
