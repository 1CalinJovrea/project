Pretentious

I went to the film mainly for Kristin Scott Thomas, as in the trailer I
got excited by seeing her transforming into a villain.She was still great in OGF. She might be the only good thing.My first opinion about the film is that, it is so obsessed about
aesthetic that they didn't care there was no meaningful script.
Pretentious written all over it.It is as if Ryan Gosling just came from his home with the same outfits,
same hairstyle he has in his everyday life and giving the same looks
over and over again in nearly most of his films. Its like a staring
contest with Ryan Gosling. He is not mysterious. He is not meaningful.
Its not that he expresses so many emotions with his eyes. And what can
he express with such a rootless character.No dialogue written. Thats OK. Thats a choice. Not every film needs to
be filled with non-stop smart lines. But what counts is what is written
as dialogue. Here it fails big time. I read in some reviews that they
say film is slow. I'm OK with a film being slow but if a man walks half
his speed just to look cool or moves half his speed just to look
mysterious it looks silly and boring. Police singing, doing karaoke in
the bar, the prostitute just being there looking pretty and in pain,
all the wallpapers etc. they all irritated me as its so "look at me i'm
so cool and enigmatic wow". Its hard to pull that off. Takashi Miike,
David Lynch they can pull that off.As a fan of Asian films, this seemed a like a 4 year old little boy who
wants to be like his 25 year old cool uncle. A long way to go. Its just
sad that so many films that are actually similar to this "wannabe
film"'s story exist. But they don't have big names like Ryan Gosling in
it. So no one is even aware of those.Being a good director should mean combining aesthetics and good story. Kristin Scott Thomas is great to watch and if you like gore there are
some scenes you would enjoy but other than that...What a waste.
