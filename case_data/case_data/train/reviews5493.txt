A big Waste of time and money for backers and customers

How can a film this bad costing $100M get past any adult review
process. It seemed like Scorcese and DiCaprio made it for their own
egos -- big budget/Gatsby-level theatrics and face-time respectively.
DiCaprio does a good job in the role but we all (age range 25 to 65)
kept waiting for the movie to come to the point. Hours of redundancy of
plot and gratuitous over use of swearing and sex scenes the message and
context could have been delivered with about sixty percent less: we
kept waiting for a fatal drug overdose to change the direction of the
plot and give it some purpose . . We almost walked out a couple of
times but did not and waited for the plot to come to a point. We didn't
and suffered the full three hours.
