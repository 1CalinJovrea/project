As An Adult I Was Absolutely Entertained.

The plot follows 2 imaginative elementary school prankster students,
George Beard and Harold Hutchins (Hart, Middleditch) who hypnotize
their mean-spirited principal, Mr. Krupp (Helms), into thinking he is
Captain Underpants, a hero in comic books George and Harold write
together. It is absolutely entertaining for adults and enchanting for all
children who are looking for comedy and entertainment.Captain Underpants is DreamWorks' computer-animated feature film and
that is why it will be number 1 in most countries of the world.
