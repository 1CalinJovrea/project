Very Scary First Half and then Annabelle Goes Downhill...

The first half of the movie was very tense and scary, would have given
me the jumps if I had not held onto my seat edges. But post interval, I
felt a little disinterested and even amused than scary. The scenes
towards the end especially can confuse those who have no initiation to
the earlier Annabelle releases. Even if I were to leave that aside,
most of the post interval scenes disappointed me. Why few of the
characters get injured, killed or attacked couldn't make sense to me -
the script does a weak job there. The performances are all good
especially child actor Talitha Eliana Bateman. I felt her and Lulu
Wilson(as her best friend Linda) were like pillars who held the movie
together or I'd have probably given it lesser stars. Miranda Otto was
almost wasted here, found it difficult to believe it was the same lady
who got such a good role and shone in the Lord of the Rings. Pros:
Frights in the first half, the actors.. Cons: Post interval action that
kinda seeks to scare viewers just for the sake of it than make actual
sense.
