A beautiful, intelligent, thought-provoking film

A hidden gem and easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long
time. The acting, writing and directing are all seamless.I admit there were moments, such as when our poor protagonist reacts to
the truth about his girlfriend, which stretched the bounds of
plausibility, but aside from those few scenes the film was incredibly
real and fresh throughout.The film's brand of dry, intelligent humor was a lovely surprise. I
buckled in for a thriller and found myself laughing many times instead.
I also highly commend the snippets of philosophy, morality, mortality,
religion and science which were sprinkled throughout the film and
delivered with just the right amount of wit and depth by both actors. It really is a wonderful blend of romance and sci-fi, and this is
coming from someone who loves sci-fi and has a pathological fear of
chick flicks. I highly recommend it.
