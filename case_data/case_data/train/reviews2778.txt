World travel with James Bond

This is the first James Bond film I have seen with Craig in it. I liked
some of the old classics, but did not think that Bond brand should
continue forever. I saw this one because I read somewhere that there
was some spectacular scenes from a "Day of the dead"parade in Mexico in
it. And I was not disappointed, just these scenes alone were worth the
price of admission for me. I have to admit that I hate to watch
violence, so I spent quite some time in the movie not watching. But I
also laughed on several occasions, some of the Bond brand is so retro
and it took me back a few decades. I enjoyed the trip around the world
and was entertained, but for the fight scenes. Obviously they cannot
come up with new ideas to improve the Aston Martin, so this time the
car was mainly good for a long and sometimes spectacular chase.
Spectacular were also the helicopter stunts. I like Craig, but in my
mind Sean Connery will always be 007.
