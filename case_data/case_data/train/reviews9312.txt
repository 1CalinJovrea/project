Tedious and unfunny

I have occasionally laughed out loud while my sons, ages 15 and 9,
watch Family Guy, so I don't hate Seth MacFarlane.But I fantasized often during this tiresome film about leaving early
and letting my giggling kids get home on their own. (They found it
"awesome.")"Ted" does have a few funny bits. It's not a bad idea to imagine a
kid's teddy bear that ages along with him -- into the raunchiest
version of a case of arrested development imaginable. The scenes with
the supermarket manager are pretty entertaining, and I found Wahlberg's
off-key serenade to Kunis amusing. However, 98 percent of the time I was squirming unpleasantly. Jewish
jokes? How terribly fresh and original. Fart gags? That's creative.
Scenes of guys getting crazy-drunk, knocking things over, and trashing
rooms? My sides were splitting. And it got better from there (i.e.,
poop on the floor). The storyline involving Wahlberg and Kunis was strictly a retread. I
tired of their petty spats and could not care less whether they stayed
together or split. The father-and-son subplot seemed like something I'd
seen before. I know this movie wasn't geared toward 56-year-old moms. However, I did
expect a script from the originator of Family Guy to be significantly
more clever and fun. I know many will disagree with me, but this movie reeked.
