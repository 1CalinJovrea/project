A low-budget gem

The opening shot of 'The Survivalist' cleverly sets the situation in
which the film is set: the camera follows two lines on a graph, one
showing oil production, the other world population. While the oil one
starts to reduce, the population one continues its dizzying climb
(appropriately, the film is set in Ireland, home of the European
Union's highest birth rate!) until suddenly plummeting. Thus the scene
is set.An unnamed man (Martin McCann) lives in a forest, protecting his
vegetable garden from occasional marauders with his rifle, his knife,
and his totally naff haircut. This hand-to-mouth existence is disrupted
one morning when a mother and daughter appear, seeking to barter the
sexual favours of the daughter (Mia Goth) for food. The two women stay
and, although suspicious, the man gradually, slightly, lets down his
guard - but are the women as innocent as they appear?Essentially a three-hander, at first glance this could make a good
play, although live audiences might find their attention wandering
during the long periods where nobody speaks as they tramp through the
forest, do gardening, or irrigate the crops by urinating on them. But
on film these sequences have a quiet beauty (well, not the urination)
and, crucially, writer/director Stephen Fingleton - who has won several
awards for this work - doesn't over-play them, or drag them out -
something of which certain other directors of far more experience would
be guilty.The acting is good, with all three leads providing low-key but
believable - as far as the circumstances allow - performances. Olwen
Fouéré is especially noteworthy as the older woman seeking to
manipulate things in order to survive, and McCann provides some good
facial expressions that well convey emotions that would otherwise
remain unexpressed, such is the monosyllabic speech of his character.Combining human interest with tension and threat, this is a low-budget
gem that is well worth seeing if you get the chance.
