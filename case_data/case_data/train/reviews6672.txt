Someone Had Bills To Pay

I was looking forward to seeing this movie with it's great line up of
actors. I had no expectations and therefore was a blank canvas. This
movie SUCKED and was not funny at all. This movie was a transparent,
trite and ineffective attempt at placing good actors in a vehicle to
sell. This entire movie was cringe-worthy from the line delivery to the
sh*tty plot devices. Booo. I have nothing else to say but I'm being
told that my review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length
for reviews is 10 lines of text. Please see the guidelines. Attempts to
