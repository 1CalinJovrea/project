A good movie

I enjoyed everything about the movie. Music, faces, ages and nuances.
This might be for people of a certain age but it is a gentle and kind
story with a lot of beauty. I am sorry for those who cannot appreciate
these things. And I am a Colorado traveler so I appreciated the scenery
as well. I have a deep respect for both Robert Redford and Jane Fonda.
Both are richly talented actors. This movie resonates with the
understanding of deep friendship and that is something that will never
get old... I wish there were more movies like this to watch.
