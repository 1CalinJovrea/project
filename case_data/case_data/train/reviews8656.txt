Absolutely brilliant!

Such a brilliant film! For me it has done Irvine Welsh's novel proud
showing the many depths of emotions through all character profiles and
presented with interesting and artistic filmography.It has some very disturbing moments which are repeated throughout the
film and although they have the tendency to make you jump, it is mainly
out of empathy for the main character, which is a bizarre feeling as
this is a character who should be disliked and seen as the bad guy. I
think that this is one of the reasons this film has been so well
executed. The way the one character has so many different sides but as
the film goes on, it become much clearer how they all piece together to
form this one emotionally ripped apart man.If you liked Trainspotting (yes this has probably been said so many
times but it really is true) you really will love this too. In fact I
think it could possibly top Trainspotting. It's taboo, shocking,
psychologically unnerving but so worth watching!
