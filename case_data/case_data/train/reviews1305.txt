Wonderful imagery. style and atmosphere in the extreme. great acting.
Beauty in many forms: you get a lot for your eyes. Also, depending on
your taste in music, there is also a lot for your ears.For your brain, sadly, not as much."Only lovers left alive" is filled with a lot of name-dropping, by
word, picture and sometimes sound. Whether you find that fascinating or
pretentious depends on your taste.But what this movie really lacks is a story. The characters are
throughout and the dialogue may be scarce, but has some dry humour and
snappy lines. That doesn't save it from going nowhere. Glaring plot
holes may make you cringe at times. And the pacing looks like Jarmush
tried to surpass Kaurism√§ki in terms of slowness. If so, he won.So perhaps this movie is best tasted in the state its protagonists
enter after relishing an excellent glass of blood: dazed, blissful, and
somewhat drugged.
