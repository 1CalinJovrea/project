Terrible

I saw this movie as a new release a few days ago. It was one of only
two movies available in the small town where I was.I have to say that I found it truly awful in almost every respect. It
had clearly cost a bit of money to make, and it does use some quite
fancy computer-produced action graphics, but this doesn't compensate
for a boring and badly told story-line - with some of the most pathetic
dialogue you are ever likely to hear. To make matters worse, none other
than David Beckham manages to show up (as himself it seems) somewhere
in the middle to spout some garbage. Even those who can claim to have
some acting credentials fail to make their words worth listening to.The movie already seems to have several positive reviews here Â– but I
can only assume that these must come from the ultra-geek community,
rather than from your average punter who fancies an entertaining night
at the movies. A lesson learned the hard way, and a waste of time and
money.
