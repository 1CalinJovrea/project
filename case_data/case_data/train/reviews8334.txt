Tension, tension, tension!

After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and-
coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully
realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was
glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was
pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and
qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time
not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass
audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and
booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but
the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew
Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great,
which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson
the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts,
Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for
mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental
exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the
sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in
music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next "Yardbird" Charlie Parker
that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job
in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts
are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of "Whiplash" and look out for
Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his
own words: "What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days".It must have
been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons
completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most
diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a
massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific
audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with "Whiplash" - a
precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and
above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often
represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I
am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10
