I heard that one before

Let me preface this by saying I love Vince Vaughn. Its impossible for
me to watch any of his comedies without laughing, and I think he's
nothing short of a brilliant comic actor. That's why it pains me to
write this review.This movie has funny parts. Nothing that will make you lose control of
your bladder, and despite what some people have been writing, this
AIN'T no Wedding Crashers. This movie is more like an e mail you got 4
years ago that was hilarious, and someone sent it to you again. You
forgot about it, opened it, and remembered how funny it was, but no
joke is as funny the second time around. Big lack of originality here
and Will Ferrel's character was not remotely funny. Unlike Wedding
Crashers "Chaz" this character was more like the Starsky and Hutch
cameo. Wasn't impressed with that, wasn't impressed with this.When you get the same group of actors together for ANOTHER comedy, you
better have some seriously different writing. This movie badly needs
some situational / physical comedy. Charles Xavier and the antagonist
punching people is weak and lazy writing.There was one Mr. Bean quality situational comic scene in the movie
that was brilliant featuring one of the supporting interns at a strip
club, and you'll instantly recognize it when you see it. Other than
that it relies heavily on jokes in dialog - which aren't bad. They are
witty, and Vaugh's delivery is great. It's just that I feel like I've
been there and done that. Wilson's love interest felt totally scripted
to me - I'm not buying any of that, not for a dime. Waaay too rushed
into instant love - kind of like, but even worse than, Wedding
Crashers.If you choose to see this in the theater, go to a matin√©e. It isn't
worth full price. I'd definitely watch it once it hits RedBox or
Netflix. Well worth a couple bucks - $30+ at a theater, not so much.
