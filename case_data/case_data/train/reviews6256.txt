Annabelle the doll is scary. This movie is not.

About a minute into this film I squealed out of fear when they put the
Annabelle doll into frame. I have a genuine fear of dolls like this.
They freak me out. Therefore I was excited about this movie - I
sincerely thought that there would finally be another movie out there
that would manage to scare me (I have 3 in total so far). Sadly this is
not the case. The movie was boring and predictable. The worst thing was
that they have this terrifying creature-object-thing to make good use
of and they failed miserably at using it. I'm genuinely disappointed at
the reuse of the same old washed up horror storyline. How'd this script
even get approved??! booo! I wish I wrote it so they could actually see
what fear of a doll is haha.
