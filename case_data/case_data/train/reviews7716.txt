Please watch the Argentine/Spanish original

The original, "El secreto de sus ojos" is a masterpiece of cinema and
story. Not just the premise but you get to see the justice system of
Argentina and Spain. It's pretty interesting since we are saturated
with the American justice system.Very much unlike the US and similar to
France (Engrenages is a great French police procedural TV series).
People either cannot or will not watch foreign cinema or have
difficulty with subtitles. I understand that it is a challenge in that
your eyes are diverted from the screen, the cultures are unfamiliar or
the intonation can be confusing. Cinema and literature is escapism.
Step outside of the box. I'm hearing impaired and use subs for all TV
programs. I acknowledge that it's easier for me. Hollywood ruins
spectacular foreign films. If American audiences want to see less
engaging movies, there are films for that. And that's fine. We call
them "guilty pleasures" or "no brainers."
