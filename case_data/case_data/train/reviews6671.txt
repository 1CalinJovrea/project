Seriously NOT 21 JUMP STREET

I watched the REAL 21 Jump Street and this is no where close to being
called the same thing. 21 Jump Street was clean for teenagers to watch.
It gave good advice to kids. It brought up subjects that kids dealt
with. They did blow up cars or destroy a city. This should not have
been called 21 Jump Street. Another thing mostly everyone in the REAL
21 Jump Street looked sexy and young. Neither the two guys in this show
even looked their age. They both looked fat, ugly, annoying and
pathetic. Also Hanson and Duggy would not have been killed at the end
of the movie. They wouldn't have been that pathetic to look away while
apprehending criminals. I think if someone stupid says this is good
they need to go back and watch the REAL 21 Jump Street then can talk.
Hanson and Duggy brought down kids in school with class and dignity not
destruction and degrading ways. Why must they say the F word thru the
entire movie, every second. I mean come on. This could have been a
better movie if they had actually watched 21 Jumpstreet. Also those
kids they had in school does not fit how kids are now. Kids are not
into the tree hugging crap or two straps. Nah I'm sorry this movie was
a HUGE disappointment to society. Don't WATCH
