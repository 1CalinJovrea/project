Worst movie ever

One of THE MOST sexist and problematic movies I have ever seen in my
life. It wasn't funny, it was purely idiotic.First of all, John is a total loser who is completely irresponsible and
his girlfriend, Lori, ends up being treated like she's some sort of
award to be won or lost. Lori's also completely shallow and only seems
to like him because of his looks, which frankly... is all that he
really has going for him I suppose. Ted's completely sexist,
homophobic, fat-shaming, and immature.Then there's Rex who treats Lori like a fetish. There's seriously not a
single good role model or decent person in the entire movie. It's
simply one stereotype built upon another. I am deeply ashamed in
society for allowing such a movie to gain so much popularity when it's
the abyss of everything that's wrong in the world. It reeks of
privilege.
