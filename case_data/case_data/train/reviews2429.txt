Movies staring women are not promoted

This is the first big movie about lobbiests I've come across. Jessica
Chastain plays a tough part but unfortunately her personality isn't
examined in depth during the 2 hours. The film explores the ways men
are treated differently from women. For example she hires a male escort
and while men would overlook this in a male lobbyist ('cos it would be
far from the worst thing they do), for a woman it would end her
socially. The escort is the perfect combination of sleazy and possibly
entertaining.I don't imagine the notion that background checks before the purchase
of a firearm is a seriously debatable point and so the film doesn't get
into some pointless debate. Perhaps the proposed 'Registry of Muslims'
is to allow crazy WASP's buy a surface to air missile but prevent sane
Muslims from buying a 22.This movie was under promoted, like most films staring women. If you
look at the posters for 'Arrival' you'll see that the female star got
the same billing as her male co-stars who have a fraction of the lines.This was a movie about a strong woman, not unwilling to be disliked by
men. Its funny at the start when the NRA man who thinks women are best
spending time in the kitchen, is nervous about meeting her. He doesn't
know if he should shake hands with a woman in the business world.Political movies where good triumphs (such as 'The Ides of March')
didn't don't get much support despite the great cast and script.
Instead tragic films like the new 'King Kong' or the recently lame
'Jurassic Park'offering are the only things in the cinema.My totally biased opinion is that some stupid men (like the committee
Ms Chastain refers to) make choices about movies. They make
testosterone fueled choices and go for expensive pointless non- scripts
like 'Gods of Egypt' instead of low budget films that have a genuine
script.Obviously - I'm with Her!
