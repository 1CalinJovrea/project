A disgrace to the original Cars

I am a huge cars fan, I absolutely loved the first movie, the second
movie was still really good, but the first was a classic. This movie was an absolute disgrace to the first two. The writers were
different and they absolutely destroyed the atmosphere of cars. They
brought in way to millennialist stereotypes and decimated the standard
set by the first two movies. Things were misquoted from the first movie
and characters were poorly developed. Don't waste your time or money.
