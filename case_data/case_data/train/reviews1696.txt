Powerhouse of a Film

Following 2007's found footage film 'Cloverfield', 10 Cloverfield Lane
is produced from the same womb as its predecessor - but is in no way
part of the same breed. Most production companies operate under the
false ideology that 'bigger is better', however in this instance
Paramount Pictures has opted for a smaller scale production  and it is
a sensational affair.Vastly superior to its aforementioned predecessor, 10 Cloverfield lane
bears little to no resemblance of its half-brother  and this works to
its advantage in more ways than one. Firstly, the frantic and scatter
shot 'hand-held' found footage technique of the first installment is
ditched for more precise and intimate tripod filmed scenes. This makes
the film vastly more interesting and more engaging than the chaotic
shaky cam that plagued Colverfield. It is almost a breath of fresh air
to see a movie that is so thoughtfully filmed. Furthermore, 10 Cloverfield Lane a story that is entirely compelling
for the entirety of its runtime  at no stage does it slow down or
become uninteresting, and at no stage are there any predictable
moments. The dialogue is nothing short of brilliant and keeps you on
edge from start to finish, also due to fantastic execution from its
cast.The true star of the film however  is John Goodman. In what may just
be one of his finest performances in more recent years, Goodman keeps
the audiences eyes glued to the screen and keeps you entirely engaged
throughout. Cloverfield's acting wasn't at all that great  it was
rather average in all honesty  but this film brings something else.
Goodman puts on an absolute powerhouse of a performance, and the rest
of the cast are brilliant strong as well.Ultimately, Bolstered by an intriguing premise, brilliant performances
and ever changing storyline, 10 Cloverfield Lane never becomes boring
and never fails to intrigue, and is arguably one of the best Sci-Fi
films of the last few years.
