The worst movie we've ever seen

Our family has seen all of the Vacation movies and were eagerly looking
forward to this one. We were incredibly disappointed at how unfunny
this movie was. We don't mind swearing as long as it's funny, but much
of the swearing in this film added nothing. We also couldn't believe
that Kevin putting plastic bags over a person's head (a well-known
method of suicide) constitutes humour? Similarly, seeing someone commit
suicide and actually seeing their head hit a rock was distinctly
unfunny. We could go on but there are just too many examples to pick
from. Even the final scenes at WalleyWorld (a real highlight from the
original film) couldn't save this one. From now on, we will just watch
the DVDs of the originals which were genuinely funny. It's hard to
imagine why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo agreed to appear in this
one. Randy Quaid was lucky to dodge this bullet. No wonder it didn't
have the "National Lampoons" logo!
