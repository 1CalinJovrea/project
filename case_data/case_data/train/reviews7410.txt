A wonderful story

I was expecting the usual American love story, but that's not what this
is. I have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing this
film. That said, I usually don't go to see films like this.What a wonderful movie! The acting was so well done. My heart broke
where it needed to break, and it laughed where it needed to laugh. For those who need help working on their empathy, or the opening of the
mind, this is a very good movie to see!It's very thought provoking and I would even suggest to professors
(philosophy,english,cultural perspectives in science, sociology) that
they have their students write a paper on this. There are so many
issues involved here. Great for discussion!
