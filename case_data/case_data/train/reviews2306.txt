Great Power, No Responsibility

Chronicle is not really a superhero movie. It uses its themes but none
of the characters are using their powers for virtues and justice. It's
all fun and games until they get into trouble. It's a great idea but it
could have been filmed in a regular filmmaking style. The hand-held
camera fails to make the film credible. Despite from that, the film
tells a great story with a great twist. The actors are fun. The CGI is
good enough. The film is short and small but it's undeniably exciting
and really compelling than any other big blockbuster films we usually
get.Chronicle abandons the clich√©s of superhero films. Usually, when they
discovered their powers, they use it to save someone and make their own
costume and save the day. The movie asks, what will happen if teenagers
in real life have superpowers? In this film, the kids are just
recording themselves having fun with their powers. And one of them will
use it more for revenge than saving the day. It's a clever idea.It could have been filmed in a regular movie camera. The found-footage
style is pretty unnecessary. The film doesn't need that to look
credible. Also, there are too many random cameras and angles which is
kind of awkward. Though, the shot was pretty good. But it's still
unnecessary. The CGI works better in large objects. It looks dated when
comes to the small ones like the spider and the legos. Dane DeHaan,
Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan are all fun together. It gets
better in the third act. Dane DeHaan gives a great rage to Andrew. The
climax is awesomely fun.Chronicle may be short and small but it feels long and bigger. If only
the film was shot in a regular style. But it still makes a great movie.
The concept is great. It's fun, intense, and compelling enough to enjoy
it in the big screen.
