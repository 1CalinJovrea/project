Should I be ashamed for LOVING THIS!

I am a massive Terminator 1 and 2 fan, I disliked 3 and 4 a lot and I
really thought this would be terrible as well! However I turned out to be wrong! Dead Wrong! This film has the best Arnold character of them all! He is the most
'human' towards Sarah and I really loved that connection, I can see
many people liking it also. It was reminiscent of John Connor and
Arnold from T2 which I just saw today... I remember seeing the first
trailer and having many problems. I thought the story line was too
complicated and wasn't respectful of the older films and I thought the
visuals were bad. I was wrong in both cases. The story pays massive respect to James
Camerons first two classics! And it wasn't complicated for me. It was a
fun story and kept my eyes on the screen. Also the visuals... wow the
visuals... I know people said that we will never be shocked again by
visuals like we were in T2 and the first Jurassic Park! But the young
T800 looks too good to ignore. Wow! The best animation I've ever seen,
I can't see the difference between him and the real one. This is a fun, humorous, emotional action flick that shouldn't be
ignored! I loved it! And you know what, I'm not ashamed! Alan Taylor
deserves praise! P.S. I love the soundtrack, I hand it to Lorne Balfe who I know makes
great soundtracks from Assassins creed!
