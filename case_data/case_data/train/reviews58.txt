Deeply moving, arousing, heartbreaking

*****This review may contain spoilers!!!!*****I have just finished reading the book. It is deeply moving. I am still
in a daze. Heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. The film
adaptation is erotic, cinematic, well acted, and painfully beautiful,
as Luca Guadagnino's other film, I Am Love (starring the luminous Tilda
Swinton). What makes the theme universal? To my eyes, it has to do with the
complex issue of love and loss. The film and the book deal with
love/loss not in the simple sense of losing the person we love, but in
the sense of deliberately losing the person we love so we can sustain
loving and desiring the person. "I can't love you unless I give you up"
could be the line (not from the book or film) that captures the
relation between Elio and Oliver. Both Elio and Oliver maintain the minimal distance between them instead
of fully committing to their desire 'til the end. Which makes their
love the sad kind. As Elio said, "Time makes us sentimental." The right
time never arrives for Elio and Oliver. They relate to each other from
the lenses of the past ("pluperfect" love, to borrow Elio's wording)
and the future. It is never now. The thematic is appealing because it
speaks to many of us who have loved and continue to love on the basis
of the fundamental loss at the heart of desire. Is there a way out of
this spiral? Is there another way of approaching love? These are
questions the book and the movie leave the reader/viewer to answer. The
ending is unhappy yet "satisfying", precisely because this satisfaction
involves a mix of hope and agony. It keeps the movement of desire in
motion, for both Elio and Oliver, and for the reader/viewer. PS: I can't help but reflect on this great film vis-Ã -vis Guadagnino's
another great film, I Am Love, where the two protagonists literally
leave their respective worlds behind to be in a world that they both
share.
