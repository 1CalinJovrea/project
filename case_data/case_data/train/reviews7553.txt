10
Absolutely loved every moment

I have seen this animated film a number of times now, and have not
grown to become sick of it. I love the plot, the characters (especially
my favorite, GoGo) and am so thrilled that this film won an Oscar for
Best Animated Film 2015. The only downside is that my favorite male
character, Tadashi, dies, but I understand why the writers included
this in the plot, for it had a huge impact on the film and brought
great reflection to - especially - Hiro Hamada. The idea that the
overall 'hero' is a non-threatening vinyl 'marshmallow' brings further
interest to the film, for he ends up saving just about all of the
protagonists lives, not to mention he is a very appropriate character
for all audiences, as well is the film entirely. All in all, I rated
this film 10 out of 10 stars for its excellence, in my opinion, and
look forward to any future works that will come out of this film!
