Reality does not bite

Sometimes you're in the mood for a gentle, character drama with a
simple premise. This is that kind of movie. A writer trying to manage
two teenage, aspiring writers who are themselves wrestling with the
breakup of their parents marriage. So, there we have it. Sounds like it could be good if written well with
some conflict and some emotional draw. Unfortunately this movie is
rubbish.We have Bill (Greg Kinnear) idly hanging out in his $15m dollar
beach-front show home, overlooking the sea as his two good looking and
talented children get published via nepotism and back channels.
Occasionally his beautiful neighbor jogs round and has no strings sex
with him as well as giving relationship and fashion advice. Bill,
however, is holding a flame for his (obviously) beautiful ex
wife(Jennifer Connelly) and cannot move on. Boo hoo. Really, I cannot think of a film where I felt so little for the
characters. The only character with any bite is Lou (Logan Lerman) who
has something about him...but the rest of the cast act about as well I
could. Connelly has about as much screen presence as a bucket of paint
and Kinnear appears like he is waiting for a part on Grey's Anatomy. I
just ended the film thinking: this is going straight to daytime TV as a
film to pad out the schedule between cheap cooking shows and Storage
Wars.Avoid.
