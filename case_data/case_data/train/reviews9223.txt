Awful movie

What a huge disappointment. I waited since summer for this movie. I am
a huge Pride & Prejudice lover. The movie was dull, boring, incredibly
distant from the passion of Anna and her lover. Aaron Johnson looked
gay. Matthew MacFadyen was ridiculously frivolous and poor Mr. Gleeson
was entirely out of place, out of his element and had less sex appeal
than a rodent. Insufficient development of Anna's marriage. She just
cried throughout. Using a stage as a prop was also ridiculous! Really?
A stage? How boring. I nodded half way through and only stayed til the
end out of stubborness. What a disappointment. Joe Wright had an
opportunity to take us on a Russian voyage and he blew it! I'm still
hopping mad.
