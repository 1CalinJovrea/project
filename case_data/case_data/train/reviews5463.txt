Dumb and Dumber do The Interview

For the sake of film criticism, I will pretend that I watched the film
without the political maelstrom that has raised it to a level of
interest that it would otherwise never have attained.This is the typical mass produced, lowbrow, comedy that Hollywood
cranks out to appeal to 15-year-old boys. There are a few slapstick
laughs in the tradition of the Three Stooges that break the monotony. I
would not elevate the film to the level of a satire as that would imply
that there was some intelligent thought behind it. There is not. All
the humor, both physical and verbal, is completely obvious. It will not
go down in history as one of the great comedies, which is probably what
upset Kim Jung Un the most.The attempts to make political observations are all based on time-worn
points (people are starving, Kim is not a god). The sections that imply
Kim has psychological problems may be more irritating to the regime.
Most of the attempted humor deals with Kim fighting his homophobia and
dealing with a father who gave him little support.There is no need to comment on the acting as there really is none. No
one will win an Oscar nomination here. The story is predictable: You
can guess what will happen before you begin watching it. It's the kind
of film you watch to see a few gags and, maybe, get a few laughs. They
will be very few, indeed, unless you are 15 or under. However, knowing
the media attention that this film has received, it is unlikely a poor
review will stop anyone from watching it. Just remember, I warned you.
