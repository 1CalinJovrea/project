OMG what a howler!

If you see good reviews here be deeply suspicious of the posters. This
film is a turkey, not just a turkey but a howling at the moon on your
lawn raving mad loony turkey.Where to start with this travesty? First off the premise. Ex smugglers
brother in law throws drugs over board during customs bust. OK.
Happens. But what follows is laughable. He lost $700k but the dealer he
lost it for lives in a yucky condo. ??? Huh? (he was getting it for
someone else it later turns out but who'd trust this cheap bozo with
that money?)OK so the hassle is on our hero to save the day. So he goes 'tough guy'
on the dealer but then still has to do job. Huh? Look if you can beat
the bad guy up, stick a gun in his mouth why do you still have to do
the job?Its all down hill from here. Cheesy predictable action, a mass shoot
out that no one could escape from and doesn't except our hero, sigh.
Really this is just a mess. I hope you see this before the download or
heaven forbid buy a ticket at some lonely B movie theater or DVD
purchase. Demi Moore couldn't make worse starring Madonna.
