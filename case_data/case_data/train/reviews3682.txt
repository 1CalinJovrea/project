A very refreshing Indie Drama!

Before We Go follows Brooke who misses the train from New York to
Boston and a street musician decides to spend the night trying to help
her make it back home before her husband does. Throughout the night
they learn a lot about one another and eventually find a romance in
this nighttime sojourn through New York City.Chris Evans really took his directional debut by storm with this sharp
witted Rom-Com with some really glamorous shots of New York and a very
smart script. Chris Evans and Alice Eve were one dynamic pair in this,
starting off as strangers, their connection really started to up the
ante from every piece of detail they give about one another through
this one night.Evans and Eve both pursue a strong chemistry with one another even from
the ups and downs they have. One thing I'm glad this movie wasn't was
that it wasn't a sappy romance film with all the romantic tropes to it,
it was a very genuine film that knew where it was headed and what it
was going to do. The ending was very unexpected that I wasn't really
intending on seeing but I really should of contemplated it happening
from what this film proved to be, it really slapped a smile on my face.Chris Evans and Alice Eve, woah, they really proved they really have
colossal talent by the credible synergy they have with their
characters, they're so believable and you could just tell they were
having a blast with one another. Even though it does have some likeness
of Before Sunrise, I really think this film was just a tip of the hat
than morally just a rip off because it really knew what it was doing
with itself.Before We Go is one of the most remarkable Indie Romance films I've
seen In a while. With two astounding performances by its two leads,
this nocturnal walking and talking romance film with one bold script
and screenplay written by Oscar winning screenwriter Ronald Bass is
truly one of the best Indie films you'll see this year so far. BWG
really gives a sturdy setting, a smart, smart script, astonishing
performances and a genuine ending that fits so properly, I advise you
to give these two strangers a chance!
