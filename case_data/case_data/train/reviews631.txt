Not great, not horrible

Not a totally horrible movie, but not great. I can't say much more than
has already been said, but there were some errors the size of a Mack
truck in this movie that have not been pointed out.1. There is a storm severe enough to cause commercial airplanes to be
grounded, yet a small private plane can fly.2. Alex is getting married the next day, Ben is doing surgery the next
day, yet they are both across the country.3. Conveniently for the plot, the pilot doesn't file a flight plan.4. The plane crashes in the mountains, yet the passengers survive with
minor injuries. I'll forgive this one, only because without it, the
movie would be ten minutes long.5. The damsel in distress injures her leg, and conveniently, Ben is a
surgeon.6. They crash in the Rocky Mountains at an altitude that's above
timberline, at the end of December, without proper clothing and food,
and don't die of hypothermia.7. Alex tells Ben to use her camera with a telephoto lens to get a
close up view around them. It is a rangefinder camera, and thus the
viewfinder doesn't enlarge the view.8. Ben slides several hundred feet down a snow slope, and is stopped by
hitting a conveniently placed low rock ridge which stops him from going
over a cliff, yet doesn't break both his legs.9. Alex falls through ice into a stream, yet is not carried downstream
so that Ben can fish her out.10. They finally find a cabin, which was built and furnished (including
a piano) with no road near it.11. Ben steps in a bear trap. It's possible that a trapper neglected to
pick up the trap, but not likely. Bears are hibernating that time of
the year.On the plus side, there is adventure, romance, and some fantastic
scenery. And a dog that steals the show.
