Oliver Stone Served his Country

I have to save the 10/10 for those that deserve it and this one does. I saw this at the opening in Toronto and came into it with a critical
eye, having seen Citizen Four and having a good knowledge of the events
that unfolded throughout the story recounted in this film.Understandably, some weren't sure if all the shocking events in the
film actually happened in the manner they were portrayed, so it's
possible the public at large will never actually know just how accurate
and important this film is. It all happened. And more. A lot of content
didn't make it into the film but Stone's editing choices were sound.Oliver Stone's faithfulness to the facts is astounding. Nothing was
distorted or sacrificed for entertainment value. For a filmmaker to
show this constraint is rare because it puts at risk the approval of a
large portion of the audience. And it shows his true intent, even if
Stone claims he was not trying to inspire activism.Snowden Portrayal: Excellent acting, understated; that's Snowden.Greenwald Portrayal: Brilliant acting, and sometimes I got the eerie
feeling I was actually watching Greenwald, though the role was perhaps
a little too emotional at times when the real Greenwald would have kept
his composure. On Laura Poitras actually being in the film: It was justice that Stone
actually gave her character a role in the film, since Laura herself
never does, and she deserves credit for what she has done. She risked
her life many times over to bring us the facts in Citizen Four.Oliver Stone served his country in making this film and by doing
justice to the bravery of Snowden. Perhaps the world will be more
inclined to care about what is taking place right in front of us once
this film is available to all.
