Underrated movie. This is FANTASTIC

I'm very sad to see this movie was not appreciated as it should be.
People that rated this movie below 7 just don't have heart nor have
common sense, in other terms: HATERS.There is great effects, great fight scenes, outstanding actors and,
even not knowing the original, this was a good plot.
