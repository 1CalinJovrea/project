"Everything just works out the way it's gonna and we just plod along behind it"

{8.5 stars}ADORE could have turned out really cheesy, but the very real
characters, along with a nice blend of funny and sad moods, fitting
soundtrack, and pretty Australian beach scenery keep it from becoming
so. Fine performances by all the major players. Though more character
and conflict development may seem needed at first, we get to know
everyone and everything gradually, and the fact that they are all just
fairly "normal" (whatever that is) people is pivotal. Not the greatest
script, but it's nothing if not realistic.Regarding the plot: The way the improbable quadrangle develops is
pretty convincing. Even if what's happening in the premise is nothing
illegal, it's obviously weird if not downright perverse. Yet, I was
surprised to find myself rooting for both couples as ADORE proceeded,
wanting them all to be happy together. The way the two women bear a
superficial resemblance to each other, causing us to occasionally
forget who's whose mum and who's whose lover, is another interesting
effect. Finally, the isolated cove with its stationary sun-raft is an
apropos symbol.Though it's obviously not a "family film" or one for younger children,
there is no gore, serious nudity (just a couple of brief booty-shots of
Robin Wright and Xavier Samuel), or other flinchable elements (unless
you count the multiple unexplicit sex scenes).ADORE is one of the strongest, most satisfying films to come out in
recent years, and I enjoyed it immensely.
