Fresh and haunting

I have seen and loved Gomorrah and the Gomorrah series (season 2 is
coming this year in case you don't know, yeey), and went into seeing
this with high expectations. I was not disappointed. Somehow after 3
weeks I keep thinking back to it and searching for similar movies/TV
series. The main thing that detracts from the experience in my case is
a movie with unrealistic/unbelievable plot/actions, this one doesn't
have them imho so I was always focused on the action, not thinking
about "this isn't believable, nobody would do that". The soundtrack
definitely helps, I may be exaggerating but I put it up there with
Drive and The Guest, it adds a whole new dimension to otherwise just
above the average movies, making them great, making you want to watch
them again. That's something I can't say for a lot of movies I've seen.
So yeah, I think I'm gonna watch Suburra again tonight, enjoying it's
high action pace, realism, brutality and soundtrack.
