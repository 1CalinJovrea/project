I tried to see the Golden Globe but I couldn't

Well, what can I say? Joy is a plain, boring and uneventful movie
lacking great performances from Robert de Niro and Jennifer Lawrence
(of course I wasn't expecting much from Bradley Cooper). The plot could
have been interesting but the script completely ruined it I am not a
fan of David Russell bu he did a really really bad job with Joy: his
sequences don t make any sense, the narrator character choice is just
pointless and many scenes are really hard to believe in. During the
initial part of the movie, there were some funny bits which kept me
moderately entertained but, after those 30 minutes, it was just plain
boredom. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence won a Golden Globe for this is
just unbelievable and proves what we all already know and what Ricky
Gervais mentioned at the ceremony: all awards are bought by studios as
a marketing campaign. Well, they succeeded, because I spent the money
to see that, and I could not regret it more than I do.
