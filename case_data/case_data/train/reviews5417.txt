What did I just watch??

Seriously, what the .... did I just watch? I should have known Raw was
going to be bad simply because the critics loved it. IMDb used to be a
place to go to get the real scoop as to whether or not a film is decent
or not, but over the last year or two that has changed. This film was
beyond awful; no rhyme or reason for anything portrayed here - just
violence and gore for the shock value of the acts committed, I suppose.
Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever watched.
