Aca-mazing. Truly enjoyed Pitch Perfect.

I absolutely loved this movie. Saw an advanced screening and the entire
theater was laughing and clapping throughout the movie! Refreshing to
see a comedy and musical combo. A lot like Glee (minus the cheesy
factor) mixed with witty comedy like in Bridesmaids and other modern
popular comedies. Great casting! Any college girl is bound to love it.
This is a movie even my mom would enjoy. It held my interest throughout
and i think it was well produced. My boyfriend even enjoyed the comedy
aspect of it! A great girls night out movie choice or even a date night
movie. I feel like overall everybody loved it, I definitely did. I hope
this movie earns the recognition it deserves. Its going to be a hit
among young audiences like myself!
