Watch porn.

I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was
painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I
think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the
director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of
story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The
Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to
get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to
long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the
title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting
on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a
healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have
during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would
not recommend this to anyone.
