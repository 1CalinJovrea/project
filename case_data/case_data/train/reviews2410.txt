Undeniably the best super-hero movie

Each plot of the movie make us curious of what comes next. The direct
know how to manage every superheroes and villains in balance, all of
them has unique strange. We keep wondering how Iron Man look so cool
and why Captain America is a serious patriot. The effect and CGI are
also outstanding. And as usual, Marvel will give so many easter eggs
for geeks to find out. The success of this movie come up when Iron Man
franchise along with Captain America: the first avenger and Thor
released previous years. The Avenger can be main contender for best
superheroes movies against DC's Dark Knight Rise though I prefer Marvel
movies. I suggest all Marvel/superheroes movies lover to watch this
movie. period.
