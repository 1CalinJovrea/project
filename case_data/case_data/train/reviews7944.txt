Unbelievably Horrible!

Sandler...have you lost your mind! Two horrible films in a row:Jack and
Jill, and there triplet That's My Boy... the worst of them all. I am a
big Adam Sandler movie fan (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, ext.), and
putting a wig on Sandler and making him act drunk is just going to make
bumps in his career. The two directors must be very dumb because some
of the greatest actors (Adam Sandler, Andy Samburg, Katie Holmes, Al
Pacino.) have now become not as great. Making Al Pacino bad is the
worst thing you can ever do, and the director of Jack and
Jill...congratulations! You are the worst director on earth. I hated
the movie and had one only one laugh. I had more laughs watching Elmo.
Don't see the movie it's bad.
