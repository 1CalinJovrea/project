A great film

Lot's of people are disregarding this movie due to "Lack of plot" or
"Poor cinematography".This isn't supposed to be that sort of movie, it's a mockumentary, done
in the style of a documentary.They have nailed that look perfectly, and the plot doesn't matter in a
comedy.The comedy is great, the deadpan nature of it is hilarious, the jokes
are brilliant.Go in with the open mind that it's not your classic style of comedy.I think it's a great movie.
