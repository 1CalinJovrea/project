We all tend to create RUBY in our romantic relationships..

This movie is like Poetry . you can look for deeper meaning from it or
take it as it is and either way you wont be disappointed. I saw this movie in a different light and it touched me deep down to my
very core. When we fall in love..we initially take the person in as they are and
we do not try to change any bit of them. This is so evident at the
start when Ruby can do no wrong and Calvin thinks shes perfection..he
loves her mess and when his brother says he has created a "girl" not a
person he is trying to point out to him that no body is that perfect
and Ruby is a human being and she will disappoint him and make mistakes
every now and then. Calvin is selfish in his love for Ruby ..he just wants to fill all the
holes in his life that he had before she came regardless of what this
will do to her. I think that this is very common in every day romantic
relationships. We struggle with whether we really love someone or if we
are just using them to fill the gaps in our own lives. If you love
someone you realise that they are their own person and are entitled to
mistakes and you just have to love them no matter what. This is a beautiful movie and a breath of fresh air in the era where
romance is depicted in the most unrealistic ways on screen.
