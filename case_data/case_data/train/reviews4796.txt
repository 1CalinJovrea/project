Fun and silly.

I thought this light hearted silly film was fun in times that current
news leaves me stressed and sad. I would love to see a sequel that
includes all four players as operatives.... Hamm and Gadot are terrific
team as are Gallifinakis and Adams. And Adams great instincts for the
spy biz are terrific.
