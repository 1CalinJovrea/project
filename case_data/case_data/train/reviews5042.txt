What a Fantastic Movie!

Superb! I rarely get to go to a movie with my older son after his
siblings came along. We did manage to go to this movie in the cinemas.
Not only were we glad we chose this movie to watch, but two years
later, we still recall the impact this movie had on both of us. This science fiction story is deeply satisfying. The movie treats the
viewers as intelligent people. It is not in the same league of a
plethora of science fiction movies that hit the cinemas every year. For
example this year we have Independence Day 2, a high budget sequel to a
high budget b-movie from a long time ago. It is profoundly forgettable.
That is in stark contrast to Edge of Tomorrow, which has stayed with me
for so long and today motivated me to come here on IMDb to write a
review after two years!This movie is a must watch. Thanks for reading.
