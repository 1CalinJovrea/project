Entertaining Fantasy

In Ako, Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) and his samurai Ôishi (Hiroyuki Sanada)
are hunting in the forest and they find a half-breed boy. Lord Asano
brings him to Ako and the boy that is named Kai is raised with his
daughter Mika. Years later, Mika (Kô Shibasaki) and Kai (Keanu Reeves)
are secretly in love with each other. Lord Asano welcomes the Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and
the Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) at home. However, Kira's Witch (Rinko
Kikuchi) casts a spell on Lord Asano and he tries to kill Kira. The
Shogun sentences Lord Asano to death and offers the option of
committing Harakiri to die with honor. Ôishi and his samurais become
ronin and he is arrested in a hole; and Kai is sold as a slave in
another village. One year later, Ôishi is released from the
imprisonment and he plots a scheme to revenge Lord Asano with Kai and
the other ronin."47 Ronin" is an entertaining fantasy based on the classic Japanese
story. Despite the Western behaviors and feelings of the ronin and
Mika, the movie is not bad as indicated in many reviews. Actually I
have had a nice surprise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "47 Ronins" ("47 Ronin")
