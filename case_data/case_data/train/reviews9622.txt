Smell a rat?

In his previous film "Inglorious Basterds" Tarantino presents two
worthy scenes - the one with the Nazi officer in the French farmer's
house, and the one in the bar where the British and American spies are
in German uniforms talking to a suspicious SS German officer and a
shootout follows.In the first mentioned scene the Nazi officer explains how one has to
think like a rat in order to find "rats." The offensive reference is to
Jewish families trying to escape Nazi extermination (whom the Nazi
officer chases in the movie).In that scene the Nazi officer, maybe inadvertently, describes himself
as a rat, trying to play wise guy. So does Tarantino."Django" is actually proof that Tarantino is a talented Hollywood "rat"
that feeds on popular trends packaged in politically correct
radicalism. The mixture is gratuitous violence, popular concepts of
"just revenge" and butchering of history and the importance of
historical fact. Jews killing Nazis in "Inglorious..." Black man
killing whites in "Django..." Tarantino is a torture-porn specialist,
hiding behind badly disguised ridicule of the magnitude of human
suffering in historical dramas like the Holocaust or the issue of
slavery in America. One just has to remember his "Hostel" achievements
and it all comes home.The Tarantinonites can knock themselves out with Django - another
trashy movie with a spice of genius in it, to excite the perverted
tastes of Hollywood. Evil genius. That smells like a rat to me.
