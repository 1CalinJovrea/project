Excellent Animated Movie with Depth

Without spending too much time discussing the plot, this movie is
essentially a film about a misfit kid who ultimately must save the town
that has misunderstood and mistreated him for most of his life. Yes,
Norman sees dead people. However, everyone is aware of Norman's claim
of this power and they either ridicule him (other kids) or are ashamed
of his seemingly wild claim and erratic behaviour. Of course Norman's
extra-sensory powers will soon be required to rid the town of a curse.
The resulting events make for a great story and film.There are several themes in this film that were well developed and
ultimately resolved to my satisfaction. The animation is incredible,
and I loved the creative camera shots that the director(s) chose in
many scenes: much more advanced than the usual animated film. I took 2 children to see this movie, a 6-year old girl and a (near) 4
boy. The kids loved the comedic zombie scenes in particular and were
laughing out loud for much of it. They were frightened in other parts
but in a functional thematic way, not to the point of nightmares.
However I did note that some of the deeper themes went right over the
kids' heads, and while they weren't too bothered by this fact, I advise
that children over 8 might enjoy the film more fully.The climax of the film is beautifully animated, and very poignant. On
the whole a great film. I would state only that the humour surrounding
the zombies was hilarious for adults and children alike, and I would
have included more of it. Certainly this film is worth the admission. I
saw it in 3D, it wasn't mind-blowing 3D but it certainly gave the film
more texture.
