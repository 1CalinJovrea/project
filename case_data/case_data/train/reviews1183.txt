Cute and fun for younger audiences

It's refreshing to see a relatively non violent adventure fantasy
suitable for younger audiences again. Yet older audiences can enjoy it
too. I actually prefer the story to the Hunger Games stories with all
the killing. The effects and creatures are slightly fake and unreal looking but it
adds to the charm. Cute blending of mythology and the present story. Logan Lerman still looks young enough for the role but Alexandra
Daddario is looking a bit older.I remember enjoying the first one slightly more with the novelty of the
characters but this one is alright enough.
