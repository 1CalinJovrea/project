9
Held my breath till the credits rolled!

Rating a 9 because it cant be any less!! I remember watching the
trailer of the movie and I thought maybe its just the trailer thats
good, until....i Saw this movie today!!The actress who played the lead is so amazing as an actress and i hope
to see more of her in the future!! Unlike other movies from this genre,
it did not appear anything extra anywhere at all and felt more real. The serial killer as well was amazing played by the actor!I held on to my breath till the credits started rolling and I am still
in that mood of the film created by it.The lighting, the cinematography, the acting, direction is just so
right up to the mark! These kinda gems come only once in a while! I hope the team is reading
this review someday :)Guys you did an AMAZING job and this has been one of the most perfect
horror/thrillers I have recently watched! The kinda film that will
always be remembered once you watch it.
