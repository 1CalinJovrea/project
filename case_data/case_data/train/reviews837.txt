Decent but not one of the best MI movies

This is another decent addition to the Mission Impossible series but it
wasn't one of the best. It's missing the two most important
ingredients:1. Interesting characters, especially bad guys (think Vanessa Redgrave
in MI or Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI3). I hate to say it but Tom
Cruise is easily the best actor in Rogue Nation.2. Thrilling set-pieces (the break-in scene from MI, or the skyscraper
scene from Ghost Protocol). Rogue Nation's underwater security hack
just didn't quite cut it for me.Aside from that, it is a perfectly good spy/action flick. The fights
are good. Ethan Hunt and Lane (the bad guy) keep outwitting each other
in a pretty decent plot.But it didn't grip me like some of the other MI movies have.
