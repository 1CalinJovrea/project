If you were a fan of the first 3 Child's Play Movies

Then you will love this movie.I can't say I liked any of the later movies, but this one brought
something back that was missing.I personally enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would. I grew
up on Chucky and iv'e gotta say that It was nice to see Andy and some
of the others. (I don't want to spoil it).If I had a complaint about this movie it would be the ending wasn't
very satisfying. It hints towards another movie.
