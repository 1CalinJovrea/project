This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and
appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.In reality, this film made absolutely no sense whatsoever. A Batman
like character uses profanity as if it is going out of style and to
gain sympathy of the viewers, we are informed of his terminal cancer
diagnosis.What was this movie essentially about? Who was that old blind woman
carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor
in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he
didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a
life-time.
