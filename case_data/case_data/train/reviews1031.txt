8
Makes you watch 'til the end.

First of all, let me just say this is well made piece of gem. If you're
looking for a film that is "very in your face" this might not be the
film to like, but for others who has a very wide spectrum of
understanding when it comes to watching movies, maybe this is worth
your time. I've seen lots of movies like this that leaves the rest of
the interpretation to it's viewers. (My family hates me for making them
watch those) but I love movies that makes you think. A sequel would be
nice, but I think the ending is already perfect. It might have left you
hanging for a bit but still, you knew how everything will end. Gave it
an 8 due to the superb acting, amazing cinematography, the light
hearted beginning and the eeriness of the rest of the film.
