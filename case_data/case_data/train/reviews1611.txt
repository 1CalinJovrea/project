Wow

This is a movie that stays with you. It's a real movie about people,
and a place--not car chases and explosions. I don't agree with the
mixed reviews and complaints about the length of the movie. Matthew
McConnahey is well-cast. All of the actors do a good work; Reese
Witherspoon, Sam Sheppard. Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland do a great
job playing the child characters. The Mississippi river is like a
character in the movie, which evokes Huckleberry Finn, as others have
noted. The settings are magnificent. In a sea of manufactured movies,
it's nice to see something that was crafted by human beings. I would
recommend this movie to those who are interested.The audience in the theater I was in seemed absorbed.
