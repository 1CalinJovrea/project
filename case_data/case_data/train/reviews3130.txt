Exceptionally intense, and an absolute masterpiece of a thriller

This is a remarkably intense film, managing to create hypnotic thrills
and harrowing drama in such a small environment, thanks to incredibly
atmospheric directing from Mike Flanagan, a powerhouse performance from
Carla Gugino, and an absolutely enthralling story that almost never
puts a foot wrong, all of which comes together to make a spellbindingly
terrifying but utterly unforgettable watch.There's so much to praise about Gerald's Game, but I think what first
deserves praising is Mike Flanagan's directing. Survival thrillers are
notoriously difficult to get exactly right, but Flanagan does as good a
job as I've seen in any of the genre's most notable movies.Almost the entire film plays out watching Carla Gugino handcuffed to
the bed, but in that tiny physical environment, it's exceptional what
the film manages to achieve. Flanagan paces the story perfectly
throughout, allowing it to be an intense and physically exhausting
thriller as we see Gugino attempt to escape her predicament through an
achingly slow and frustrating process of trial and error and sheer
psychological exhaustion, and yet still keeps you on the edge of your
seat with every excruciating twist and turn that the story takes.What's more is that the film has a powerfully eerie feel to it that
really adds to its emotional impact. The film's setting at times feels
comparable to Hush, a home invasion thriller set in the woods (and also
directed by Flanagan), but what Gerald's Game does even better is
reinforce that sense of isolation through its deliberate lack of a
musical score, as well as the use of a pitch-perfect setting.The lack of music throughout is unnerving enough, particularly in the
film's early phase in which Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino have a
series of incredibly intimidating conversations, but the way that the
room in which the story plays out is set up is the icing on the cake.
Stuck in the middle of a big double bed, Gugino already appears even
smaller and less powerful, but it's the fact that the room feels so
barren and lifeless at times, with its secluded positioning in the
country house between the forest and the seafront, as well as the
ghostly flutter of the curtains by the open window over the course of
the whole story.All of that makes Gerald's Game a truly atmospheric watch, and plays a
significant role in the incredible emotional power of its story, which
is where the film manages to step up to the next level.This isn't just a survival thriller, nor is it just an eerie horror
movie, but it's a film with a really deep emotional and psychological
pulse, and one that will captivate you entirely from the word go.It's a very difficult film to talk about without any major spoilers, as
the main action gets going as quickly as 15 minutes in, however it
suffices to say that Stephen King's story features some truly thrilling
and unpredictable twists and turns, all of which allow the film to keep
breathing new life into itself despite the fact that it's physically
sitting still from start to finish.There are times when the film hearkens back to the intense horrors of
Misery, but to me there seems to be even more to it than that, often
delving into some incredibly deep and emotionally harrowing and
traumatic themes that will make you want to cover your eyes at times.
However, it's all written sublimely, and you definitely won't be able
to take your eyes off the screen, no matter how hard you try.Finally, we come to the real stand-out of the entire movie: Carla
Gugino. Her performance is as physically impressive as it is
emotionally exhilarating, as she excels in showing her character's
extreme exhaustion from being stuck completely alone in this awful
situation (something that's also helped by some really excellent make-
up work as well), but she also makes sure that the emotional drama
remains the central focus of the film by putting in a very distressed
and on-edge performance throughout.It's easy at times to get swept up in some of the more gruesome details
of the plot, but thanks to Gugino's captivating performance, the main
character's emotions relating to both her current predicament and her
past emotional trauma, both of which play vital roles in the story, is
at the very centre of your focus, and allows you to fall ever deeper
into the some of the horrors at play in this spellbinding story.On the whole, I was absolutely blown away by Gerald's Game. If I were
to have one complaint, I'd say that the very last ten minutes or so
aren't quite the ending that the film deserves, but regardless, it's
still an exceptional film, featuring some of the most intense and
nail-biting thrills you'll ever see come out of just one room, as well
as powerfully atmospheric directing and an incredible lead performance.
It's not an easy watch by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a
film that will grab you immediately and not let you go until the very
end.
