Mind blowing realism , tense , powerful, amazing performances , just brilliant .

Just watched Mark O'Connor and John Connors masterpiece Cardboard
Gangsters . It was excellent. John Connors is an truly fantastic actor
, and holds every scene with a chokehold grip that doesn't let up. The
direction , camera angles, use of music, this movie is just drenched in
style . Also there is a montage scene midway through the movie where
Damien Dempsey's talents are used to enormous effect , with the use of
his track " Serious " . A perfect powerful fit for a powerful movie .
Please do yourself a massive favor and see this movie on the BIG screen
, it is tense , gritty and absolutely brilliant . I personally cannot
wait to see what John Connors and Mark O Connor have to offer next ,
either as a team , or on their own. Either way it is going to be Gold ,
best of luck to them both and they deserve every success . Thanks for
taking the time to read this , and please check this movie out , it's
f**king deadly . Phil Doyle Dublin Ireland .
