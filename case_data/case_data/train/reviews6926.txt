Has its moments

One of those movies that overall wasn't that amazing as a whole, but is
vindicated thanks to some satisfying moments. Experienced frisson
twice, and at another point was so immersed I forgot to think about
anything except this movie. These made it a worthwhile evening
entertainment.Has a memorable reoccurring visual that I probably won't be forgetting
soon.
