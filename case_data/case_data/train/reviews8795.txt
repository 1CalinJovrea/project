Great Film with a touch of Mark Twain

Not sure how much the writer / director was influenced by Mark Twain
but that's what I felt like i watching a modern telling of a Twain
tale. The characters the setting the danger the change from a boy into
a man and the decisions the lead character makes are all fantastically
executed. I recently reviewed This Is England because I love come of age tales
where there is actual hurt and heartbreak because that's what defines
us in life. This Is England is still my favorite of those type of films
but Mud is a close second. The acting is great MM is amazing but the real start of the film is boy
as he changes into a man as the story unfolds, don;t miss this one,
great film.
