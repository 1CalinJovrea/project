Amazing

I think this is one of the best movies of 2015, there is action,
sentimentalism, a lot of cues of reflections. The narration is
eventful, there aren't scenes in which you lose attention. We all think
about the old age, when we will become full of wrinkles,unable to do
anything, we all think to all the things we could have done. Time flows
so quickly, we have scarcely time to make project but we don't have
time to see them realized but probably this is what is right. Movie is
based also on love: we all in life have to love someone, to cling to a
person we trust in. It's expressed very well also the concept of "loss
of identity":There's always a period in life in which you don't know
who you really are, you feel lost, you don't know what are you doing
and you start to live the life of an other person,the life of the
character that is been created by your friends,parents,sons,wife.
