Hollywood in deep crisis

In the absence of fantasy and original ideas, the Hollywood producers
get out of mothballs old stories and they serve us as new, using this
time four women instead of four men. No-one from the four actresses is
funny, only Kristen Wiig has just a little bit of something. Actually,
I do not understand what this Melissa McCarthy is in the movies
business, she has nothing specific, no beauty or talent. She's as
boring as it is annoying. After watching this, you'll have to find a
real movie to watch...
