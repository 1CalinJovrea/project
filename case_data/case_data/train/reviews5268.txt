tired and unfunny

22 Jump Street for me came off as a total money grab, with not much
effort being put in by those involved, especially the writers. The
story is basically the same as 21 Jump Street with minor variations,
and the humor basically consists of references to the first film. The
new setting of college is not really taken advantage of, and it doesn't
feel that much different from the first film. Also, whereas the first
film played as a spoof of buddy cop dramas, 22 Jump Street just felt
merely like a bad buddy cop drama. We don't watch these films for the
action. Tatum and Hill are not given much to work with, and they tended
to get kind of sappy. Definitely not worth your money
