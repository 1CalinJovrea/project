For the love of god stop this.

Please for the love of god stop now. How is it possible for these to
continue to get worse, and even more pertinently, why do I continue to
see them. For the first time in a very long while I considered walking
out of a film, and that was after about 15 minutes. I was bored stupid.
They try to continually up the action set pieces in this franchise but
just manage to make them more stupid, bombastic and confusing with
muddied visuals, terrible pacing and stupidity from the characters. And
some director really needs to get hold of Johnny Depp and get him to
actually act and not merely caricature his original creation of the
first pirates just upping the ticks and foibles. And as for the acting
of the rest of the cast, Jesus. Even good actors seem to feel the need
to Depp it up in this series, and the two new leads were so wooden they
didn't need ships to cross the seas. Add to all that a god awful script
full of pathetic dialogue and character motivation with a pee poor
story arc and this turd may finally sink the franchise. Here's hoping.
