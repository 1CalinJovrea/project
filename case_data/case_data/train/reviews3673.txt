Good Wahlberg action movie. Strong storytelling after the clich√© start.

Contraband starts like "Gone in 60 Seconds", but instead of boosting
cars it's about smuggling contraband, and like GI6S it's because of an
idiot younger brothers and familial responsibilities that brings an
ex-criminal/smuggler out of retirement for that one last job. Chris our
smuggler protagonist is deemed the Houdini of smuggling but in reality,
he's a general super bad-ass who can talk fast, kick ass and smuggle at
superhero levels. We are then treated to the Mark Wahlberg show where
it's hard to imagine anything adverse happening to him and we just go
along with the ride.The movie is at its best after it sheds its GI6S intro and moves to the
nitty gritty details of smuggling. The movie feels at home at sea where
everything is calculated and ordered, but while on land, the movie is
always bizarre, violent and out of control. This lends for some really
angular storytelling that keeps the movie exciting and interesting.It's great to see Kate Beckinsdale in the movies again though she plays
the wife whose main role is to look great and be in distress, a far cry
from her iconic Underworld Selene or from her last movie Whiteout.On the whole it's a good action movie and if you liked Mark Wahlberg's
previous movies like the Italian Job and Shooter, you will also like
this.
