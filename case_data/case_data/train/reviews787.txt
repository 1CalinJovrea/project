Good actors; baaaad and boring movie

OMG this was a bore. Total and utter bore. Nice looking, handsome
people; boring and contrived storyline. You get to care NOT about any
of the characters. In fact, the movie is so desperate that it tries to
sneak in a story about a sick person to try to make us care. Really, I
find it hard to believe so many people liked it enough for it to
receive a 7.3 on IMDb - to date.Most of the actors have done very good films before, so I know it's not
the execution. It's a bad plan that went even more wrong during the
act. For instance, tell me about any other father that does not care
his son smokes pot - unless he's a total hippie. It's stuff like that.
This movie is a bunch of BS and don't waste your time. 7.3, please.
Ruined my night and now I am going to doubt the ratings on this site!
