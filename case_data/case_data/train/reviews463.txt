The Hardy Twins, what a treat

The original film about the subject "The Krays" (1990) had Billie
Whitelaw as their mother and, somehow, she dominated my memory of the
film. Here the twins have a mother but she is, on the film, a distant
character and that's what I missed here. I missed their interaction.
She clearly had a massive influence in their characters but in Legend,
those pieces of the puzzle are unfortunately missing. But, Tom Hardy
compensates for any flaws. He is extraordinary, twice. The twins are
total individuals, totally two people. What they carry in common is a
sort of sexual danger, one explicitly the other implicitly but both as
powerful. They dare us to get close. Amazing performance(s)
