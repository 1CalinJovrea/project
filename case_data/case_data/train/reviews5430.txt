We may get die together, and I don't even know you.....

Stranded on a mountain after a plane crash, two strangers work together
in the extreme elements of the remote, snow-covered terrain. Realising that help is not on the way, they embark on a perilous
journey across hundreds of miles of wilderness, pushing each other to
survive and discovering their inner strength, and feelings toward one
another......Elba and Winslet are two wonderful actors who could make the most
mundane of scripts watchable, and here, this is exactly what they do.The film throws us almost straight into the main plot arc, after a
brief appearance from the lesser of the Brothers Bridges, and then for
the majority of the film, we are left with the two leads.And here where the problem lies.Their characters are about as cold as the conditions they are subjected
to, and for the majority of their journey, the conversation is almost
non-eventful, aside from the odd argument about her staying off her
leg.The script doesn't allow any chemistry to flow between the two, and for
the most part, it appears that Ben really dislikes Alex, and as a
surgeon, it's more or less his duty of care to look after his ailing
patient.The scenery is predictably gorgeous, and once the characters finally
warm to each other, you are more committed as to just how the dog is
staying so chipper and energetic throughout, despite being attacked
earlier on.It's a shame because this film has so much potential, and despite the
characters being less than sympathetic, the two leads make the film
averagely watchable.The final act is the meet and greet scene, and you can see what's
coming from a mile off, and it handles it poorly.Editing is poor, and there is one scene where it looks as if Elba was
dreaming about being inside a washing machine, and it's unintentionally
hilarious for all the wrong reasons.It's not a bad film, just uneventful.
