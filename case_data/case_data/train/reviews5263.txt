Seriously, don't bother.

I only went to see this film because it was on at a convenient time,
but boy do I wish I never bothered. It was...dreadful. It calls itself
a comedy? In a reasonable sized screening I didn't hear one person
actually laugh, the odd titter - that was it. What resounded was the
awkwardness everyone felt watching this 'comedy' just fail in every
way. We were all sat there in horror as joke after joke fell flat on
its face. Mind you, so unbelievably bad as it was, it was spell-binding
in its awkwardness. I think Emily Blunt generally is a great actress,
but she does not have comic timing. You'd think Jason Segel couldn't go
wrong, but even he couldn't pull off the "jokes" that this film was
rammed with. I would literally rather pull my own fingernails off than
have to watch this painfully misguided comedy again. Who on earth wrote
that script? Give it up before you butcher any more actors'
reputations.
