A great family film, and a cut above what I've seen so far this year

It's not perfect (it becomes too solemn toward the end, and the ending
itself seemed abrupt) , but this crowd pleaser pleased me. Chris Evans,
out of superhero armor for once, was quite good as a man raising his
young prodigy of a niece, Mary, alone following his sister's suicide.
The niece, although tough at first, grew on me a lot, Octavia Spenser
and Jenny Slate were charming in smaller roles, and Lindsay Duncan was
magnificent as the film's villainess so to speak, and Mary's
grandmother, imbuing her possibly one-note character with a nuanced,
three-dimensional performance so that you couldn't help but understand
her from time to time. The script was funny, tender, and moving.It all boils down to a custody fight in which the argument is what is
better for Mary: to have every possible option available to her as she
will with the grandmother and her money and stress on advanced
education, or to be with the uncle in the belief that grandma's
opportunities will simply suppress her life. Things are presented so
that there really are two valid sides.While I sided with Evan, because the audience is largely following his
story, I think there is some evidence to believe that the grandmother
is offering a better future for the child, from a judge's perspective
at least. How does this all work out? Watch and find out.I'd give it a solid recommendation.
