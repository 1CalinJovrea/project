Johnny Depp has utterly redeemed himself in my mind from the disastrous
"Dark Shadows". A great family film!! Excellent story and character
build up - the way a GOOD story should be told. Somewhat in the fashion
of Little Big Man in that it is told as a reminiscence. Armie Hammer
was excellent as The Lone Ranger - the seemingly only bastion of
decency and honesty in the Old West. Filmed in magnificent John Ford
country - no totally indoor sets for this movie!! Which this story
really could not have been told well without it being on location. The
little spoiler comes next so stop reading if you don't want to read it.
Excellent decision by Verbinski to really racket the action up at the
exact point the audience hears "The Lone Ranger" song for the first
time in the movie. From there on out it's a wild ride!! Johnny Depp at
his deadpan best. This one I will spend to see again while it is still
on the big screen!!
