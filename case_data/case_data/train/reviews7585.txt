My god.. this was awful

I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief
description on certain elements of this so-called "film".Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. At
least convince us you're an intense guy, Mr. Grey. Plot: 1/10. that wasn't a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for
soft-core porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work i
guess and good sceneryRomance; 2/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poor
attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, but
it's just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is
no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. "The deeds" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points
than this. Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama
movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM,
which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal
sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the
best action movies i've seen in a while!
