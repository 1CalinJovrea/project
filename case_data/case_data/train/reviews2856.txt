Worst Movie I've seen in years and I LOVE these guys!

The trailer alone sold me; Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling playing
goofball 1970's detectives? I'm in! I should have stayed out. This is
only the second movie in like 20 years that I've wanted to walk out on
but we had friends present and I didn't want to make a scene (turns out
they would have left with me). Ten minutes into this movie will tell
you that this in not screwball comedy, it isn't a detective thriller
and it isn't a throwback look at the crazy 70's. It could have been any
of the three and been successful but the writer(s) couldn't make up
their minds which way to go and you're left in a painful limbo where
(1) the movie isn't funny (2) there's no suspenseful plot like a real
detective movie and (3) you suddenly remember you taped several far
more interesting things at home. The writing shows signs of being done
by several different people who weren't talking to each other and wrote
at different times. Such a shame.....the acting was actually pretty
good. Don't waste your time:Run away from this dog!
