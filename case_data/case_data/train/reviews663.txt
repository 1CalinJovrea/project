Mall Cop meets Jason Bourne meets the A-Team

This movie was enjoyable - specifically the story-line, but it lost its
major appeal and potential with a poor screenplay with many plot holes,
sub-par directing, and the choice of some of its actors.The only decent actors in this film were Ben Kingsley playing the
odd-ball villain Charlie, of which he's done before so I'm used to him,
and the little girl Jamie played by Katherine de la Rocha. Liam McIntyre as Vance (mostly in the 1st half of the film) and Chad
Lindberg as Mason where just the wrong actors for their roles, or the
wrong roles for those actors. Then there was that ninja mercenary who
was just really unnecessary. Now to be clear, I am a big fan of Antonio Banderas (Eduardo "Eddie"
Deacon), but this was not the role for him. Playing the Mall Cop meets
Jason Bourne was very unconvincing, especially during the fight scenes.
Additionally, putting him in roles that he has to whisper is a mistake,
because I can barely understand his dialog with his accent.The screenplay and directing where very confused in what they were
trying to accomplish. Had this movie been serious throughout, with
convincing and appropriate actors/roles, this would have been a hit.
But unfortunately, having Chad Lindberg play the big baby-nerd role,
and Liam McIntyre with those dumb sideburns and annoying dialog at the
beginning, I couldn't take this film seriously, especially after seeing
that ninja mercenary with the dual samurai swords that he never even
used. Had their roles been as serious or convincing as the sniper, or
Gabriella Wright (Ruby), it would have kept me in suspense and
enjoyment from start to finish.Overall, the story is what kept me interested the most, and for that,
it's a 7/10 from me.
