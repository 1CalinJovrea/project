I absolutely love the first Conjuring movie. When I watch that movie,
it gets under my skin. I actually feel troubled and somewhat terrible
after watching it. I rank the first movie rather high. It bothers me
almost as much as the Exorcist does. I don't even like to watch it at
night. The feeling of dread in that movie is heavy. In the sequel, my
patience was challenged a bit. It plays out like a sampler of far
better films such as Poltergeist and The Evil Dead. It's fun for what
it is: a popcorn movie. If you enjoy fun ghost movies, see this one. If
you're expecting a movie on the level of the first Conjuring, you may
find yourself a bit disappointed.
