A Solid Thriller

(spoilers) Directed and written competently by Aussie actor Joel
Edgerton, "The Gift" is an extreme psychological thriller that smartly
doesn't bow to violence or blood. It is one of the better movies of
2015. Jason Bateman is cast oddly in a role away from his usual comedy
and does a good job as the lead character. There's a strange mystery to
unravel, and Edgerton with his film making team are up to the task.
Edgy music and strange camera views bolster the foreboding story. While
not wholly original in its premises, it's execution is stellar. Rebecca
Hall leads the acting, Edgerton plays an odd-ball sufficiently.
Edgerton has written a few other films, but this looks to be his
directorial debut, and he did very well. 7/10 Recommended
