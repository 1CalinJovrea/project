It's good and I don't watch this type of genre

I have been watching movies for 8 yrs or less now and didn't expect
that it will happen to me.I like that Henry is a genius and a inventor
plus that he thinks himself that he is a grown man even though he's
just a 11 yr old kid and his Mom relies on him on every parent should
do and Henry should have fun playing with his brother etc.SPOILER ALERT:I didn't expect to cry a f***ing lot even though I got spoiled,
Seriously, I cried like a baby and i'm a grown man. I liked the
characters so much and I really like the plot. The only bad thing is,it
is too much focused on Henry ( the main character obv ) and I wasn't
expecting that much action but I knew that there'll be an action but I
just didn't expect that Henry ate the 1hr more or less of it but IT WAS
WORTH IT ( to me ). I don't watch this type of genre a lot, but when I
watched the trailer, it took my attention and been wanting to watch
this since the trailer was released. My conclusion, I really liked IT even though like I said I don't watch
this type of genre ( drama ) a lot. Now, Go watch it and see for
yourself, If it was too clich√© for you- I think you will still like it,
but we all have different opinion. For me it is a GOOD MOVIE and one of
my favorites this whole year of 2017.
