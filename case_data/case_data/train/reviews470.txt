Cringey and gooey

First half of the movie is OK but it doesn't make up for the awkward,
gooey last half. The story is way too familiar. The action scenes take
too much time and leaves little room for the story to become great. The
emotional part of the movie doesn't feel real because of the lack of
build up.If you still see this movie i hope that your expectations are lowered,
thus making your experience better than mine.
