5
A unbiased review

I rated this movie 5 because the settings and the costumes as well as
the acting of the characters, especially by the actor who played Dan
Leno was worth watching. However, I felt like this movie too, just like
every other movie these days is trying to emphasize that a woman is
capable (both physically and mentally) to do everything that a man
generally is well-adept to do, and in this case a cute looking woman
butchering people for no apparent reason. Spoiler Alert: The worse thing is the ageing detective falling for a
deranged murderer and letting her husband become a scapegoat and making
him the culprit of those horrendous crime after his death just because
he never respected the institution of marriage and in the process
turning the real murderer into a legend. Pathetic! The double standards
of feminism is again apparent in the end..
