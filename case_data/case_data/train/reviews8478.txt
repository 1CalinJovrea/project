I am in shock

I honestly can't believe that this movie could be this bad. The Don
Winslow book was a page turner that was filled with suspense, gangster
violence, sexy scenes, and was so stylized. The 'coolness' of this
story dripped off the pages. My expectations for the movie initially
were low, but when I heard that Oliver Stone was at the helm I got
really excited. I mean how could it go wrong? A story this good with a
film maker who brought us The Doors, Platoon, and Any Given Sunday
can't go wrong. Well it did, in a big way. Acting was terrible, the voice over
narration was annoying, and the editing was wonky leaving the film with
no pace. And where was the Oliver Stone touches we thought would be
there?!? Even the music sound track sucked. I am very disappointed!
