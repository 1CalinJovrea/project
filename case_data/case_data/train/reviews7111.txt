Nice Guys Naff Plot

Nice Guys is a film you can enjoy but does not satisfy. Crowe & Gosling are really good in their roles but I felt we needed to
know more about there characters and lives. The virtually alcoholic private investigator (Gosling) with a 13 yr old
daughter. I was left puzzled : Why was he virtually alcoholic? Why did
his house burn down? What happened to his wife? Why is he such a loser? You know even less about Crowes character. Which is a shame as they both worked well together and it makes it
interesting being set in 1977One is searching for Amelia (Gosling)The other is paid by Amelia (Crowe) to stop people searching for her. The first half of the film is good. Why are people searching for
Amelia, including some who intend to kill her. But for me, the second half of the film was ruined by a pretty stupid
plot, which I will summarise as follows. Amelias mother (Basinger) is head of justice department. She (Basinger)
is in cahoots with car manufacturers to cover up excessive pollution
from their cars.Amelia outraged makes a 'porn film' that exposes all of this. She
intends it to shown at the 1977 car expo to reveal all the dastardly
dealings. Basinger is having everyone involved in the film killed, including her
daughter Amelia and all copies of the film destroyed. I know it's pretty stupid. Which is a shame because Crowe and Gosling
did such a good job. There are plenty of laughs, you start the film with high expectations,
But 'Nice Guys' doesn't know if its a comedy, a thriller or a film with
a serious message. So ends up a disappointing 6.5/10
