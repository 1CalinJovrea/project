The Sting This Ain't

Let this movie serve as a cautionary tale for dummies who want to make
a con artist movieÂ—Don't. You are out of your depth. This movie made no sense. The romance in it made no emotional sense and
was not set up properly. The twist was obvious, and made no sense. See
instead: The Grifters, The Sting, House of Games, Oceans Eleven, The
Spanish Prisoner, Film Flam Man, Match Stick Men.Whoever in New Orleans agreed to have this shot there did not read the
script. It portrays New Orleans as the leading American city in which
to get your valuables jacked.If you believe someone could pull your wedding ring off your finger
without you noticing it, you will maybe like this film.If you still insist on seeing this, check your logic at the door or be
prepared to be angry. Don't say you weren't warned.
