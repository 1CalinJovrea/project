Disappointed

I have read several of the high star rated reviews and still cannot
understand why this film is so highly rated.Both my daughter and I went
to see this film as a " Screen Unseen " (This is where you go to see a
film at a reduced cost but don't know what film is being shown)Because
of the reduced cost these showings attract a large amount of
people.When the film started the cinema was around three quarters full
after the first 10 mins people started to leave (this is not unusual)by
the end of the film there was only around a third of the original
number remaining (including my daughter and myself this is unusual)The
ending was so strange it was as if someone had just cut off the film
with no explanation and a big WHAT! came from the remaining audience, A
total waste of 2 hours of my life see it at your peril.
