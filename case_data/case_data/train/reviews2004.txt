Sci Why?

OK this is a lame title for a review, but prometheus kind of deserves a
lame intro. The move opens up very promising, with epic landscapes and a
beautifully done intro and epilogue. Then there's a scene where we see
David doing his every day chores and keeping himself busy while the
rest of the crew is still in cryo-sleep. This scene is utterly genius
and should'v really set the tone for the rest of the movie, but all
what comes after is really disappointing. the films builds up quite nice, but until half of the movie it slips
away in to unnecessary dialogs. probably to cover up the major plot
holes. I was sitting in the theater just asking myself: why are they
doing that? Why is this character stereotype in the movie? How did they
find this place so fast? Why in the hell do they have a switchboard
that turns on holograms about what happened last time and who put them
there? What is up with the zombie??? and so on.If all these questions were compensated with raw action, or tongue in
cheek humor, i could have just waved it away; But the film propagates
itself as an intellectual, epic adventure about the beginning of
mankind.For a guy who made brilliant films such as Alien, Bladerunner,
Gladiator etc. You have to wonder, why is he satisfied with a lame sci
fi movie that any other director could have made...and i hear he's planning a sequel to blade runner... Please, will
somebody tell him he has to stop before he destroys his name as a
brilliant director...
