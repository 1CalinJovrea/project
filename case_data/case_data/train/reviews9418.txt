Disappointed - can predict the whole story after 15mins

I couldn't hide my eagerness to go to cinema on the first day, because
the "first Ape" is soooo good. But after 15 mins of watching, I can
predict the whole story, and keep hoping my prediction would be wrong.
NO! The story is old, ridiculous and easy going.The Dawn might receive my better review if it was released 10-15 years
ago. But it's 2014, please, except CGI, the rest is easy to know before
you watch, overwhelmed with non-sense details and very stupid.- Apes teach each other human's language but never use it? - Apes live
next to human around 10 miles but no one knows? Even the whole world
has been trying to find them for years? - The factory is workable after
so many years with just a little effort of 4 guys in several hours?
Come on, I live in the country where we depend on such power source, to
run such kind of factory, we need a big team of engineers, workers from
many departments working together on specific conditions. - We just
need a stupid man and stupid apes' leader ever to start the war so
easily. - ipad, cameras and many electronic devices are working well
after many years without power, wow. - Human are lazy,aggressive and
selfish. I think when those people living in such kind of condition (no
food, no electronics...), they should kill each other before apes come.
... I don't want to list more and more non-sense and illogical details but
how the writer can ignore so many basic thing like that? Huge
disappointed about the "second ape". Finally, the ape leader who didn't want the war, now stays in the city
to wait an army coming to kill them all. OMG...Can't be "better"
ending.
