Disappointed

I love The Incredibles, Up, Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Despicable
Me and Megeaman. I thought I was going to see something that amazing,
but with a female protagonist. But no. It was the same old Disney
princess movie: a princess having problems about who she is or is not
going to marry. We saw that in Snow White, Seeping Beauty, Cinderella,
The Little Mermaid. Apparently, that all females ever do: fret about
who they are going to marry.Spoiler alert.The movie starts out great: funny characters, great scenery, Scottish
accents, and a promising protagonist. I'm sucked in and expecting
something amazing and interesting, like the other Pixar movies. Then,
of course, since it is the Dark Ages (and Disney, not "really" Pixar),
the hand of the princess will be the prize in a contest. Been there,
done that. Of course she doesn't want that, so she runs away and finds
a witch and asks the witch to change her . . . her . . . fate? Like the
trailers said? No. She wants to change her MOM. The princess does not
want to grow and mature, she want's mom to quit bugging her. Mom has
done everything she can to give the princess a wonderful life and
educate and prepare her for a life of queen-ship. But that's not what
the princess wants. The princess wants Â– what? She really has no viable
alternative. It's not like she can go and get a career. The movie
implies that if she gets married, she can't ride her horse or shoot her
bow any more. Why not? So they parade out the three husband candidates
and of course, even though they are the sons of great chieftains, they
are all worthless. Predictable, boring plot. What if one of them was
handsome, charming, and a good archer, then she might not have minded
getting married and we could have seen the wedding in 3D.Back to the witch. Well, the witch only knows ONE spell: change it into
a bear. That's a big help. The last person who bucked conformity and
wanted to do his own thing, he got changed into a wild, destructive
bear too. Is that one of the lessons in this movie? Conform or you will
become a wild, destructive, shunned animal? When her mother eats the
magic cake and begins to feel sick, all the princess can think about is
if she still has to get married. What if the magic cake killed her mom?
The princess doesn't seem too worried. Is this one of the lessons of
the movie? If your parents are trying to do the very best for you, and
it's cramping your style, just drug them to get them off your back.
After mom turns into a bear, there was no plot any more. It was just
running around like Bugs, Daffy and Elmer in the forest and the castle
until it was time for the movie to end. BORING.Then there was the big speech the princess gave in the banquet room
about "Can't we all just get along?" What was that about? Everyone was
partying and getting along just fine. Lame.So the princess cries and tells mom that she's sorry (of course she is
now that everything's a mess), and mom turns back into a person. But
who has the character arc? Not the princess. The princess still does
not want to get married. MOM is the one who changes, and she had
better! After all, she knows that if she leans too hard on her daughter
to do what's best, the daughter will drug her. So is that the lesson in
the movie? Don't pressure your kids to do what you know is best for
them, or they could get punitive. So mom caves in and says the young
people can chose by falling in love. There's a ground-breaking moral.
News flash: western women have not been getting betrothed for
centuries.And why did they call the movie "Brave". The Princess didn't do
anything brave in the whole movie. In fact, she had a hissy fit, ran
from her responsibilities, and turned to drugs to solve the problems.I don't care if it was 6 years in the making, or how amazing the 3D
effects were: the story was a dud.
