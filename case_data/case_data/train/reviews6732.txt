'You never heard the saying, never rob a bank across from a diner with the best donuts in three counties?'

Born in 1966 in Iceland, Baltasar Korm√°kur graduated from The Drama
Academy of Iceland and is one of Iceland's most popular and critically
acclaimed actors of the younger generation. He is also a director and a
producer and seems to be one of the more exciting new talents of the
day. He directed this work by Stephen Grant based on the Boom! Studios
graphic novel adapted for the screen by Blake Masters. It is a crazy
mixed up story of mistaken identities, hidden identities and corruption
in every branch of the crime prevention division of the government. It
works primarily of the unexpectedly fine screen chemistry between
Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg.Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) is an undercover DEA agent who takes
advantage of gunman Michael Stigman's (Mark Wahlberg) idea to rob a
bank to bust him and a mob boss (Edward James Olmos). However, it
proves too successful with much more money seized than predicted and
with Trench's forces failing to halt the getaway. Complicating things
still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who
shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly
finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine
rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on
both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a
way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves. The
well-healed cast of characters (at times difficult to tell who is on
what team) includes Bill Paxton, James Marsden, Fred Ward, Robert John
Burke, Greg Sproles, and Paula Patton.It is noisy action all the way but the script is peppered with enough
solid humor and exceptional banter between Washington and Wahlberg that
it keeps our attention to the very odd ending. Grady Harp
