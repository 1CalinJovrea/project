"One last ride"

One of the best action film that exists out there and definitely the
best in the Furious series. With death defying stunts and terrific
visuals, it is a match made in heaven for petrol-heads. From jumping
cars off an aircraft to jumping between buildings in Abu Dhabi, it puts
shivers down your spine! Rock pulling off his signature move to street
fight between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham and yet one cannot get
enough of the action. This is pure entertainment at its best. As if
this wasn't enough, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end was emotional
and the best thing about this film. He got a send-off that he deserved!
Those last scenes cannot be emphasized enough upon. Overall it is the
best action flick so far this year. "Whether I'm a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, the most
important people in the room are mi familia."
