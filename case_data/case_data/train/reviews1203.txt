Nothing like the trailer portrays...

The trailer portrays this movie to be a light hearted comedy about
pregnancy, which is what made me go see this movie. This movie is not
funny, all the funny parts are in the trailer so I feel completely
fooled into seeing the movie. It isn't a drama either as I find the
serious bits very depressing and they don't quite fit with the movie.
Characters are extremely annoying and there is nothing in this movie
that would ever make you feel good about being pregnant. I actually
think pregnancy is portrayed very badly in this movie as the characters
who are so desperately trying to get pregnant are really one
dimensional, but I have issues with people wanting to have kids just
because they "want" them anyway. The whole ordeal is a bit cartoonish
here also. I'm so glad that I didn't drag my boyfriend to see this one
as I don't think he'd ever forgive me.
