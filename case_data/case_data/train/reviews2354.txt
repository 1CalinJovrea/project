Fun Movie

I'm an old goat who was, in the 80s, called the rock 'n roll Captain
where I worked. My son, who just turned 34, heard this music night and
day when he grew up. Last night, we saw the movie together and we both
enjoyed the hell out of it, even mocking the idea of hip-hop entering a
rock venue. Those looking for realism should recognize that a musical is never an
actual representation of the day and most often is a parody,
exaggerating and mocking its point. Rock Of Ages was just that, but in
a very fun way with good music and musical centered acting.I recommend this movie because of all its elements: acting, setting,
music and and plot line.
