The new drama film Hounds Of Love starring Emma Booth, Ashleigh
Cummings, Stephen Curry, Susie Porter, Damian de Montemas.Sharing its name with a Kate Bush song and set two years after its 1985
release, Hounds of Love is a chilling kidnap thriller set in Perth,
Western Australia in December 1987. Teenager Vicki Maloney (Ashleigh Cummings - Australian TV Series Miss
Fisher's Murder Mysteries, Tomorrow, When The War Began) - at odds with
her mother Maggie (Susie Porter - Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The
Clones, Little Fish) for separating from her father Trevor (Damian de
Montemas - Australian TV Series Underbelly and Wolf Creek) - is
deceived and abducted by a cold, sadistic couple Evelyn White and John
White (Australian actress Emma Booth - Parker, Tracks, Australian actor
Stephen Curry - Australian TV Series Neighbours, The Cup) and
imprisoned in their suburban home. With morbidly riveting central
performances, this debut feature film from Ben Young weaves themes of
power, control and motherhood into its tension-filled central premise.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Hounds Of Love includes
Harrison Gilbertson (Need For Speed, Haunt) as Jason Vicki's boyfriend,
Australian actor Fletcher Humphrys (Chopper, Australian TV Series Home
And Away) as Gary, Steve Turner as Troy, Holly Jones (Looking For
Grace) as Miss Martin, Michael Muntz (Australian TV Series A Country
Practice) as Sergeant Mathews, Marko Jovanovic (Son Of A Gun) as
Sergeant Henderson, Scottish actor Liam Graham (Sororal) as Pete and
Lisa Bennet as Gabby Donovan. Overall Hounds Of Love is a good drama film filled with drama, hard
hitting scenes, kidnap, torture, gory violence, abuse, family,
friendship, falling outs, arguments, some upsetting scenes and other
things throughout the film.So I will give Hounds Of Love an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and
Hounds Of Love is worth seeing if you like drama films like Room,
Oldboy or kidnap drama films along the same lines as this.So if you get the chance to see Hounds Of Love in the cinema then you
should go and see it sooner than later.
