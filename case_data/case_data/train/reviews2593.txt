Family dysfunction is rarely this entertaining, poignant or effortless to watch.

Ah yes, family dysfunctional. Everyone has it, and frankly its an over
mined sub genre in film. With entries often pushing melodrama and
character arcs to neat, organised catharsis, it has become as
predictable as bad romantic comedies. Which is why i'm so happy to
report that 'The Meyerowitz Stories' is one of the best dramedies I've
seen all year! Told through various character perspectives in no real cinematic
structure, there's a naturalism to the style. A humbleness that revels
in subtleties rather than climatic overtures. And by god is it
refreshing. There isn't a drop of pretension to be found in the film,
no barriers between you and the characters, who are all lovingly played
by an assured, veteran cast. Adam Sandler is a standout in what is already an outstanding ensemble.
This is a performance quite different from what you might expect. It
isn't a retread of Punch Drunk Love, or a dramatic overhaul of his past
characters either. He instead lends a striking amount of humanity to
Danny, which can be said of the entire cast. But Ben Stiller in
particular deserves a shout out. I've never quite seen him pull off
drama this straight faced and earnest before, and like most of the
film, the sporadic dramatic beats are interspersed throughout his
performance. Yeah i cant quite say enough nice things about 'The Meyerowitz
Stories'. This was a joy to watch.So i'll just say this, if you love
Wes Anderson films, in particular 'The Royal Tenenbaums' this is an
easy recommend. And while it lacks the formalism and ridiculously
cinematic glory of Anderson's style, there is far more humanity is
Noah Baumbach straight faced approach. Meyerowitz Stories may not
provide anything radically new, but it provides a great entry in the
tired list of dysfunctional comedies, along with some of the year's
best performances.
