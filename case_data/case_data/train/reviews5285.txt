Sequels have been good until now

UGH...just saw MM XXL and I left the theater feeling grubby. Look, I'm
no prude and I really liked the first Magic Mike and was hoping to see
the same kind of guilty pleasure with some good moves. Forget it. These
guys just used their nice bodies in a showy, uninteresting way and
there was very little classy hot dancing.It's such a rip off when actors just walk through a movie because it's
going to make money. Wait for the DVD if you want to see this. It's
corny, sleazy, very little dancing by the guys and a stupid, stupid
story line. This movie had no class at all as the first Magic Mike
had...that one was good! Sheesh, I almost walked out about 25 min. into the movie, but then I
thought I could not give a solid review if I did. What a waste of my
time. I should have gone to Terminator.
