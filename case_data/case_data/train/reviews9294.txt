Quiet possibly the worst film I have seen this year!!

So I think everyone is aware this film has had a lot of troubles, and
for those of you that weren't, you will soon see why if you waste you
money, let alone your time on this excuse of a film.Like a number of people that have posted I also wanted to believe this
film would offer something, but it doesn't. It is not original, the SFX
are average, the acting is poor.I like Pitt in most his films, but in this one, I honestly think this
is some of the worst acting of his career - look out for the scene
where Pitt is in the WHO building in the last act when he finds out
that all the dangerous viruses are in the B wing where.... you guessed
it all the zombies are, I actually laughed out loud at his acting it
was that bad.The films jumps about and you develop no emotion for any of the
characters, even from the opening scenes I just didn't buy into the
loving family that Pitt was supposed to be a part of.The end of the film is also one of the worst closures to a film i have
seen. It was if, they hadn't filmed an ending so thought how the hell
do we bring this to a close, and a bright spark said I know we'll get
Pitt to explain it all via narration that will keep the fools that have
sat through it to the end happy.In short zombies do exist - this film is proof of that, it should have
died before it got to release but somehow it made it back from the
dead. Now all I need to do is vaccinate myself against this monstrosity
by watching an equally bad film.
