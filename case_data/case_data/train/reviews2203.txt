Let me understand...

It is a common secret that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis do not
have the quality of Peter Sellers or Jack Lemon. However, they do have
the ability to make you laugh(if you do not have very serious demands
of what you see). Unfortunately, "The Campaign" proved that you have to
think more than twice if you want to spend a couple of hours watching
films with these guys. Not, because they are untalented (even if their
talents are not vast), but because they are type-casted as protagonists
in movies addressed to toddlers. Ferrell does what he normally does,
mugging and shouting without any reason justified by the
"plot"...Galifianakis is much more consistent to his role but the
script seems to be written in one evening, following the typical
formula of modern Hollywood "comedies", which are produced with no
sense of what cinema really is and with the meaning of talent in total
absence. I'm sure that even an 8 year old child could produce a much
more clever story than this. Please let me understand why this film was
shot. Will anybody of the participants can feel proud of it at the
future or it will be unforgettable? I m sure that there are thousands
of comedies much better than this, even with less than the 1% of the
budget used for "The Campaign".
