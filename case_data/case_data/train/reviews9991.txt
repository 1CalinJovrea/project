War? Still looking for it...

I should have read the reviews here before going to the theatre, would
have saved me the ticket, petrol, and parking.I must have dozed off at least four times and the plot has more holes
than a slice of Emmental cheese.No war whatsoever, nada, zero, zilch. Some guerrilla combat(?) and that
was it. The only war I saw was me fighting to keep awake.Go read a book instead 1/10
