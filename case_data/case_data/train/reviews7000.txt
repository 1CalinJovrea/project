If you want a good movie about Steve jobs watch Pirates of Silicon Valley

This Feelgood tragedy of the century isn't worth your money. Why the
hell did they even make this movie in the first place!? Were there not
enough documentaries and TV shows about Apple and Steve Jobs!? Did we
really need a butchered version featuring Ashton Kutcher. They spent 8
and a half million dollars making a movie about a guy who already had a
lot of movies already Why is Steve Jobsis portrayed here as some sort
of hero? It just makes me so mad to think that they could get away with
making something like this Spend your 14 dollars and get something to
eat while you watch Pirates of Silicon Valley, a much better and much
more accurate story of Steve Jobs and Apple's beginnings
