Completely irrelevant and grossly disappointing

I'm shocked at the amount of good reviews thus far. There's the first
10 minutes of this film... then there's the last 10 minutes... NOTHING
in between contributed to an acceptable origin story of Leatherface. We
got a brief look at his childhood (first 10 min)... eventually we learn
how he became disfigured (last 10 min)... but how he became this giant,
semi-mute, monster... there's NOTHING about this story-line that
explains this or gives us ANY additional insight. For the most part we
find out what we already knew (in the first 10 min)... his entire
family is sadistic and insane... THAT'S how he became Leatherface...
not anything you're going to see here.This was nothing but an attempt to tell a story that ultimately has
nothing to do with the origin of Leatherface. The leap from how this
guy became Leatherface is astronomical and nonsensical. What we already
knew was sufficient and should've been the focus of an origin film. THIS was just an opportunity to take advantage of a successful
franchise with a story that was FORCED to tie into the original Texas
Chainsaw Massacre. Complete with a bunch of forced twists and turns in
attempt to appear to have more depth than it actually does. This was
pure garbage and the only thing good about it was Lili Tayler, who
wears "psychopath" very well.Look for me on Twitter and YouTube for audio reviews. MovieBuffChick1
