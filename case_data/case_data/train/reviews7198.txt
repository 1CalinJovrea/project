"Now You See Me" was a personal guilty pleasure of 2013, it was
absolutely unpretentious and unbelievable but it knew it was so and
with the help of a talented cast and a couple of good characters and
story beats it turned out as a fine time at the theater. Its sequel
starts out with the same unpretentious and fun vibe of the first only
to slowly escalate up to what becomes one of the most lifeless and
visually painful experiences of the year.As I said the movie started out really fine, in the sense that it was
doing what I wanted it to do. Nobody should or would walk into this
film expecting the new "Heat", I just wanted to have some dumb fun,
with a self referential film that doesn't take anything seriously and
up to the fist two set-pieces of the film that's what I was getting.
The cast was working the best they could and the action felt fluent and
visually pleasing, there was a rhythm to it and a reason for it in
particular.Yet, as soon as we start getting into this film's second act things
fall apart to a mind numbing degree and I mean that literally, my mind
went blank with the level of stupidity and inconsequentially of what
was going on, I watched this film in a state of trance where I couldn't
tell if I was dozing off or simply bored to death."Now You See Me 2" takes the levels of suspense of disbelief to a whole
new world where not even laughing at the film proves to be of any kind
of satisfaction, everything going on is just visual noise and other
than being filmed in the most uninteresting and unstylish way possible,
it has no momentum, no character, it's just there for the sake of
extravaganza and it keeps going on for unbelievable amounts of time and
it never proves to be any kind of pleasant.And we haven't even taken into consideration the logistical
implications of what happens. It is just crazy. There is no grit of
grounding of actions, stuff just keeps happening on top of other stuff
and without any kind of character or story implications the film
becomes more of a showcase of dull visual tricks. Not to mention the
story twists it spices in which are preposterous to even think about
and sprinkled with silly clich√©s and dialogue that not even Ruffalo or
Freeman, two of the greatest actors, manage to make even passable.I got a head ache from this movie, it was a terrible experience, I
don't recommend it and the shortness of my review is reflective of how
lost with words I am about it.
