What a waste of opportunity

I made the mistake of reading the book again before watching the movie
So had high expectations. It was The Snowman that got me hooked on Jo
Nesbo and was excited when I saw the trailer. I walked out of it at the
end feeling very disappointed.Characters were stripped down to being almost irrelevant. They should
have stuck more closely to the book for Katrine Bratt, such an
important part. Ave Stop did not come across as the charismatic media
guru. Instead, he appeared to be somewhat impotent. ldar Vetlesen may
as well have been cut right out of it. The script very loosely followed
the book. The twists in the plot were poorly handled. The opening Scene
faded to frame the plot and I won't say anymore about that. Val Kilmer
as Gert Rafto?? At least the harsh, bleak atmosphere was captured and
Fassbender did a pretty good job.This movie Should be shown to film students on how not to do it.
