What a dud!

There were so many ridiculous aspects to this movie, it is hard to name
them all. An old clunker transport plane gets into the DC airspace and
magically transforms to some high-tech piece of machinery, all within
arm's reach of the US military planes...the lack of negotiation with
terrorists is actually the US giving the terrorists everything they ask
for. All so they will not kill our president. NO president is worth all
that...Susan Sarandon's character reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as
she is being dragged to her supposed death...the N Korean army of about
20 taking out all the secret service and US military...the use of a
single gauze on an abdominal gunshot wound...Seriously, who wrote this
crap??? It was abysmal, to put a positive spin on it. When Morgan
Freeman (Speaker of the House) became acting President, all I could
think was thank goodness it's not either Nancy Pelosi or John Beohner.
