4
strangers in a strange land that essentially repeats "Evil Angels"

The 1988 movie "Evil Angels" (aka "A Cry in the Dark") told the story
of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, an Australian couple suspected of
killing their baby. Meryl Streep got a chance to one again show off her
accent skills, affecting an Aussie one.Well, we now have "Strangerland", which has a similar plot. Nicole
Kidman and Joseph Fiennes play a couple whose children disappear right
before a sandstorm hits, only to see the townspeople turn against them.
It turns out that the sandstorm itself is the most interesting part of
the movie. After that, the movie becomes a talkfest. The main stars and
Hugo Weaving have appeared in far better movies. In fact, editor
Veronika Jenet also edited "The Piano", which I do recommend. There are
quite a few movies from down under that I recommend, but I don't
recommend "Strangerland".
