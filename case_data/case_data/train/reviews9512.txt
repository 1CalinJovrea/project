Should Be Better Known

Another reviewer here asks a very pertinent question as to why this
film is not better known. If you watched this and didn't enjoy it then
I reckon you must be dead. First off, the acting is superb. I'm not one
for American child actors. They are often bizarrely moppet-like and
unappealing, but this child is absolutely marvelous. She steals every
scene she's in, and, like her uncle, Frank, I just sat back and
wondered at her charm. Chris Evans does a fantastic job with this role.
He plays it understated, which works incredibly well. There are some
genuinely funny moments--I particularly liked the one-eyed cat, Fred,
and his rescue from the (euthanasia) shelter. He's just sitting there
with two other cats waiting to be put down. No one dies on Frank's
watch. Great acting, interesting plot, genuine emotion, questions about
the meaning of life and the debt we owe to our talents, all wrapped up
in a great-looking movie. Just watch. You'll love it.
