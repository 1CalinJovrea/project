Sigh. Had such good potential...

What, to me, kept this film from earning higher marks was simply how
silly the plot and direction turned out to be. I get that the father
was weak and spineless (No gun in the house? In rural Texas? With a
wife and vulnerable young girl in the sprawling, relatively isolated
house?), but was he so weak that he couldn't fight off an overweight
burglar? How'd he suddenly gain so much strength to suddenly go running
through a burning house if he was shot several times and left for dead?The part about how the father came to be able to channel the killer's
darkest, murderous thoughts on canvas needed explaining, too. How this
is possible is a mystery, since Fatboy is just a regular human being
who spent many years in a psych hospital for attacking local school
girls with a brick, his M.O. Somehow, being in the hospital all those
years endowed him with supernatural powers. The Pluses to this film was the ability of the studio to license
Metallica songs. And the fact that the titles were written in Iron
Maiden lettering doesn't hurt, either.
