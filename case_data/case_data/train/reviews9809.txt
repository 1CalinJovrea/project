Not as good as everyone says.

A old couple left 30 minutes in. I couldn't understand the music, I
couldn't hear the lyrics. Ryan Gosling's character was a dick for 90%
of the movie. He is a good actor, but my goodness his character is an
ass hat. The story to me was blah. It was like I've see this story told
before just differently. Emma Stone is amazing. I definitely enjoyed
her more than Ryan's character, but that honestly isn't too hard. The
movie seemed pretentious and over rated as a whole. It was just
Hollywood getting off on Hollywood. Imagine if Hollywood was a person
and cloned themselves. Then Hollywood starts sucking Hollywoods dick.
There, that's most of the story. White man tries to save jazz. I did enjoy the visuals, editing, colours and dancing. So it was nice
to look at, I'll give it that. But the story to me was under whelming.
