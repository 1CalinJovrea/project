The most visually stunning movie I have ever seen

This movie is absolutely stunning from the get go. I can't remember
ever being pulled into a film so completely and thoroughly, and I don't
think I've seen a more beautiful film. Its a pretty intense ninety
minutes, with Bullock's character constantly battling one catastrophe
after another, and all of it is amazing to see. The plot is pretty
straight forward (see it, I won't talk about that), but its the way
they pull it off that makes it absolutely worth seeing. Thanks to some
incredible CGI, great direction, and solid acting, the movie is an
absolute must see. I'm normally not a fan of 3D movies (I hate wearing
the stupid glasses), but this movie uses it wonderfully and to great
effect. I would strongly recommend seeing it in an IMAX theatre if you
get the chance - if there was ever a movie made for 3d IMAX, this is
it.
