Avoid this movie (Tree of Life 2)

I have never been so convinced of a film that will cause people to walk
out of movie theatres. It really is that bad. OK, so some films are
weird, but this just seems to be weird for weirdness sake.Sometimes you get people who are quiet & don't say much, but when EVERY
character in a film is like that it gets very tedious. The lack of any
kind of recognisable plot should also have given me the heads up.I'm aware there might be people who go all artsy about this film, but
I'm the kind of person who believes that a movie needs to be at least
mildly entertaining. When story and plot and acting are sacrificed in
the name of 'art' it's time to head for the door.
