Vow-I Swear that You Will Love It ****

"The Vow" is a wonderful movie dealing with rediscovery by 2 people.
Happily married and so much in love, this couple, based on a true
story, has so much to live for and then fall victim to an automobile
accident where his wife came out of a coma but suffered severe memory
loss. While she retained many things, she did not remember her husband
at all. The film is a story of how he struggles to win back her love.Not only does he have to contend with her disability, he has to contend
with her cunning, wealthy parents who had opposed him and see this as
an opportunity to get their daughter back.Sam Neill and Jessica Lange are the wealthy parents.This film is definitely a triumph of the human spirit.
