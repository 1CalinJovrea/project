Warms the heart, but does little else

This film scores highly for me because it was a heartwarming, endearing
tale about Paul Potts, arguably the finest product from Britain's Got
Talent. I feel that because I know his story, I got little out of the
film-watching experience because I already knew what was going to
happen. Corden, while a good fit for Potts, neither made me laugh as I
expected nor delivered the emotion that I so desperately wanted to
raise goosebumps on my skin. The dubbing of Potts' voice over Corden
added credibility to the film, as well as the adaptation of Britain's
Got Talent footage to Corden, the judging panel and Ant and Dec.A film I would watch again for the feel-good factor, but little to rave
about unfortunately.
