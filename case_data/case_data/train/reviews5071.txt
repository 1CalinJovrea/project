Based on the Truth?

I am severely disappointed in this film for the main reason that we see
US movie makers twisting the truth so that they come out looking like
heroes. And I am not alone in this. The UK and French governments were
quite rightly upset by the movie saying that their embassies had
refused to help out the Americans in trouble. The UK embassy took the
refugees in at great risk and kept them there until the Iranian guard
was getting suspicious. Ben Affleck claims he had the refugees refused
because he wanted them to appear to be isolated would be funny if it
wasn't so clear that he actually wanted it to be the US who really
saved them. At least the movie makers did have the Canadian embassy
involved as it had been at the time. The movie should have said at the
start that the facts had been changed in the name of drama. Movie
makers have a responsibility when making movies based on the truth to
let people know what really occurred. When they don't they are actually
guilty of trying to change history and worse people believe what they
see on the screen. And lastly seeing the guards at the airport chasing
the jet in order to try and stop it was absurd. Why didn't they simply
shoot at it or have the Iranian air-force force the jet to land. A joke
of a movie so far removed from what actually happened and to say its
'based on the truth' really shows just how far the truth gets abused.
