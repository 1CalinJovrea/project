Driving down is half the trip.

One of the most exciting things about movies is discovering a gem that
you never heard of. This film came on a cable movie channel one night.
If any film in the past 10 years were to pay homage to David
Cronenberg, this one is it. The plot isn't the only engine drives this
movie. It's driven by its mood, competent cast and its brazen disregard
for conventional human boundaries. Miss Isabelle is pitch perfect as
Mary. She's a quick-to-learn student who rapidly becomes a "practicing"
teacher on her star patient. Miss Isabell's understated performance
sets the mood with every character. You just can't take your eyes off
this movie. One of those characters said, "Mary, driving down is half
the trip." Thanks to the Soska sisters and everyone who worked on this
film, that "drive" is worth watching more than once.
