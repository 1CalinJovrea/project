Unbearably Misleading

This is the epitome of burying the lead But the trailer seemed a bit
strange to begin with. Instead of the usual montage summing up the
entire movie, or at least half of it, we get one scene: an assertive
tomboy princess with neat looking fiery red hair shoots an arrow to
choose her own fate instead of a bunch of losers vying to marry her:
the one that hits the bulls eye wins her hand in marriage. (Let's make
it clear, all three young men are pathetic wrecks: if one resembled an
Elfin Johnny Depp with half a brain, perhaps there'd be no story at
all.) After our frustrated heroine, Princess Merida, hits all the marks
by herself, the real tale begins  and not only is it strange, awkward
and confusing, but even the target-audience children might shake their
heads in disbelief.Merida, in order to change her destiny, seeks a forest witch who gives
her a spell. Then, back at the castle, Merida offers her mom  the
person really in charge of this arranged marriage thing  a spiked
muffin that quickly changes her into a giant bear! This was unplanned;
Merida wanted to change her mother, not change her mother. The rest of
the movie has the Princess keeping Mother Bear away from her huntsman
father who, years earlier and as the film began, lost his leg battling
a you got it bear. And then her three troublesome little brothers
turn into bears and there's the one big bad bear from the intro that's
part of a confusing backstory about a fallen prince.So with all the potential of setting a movie in the time where trolls
and gnomes and dragons and fairies and kings and queens and knights
could have roamed the mystical Celtic countryside, we get a bunch of
common bears and a stretched-out story lacking a real plot, leaving
only the memory of that "trailer" that would have made a fantastic
short film to open a real movie with.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com
