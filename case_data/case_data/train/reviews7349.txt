A beautiful story of love, loss and the aftermath of war...

I desperately wanted to see this film, since I love all the actors and
find Vera Brittain's story so incredible and heartfelt, regardless of
the fact that it would have been similar to many stories after the war. This really is a story about love, friendship and loss. The fact that it was based on someone's memoir made it all that more
real and devastating, considering that could happen to anyone( if a new
war was to begin) and has and is, in certain parts of the world,
happening to someone right now.They haven't sugar coated anything in this film, and even though I've
gone from being cheerful to completely distraught, I wouldn't change
anything about it.If you want to watch a film that is real, explicit in the right way,
but without gore or an irrational amount of romance, and with the
perfect cast and acting, that has beautifully reflected this brave
woman's story...................... Look no further!
