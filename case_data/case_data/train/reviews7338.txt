Ugly, violent, ultimately pointless film

It's safe to say that you couldn't ruin the plot for this film, as
there isn't much of one. If you read the IMDb summary that is pretty
much it with a bit of violence.The characters are one dimensonal, uninteresting, you can't but not
really care as they are stabbed, shot or eaten by dogs.The violence is a bit pointless as it isn't combined with a strong
script or a few plot twists. With no interesting dialogue between the
protagonists your left watch a group of uninteresting boring people
butcher each other. In the end the film is predictable, conventional
and offers no surprises.All in all a wasted opportunity given that the film had a strong cast.
