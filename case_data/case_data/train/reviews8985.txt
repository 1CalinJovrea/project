Entertaining Science-Fiction with some flaws

ElysiumElysium is at one point disappointing and at the other it is fine. It's
a Dystopia which does not look like it could be too far away from the
present. The longer you think about it, Elyisum already happens
everywhere, and Neill Blomkamp is a South African native, so it becomes
clear, that the message is about poverty and money in the future. The
difficulty making such a future logic and scientifically well, is
obvious, and it is not completely convincing. There lies the main
problem of a sci-fi movie. You make either a starwarsy fairy tale or
you have to make it very, very believable like the director's much
acclaimed "District 9". Plotwise it reminded me of "Wall-E" (which was better), "Oblivion",
"Escape from NY" and some anime type plots . The story was very
predictable from the beginning and for my taste, it could have been
made completely PG 18 in terms of violence, to make it darker and more
grim. Now, it looks a bit indecisive. The actors were fine, especially
the less known, like Copley, Luna and Moura. Jodie Foster is great
here, reminded me a bit of Tilda Swintons performance in "Michael
Clayton". Matt Damon is a good actor, but he's a bit overused lately.
In comparison to "Pacific Rim" it's clear, why the audience is more
happy with Del Toros skyscraper-style movie: it's pure entertainment,
reality is far away and the violence is very mild - you hate it or you
love it.To sum it up, I was well entertained by this. I liked the strong hints
of real present problems. I disliked the predictable way the story
unfolds, the overall mixture of action and violence and some illogic
details. I definitely want to see more movies by Blomkamp and so it
gets my 7.0.
