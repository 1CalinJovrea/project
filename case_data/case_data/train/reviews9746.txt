Distasteful & Dispecable

I'm not sure what Hollywood is on lately, but this films just goes to
prove that there is truly nothing good coming out of that hell-hole
lately.Director Michael Bay, the producers and actors should all be ASHAMED of
themselves for creating a film which attempts to bring humor and raise
sympathy for a group of kidnappers, torturers, robbers and ultimately
murderers. WTF were you guys thinking! This group of idiots were guilty
of heinous acts and yet you produce a film that makes lite of them and
their atrocious crimes. If this had happened to someone you loved would
you still make the same movie or be involved with this trash? I doubt
it.If you want to know more about what these criminals did, read the Miami
New Times 3 part series by the same name of this film or the book by
Marc Shiller (the sole survivor).I will never spend a dime on any film which any of these actors,
producers or directors are involved with. It may not mean anything to
them, but at least I have my self respect.
