Dull and Overrated

In a particular scene, one of the "hostages" (one of the escaped
Americans from the taken-over Iranian Embassy) is looking outside the
window of the safe house, and he sees, right on the street, a guy
getting shot... The guy looking out the window has a blank expression,
and this sums up the overall suspense and vibe of ARGO that, until the
last twenty minutes when the characters are trying to silently escape
through the airport, has little momentum and simply goes through the
motions.The aspect about the fake film, that will provide a cover to save the
hostages, is rushed, and although Alan Arkin has funny lines, there are
very few obstacles for the characters to get that fake movie going...
One step to another, all the characters seem to sleepwalk through each
scene where people sit behind desks and talk to each other.Affleck's directing style is good, it looks good, but his performance
is dull and listless... Much like those hostages that we are supposed
to feel for but, with their horrendously distracting 1970's wigs and
mustaches, they're just wallpaper in a wallpaper experience.This is the most overrated movie of the last decade.
