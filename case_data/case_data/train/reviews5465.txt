An amazing combination

I didn't thought this combination of zombies and a classic novel/film
would work so well. The actors are magnificent and the argument stay
hold to the original story, the origin of zombies it not only well
explained but also is not abused and it stick with the drama perfectly.The scenes are beautiful, the costumes are gorgeous also the action
scenes fit perfectly on the right time having the right length for it
not being tedious or non sense.That post-credit just puts an awesome cliffhanger for a second movie
that i will obviously going to watch. Just don't prejudge this movie, swallow your pride and enjoy the
immortal film that all this people made for us.
