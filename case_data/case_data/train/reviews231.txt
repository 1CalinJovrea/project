You can wish for better!

For cheap horror thrills, you can wish for better because this movie
never goes far enough to truly scare anyone. "Wish Upon" isn't likely
to make much of an impression with dedicated genre fans, but should
play well to its clearly targeted teen audience. Unfortunately is
another example of everything wrong with horror movies. It is too safe
to be scary, too boring to be worthy of interest, too hilariously
obvious to be taken seriously and puts a promising young cast on a dull
and soulless story. John R. Leonetti offers no suspense or surprises
and can't get a decent performance out of anyone. Wishing this film out
of existence right now!
