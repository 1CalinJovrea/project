One of Clint Eastwoods finest directed movies!

The movies is about Chris Kyle's home life and military career with the
US Navy as a SEAL sniper. The movie has some intense moments,
containing violent and disturbing scenes. The movie doesn't portray
Chris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems
all soldiers have to face both overseas and at home. Clint Eastwood who
is in his mid-eighties, shows us he still has it, directing an amazing
film. The movie tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the first
book. Overall, American Sniper is a great movie that has all the
components, that make a movie great. For anyone who is a war film
enthusiast, this is a movie for you. To those who call Chris Kyle a
murderer and baby killer, I believe you fail to understand what
soldiers sacrifice to protect our liberties and keep us free.
