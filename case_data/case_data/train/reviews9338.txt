An absolute delight

In this variation on the Snow White story, most of the familiar
elements are in place, augmented by the dwarfs being robbers, and the
Wicked Queen having designs on the Prince (with a view to topping up
the old Exchequer).Julia Roberts, for whom I do not care, plays the Wicked Queen and plays
her very well. Lily Collins (daughter of Phil) plays Snow White, and
Armie Hammer plays the Prince.This film cleverly balances a fairly faithful retelling of the story
with a simultaneous gently subversive deconstruction, and I must praise
the script right from the start: it is both clever and funny. The film
looks terrific. Roberts is, as already mentioned, very good, and Lily
Collins is an absolute delight, sweet and vulnerable, yet also with a
degree of feistiness. She is also one of those rare young women whose
face is lit up when she smiles. The dwarfs and the Prince are all very
funny.This film is charming and delightful, and has a number of surprises,
some of which are a treat (the poisoned apple, and the musical ending,
to name but two). I loved it.
