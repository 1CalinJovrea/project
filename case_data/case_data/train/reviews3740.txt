Great film except not as great as its predecessor

Kick-Ass 2 was definitely a film for the fans, if you aren't familiar
with the Kick-Ass series then this movie wouldn't be for you. Having
said that I am a fan of the comics and this movie was awesome. The
fight scenes were crazy and Hit-Girl always runs the show. I hate that
the critic scores are low but I honestly kind of figured they would be
and I see why they made it so low, to a film's core this film wouldn't
be looked at as a masterpiece, and they couldn't exactly retain the
same shock factor the first one had because Hit-Girl was only 11 or 12
years old in it. But all things aside this was a pretty entertaining
film and I think most people would really enjoy it.
