Animation movie that stars Adam Sandler in a comedy that is fun for all ages.

This movie is definitely very funny. Overall the plot isn't something
that is a serious message and IF the audience accepts the fact that
they are only going to be getting a funny movie out of Hotel
Transylvania, then the experience will be much better. The evolution of
Drac's beloved hotel is apparent in this movie. When his grandson
enters the setting this changes the dynamic of the movie making it more
interesting. The animation in this film is nonetheless, absolutely
incredible. I have to hand it to the animation design crew, because in
that regard, this movie was something special. The introduction was a
little sped up, and the movie itself moves very fast so if you stop to
take a pee break, there's a good chance you will definitely get lost in
the movie. 9/10 from me. Patrick Clay
