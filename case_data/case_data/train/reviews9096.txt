A great animated film for all pet lovers

I got curious about this movie after seeing the trailers. Then my mom
and I saw it in the theatre; I thought it is another great animated
movie of the year. Also Max & Gidget are my favorite characters.The story is about Max living a good life in his New York apartment
with his beloved owner Katie. That is until Katie brings home a big,
shaggy stray name Duke, who Max thought is trying to muscle in on his
happy home. One day during a walk with the dog-walker, the resentive
Duke tricks Max into travelling far into the city, and they are
attacked by a feral cat gang in an alley. The cats remove Max and
Duke's collars and the dogs are caught by the city's Animal Control.
Fortunately the two dogs were saved by a rogue band called "The Flushed
Pets". That is all I could tell you folks.I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love
the whole film from beginning to end. I also love the movie's humor and
great animation. One more thing to point out is that Max was so cute as
a puppy! So overall, this is a great film for all pet lovers.
