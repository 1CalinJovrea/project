4
Bad, dull, un-original

A 4 is probably generous. I'm getting sick of the Elysium genre and
this is the same thing with the exception of some vivid dreams. The
elites have sequestered themselves on the same planet this time. The
plot is the elites can and do openly mind control everyone and
segregate the population the way they think it should be separated, but
some special people can't be mind controlled and have to be dealt with,
by violence of course. Suffice it to say it gets weird. I mean weird.
Goofy. Nonsensical. Unbelievable. All accurate descriptions of this out
of control mess. I didn't see the first one, and now probably won't
because I already want this 2 hours back.
