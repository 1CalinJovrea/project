A True Masterpiece

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see this film on the big screen, but
after viewing the trailers I was quick to pre-order it on DVD. I cut
myself out from the world of Chronicle so as to avoid any spoilers or
opinions, leaving me going into this film with a fresh mind, a blank
canvas. If my mind was the canvas, and this film was the artist, then it has
just painted a masterpiece. I have seen tons of films, yet this one
seems to have left a massive, lasting impression on me. It's an
interesting take on the 'found-footage' sub-genre and it's incredible.
We first see these seemingly normal high-school boys, one of which is
the classic quiet and disturbed teenager who has a bad family life. The
way this film deals with his life is perfect and it's entirely
believable. The thing that drew me into this film the most is what they do with
their new-found abilities. In reality, if we acquired super-human
abilities our first thoughts wouldn't be to help people. We are only
human, after all, and thus we would pursue money, fame or popularity.
This is especially true for teenage boys who are naturally reckless.
The film is soaked in originality and if you're obsessed with
super-human films like myself, it will leave your heart racing and your
mind so blown it will be splattered all over the floor.The story isn't exactly unique but it somehow manages to tell that
familiar super-human story in a new way. The reason that the main
character acquires the camera is natural and it's something that you
can imagine someone doing in his position. To tie it all together in a wonderfully neat package is the visual
effects. The effects are fantastic and it all adds to the realism. The
flying effects and fight scenes are all fantastically well done and
it's worth seeing just for that! All in all, great film. Whether your into super-human movies or not, go
and see it. You will not disappointed.
