Hawkins and Hawke shine in one of the year's best films.

MAUDIE (2017) **** Sally Hawkins, Ethan Hawke, Kari Matchett, Zachary
Bennett, Gabrielle Rose, Billy MacLellan. Poignant and wonderful biopic
about Canadian artist Maud Lewis (a compelling portrait of restraint
and heart-break by an Oscar worthy Hawkins), whose broken winged dove
of a human being, finds herself finding herself when she is ousted from
her family's home by her jerk brother and selfish aunt. Seeking
employment and a place to live she becomes the unlikely companion to
gruff worker Everett Lewis (well-crafted job of nuanced grouchiness by
Hawke) who eventually falls in love with the truly lovable and humble
Maudie. Filmmaker Aisling Walsh does a remarkably efficient job in her
big-screen debut after cutting her teeth on television balancing the
possibly maudlin and mawkish instead with undeniable warmth, compassion
and skill. Guy Godfree's lovely cinematography and the gentle score by
Michael Timmins are on point. One of the year's best films.
