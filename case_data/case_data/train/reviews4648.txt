This is a movie for every generation. It needs to be noticed, it deserves to be talked about, and discussed.

Aesthetically on high-level, questioning the most important points of
human life and importance of verbal, mental, physical, social,
emotional development and the inability of developing them all on the
same level. There are so many factors that influence one's development.
And there is space for many mistakes.High quality acting. Viggo Mortensen gives one of his best
performances, a devoted father that wants only the best for his kids,
an authority, a leader, a teacher, loving, loyal husband, a grieving
human with tough, determined, honest attitude he transmits to his
children. Kids, from the youngest to the oldest, act with such
naturalness that you simply dive in this masterfully-made journey.Film doesn't show how one should live and not live because both sides
are flawed. Internal and external conflicts make you question the
reality of the present, giving you space to find your own balance of
how one should live.I personally started thinking of how there is a massive space for
improvement in every field of our lives. An example is school. And how
devastating it is that one could neglect the knowledge at that extant.
Kids need to be inspired and motivated to learn. And more important is
that they have to build inner-motivation that will make them interested
and ambitious as they improve the world around them. And of course kids
can't be accused for not wanting to learn if the teachers don't show
them how and why to love their subject. And of course parents to
support them.This (above) is just one point of where this movie has taken my
entranced mind.This is a movie for every generation. It needs to be noticed, it
deserves to be talked about, and discussed. Because that is the point
of Captain Fantastic.
