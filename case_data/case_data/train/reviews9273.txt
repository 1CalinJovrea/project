Brilliant

The movie is brilliant in every aspect. Storyline is creative,
believable, and unpredictable. The mood shifts back and forth between
genuinely funny and terrifying and yet the story remains focused and
realistic. The direction is fluid and well-thought out. The cast give a
steller performance. The cinematography is top notch. What more is
there to say? This is the exact opposite of what I usually find so
irritating about most movies. This deserves an 8 star rating at
minimum, in my opinion. Watch it immediately.
