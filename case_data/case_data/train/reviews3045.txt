If it doesn't make you laugh I don't know what will

The Lego movie may not seem like your cup of tea and perhaps you have
instantly disregarded it as suitable for children alone, but I urge you
to watch this film at your earliest convenience and see if you too do
not become enraptured by this world of LEGO mini figures; and if the
end credits appear before you have even uttered a squeak of delighted
laughter, then I apologise for the misery that must be your life.
Because if the LEGO movie doesn't make you chuckle at least once in the
hundred minutes of on screen time then I cannot say I know what will. The fresh faced witty humour of the characters was refreshing and led
to shrieks of amusement from the prepubescent's that filled the cinema
and the belly laughed guffaws of parents alike. Unlike many children's
films to date, the film featured none of the thinly veiled innuendos
and stereotypes (commonplace in Disney films). Deviating from the norm,
the 'hero' of the story (subject to personal opinion) was unaware and
unprepared to fulfil his role and in actual fact, one of the main
lessons to be derived from the film is that anyone has the ability to
be someone special as long as they believe in their own ability to do
so. Instead of portraying heroism as something designed for the 'elite'
and privileged few who have been 'destined' for greatness since birth,
the recurring theme within the movie is that anyone can be a hero.Full review http://thatgirlreadallaboutit.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/the-
