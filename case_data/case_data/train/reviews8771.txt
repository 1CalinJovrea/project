Depressing, Disturbing Movie

My distaste for "Neighbors" has little to do with the overall poorness
of its quality. What gets me is the film's basic opinion of what is, or
should be considered, funny - an opinion that disgusts and depresses
me, and doesn't speak well of who we are as people. Seth Rogen (moping
around without a hint of comic energy or skill) plays a loser who gets
drenched with a deluge of filthy butt gags. Now comes the depressing
part: The movie (just like several Will Ferrel films) can't think of
anything for the "hero" to do with himself except to hurt and humiliate
the people who interfere with with desire to get what he wants. And
we're supposed to LIKE it. We're supposed to be CHEERING for these
babyish acts of sadism. Cruelty and amorality CAN, in fact, be a source
of humor (I consider "Ruthless People" one of the greatest comedies
ever), and "Neighbors" does provide one character (an ego maniacal
Me-generation yype) who's a fit target for the audience to enjoy a
little slap-down. But this overall assumption that there's an inherent
joy in seeing innocent people get injured or embarrassed (also
characteristic of Adam Sandler movies) leaves me asking, "What kind of
world am I living in? What's WRONG with people?"
