Let's bring Snowden back home.

I saw this movie as part of a small audience. Years ago, when the story
was on the nightly news, Our USA news media had distorted the story so
badly that I thought that Snowden was a spy. Now, I doubt that he was.
There was a question asked of President Obama that made it clear for
me. "Do you now consider Snowden to be a spy or a whistle blower?" I
think this is a very Good movie. The small audience applauded at the
end. It seems to be pretty clear that Snowden blew the whistle on "Big
Brother". You should go to see this movie. Take some friends with you.
There is very good dramatic acting. Good directing even though Oliver
Stone does make it very dark. Snowden wanted to stop government spying
on anyone. He would be a much better option for President than either
of our current choices. I admit to being an Oliver Stone fan. His
movies go into details that our news media ignores. Maybe we should try
to get Snowden to come back so we can hear his version of what actually
happened.
