I love the Fast and Furious movies, and this one did not disappoint. I
was blown away by the last film and didn't think it could get any
better than that, but boy was I wrong. From the very first scene there
was more action and suspense than you could poke a stick at.I wasn't planning on reviewing The Fate of the Furious when I decided
to go see it at the cinemas, but about a quarter of the way in I
decided that I simply must, because I want everyone to know what an
awesome film it is and that it's worth all the time and money in the
world going to see. The characters were consistent, as always. I absolutely loved the
banter between Hobbs and Deckard, and think they both bring so much to
the series. Deckard is the guy everyone loves to hate and oh, did I
hate him in the seventh film. However, I found him much more likable in
The Fate of the FuriousÂ— probably because he was one of the good guys.
Roman and Tej are also two of my favorite characters. They're always
witty and humorous, but both bring their own skills to the table.I must say that it absolutely broke my heart to see Dom betray his
family and his team. I still have no clue why he did it, and that's one
of the main issues I have with the film. The story line was quite
complex and I didn't really understand it, but I've never been good at
that. I think it's so cool that you can still enjoy the film without
knowing all the in's and out's, or every last detail. Dom's always been one of my favorite characters, although I was ready
to never forgive him after the stunt he pulled in The Fate of the
Furious. I think deep down I always knew he'd go back to his family and
do what was right, and needless to say, he's still one of my favorite
characters. I think it was very brave of the produces and directors to
take a crowd favorite and turn him into a character who most people
will probably now hate, but I think it was 100% the right thing to do.
Being the eighth film in a series, it would have been all too easy to
play it safe and pursue the same old story line. Instead, they changed
it up and did something no-one saw coming and which everyone hated by
turning the main character against his family. Can you imagine how
boring it would have been if none of that had have happened and
everything throughout the film had just been smooth sailing, without
any drama?Which brings me to the character of Cipher. I absolutely hated her, and
not just because she was the villain. I found her to be incredibly
weak-willed and boring. She made everyone else do all the hard work for
her, and where does she get off telling Dom what he should feel and
that what he is feeling is actually false? Blah, blah, blah. I didn't
know that she could read minds. Plus, who likes a character who turns a
good man against his family and friends, kills an innocent woman in
front of her baby, and threatens to (and almost does) kill said baby?
There's nothing that satisfied me more than seeing her fall to her
demise, and I would have loved to have seen her die a slow and painful
death. I give this film 9/10 because it kept me on the edge of my seat and was
an absolute joy to watch. It was a bit predictable at times, but name
one film that isn't.
