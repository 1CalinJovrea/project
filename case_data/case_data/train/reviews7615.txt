Sometimes the scariest thing about being a vampire is doing the dishes

This fly-on-the-wall mockumentary is a refreshingly silly take on a
genre that desperately needed sending up - vampires. If you thought
vampire movies had reached saturation point, think again, because What
We Do In The Shadows manages to lend it a thankfully comical bent.
Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement lead a solid cast of Kiwi actors
playing a small group of inept but lovable bloodsuckers living in a
flat together in Wellington. When a freshly turned convert starts
bragging about his newfound vampire status while out clubbing, things
start going wrong for the troupe, who until then had only to contend
with minor problems like what to wear on a night out when your wardrobe
is 400 years out of fashion, and how to go clubbing when nobody will
invite you in the door. Vampire gags come thick and fast and there's
enough of a solid plot to keep the movie entertaining. It even gets a
little bit tense in places when the flatmates start to fall out over
the new convert's bad behaviour. All in this is a very funny film, with
more than a few classic one-liners. A great date movie to check whether
your lover-to-be can handle a little dark humour. Highly recommended.
