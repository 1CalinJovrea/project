One of the best dark comedies of our time

This movie first drew me in because it was an R Rated Black Comedy. As
I have been on the lookout for them since watching the Voices, I
happily settled to watch this movie. And it was a good thing I did.
Firstly, the director, Martin McDonagh, is one of the best I've known,
and he did not let me down with this film. He managed to display what
he does best, creating a funny movie with a dark backstory. This was as
heart moving as it was heart-wrenching. If you needed an example of an
oxymoron, this would be the one. Funny and depressing, it tugs at your
heartstrings whilst keeping you on a journey of laughter.The cast, perfect. Being honest, I hadn't heard of France McDormand
before. But after this film, I will never forget her. An amazing choice
of the dead daughter mother figure, she's stubborn and great. Will be
seeing more of her work in time to come. Woody Harrelson and Sam
Rockwell have great on-screen chemistry. Unlike McDormand, I am a huge
an of Rockwell, loved his work in the Green Mile and Confessions of a
Dangerous Mind and if you aren't a fan of him for whatever reason
before this film, you will surely be one after. I'm surprised he
managed to sneak in a few dance moves as well, he really stole the
show.So, if you are looking for something to brighten your day, I cannot
recommend this enough. As I have said, one of the best dark comedies of
our time. Please, watch it, you will not be let down.
