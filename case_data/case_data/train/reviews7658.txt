The Dad, the Wardrobe and Dom.

About Time sells itself as a time travel romantic comedy. Its more
about relationships. A relationship between father and son, brother and
sister and two people who meet and get married. There is also some time
travel.Writer and director has some form when it comes to time travel after
writing a critically acclaimed episode of Doctor Who in 2010.Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is a shy and awkward teenager especially when it
comes to the ladies. On his 21st birthday, his father (Bill Nighy)
unveils a family secret. The men in the family can travel back in time
in their life stream.Soon Tim embarks to London to become a lawyer. He resides with a rude
playwright and when a date in the dark goes awry becomes he used time
travel to make the playwright's later stage play a success, uses time
travel to re-establish relationship with Rachel McAdams.The film is not a laugh out comedy, in fact its a mixture of romance,
drama, melancholy with a few laughs. There is the usual ingredients
that you find in a Curtis film, the upper middle class with an
eccentric family, a large house (by the seaside this time),) musical
interludes, spiky and kookie young female character and romance with a
transatlantic star. The time travel element is new and to be fair to
Curtis he has thought about cause and effect.The best scenes are with Bill Nighy and its a genuine, warm
relationship so you can guess that his father is going to bite the
dust. I never get if there was any real chemistry with Gleeson and
MacAdams. Dom was very good in the early scenes when he is young and
vulnerable but he could not sell it when his character got older and
had children.It was good enough to enjoy and pass the time but had very little
substance.
