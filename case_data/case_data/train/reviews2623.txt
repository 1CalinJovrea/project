Totally Unbelievable

Nothing rings true with this film. Not the characters. Not the
dialogue. And certainly not he situations or the characters reactions
to the situations. For this sort of absurdity I would expect to be
watching Will Ferrell.There was one scene of emotional trueness between Jane Fonda consoling
Jason Bateman. I would have like to have more of this, since the basic
premise of the story is a family reuniting after their father's death.I might have chuckled once, I know for sure I didn't laugh. More likely
my response was to say to myself, "That's stupid." I love family set
pieces and thought the cast could deliver, but as they say, 'If it
ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.' For me, it certainly wasn't
on the stage/screen.
