One of the best in 2013!!!

Though director Spike Jonze collaborated with Charlie Kaufman on Being
John Malkovich and Adaptation, the latter didn't have a hand in Jonze's
assured, moving fourth feature, but his spiritfiendishly inventive,
casually postmodern, self-lacerating, fearless, funny, and ultimately
deeply sadpervades the film. With Her, Jonze beautifully realizes a
future Los Angeles where a lovesick man (Joaquin Phoenix) in the midst
of a devastating divorce is so desperate for intimacy that he falls
hopelessly in love with an artificially intelligent operating system,
voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Jonze's screenplay acknowledges the
innate absurdity of the film's premise while spinning it into an
elegant, heartbreaking depiction of human loneliness and the innate
need for connection. For the setting, Jonze plugged into the current
era's technological mania to say something timeless and profound about
love, loss, and evolving desire.
