Visually Stunning...

Visually the film was compelling, but it lacked the storyline so needed
from the book. I felt a little disappointed watching it, thinking about
what they could've done. Separating my mind from the book I would say
stand alone the movie was exactly that, a great movie. My suggestion
is, if you've read the books then separate your mind from what you've
read except for basic skeleton of the storyline in the book itself. The
skeleton is their. They just gave it a slightly altered body build that
changes what readers and fans may have been expecting. In all I give it
a 6/10 for my own disappointment in the storyline. I leave out any true
spoilers in order to let you make your own decision about the movie. Good luck, and have fun.To everyone who helped make the movie. I appreciate your hard work and
efforts in bringing to life a fan favorite dystopia sci-fi novel
series, and even though I was disappointed I will still go see the rest
of the series in theatres. I started it, now I have to finish it.Felix felicis,BKL
