Battlesh*t

Battleship is bar none the worst movie I have seen in recent years. It
is a noisy, clich√©d and unbearable piece of trash that exploits the
work of CG artists and paying customers who just want to be
entertained.A simple way to describe Battleship, is that it's basically a $200
million naval recruitment video that was made by a schizophrenic 8 year
old who likes video games and things going Ka-Boom.The main heroes in this movie are indeed American navy sailors, but the
one thing the film-makers really failed at is making these people
likable and realistic. Taylor Kitsch plays the lead character, he's
basically some drop out loser who robs convenience stores to get
girlfriends and joins the navy at his brothers behest, and in what
seems like no time at all he becomes a lieutenant with big
responsibilities on a naval vessel with some few hundred men beneath
him. The special effects are the only thing to keep you invested, however
they're all completely CG so it just likes a cut-scene from a video
game . Something that should be impressive (like a ship sinking) is
made pointless because it's something clearly rendered on a computer.The soundtrack to the movie is okay composition wise, but it's often
loud and draws attention to itself and it sounds exactly like the
Inception soundtrack on numerous occasions.This movie has the shadow of Transformers looming over it, both in its
marketing and tone. Battleship however is far, far, far worse than any
of those three films and it could probably be used as a symbol for the
decline of western civilisation.
