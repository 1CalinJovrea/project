The emperor has no clothes

Part of the reason I wasted my time with this movie was because of the
good reviews. After watching it I could only reach the conclusion that
all those good reviews exist because no one wants to "look dumb" for
not "getting it" (not unlike most of David Lynch and Lars von Trier's
corpus of work).There are reviewers that will promise you some secret metaphorical
meaning, but given that the movie is as utterly disappointing and
unfulfilling as the "intelligent reviewers" are forthcoming with their
promises, I wouldn't hold my breath.Watch Synecdoche instead.
