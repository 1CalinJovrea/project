Meh

I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't get past all of the
little things they changed, or mistakes they made. The book was
obviously so much better. But, I do think that the cast was spot on,
they couldn't have picked better people to play each character. I hoped
that Paper Towns was going to be as big and as good as tfios was, but
sadly it just wasn't. I feel like they rushed this movie. They didn't
take enough time to let things unravel like they did in the book, I
mean, of course they couldn't have included every little detail or else
the movie would be way too long. But, i strongly believe that they
could have done a better job, by taking things slow and gradually
moving the story line along instead of pushing through everything. I
just hope Looking For Alaska meets some expectations.
