Fell Incredibly Short of Expectations

I really like D. Aronofsky's films. As a whole, he has a solid corpus.This film, however, had significant structural problems which shake its
foundation as a film.The film is split into two parts...Why? It's not clear. It's also not
clear what the two plot-lines mean. There is not "real" connection to
piece them together and the viewer is pushed to create their own...This viewer sees a meaningless old testament - new testament
relationship. But interplay? Not much. There seems to be a Cane and
Able story in the first half. You know what happens... But how this is
relevant to the main actors (the husband and wife) who take this couple
and, subsequently, their two sons in. The husband and wife host the big
family argument. Why? Dunno?The second half, when J. Lawrence, has her child, we are thrust into a
tired boy-Jesus plot line and his subsequent sacrifice a la New
Testament plot themes. But why? And what do these two halves of the
movie have to do with one another...apart from the first being an old
testament story and the second being one from the new testament.The ending is violent and contrived, yet is a very good dream sequence,
albeit Lawrence is not dreaming (or is he?).Two old Polanski homages, albeit super-heavy-handed, incessantly
bombard you throughout the movie...The Apartment and Rosemary's Baby.
But is it an homage or just meaningless lifting of motifs? The hole in
the wall and the bloody hole (aka vagina) are direct parallels. As is
the baby sacrifice or offering in both.All in all it was watchable. Had some interesting points. Good camera
work. Good effects. But the story doesn't hold up on any level, except
in the mind of some viewers who need to stitch it together and make
sense of it themselves in their own way...Perhaps that was the abstract
goal.
