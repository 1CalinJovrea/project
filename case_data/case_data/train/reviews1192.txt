Denzel challenges Neeson for the title of World's Oldest Action Figure

Don't misunderstand.Both Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington are in their 60s, both have
defied the laws of Physics by starting brand-new careers as Action
Heros late in life. and both are charismatic and talented enough to
pull it off.(Neeson with the Taken series plus a few other assorted action roles
recently; Denzel with the Equalizer franchise and this strange oater.) Frankly, I would be happy to buy a ticket buyer for all the action
roles they both can dish up. If both these gentlemen want to continue
to make these sorts of pictures for the next 20 years, I promise to
keep watching.However, leaving aside the star power of the lead in this production,
overall this film is a borderline remake.The original had a better ensemble cast, better music, and better
acting.This is an "OK" remake (as many other members have opined here) with
arguably better pistol-handling skills.And still a very nice way to spend a rainy afternoon.
