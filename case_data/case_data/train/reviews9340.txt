Wtf?

I'm not sure what I've just watched, and trust me, only the freezing
cold NZ winter day could have kept me inside watching this dross. Oh,
and Alexander Skarsgard's chest. I admit that. Where do I start? I get
that we've moved into a world where everything white and male is bad,
and everything black and female is good, but seriously? Trying to
squeeze the Tarzan legend into that narrative as well? Why not write
your own damn stories and leave ones like this in the past. So, we have
every single non-white person heroic; every single white person
psychopathic (except Tarzan, of course. Even Hollywood can't write the
narrative which puts Samuel L Jackson into the actual Tarzan role.
Yet). I resent having to pay for this ludicrous propaganda. I studied
African history for my degree. Where do you think the slave trade
originated? Who stopped it? Yeah, go do some research and answer those
questions for yourself. I think at the end of this movie (I don't care
if there are spoilers ahead; this film is THAT bad) Tarzan and Jane
have opted to stay in a squalid African hut to have their baby because,
ya know, who'd want a huge manor house in England with servants and
hygiene? I give up. This film makes me want to stop watching movies.
