The legend lives on...

First off let me say that I have been a life long Rocky fan. With that
being said I went into this film very cautious as almost the entire
cast and crew were brand new. The trailers looked good, but today a
good trailer is not necessarily an indicator of a good film. Sylvester
Stallone killed it as a much older and more breakable Rocky. Michael B.
Jordan's performance was as good if not better than Sly's. I think that
from this day forward anytime I see Jordan, I will think of him as
Creed and not whatever character he is playing. The story was
engrossing and well thought out. The film pays a great amount of
respect to the Rocky films while at the same time carving out it's own
place in boxing film history. Honestly I have no idea how accessible
this film would be to someone who's never seen a Rocky film, but I
think the way the story flows it wouldn't be too much of an issue.
Again, highly recommended.
