A mostly realistic look at a historical event

Patriots Day tells the story of the Boston Marathon bombing and the
investigation immediately after. It stars Mark Wahlberg as a police
officer on duty during the bombing. Peter Berg directs the movie with
care, editing news footage and surveillance footage of the vent.
Patriot's Day also tells the story of the bombers and the lives of the
people they crossed.Patriots Day is a riveting portrayal of the harrowing events of the
Boston Marathon in 2013. It presents both sides so the audience can
follow the investigation and the bombers. Through following the
bombers, the audience can follow and understand that the bombers are
not faceless antagonists. The bombers have their own agenda and
relations.March Wahlberg gives an excellent performance as an officer on duty
bearing witness to the bombing. The movie presents the police point of
view and their mistakes in apprehending the bomber.I highly recommend Patriot's Day.
