Delightful Dysfunction "August: Osage County"

Though nearly 40 minutes of Tracy Lett's Pulitzer Prize winning dramedy
have been shaved for the screen version, "August: Osage County" still
manages to deliver on the towering play's hearty laughs, gasp inducing
shocks, and well earned tears.While it is hardly the best adaptation of a play to a film, as much of
the film still retains it's indoor, staging setting, it is boosted by
some sterling performances of actors at the top of their craft. Chris
Cooper and Margo Martindale are stellar, playing off each other with
deft and precise timing. Julia Roberts has not had this good of a role
in... ever, and she mostly delivers. Julianne Nicholson is both quiet
yet fiercely determined as middle daughter Ivy. Sam Sheppard is amazing
in the even more truncated role of the Weston family patriarch who goes
missing, and Misty Upham is so good with so little to say as the young
Indian woman, Johnna, tossed into a family in turmoil.Of course the turmoil is led by the Medea-of-the-Midwest, Violet,
played for every ounce by Meryl Streep in one of her most indelible
performances ever. While viewers will surely be talking about the
"infamous" post funeral dinner scene, the price of admission should be
had for Streep's monologue late into the "second act," where she sits
with her daughters on a swing set and discusses the worst Christmas
ever: an acting class with the full gamut of emotion. Viewers may be equally divided by spending 130 minutes with such
unhappy people, but there are plenty of dark laughs in Letts'
screenplay to alleviate the tension. And with actors these good
interpreting the parts, "August: Osage County" is easier to swallow
than some awkward family dinners we've all had to attend at some point
in our lives.
