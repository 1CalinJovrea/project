Worst highly regarded movie of the year

My girlfriend and I were excited to see this movie--(97% on Rotten
Tomatoes)...but were extremely disappointed. We would have stopped half
way through, but were convinced something redeeming would happen in the
last half. There wasn't. Obviously we are outnumbered on this one. Why? I couldn't find a likable character anywhere in the movie. And
Francis--cute and endearing to many, it seems--came across as shallow
(with mindless drivel usually coming out of her mouth), spacey,
childish (comes off as a needy grade schooler at times), entitled (that
she can coach surf indefinetely) and selfish. She comes off as a
stoner/dancer trust fund kid who hasn't worked a hard day in her life.
She appears to be floating around New York with very little passion or
interest in anything. Even her "love" of dancing feels lukewarm as she
seems unwilling or unable to put any real work behind it (until the
final scene of the movie). And you fly all the way to Paris just to sit
in a coffee shop? C'mon. I'm sure this all sounds harsh for the vast
majority of people who liked this film, but I haven't seen such
annoying group of characters in a very long time.
