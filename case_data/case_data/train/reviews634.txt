As good as it could be, but far from great

"Porno" wasn't a great Irvine Welsh book, but at least it introduced
new characters and updated us on the whereabouts of the original
Trainspotting crew. The "prequel" Skag Boys was to my mind much much
better.The problem is, Porno couldn't really be filmed, as it concentrates on
the filming of pornography. So instead, some elements (but not many) of
it have been lifted to make T2, but most of T2 is "original". It's
around 5% Porno if that.However, I'd estimate that maybe 10 minutes in total of T2 is direct
samples of the first film. Sure, have a bit of it in there, but we all
know that T2 is a sequel of a film famous enough to have stuck in our
memories. And I felt that constant referring back was after a while
unnecessary, and intrusive.There wasn't a single scene in "T2" that could hold up to anything in
the original. Not one.Look, I'm glad I saw it, but it's not something I'd really watch again
more than once. Some films are classics because they are of their time:
Trainspotting; Pulp Fiction; the Big Lebowski; Withnail and I. Trying
to do a sequel for any of them is going to be a pointless exercise, you
could never do one that holds a candle to the original.What Boyle and co have tried to do in "T2" could have been much worse;
but it couldn't have been much better either. The past is the past, and
we should leave it there.
