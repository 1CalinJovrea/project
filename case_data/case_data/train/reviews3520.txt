Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse (2015)

This film is proof how much the world needs a zombie comedy flick.
There was no such thing until now. And how did we get there? Some
producer locked three writers in a room with some Chinese take-out and
told them you can't come out of there until you have written a zombie
comedy script. After much screaming and laughing they emerged three
hours later with a finished script. Rumors of production costs in
excess of $10,000 are greatly exaggerated. Zombies running amok: zombie
police, zombie cats, zombie strippers chasing Boy Scouts, zombie sex.
Gotta be good. This film should prompt a new rating: "Z" for zombie.
Not appropriate for women and children, small animals, old Republicans,
your mother, weirdos, or any other companion who could be at any future
time considered as a "relationship." There are so many Sci-Fi/horror
clich√©s in this plot it would be a most tiring endeavor to sort them
all out. Who cares? Never before in cinematic history has a town been
saved from a zombie infestation by Boy Scouts. Hats off to the writers
for this one. So, tonight, why not take in a
zombie-teen-comedy-stripper-like-fantasy-boy-scout-flick? C'mon. You
know you deserve it. Highly recommended. Very funny. 8/10 A sequel is
anxiously awaited.
