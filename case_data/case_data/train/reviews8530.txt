Sensual Italian summer

This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the
character's eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly you
feel, by God how you feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the very
best out of his actors: Armie Hammer's performance shows unprecedented
depth and Timothee Chalamet is the essence of awe inspiring acting,
this film will land him an Oscar nomination at the very least.
