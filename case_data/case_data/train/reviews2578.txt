Another Strong Aussie Thriller

I have always been a fan of Australian Horror/Thrillers. Let's face it,
with the vast outback and big Cities Down under, there is a lot of room
for varying plots and story lines that make for great entertainment."Hounds of Love" is a story set in the late 80's about a psychotic
couple who kidnap and abuse young women. Without giving too much away
about the story, it follows a common theme often seen in
Horror/Thriller Genra's made these days but, to its credit, there are
sub plots and other mysterious factors going on beneath the surface of
the main story.I thought the acting was above par and the low light settings in the
home and quirky behavior of the main characters (the kidnappers) lends
an eerie air to the film that works well to bolster the uneasy feeling
you get watching the film.There are many frustrating points in the film, which are by design. It
is no easy task pulling off scenes that get under your skin so much you
want to scream at the television or movie screen. This film does so on
several occasions thanks to the talent and ability of the director and
actors. What I enjoyed most about the film is the fact that a commonly told
story had many sub plot variations happening as well as sticking to the
main thematic plot. This, I found, was unique to the modern day
Kidnap/torture stories film production companies pump out as often as a
McDonald's commercial.Of course, you be the judge but I definitely recommend this film for
fans of the Genra/s. Anyone who has ever read any of my reviews will
know I am not one to hold back when a film stinks to high Heaven. I
tell it as it is. With that, you will get your $'s worth with this
film.
