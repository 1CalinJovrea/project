Creepy Carpenter shrine

Reminiscent of classics like Halloween and The Thing in tone, feel,
pacing and even score, It Follows is a neat horror movie doomed to be
mocked for its seemingly silly premise: a sexually-transmitted curse
whose victims are stalked by a slow-moving but implacable
shape-shifting entity, like a sort of zombie syphilis.Still, there is more artistry here than may be immediately obvious.
Writer/director David Robert Mitchell does a phenomenal job in terms of
atmosphere, creating a palpable sense of dread as the young
protagonists try to evade their supernatural enemy escaping through
gloomy, Bradburyan suburbs.7,5/10
