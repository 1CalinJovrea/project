A lightweight, with a heavyweight story.

Miles Teller has become an exceptional actor of his time. I was excited
to see his turn as Vinny Paz, the Boxer with the broken spine. A story
of overcoming impossible odds and agonizing pain seems like a role that
was tailor maid for Teller. When we last saw him, he was getting
slapped silly by an enraged jazz professor. Are we going to get
Whiplash-ed again? Unfortunately, not this time. Among moments of
greatness, Bleed for This is a totally missed opportunity. There is so
much you could do with this material. Why couldn't we go deeper into
the mind of Vinny? Why couldn't we see, in nuanced ways, how tortured a
champion boxer could be when he realizes that he can never fight again?
We do see this almost happening in the painful scenes of Vinny trying
to lift a bar with his severed spine, and the brutal scene where Vinny
gets his headgear unscrewed with no anesthesia. It's so visceral and
awful, you can actually feel the pain. But the rest of the film is a
cornucopia of boxing tropes. It's The Fighter meets Raging Bull meets
Southpaw.. and on and on. You've seen it all before.
