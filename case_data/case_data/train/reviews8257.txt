I am glad they left some secrets

I thought the movie was awesome.The main secret that the makers of the movie left out was where did the
supernatural power come from. The question was asked throughout the
movie and even in the end it was brought up again. I feel like for many
this was a big problem, but for me I felt it left good curiosity.The overall movie was filmed well. I thought it was going to be a
regular story about someone who becomes a here etc. However the movie
was formed off of realistic scenarios. Scenerios mixed with the science
fiction elements made the movie bring a sense of realness.Something I liked about the movie is the emotion brought out in each
character with the gained super power. I feel like each person watching
the movie could at least relate to one of them.To sum it up, awesome movie and great actors.
