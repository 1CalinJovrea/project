Darkly comical, ultra-violent and stylish as hell!

Wow! What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and
initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served
with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving
their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems
however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson
suspects that something is amiss.What follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes
that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The
acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens
and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst
simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits
well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film
remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us
with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as
a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving
spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've
seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of
tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set,
some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!A special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which
really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore
the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!Highly enjoyable and highly recommended!
