Forgettable and unnecessary

No Brendon Fraiser, no stars. Enough with the remakes already. Remakes
Remakes are not well made these days.Gohstbusters, Fantastic Four,
Total Recall, shoot now they are even thinking about remaking
Flatliners and Overboard. These were great movies that did not need to
be remade and degraded. Please have an original thought Hollywood, is
it too much to ask for? Anyway. It was a forgettable film that should
be lost in the dust.
