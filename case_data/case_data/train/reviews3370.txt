Harry Potter's Universe Without Potter is Just as Good

The magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well
through the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed,
but America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.Until now.The year is 1926. In the midst of the dark wizard Grindelwald wreaking
havoc in Europe, an unassuming man travels to New York City with a case
full of, well, fantastic beasts ( a case which goes full TARDIS, as
well). There's also an unknown magical threat tearing up streets and striking
fear in the hearts of the nomaj (non-magical, US term for muggle)
community. The Magical Congress of the United States is searching for
the culprit, and who do they blame? The unassuming man, Newt Scamander,
a role that Eddie Redmayne fits into perfectly.With the help of Tina Goldstein, a disgraced Auror, and Jacob Kowalski,
a nomaj who gets caught up in Scamander's creature exploits, they must
clear Scamander's name and find out who is behind the attacks in New
York and stop them.This film has a lot going for it, but it really holds up as an
installment of the Harry Potter franchise in the way that it showcases
the allure of the universe without the old story of The Boy Who Lived.
It is also buoyed by great visual effects and witty banter throughout.This will prove to be just the first of possibly many films in the
Harry Potter universe (and yes, Johnny Depp does show up as
Grindelwald), and if this film is any indicator of the wonder this
universe instills, I can't wait for more.
