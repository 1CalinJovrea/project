Really, really bad

I can't believe that Antonio Banderas and Ben Kingsley accepted their
roles in this clich√©-ridden, laughable excuse of an action movie.There's really not much positive to write about this wreck: I started
to watch it expecting something decent from the two leads (who are both
great actors) but I couldn't force myself to finish it.Cringe-worthy dialogue, way over-the-top action, bad acting and
absurdly ridiculous "tactics". This is bottom-of-the-barrel film making
at its worst. I only gave 2 out of 10 for Banderas and Kingsley.
