"When you hear something that sounds like a gunshot, drive."

Never watched the show, so can't compare the two, or whether or not
this is a faithful adaptation of it or not, but I loved this film. It
perfectly rides the fine line between straight 1960s spy movie
throwback, and satire of one.Villain is pure 1960s vamp/ femme fatale, Henry Cavill and Armie
Hammer's chemistry alone makes this worth watching. Hammer's twitch as
his anger reaches boiling point is a great bit of detail. Cavill really
reminded me of Roger Moore's Bond, specifically from The Spy Who Loved
Me. He has a suave, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing" attitude
throughout.Several scenes creatively have the action taking place in the
background, while the focus is on the foreground. A perfect example,
and maybe my favourite scene in the film, is Cavill sitting in a truck,
basically picnicking, with a large sandwich and bottle of Chianti,
while boat chase is playing out in front of him, reflected on the
windscreen.The film is rated PG13, but it doesn't look watered down to get that
rating, ... Henchman's electrocution torture scene was both graphic and
simultaneously funny- another case of the action playing out in the
background, while Cavill and Hammer debate the fate while in the next
room.The plot is a bit of a mess, especially toward the end, but a great
cast, sharp dialogue, and great attention to detail, and good action
makes this a winner
