"Lotta things you don't know about me," Nick Fury tells Captain
America And he could also be talking to the theater audience since so
far, through several films, the monotone, monologue-spouting
S.H.I.E.L.D chief has been kept on the peripheral And now he, along
with former Russian agent Natasha, can step into the co-lead spotlight,
which sadly winds up casting an extremely dull glow on everyoneEspecially our hero, Steve Rogers, who literally starts out in a brisk,
humorous pace and then has a bland pop culture conversation with fellow
soldier Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie, a forced sidekick
eventually donning his winged-costume befitting a bad cartoon,
awkwardly contrasting to the gloomy plot that's part James Bond, part
political thriller... The latter where Robert Redford, as a
stiff-suited wolf in sheep's clothing, fits like a dreary glove.Between spurts of bombastic action are lofty conversations about
American defense, questionable freedom, and glimpses into the first
movie including a pointless visit to Steve's old stomping grounds This
occurs after Sam Jackson's Fury has his very own car chase leading to
the introduction of a stealthy, long-haired assassin with limitless
fighting skills, equal to Captain America, and whose real identity adds
to the melodrama. (Tony Stark, where are you? These people take
themselves way too seriously!) The only good parts that seem worthy of  or that were already wasted
and/or spoiled on  theatrical trailers happen much too fast while the
head villain's wag-the-dog goal is not only cliché, but for a world
derived from comic book origins, and following up the cinematic
spectacle that is THE AVENGERS, this uneven, uninspired SOLDIER is no
fun at all...
