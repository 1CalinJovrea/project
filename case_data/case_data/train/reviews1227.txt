Felt Like my Intelligence was Insulted *****Spoilers********

I could not believe that someone actually approved this script and
spent money on this. This movie reminded me of 11 year old kids playing
spaceship - apologies to all 11 year olds out there. I cannot believe
these actors actually read the script and still wanted to sign on.However, I will say I was fascinated by the effect of being in a space
station. Those scenes were pretty good.Now, here is a problem I had since I had a hard time understanding some
of the dialogue. They were sealing off the ship so that Calvin couldn't
get to them. Yet, when the scientist was dying, there was Calvin on his
leg inside the space suit. How did it get there? Did someone explain
that.Possibly the worst scene was when the last two people were alone & Jake
all of a sudden comes up with a plan to use the escape capsules.I
though I would throw up!
