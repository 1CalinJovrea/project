masterpiece of kiwi humor

no-one does dry, self-deprecating ironic humour like the kiwis. Its a
unique blend of taking oneself too seriously, trying to be cool in very
awkward, self-conscious way (because its not cool to try to be
cool)resulting in apparently accidental absurdity known as "being a
dick". A vampire mockumentary is a brilliant vehicle for this kind of
humour, as vampires are supposed to have an undead, hypnotic kind of
glamour which can easily be camped up without seeming to do so
deliberately. The scenes where the vamps are trying to decide what to
wear for a night on the town without being able to see their own
reflection is a perfect example of this. This comic ethos also explains
why mortal Stu is so popular with the vamps...he's very cool because
he's not trying to be cool at all to the point of having no
personality. Ironically he's a total nerd.Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement (as Vladislav the Poker)and
Rhys Darby (as the leader of the werewolves) steal every scene they're
in. Rhys' attempts to prepare the werewolves for their monthly
transformation without losing their trousers whilst facing off with the
jeering vampires results in side splitting chaos. The zombies and the
cops are also priceless. Watch this on DVD because you'll want to replay these scenes. And don't
miss the feature Interviews.
