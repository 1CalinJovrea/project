I've read enough "it's not realistic" reviews.

First off, all of the scenes where the lead characters are shooting,
they're using live rounds. The first op, during the extraction...the
miniguns and M240s shooting over the actor's heads...it's live fire.
Even shooting the moving truck with an AT-4 rocket in that scene is a
real AT-4 being fired at a moving truck. The "actors" refused to do any
scene that was not real.My next peeve is that all of this happened...period. Some of the
details were changed like this: the scene where Rorke is hit in the
chest with an RPG that does not detonate...it did happen...just not
like that...and not to Rorke. The SEAL that was hit did survive, but
the RPG was lodged in this ribcage. And by the way, RPGs do not move at
600MPH...more along the lines of 80-100MPH...and not even close to that
at such a close range.The acting in the film is not acting at all...these are real
SEALs...this is how they are in real life. The point was to give the
general population a look into what SEALs do.But most of all, it's about what these guys are willing to give to do
their jobs. No recognition, minimal pay, and a job that keeps them away
for up to 18 months at a time. The only recognition these guys get is
when they die and their family is given a flag, and the SEAL emblem,
the Eagle and Trident...but never an explanation as to how or where.If you want a glimpse into the real lives of the most elite
counter-terrorism group in the world, then this is a must see.
