Is this what we have sunk to?

No spoilers here. I left after about 20 minutes so I couldn't "spoil"
it for you if I wanted to.If any of you are familiar with my reviews, you know I find the liberal
use of the f-word incredibly offensive, especially when some form of it
is used at least once in every sentence, and seemingly because the
writers don't have a very large vocabulary. The opening scenes are
peppered with it as well as a few extremely tasteless "jokes." Then the
credits roll, with a throwback backdrop of a musical of the Golden Age
of Movies, and you think, OK, this could be fun.Then onto more profanity coupled with supposedly funny domestic
violence, and a couple of cameos. The first by Jay Leno is
embarrassing, then Liam Neeson makes you think there might be enough
vignettes like this to make the movie worthwhile. But then the n-word
is used. I don't care if it is uttered by a black actress in reference
to a white couple. The second time she said it, I walked out.What I REALLY found disturbing is that some other theater-goers found
several things to laugh at. I live in a small community, and these are
my neighbors? God help us.
