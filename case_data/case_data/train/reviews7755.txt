Well Directed, Beautifully Shot, And Quality Acting!

When actors decide they want to make the transition to the other side
of the camera and direct films, it can be a dicey proposition. It makes
me even more nervous when said actor to director decides they don't
have the acting out of their system and want to keep acting, but with
"Wind River," Taylor Sheridan (best known for "Sons of Anarchy," but
also the writer of both "Sicario" and "Hell or High Water" with this
completing his American Frontier Trilogy) separates himself in order to
focus on directing a wonderful based-on-a-true-story tale.Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a tracker who works for the Fish and
Game Commission in Wyoming who gets caught up in the investigation of
the murder of a young Native American woman on a local reservation
during a series of brutal snowstorms. He partners with FBI agent Jane
Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) as they try to navigate the elements and even
the law as it pertains to the reservation itself and a very thin law
enforcement department headed up by Gen (Graham Greene).I know there is not much to the above summary, but that is all you
really need to know about this film, besides the fact that I REALLY
enjoyed it as one can do with the material involved. Make no mistake:
this is a dark film that deals with very haunting subject matter, so
there is quite a bit of weight to it, but Sheridan treats this story
with the highest level of respect by allowing his very well written
script to drive it while still shooting it beautifully. To see such
beautiful landscaping (actually shot in Utah) take my breath away while
still understanding the danger of what the elements bring from the
wildlife to the weather and even the inhabitants add a great layer to
the story, but what takes it to the next level is the score from Nick
Cave and Warren Ellis (not THAT Warren Ellis) that frames each and
every scene perfectly without giving what is coming up ahead.From a performance standpoint, I really dug the way that both Renner
and Olsen dialed it WAY back within their characters with Renner
keeping Lambert simple and focused on the task at hand and Olsen
showing how Banner is just trying to do the right thing while
attempting to understand the situation she in AND asserting the
authority she has representing the Bureau. Greene gives great balance
and levity to their dynamic while keeping his character involved as a
reminder of the heightened sensitivity of their situation.The Weinsteins' eye for film strikes again here, and I am also looking
forward to where Sheridan's career behind the camera goes as well. For
this being the second time he has helmed a film, this is incredibly
impressive and should at least be on your "need to check out" list if
not all the way to "must see".
