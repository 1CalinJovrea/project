Harrowing Film!

Whenever I watch a great film, I always have a sense of feeling
cleansed, as if a soiled part of me has been washed away (for the time
being anyway) by something on the screen that touches a better part of
my soul. THE HUNT certainly did that for me. The story is a simple one,
a man, a teacher, is wrongly accused of sexually misconduct with a
young child and his community, filled with old friends and
acquaintances, turn on him and make his life a living hell.Vinterberg's film brings to mind many of the same topics and is loaded
with the same visceral feelings that his first film THE CELEBRATION
touches upon, sexual deviancy, alienation, the mob mentality of the
righteous, mixing innocence with brutality in many of its most
heartbreaking scenes. Mikkelsen handles the main character Lucas both
with restraint, and a little explosiveness when warranted. It is this
fine line between stability and chaos, of the civilized world and
anarchy, that give this film an unpredictable quality. The entire cast
is wonderful and Vinterberg's direction and writing are spot on. Great
Film!
