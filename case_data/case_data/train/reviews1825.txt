Best Musical Reminder

I've read a lot of the negative reviews about Annie saying everything
from it's a lot of music to not liking Cameron Diaz to not liking the
ethnic Annie. I will say that I've seen the original Annie and all
other versions and it does what all the others do...THEY SING A LOT! It
is for goodness sakes...a musical! I would be very upset if I went to
an opera where they talked! I like the additions and the things that
they've added to the new Annie to make it match modern times. I also
really enjoyed Cameron and Jamie Foxx's performances. They were good
and refreshing. I loved the new Annie...not only was she cute as a
button but her performance was great! Don't listen to critics...go see
the new Annie.
