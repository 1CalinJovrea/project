Bad quality

I went to see this movie because of the actresses: Julia Roberts and
Nicole Kidman. Usually they know how to choose the movie they
participate in. With that script they gave them they did what they
could. The other actor "Chiwetel Ejiofor" was not good at all. It is
fine to adapt an excellent movie (The original one is from Argentina
and was a real masterpiece), but at least the adaptation should show
that some original work was done. Even if I knew the story, I found it
hard to follow at the end. I can only imagine how somebody that did
know the story would feel. I do not recommend this movie at all. I
strongly recommend the original one: El secreto de sus ojos (2009).
