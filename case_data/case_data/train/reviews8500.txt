an honest and unsuspecting message for our generation

Spring Breakers highlights the mindless popular culture that surrounds
youth of this generation. The reason for its controversy stems from the
fact that its target audience found its plot to be pointless, even
though that was the point. This film depicts the shallowness of the
modern definition of what is 'cool', like idolizing people that suck,
those that contribute nothing to society but cheap entertainment. This
sort of fascination blindly controls youth, the main reason so many did
not understand the meaning behind this movie: they are blind to its
influences. They think week long drinking binges, whoring themselves
out, and having no goals is cool, because YOLO. However, this film is
based off of these components and its audience deems the plot as
pointless. Funny. Spring Breakers is like this generation looking
itself directly in the mirror. Overall, Spring Breakers is full of outstanding graphics, bright
colors, provocative scenes, and young Disney turned Hollywood stars. It
was fun yet hard to watch, depending how serious of a reality check you
need (assuming you even understood that it was one)
