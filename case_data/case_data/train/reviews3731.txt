It wasn't what I was expecting

This is a strange clash of more recent clichés and movie trends; among
them are first person perspective, reality television like coverage,
recovered footage, lots of screaming and hysterics from characters, and
odd moments with monsters and other demons. The movie plays out similar
to characters in a haunted house; the exception here is that it takes
place underground in a variant I can describe only as being several
different levels of hell. A few characters live to tell the tale, but
not after a lot of heartbreak and a lot of other characters die. A few
characters are forced to relive their fears and other haunting
memories, without much explanation as to why it is in the movie to
begin with. There is also a lot of occult, religious and other
supernatural elements thrown about; one reference to the philosopher's
stone and the knight's templar also makes it in.The rest of the movie stars a girl that isn't afraid to video tape
herself as she goes off on an adventure  much against what common
sense might issue. She is a real go-getter and isn't afraid to pursue
what others might consider lunacy; if it means chasing down her
father's legacy and proving others right, then so be it. Much of the
movie involves her skills in archeology and assets as a Mary Sue
(perfect character), along with her persuasive personality in getting
others to come along with her treasure hunt. Most of the rest of the
characters aren't sure what they are getting into, but they know there
is a treasure to be found; others just seem to tag along as part of the
group and what happens happens.The movie is good for mindless entertainment; that is all it really is.
The rental available through Redbox is missing out on the bonus
features and is strictly a movie only.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=6997).
