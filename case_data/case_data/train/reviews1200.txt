If you're into sex, drugs and swearing, this film's a MUST SEE for you.

James McAvoy stars as Bruce Robertson, a detective in Edinburgh - who
by the way gets enjoyment out of his sexually abusive relationships,
drugs and, well, anything that might seem appropriate and would
coincide with the word "Filth". It really lives up to its name, the
film. Consider going to see it because it's one of those films that
might actually cheer you up - it has some humour here and there, must I
say. It's a rather unique comedy-crime film and has plenty of things
that'll make you laugh.McAvoy was cast right, as he gives a somewhat thrilling performance -
well actually, every film he's in his performance is perfect; whether
it's young Xavier or Wesley Gibson. To sum up, if you're into crime, comedy and drama, filled with drugs
and sex and swearing and...well, you get the picture, then you'll love
"Filth". Honest rating out of 10 - 8.0, 8.0/10. Edgy and funny, filled
with sexual references and absurdly obscene language - Filth is
something new off of something old. Great acting in particular, must I
honestly say!Thanks for reading, guys.
