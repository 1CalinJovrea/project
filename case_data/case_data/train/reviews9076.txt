Catherine Z. Jones is the hottest in the land when playing the bad one!

I have just seen this film tonight in Luxembourg, the famous Ruritanian
duchy. It is the first film in quite a time that really thrills me and
gets me high. Everything is very good, from the twisted but consistent
plot to the great cast. In fact, there were many films shown today at
the movie theater and when I saw Soderbergh, Law and Z. Jones were
involved I thought to myself: it can't possibly be a fail, and I am
glad to say now my assumption was utterly right. This is a real treat
like those we used to have back in the forties. The evolution of the
main character is very realistic and convincing, from an honest but
somewhat naive English shrink in NY to a red blooded survivor
struggling to get back his life in a ruthless legal jungle. In the end
we even get the morals from the tale, which I will not disclose for the
sake of a good watching. Much can also be said about a paranoic society
feeding on pills to live up to overwhelming expectations of success and
top-performance; a cowardly and hypocrite society which, ironically, is
not ready to take responsibility when things take, say, an unwanted
course. But, fortunately, these clever hints masterfully scattered
throughout the film do not harm the most important thing, a sound
mystery story with excellent players and a spectacular ending. Most
highly recommended by all means.
