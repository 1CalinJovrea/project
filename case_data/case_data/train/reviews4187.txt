awful movie

a male stripper died and some women tries to hide it by stupid
jokes.for them death is a joke (like most of the white dark comedy
movies) i think.poor direction and bad story.most of the Hollywood
movies releasing in recent times are worse than any other
industries.Hollywood should come up with some standard movies like
'manchester by the sea', else it will be a disaster for the industry.
