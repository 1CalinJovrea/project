Wow!!

Wow wow wow!! I've never been much of a fan of sequels but The
Conjuring 2 was incredible. I'm never one to jump at everything 'scary'
I see in movies as usually you've seen it all before & let's be honest,
nothing really scares you much when your not a teenager anymore.
However The Conjuring had me jumping all over the place. At one point I
even yelped, much to my embarrassment, but that's why we go to horror
movies! To be scared & the conjuring didn't disappoint. All actors gave
amazing performances & the story had you never in a state of boredom.
Walking out of the cinema I couldn't wait to see what The Conjuring 3
would bring! (Assuming we're lucky enough for another). Definitely a
movie to see in the cinema. I give it 10/10!! Great movie!!
