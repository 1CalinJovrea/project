Star Trek planet bound

The Good: Visuals were nice and the CGI were top notch. The Bad: The
story, the plot holes, the forced acting of dumb lines and the amount
of times I rolled my eyes, epic. The Ugly: The entire story was just
ugly, void of making a bit of sense or enough back story on the villain
to understand his motivation. His entire short back story felt
contrived. There were way too many "lucky" unexplained coincidences and
plot holes. It was like the writes wanted to show off CGI and cool
special effects and threw a bunch of stuff together to force a story
instead of writing a good story first. I was a kid when the first Star
Trek came out and was/am a huge fan, but I would rather re-watch the
Star Trek movie about saving the whales than re-watch this abomination
again. So glad I did not spend a penny to see it...
