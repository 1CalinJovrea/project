An incredibly unique and compelling drama.

The Place Beyond The Pines tells a unique, compelling story in a way
that I have never seen before. This movie kept me interested from start
to finish. It is far from traditional storytelling. The story is split
into three sections all very different from each other. I enjoyed each
section of the movie almost equally, but the first hour of the movie is
definitely the strongest. The movie may be slow to some, but I was
invested in the story from start to finish. This is the best I've seen
Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, no doubt. There are no bad
performances but Cooper and Gosling's stand out the most. Dane Dehaan
plays an important role and does a great job of it. Dehaan is
definitely a rising star. The tone of this movie is incredible, and I
would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama. It is the best
movie I have seen this year, and with the breakthrough performances
throughout, this is a movie you're not going to want to miss.
