What a load of rubbish

I can't believe I watched this trash. Well in fact I couldn't make it
to the end.I fast forwarded the last 30 minutes. I was so bored by it. Watching
this movie is like being tortured. I've never been tortured but I can
imagine it would be like having to watch ALL of the film.Having fast forwarded I did see the ending, and the ending is like the
beginning. A total non event.A big problem is I couldn't stand Tom Hardy's awful acting. His fake
American accent and body movements got right on my nerves.How on earth Hardy is considered a great actor is staggering. He's
awful. His only good film in my view was Bronson. Everything else has
been commercial claptrap. There's this and that dire 'romantic comedy'
he made last year.Going back to this movie, the rest of the cast are total clichés. The
story is a cliché. All of the acting sucks. The women in it are as
you'd expect them to be. There are NO surprises. Everything is a
cliché.Utter trash. Seen it all before. Boring, clichéd rubbish. NEXT! 1/10.
