Good Watch

I was actually excited for this film, but a little confused as to why
William H. Macy would want to direct Kate Upton. I really liked The
Other Woman, so I decided to give this movie a try.It was a great story, and kept me absorbed from start to finish. Not a
great comedy, or an award winning material here. But highly recommended
from this particular reviewer.7 STARS!
