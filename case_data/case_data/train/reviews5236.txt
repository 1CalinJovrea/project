I enjoy  it a lot. Ignore the critics.

I can't stand these unfair and unreliable reviews.So, this is my first review for a Chinese film. I would say I felt the
same feeling of excitement when I watched Lord of the rings (LOTR). I
even like The Great Wall more than the hobbit.We've watch hundreds of movies with bad reviews and we knew that as
long a film has at least one 10/10 fair review, don't hesitate to watch
a movie. Ignore the noise of negative people. Let them get sick with
their views.This is great movie that combines history and fiction. Enjoy it! Just
like what the actors said.. "TRUST"!!!
