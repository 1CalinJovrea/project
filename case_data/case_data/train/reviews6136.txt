As usual, over-egged hollywoodian pudding

Wow, I saw like the 5 first minutes of it and although I am a
Fassbender's enthusiast, I couldn't get past it.By chance, I fell on Polanski's Macbeth. 1971, Ladies and Gentlemen.Well, let me tell you, this man may have made a terrible thing once but
he was a movie-maker. No need to have millions of budget. The very first seconds, there is
like something in the air, that is not something you see, but you feel,
and that is the soul of the movie, that the actors, the scene,
everything is put there to be felt.I have not felt that in today's Macbeth.
