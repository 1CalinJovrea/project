Funny Movie, that's all

I agree with most of the people reviewing this movie. Yes, it doesn't
make sense at all and it doesn't follow a plot line. I mean, all of
their old high school friends live in the same town and they run to
each other every second, as if that happens in real life. Many things
doesn't make sense also, but.. the point of the movie was to laugh and
I sure did!I laughed during the entire movie. Many scenes were great. The bus
driver sleeping in the K-mart bed was hilarious. Every scene the frat
guys appeared were funny also, they were portrayed as the most generic
frat guys which make them funny.The acting was good also in my opinion. Everyone played their character
right. It also had a lot of witty jokes in between that not many people
get.To summarize this review, want to have a good laugh, watch this movie.
Want to watch an Oscar academy movie with awesome storyline, don't
watch this movie.
