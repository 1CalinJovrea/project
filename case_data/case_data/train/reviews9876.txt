I would rather perfectly pitch myself off a building than watch this again.

I was never planning on seeing this particular movie after seeing the
unfortunate trailer. However, I had heard good things about it from
people who's opinions I used to trust. I won't make that mistake again.
Pitch Perfect was awesomely terrible. It began innocently enough, but
then it quickly devolved into a mash-up of just about every single
clich√© one can fathom. It has the loner girl who doesn't want to try
new things but then she gets involved with a group and she has friends,
yay! The girl falls for the guy, but she screws it all up, but don't
worry they get back together in the end. The group starts out terrible,
but then because of the new girl with fresh ideas they step up and win
it all! So many eye rolls in one film!Even after this, the worst part of the movie has to be the awful sound
mixing. The songs are so doctored that one is painfully aware of the
actors' lip syncing and it takes you right out of the movie. They could
have at least tried to make it sound like the songs were being recorded
live, rather then using so much auto tune and other forms of voice
manipulation. Then there were the plethora of jokes throughout that fell so flat it
hurts. Some of those jokes were even repeated multiple times, because
once wasn't bad enough. At least Rebel Wilson provides a few brief
moments of relief from the onslaught of worn out and unfunny jokes.But, like, that's just my opinion. If you like terrible things like
Glee, then you will probably love this movie.
