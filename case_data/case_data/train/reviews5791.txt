A twenty-first century political fable unrelated to Alan Turing

This film, while entertaining, aims mainly to be a purely twenty-first
century anti-bullying parable, regardless of the historical truth about
Alan Turing. While I have been more firmly opposed than most to
boarding school bullying, in this case, the nobler the goal, the worse
the writing. The film tries unsuccessfully to make Turing both a
friendless quasi-autistic lone genius, and the head of the entire
decryption project; neither point has any relation to reality, and
barely cohere to each other. (I admit to some bitterness about this
slur on my grand- supervisor, since it implicitly denies the existence
of my graduate-school supervisor.)The film also does disservice to Joan Clarke's genuine contributions,
substituting a muddled and completely ahistorical subplot about her
professional dependence on, and mathematical superiority to, Turing,
while seeming more concerned with her appearance than her intellect.
