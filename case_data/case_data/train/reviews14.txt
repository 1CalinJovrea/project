True breath of fresh air in a time full of poorly-written movies and cheap special effects

First and foremost, this is not your typical mainstream summer movie.
However, if you're reading this, then I'm sure you've already seen the
two preceding films, Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. If you have,
then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. This movie is driven
by the characters and their dialog. No fancy special effects, no
elaborate sets, no uber-popular actors to stuff in the movie to make
people watch it. Just great dialog from two excellent actors.Now that that's out of the way, I was a little uninterested when
hearing about this movie, that it was filmed in Greece. However, after
seeing the film tonight, I find that the setting was quite lovely and
really had little to do with the movie itself. The movie was more about
how these two main characters are dealing with getting older and being
parents, and how over time, your opinions about things and about each
other can change.One thing I've always liked about these movies is the gritty realism of
the two characters. Being an American myself, and previously having a
French girlfriend (and living in France), I can totally relate to the
two characters and the idiosyncrasies that are attributed to both of
them in this story of their lives.This movie was, once again, a model example of good dialog and great
characters! I was very happy to see this movie, and I'm glad to see the
writers haven't lost their touch. This movie was written by not only
the director, but also the two main actors, and this series is really
their "baby" - you can tell much love and care went into these films,
even though they are all shot very quickly and with a small budget. I
love how there are very few cuts in most of the scenes, and you can
tell that everything about this movie was simple. This is a true breath
of fresh air in time full of poorly-written movies and cheap special
effects.
