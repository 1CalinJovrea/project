An OK movie to watch

This is definitely not another lets go to Vegas, party and end up in
trouble movie. The movie is about friendship, life and how our life
passes so quick that one day we think "where did it call go"? Movie
also reminds us that the most important thing in life are friends.The cast is promising - freeman, De niro etc. They do not disappoint
and the movie itself is enjoyable. Definitely watchable but not the
best one out there at the moment. Easily followable and you do not have
to think that much.Overall the performances are average, the story itself is nothing
special.
