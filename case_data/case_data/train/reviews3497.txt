Much better movie than we expected!

I see this movie currently has a 6.2 rating on IMDb. In my opinion,
that is far too low a rating for a movie with this much going for it.
The script is well-done, the cinematography is absolutely fantastic,
special-effects fantastic, the acting is mediocre, but you can't have
everything or it would be a 10! Not much gore, but instead has plot
twists that caught my son and I off-guard. Seriously, rent or buy this
movie, and watch it late at night. It will give you thrills and chills,
and that's what a good horror movie is supposed to do.
