People need to stop bashing this movie; it was a lot of fun.

So I realize there plenty of cynical people out there that think
enjoying a fun musical isn't as cool as bashing it. If you listen to
these people, then pretty much everything "sucks" or is an "epic fail".
I don't think this movie is being given a fair shot. First off, Tom
Cruise gave a great performance and, believe it or not, sings rather
well. The plot was slightly predictable but, nevertheless, the movie
was fun and energetic. If I had to give any criticism, it would be that
Mary J. Blige was underused and Alec Baldwin delivered a couple of bad
lines. All in all, it was a very entertaining movie. I realize people
like to get on the net and complain and say how stupid everything and
everyone is, but don't let that sad, grumpy mind-set keep you from
seeing this movie. The song performances alone are worth the price of
admission.
