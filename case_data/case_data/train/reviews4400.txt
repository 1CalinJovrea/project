RIP Alien

The Alien franchise is now a caricature of its former self. Forumulaic
and predictable, in the Alien: Covenant, the accountants have taken
control of the story. So many scenes were unnecessary with a
disconnected mixture of styles, it seems as if the story was pieced
together by a committee with each member allocated their portion. Just
like in the movie 'Life', expect the crew on spacecraft to be totally,
unapologetically, inept in every sci -fi movie these days. I don't
understand how this is meant to be entertaining. But more disappointing
is the predictable ending, and the lame 'reveal'. Ripley's intuition
was on the mark, but in a universe of possibilities, is this best that
writers can imagine? There is a great deal of pretentiousness here,
allusions to cultural supremacy, and we have seen this all before. This
isn't sci-fi. This is a Marvel comic.
