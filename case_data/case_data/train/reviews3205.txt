Please do not waste your time or money on this nonsense. Oh boy where
do I start. OK for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells
everyone that Neil Patrick Harris "kidnapped" her (Rosamund). He did
this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he
cleaned up. Then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to
burn!!!!! (how does he even know of this location)?????? But he makes
such a p!$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do
properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood. and no one questions
this even once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one even looks for any wounds or
asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh and
the hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. No
flipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for wounds
especially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read the
other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring
mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense. I really wish
IMDb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even
rank a 1. I give this -5 for utter bull$h1*.
