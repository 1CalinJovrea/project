Once Was Enough

You can get so far ahead of this picture, you may have to go to the
corner for snacks and back to let it catch up. If you don't see a plot
development coming, they will sing a song about it. Don't worry. I have
a soft spot for movies about music and musicians who triumph although
the music is undeniably terrible. And it is. Keira Knightley, I assume,
does her own whispery, little girl singing and the acting is in the
mumble, behavioral style which is sure-fire to glaze your interest in
most any of the characters. We are told much was improvised. Much like
the music that was not written because no one here reads music or can
compose. Songs are "written" in diaries or on crumpled pieces of paper
lending them "authenticity" in this type of sing spiel. Mark Ruffalo
gives the film some weight and humor, as he always does, but he's
wasted in this less than middle-brow pawn to the pop music industry.
Knightley looks anorexic and actually seems to lose weight during the
film and developed a prominent under bite by the end. James Corden has
enough to do to show he could be a major film actor with the right
script. Cinematography shows New York's lower east side at its
seediest. Catherine Keener, as fine an actress in films as there is,
gets the thankless ex role.
