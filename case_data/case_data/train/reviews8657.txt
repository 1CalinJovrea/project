The prequel that no one asked for, but everyone will watch.

Monsters University: the prequel that no one asked for, but everyone
will watch. It would appear that Pixar has recently run out of original
ideas and has resorted to making sequels and prequels of older more
successful movies (Cars 2, Planes, Monsters U and Finding Dory). That
being said, the film was actually pretty decent and was rather
watchable and enjoyable. The film had multiple unexpected twists, which
avoided having an all too predictable ending. It also explained many of
the features of its sequel, like Randall's rivalry with Mike and Sully
and the Abominable Snowman. Reviving the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve
Buscemi and adding Helen Mirren and Charlie Day, amongst others, this
film stayed within the universe that the original movie had created,
however in comparison failed to live up to its predecessor's greatness.
