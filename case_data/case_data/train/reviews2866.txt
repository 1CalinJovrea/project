Go to a zoo and see real apes instead.

Seriously, if you want to see 2 hours of apes locked in a cage then
just go see it in person at your local zoo. The $15 admission fee is
for about the 15 minutes of CGI. This movie dragged on for so long that
I actually began rooting for the humans just so this thing would end.
It truly has more plot holes than the Zapruder film. And that's not
even mentioning the absurd ending that makes absolutely no sense. Woody Harrelson is still a legend.
