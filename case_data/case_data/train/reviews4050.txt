I watched this movie in 3D with my (very mature for his age) five year
old grandson. He loved it and wanted to talk about the plot for most of
the afternoon to anyone who would listen. However, other young children
in the theatre were rather nervous and scared in certain parts of the
film and a few very small (2 - 4 year old) children had to be escorted
out of the cinema by their parents.Personally, after the first five minutes, which were a bit slow, I
became absorbed in the story and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There
was lots of action and the plot was attention grabbing and unique, with
no soppy love story and little slang included.
