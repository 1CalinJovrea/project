Riddled with plot holes that ruined the experience

Acting and CGI was great, even the story was great too.But the HUGE, HUGE, HUGEEEE plot holes killed it for me, making the
film unbearable to watch.*spoilers*1. Why did Logan not kill the Dr, the clone, and Donald Pierce while
they were laying defenseless and half dead at the farm?2. Why did the black farmer attempt to kill Logan after killing the
shaved clone Logan? Logan was clearly standing in a non-aggressive
manner and even let himself get shot without saying a word???3. How did Charles Xaivier not detect that the Logan clone was not a
mutant or not human? His power is to read minds and detect life... How
didn't he realize a robot has just walked into the room and sense he
was about to be killed???4. The year is 2029 and the army has not developed the technology to
capture kids safely? Hell even a net gun or taser would have worked
better than tackling the kids? WTF. They even had harpoon guns that do
not kill and they didn't use them on the kids, instead they just chase
them through the forrest...5. In the final scenes the children take turns using their power on
Donald Pierce (just to make a cool montage), while Logan and Laura
battle to death with the clone??6. The children are trained to kill and have no fear, yet they run away
(from no one) while letting Logan fight the clone alone? They were 20
to 1 and they decide that it's time to run?7. Even though they were so pressed for time and had no time to save
Logan, they make the time to have a burial for him? Also what the hell
is with the cross they made? Were they taught religion while in killing
school? Seems legit.SO yeah these points infuriated me.. Feel free to comment and rebuttal
my points as I am keen to find out how nobody else is seeing these
loopholes...
