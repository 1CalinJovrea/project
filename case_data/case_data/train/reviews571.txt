I'm going to pretend Taken 2 never happened!

Terrible and a major disappointment to anyone that loved Taken like I
did! Weak plot, terrible action and preposterous storyline make it
laughable. I know the first one was far fetched but much more
believable. Takes away from the first one!!! The fact that Kim couldn't
get her license and then magically can drive a stick shift is
ludicrous. The fight scenes were filmed too close up to see and the
Albanians were made to look like total idiots by missing every shot and
Liam landing everyone of them. The story was slow to start and seemed
filled with fluff. The movie ends without a real build up leaving you
wondering..... What just happened?!
