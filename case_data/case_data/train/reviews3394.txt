You Won't Regret Watching This

Being a fan of the director's work, I built this movie a bit too much
up in my head. But honestly -- it delivered on everything. It's funny,
it's sad; there are happy moments, and deep emotional ones. But despite
the drama and comedy going on in this, it also addresses problems going
on in our world, and really made me think about these issues.If you're a fan of the director's previous work, especially "The Host,"
then you won't be disappointed. Even if you're not familiar with his
work, you won't be disappointed. If you can get past the slight
weirdness of this movie (which might not fit everyone's taste), I can
promise you that you won't regret watching this.
