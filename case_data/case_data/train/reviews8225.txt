Did Columbia Make This Film Just For Me?

I am gonna say it... This film is as good as the first one.It's a roller coaster ride from frame one. The production and writing
teams don't make the mistake of being complacent, as can so often
happen in a third installment. No-one messed too much with Elfman's
engaging and original soundtrack, either. Old themes are revisited, but some clever plot twists, Sixties
references (which I loved being a child of that Era) combined with
fresh and interesting characters put MIB 3 on a par with the now
classic MIB 1.The comedy dialogue is snappy too. I found myself chuckling through
most of the scenes where Smith plays off Tommy Lee's deadpan style that
worked so well in previous MIBs.Josh Brolin is superb as Young Agent K, adopting Tommy Lee Jones
mannerisms and inflections with spooky skill. Jermaine Clement is a
convincingly psychotic Super Baddie, assisted by outstanding CGI that
the Special Effects Team have perfected on MIB films.The plot races along but I won't mind watching this film a few times to
try and understand everything that passes. Right at its centre is a
feel good story that ties up a few loose threads. I won't spoil the
ending for those yet to see it, but I did shed a tear.
