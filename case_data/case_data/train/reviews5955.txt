It's Not bad, Considering How Hard an Adaptation it is

Hemingway was terrified of being boring. Compared to Hemingway, Kerouac
was completely & utterly fearless.So let's take a page out one of Kerouac's best books, start at the
beginning, & let the truth seep out.I first encountered "On the Road" in the public library when I was in
6th grade. It spawned a fascination, an obsession, an addiction.
Between the age of 12 & 18, outside of school, the Beat writers were
all that I read. I devoured them. And in the years since my youth
Kerouac has morphed from an obsession to a comfort author, I read him
to help cushion the blows life brings. "Maggie Cassidy," is still my
favorite.That being said, I walked into this flick with extremely low
expectations. I'm more than familiar with the source material &
couldn't see how it could translate into anything but a dull film. I
expected the film to stagnate. I wasn't really disappointed in this.
Anyone that has read "On the Road" has to question the wisdom of
attempting to translate that into a decent movie.Like the novel, there are parts of this film you just have to fight
through in the hopes that he'll move off his love for grape picking &
into something interesting again.The plus side is, once you make it past the stagnation, the plot picks
up again & you feel the sense of freedom having overcome the monotony
of Kerouac. But on the other-hand, I'm fairly certain that's the point.The bottom line is that if you are familiar with Travelin' Jack you
know what to expect before you walk into the film & you walk out with
an experience far better than you would have thought it's be. It's an
enjoyable film.However, if you're like most of the world & for some reason do not
read, you'll be expecting the legend without understanding the reality
& you will hate it, for no other reason than the lack of background
necessary to expect Kerouac to be, well, Kerouac.
