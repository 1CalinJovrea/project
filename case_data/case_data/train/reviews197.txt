Better than expected

This is an above average horror movie. First the good points: The cast is A list - after all 2 Oscar winning
actresses as daughter and mother - Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue
(who hasn't aged much). Max Thieriot (now of Bates Motel) is their next
door neighbour who lives in a house where his parents were murdered.
The acting is good and there is some build up of sympathy with the
characters in the story. It's not supernatural so it's not too implausible. Doesn't have too
many shock tactics. I'm kind of sick of the recent supernatural horrors
with Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz and the one with Katie Holmes and
Bailee Madison. It's not too slasher like too. No violence that doesn't
advance the plot.It's got some faults: Firstly the closeup photography is a bit too
close up. Can't see the whole face. A bit jerky too.There is a twist of course which is not totally unpredictable. Overall kind of enjoyed it.
