Rough Night without the stripper

I think one of the biggest differences between this film and Rough
Night was this one is obviously geared more toward black women. While I
did enjoy this movie I laughed harder during Rough Night mostly because
every funny scene you see in Girl's Trip was seen on the preview. It is
easy to compare the two movies because the story lines are very similar
and they came out in the same year. Both are about a group of college
friends who reunite after years and go on a trip together. Both have a
leading lady who live lives in the Limelight; one being in politics and
the other a self-help novelist. However Girl's Trip did have what Rough
Night was lacking and that is better chemistry between the women. I
felt they were more believable as long time friends. It was an
entertaining raunchy comedy with heart and feel good moments a lot of
us can relate to.
