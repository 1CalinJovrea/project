Terrifically fun popcorn action

After the noisy and irretrievably stupid (though reasonably
entertaining) Into Darkness, I wasn't desperate to watch this one, but
when I finally did I was relieved to discover that it was even more
enjoyable than the first film in the reboot, a rollicking adventure
with terrific alien weapons, fun McCoy/Spock repartee, a promising
newcomer alien, and a lot of really excellent action scenes. The movie had almost all the qualities of the original series except
one - the thinking part. The smartest thing in the movie is the funny
opening scene, which suggests the difficulty of communication between
different cultures. But that's the last thing in the movie that suggests even a moment of
thought. The main villain has very little in the way of motivation, and
when he explains his purpose it's quite disappointing. Nothing in this
movie is there to provoke thought, and I'm not entirely convinced that
anything in the movie really makes sense, although there's nothing at
the time that hit me as too absurd to live with (unlike the previous
movie).If you expect this movie, like the series, to explore racism and war
culture, well, you're not going to be happy. But if you just want some
old-fashioned action with some familiar characters, this totally hits
the spot.
