there's more than meets the eye

In June, 2013, it came out that the National Security Agency had a
massive espionage network in place. Within a few days, the source of
the information revealed himself. Edward Snowden was a computer
professional who had been working first for the CIA, and then switched
to the NSA. Before long, his conscience started bothering him, and so
he downloaded evidence of the espionage network, flew to Hong Kong, and
revealed it to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, while
director Laura Poitras filmed the interview. Without a doubt it was the
biggest story of 2013.This story got told in Poitras's Oscar-winning documentary
"Citizenfour". Oliver Stone's "Snowden" tells the story, but also looks
at the years leading up to Snowden's employment by the NSA: his
military service, his stationing in Geneva, and then Japan, and finally
his employment with the NSA outlet in Hawaii.I don't know if I would go so far as to call this a masterpiece, but
what's mind-blowing is the sheer scope of not just the espionage
network, but everything else that it comprised. Without a doubt, the
most important scene is the worldwide revelation of Snowden's leaks,
and Snowden's subsequent flight to Russia, where he remains to this
day.Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fine job as Snowden, as do Shailene Woodley
as his lover Lindsay Mills. The rest of the cast includes Zachary
Quinto (Spock in the "Star Trek" reboot) as Greenwald, Melissa Leo
(Alice in "The Fighter") as Poitras, and an assortment of other people,
including some surprise cast members.All in all, I recommend the movie. Even though the viewer knows the
plot, it's still a suspenseful story.
