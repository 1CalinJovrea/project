Best Thing About This Is The Special Effects

This movie was a major disappointment in my opinion. I've read the
books and I loved them so I thought the movie would be pretty good too!
I was wrong. Problem one is that it was a little too slow. They could
have easily shortened 10 to 15 minutes of this movie but yet
unnecessary parts were added. Problem two is that the acting was just
not good. They could have done a much better job and at least tried to
act in character. The biggest problem is that this movie was just
stupid. It took them up until the last 20 minutes to reach their
destination and to get to the whole point. Up until then there were
just time wasters. The only good thing about this film is the special
effects. I saw this in 3-D and i give it applause for its amazing
graphics and special effects. Other than that though, this movie isn't
worth seeing, it has countless flaws and problems. Don't waste your
money on it.
