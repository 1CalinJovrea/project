A nightmare world on videotape

Arranged around and within a tenuous wraparound home invasion scenario,
the vignettes that comprise this shakycam shocker prove memorably
effective, each lulling the viewer into a false sense of security via
meanderingly mundane set-ups that abruptly shift to more unnerving,
visceral territory. Old tropes such as alien interference, haunted
houses, serial killers, and femmes fatales find themselves fed through
the lens of the hand-held camera to rather impressive effect. The
overall picture painted by these series of snuff flicks-within-a-flick
is one of a world sporadically at the mercy of an otherworldly array of
entities, with the glaring unremarkability of its setting serving to
amplify, rather than undermine, the atmosphere of cosmic malevolence.
All these elements amount to a punchy anthology which succeeds in
overriding my antipathy toward the dreaded jittercam technique - no
mean feat!
