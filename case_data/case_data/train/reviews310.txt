Had the potential but not delivered well

This movie has a good concept and the initial ground work is there.
Problem is they jump from past to future without the viewer realizing
it in many instances so it gets confusing trying to keep the story line
straight (all they needed to do was add a year or something to the
bottom corner of the screen). A few scenes do not make sense leading up
to the finish of the movie as it is confusing if your are watching past
or current events unfolding. Ryan Reynolds basically made this a decent
movie with his acting skills, the rest of the cast are kind of annoying
to watch. All said, what really made me positive I would never watch
this again is that it just goes from being at a pinnacle point that
they could have built up a huge amount of suspense and finished with a
bang to a quick non suspenseful ending that just closed a few loose
ends and ended the movie.
