It should have been called Satyrs of LI instead of Wolf of Wall Street

It's hard to find the words to explain how TRULY AWFUL this film is.
I'll try to do a list:1) There's no context: They never show the victims of the fraud. We see
the sales effort but not the people they're selling to. How can you do
a movie about people perpetrating a fraud without showing the fraud &
its effects??? 2) There's no character development: They all start out as disgusting
creeps and they all end up being disgusting creeps. 3) There's not much of a plot: It's 2 and 1/2 hours of debauchery and
then 1/2 hour of getting caught. The debauchery part goes on forever
and gets boring really fast. Not to mention disturbing & disgusting.
Did Scorsese really make this movie just to show all this debauchery?
What's the point of showing 2 and 1/2 hours of it? We get the point
that they are gross lunatics pretty fast. Why keep going with seemingly
endless variations of it? There is no point to it. So, when all is said & done, this is basically a movie about
debauchery. It should have been called "Satyrs of Long Island" instead
of "Wolves of Wall Street" because these turkeys operated from LI and
there's practically nothing in the movie about actual Wall Street
firms.
