emotional roller-coaster - but average script

I watched The Impossible with a clear intention to remain a little
emotionally detached. I knew from the trailer that a disaster was
imminent from the word go, so I braced myself for impact and kept my
fingers crossed that Ewan Mcgregor was going to give more than the lack
luster performance that i feel like I've been growing accustomed to.
Okay, so i was crying from about 10 minutes into the film. While
McGregor is credible, although still not a return to form, the real
performance here is from Naomi Watts. She is gripping to watch, and
lends credibility to the rest of the cast as she watches the world fall
apart around her. I winced, squirmed and spent many minutes forgetting
to breathe. An emotional roller-coaster which, while somewhat lacking
in depth in storyline, more than makes up for it with a strong edit.
Great job with an average script.
