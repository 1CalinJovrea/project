Moderately Decent

I give this movie a four out of ten overall on IMDb's scale out of ten
points.For writing I give it a four out of ten. It is not terrible but also
nothing special. It is a pretty easy story line that you can see the
plot developments coming in. There are twists but they are the typical
kind of horror and thriller movie twists that you can see coming a mile
away. The dialogue is not bad but nothing really stands out as great
and most of all there is nothing about the story or script that sticks
with you.For acting I give it a four out of ten as well. There are some good
actors and some bad and even terrible actors but most of them are
decent to average.For production value I give it a five out of ten. The picture looks
great and the shots they show are pretty interesting and keep you
interested until the end. The horror movie shots are typical but well
done. Again nothing special that stands out or is very memorable but
definitely nothing too awful either. The sets etc are all decent. The
sound is also good though at times I thought the music or score were
too loud.
