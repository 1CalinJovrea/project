Mediocre...

The first one was interesting seeing old big names on screen. The
second one had the Chuck Norris jokes and van Damme doing his signature
kicks. This one?... This one has a lot of "kaboom and badawoom"...
Which is why, I guess, it is an all right movie.Unfortunately none of the big names do anything interesting on-screen.
If you're expecting to see Wesley Snipes do Blade stuff, or Jet Li some
amazing kung fu, nope! you will be disappointed...Mel Gibson is great, but he's got a tiny part. The only fun is provided
by Antonio Banderas.As for the new actors... who cares!The problem with the Expendables movies is that the more big names are
on the credits their on screen time has to be shared with others and it
breaks down to just a few moments each.I do not understand how they missed the point again!
