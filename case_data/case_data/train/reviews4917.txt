Capetown tourism

OK I live in Capetown so I may have a jaundiced view of this movie .
First of it is a below average conspiracy movie of no remark . The
thing that struck me about it was how the script was somehow
manipulated to show various parts of the Cape (or Capetown). Was this
actually written in conjunction with cape tourism , It certainly looks
that way . Maybee the production company got discounts on filming fees
in return for showcasing various parts of the cape .Oh and by the way
if you have to have a car chase at least have some kind of continuity
reality to it for the viewers who are from the place were you are
filming , you cut from Capetown central to nearby highways to suburbs
and townships 20 miles from downtown in the same chase , I wont even
start on the white elephant world cup football stadium ,Ridiculas ,
Anotherthing Capetown is still extremely racist and divided by suburb
on race lines of old , the idea of a white man living in langa by
choice is f*cking laughable So if your not from Capetown its just about
watchable but please don't think your getting any sense of this town
from the movie
