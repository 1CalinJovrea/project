Very Average Movie

I enjoyed watching this movie, but the word that comes to mind is
shallow. My wife and I actually have a podcast about movies and we
decided there just wasn't anything to talk about so we didn't record an
episode on this one.The music is good, but it's not great. The story is mostly predictable.
The characters are not terribly interesting (although the gorilla
character does have some good depth).Overall this is a movie that, if I saw it on TV I would leave it on as
background noise, but will not seek out watching it again.
