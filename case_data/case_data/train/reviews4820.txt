Overrated, offensive, disturbing. Does not deserve to be in the same sentence as "Oscar."

Over the past week I believed I had seen the most overrated film
currently frontrunning the Oscars this year after viewing "Zero Dark
Thirty." And then I discovered this abomination.There is little to nothing to comment on regarding this film's script
or story because when it is boiled down to its roots, it is a trite,
clich√© bore that has been done many, many times before and far better.So what makes this movie not a complete copy of many films before it?
This film contains a horrific depiction of mental illness that
objectifies human beings as caricatures. Cooper's character, who is
supposedly the film's primary protagonist, is portrayed in such a
disturbing way that an uninformed viewer could not be blamed for
thinking that those who are bipolar - a very real illness with very
real, good people who suffer from it - are all miserable, violent
people who obsess over others to the point of stalking them. His
'character' is then propped up and 'fleshed out' through a collection
of tired tropes typically seen in Hollywood's voyeuristic,
disrespectful portrayals of those with mental illness.Avoid this sickening film at all costs, especially if you are someone
who suffers from mental illness or are related to someone who does. It
handles its subject matter in a way that will disturb you to the point
of tears before the movie is even over.
