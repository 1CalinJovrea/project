Not worth calling a Horror flick

This is the worst part of the entire series. In My personal opinion the
should of stopped at the second one. This movie series has just become
a disappointment. The only reason it has survived this long is because
it is fueled by mans urge for violence and his obsession with sex. The
fact that this movie contributes to a story line that has died out a
long time ago and that its main idea is focusing on porn; Inhuman acts
and cruelty is absolutely disgusting. If I watch a Horror movie I
expect it to have mystery and frankly some kind of originality: This
movie's ending we could see a mile away and its plot was given away in
the first 10 min. They should of stopped while they were ahead.
