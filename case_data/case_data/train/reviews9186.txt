Gripping battle realism like a Tom Clancy wet dream

'Act of Valor' is an impressive movie about the cult of professional
warriors in the age of global terrorism. Directors Mouse McCoy and
Scott Waugh collaborated with the US Navy and actual Navy SEALs to give
the film a sense of battle tactics and environment on par with 'Black
Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. What little is lost in the SEALs'
lack of acting chops is more than made up for by honest performances
from the men who actually do this stuff for a living and the film's
gripping battle realism. The movie sidesteps an overt political point
of view, wisely focusing on the men and their mission rather than
commenting on the times in which they serve. Watch for a great scene
where Navy swift boats extract the SEALs from a Central American jungle
with an astonishing display of live fire. Plenty of battle action to
see here that you've never seen before. Highly recommended.
