Violence Without Consequences = Childish Nonsense

"I keel you, I keel all of you. Kill, kill, and more kill." And throw
in a few completely pointless and stupid car chases and lots of
explosions for the mouth-breathers and you have a formula for a
successful action movie. We should make violence at least as much of a
taboo in film ratings as sex.This is the wet dream fantasy of booger eaters and video game dorks
with an emotional age of nine. So John Wick is like the Harlem
Globetrotters and the bad guys are the hapless Generals. I think that I
was nine years old when the last time I enjoyed that bit of
entertainment which was about the same time I gave up on kung fu
movies.If someone kills a dog in a movie a huge segment of our population
would blow a bowel in protest yet there is enough human death in this
bomb to fill a mass grave the size of Delaware. Doesn't this seem
strange to anyone? I bet this movie is the favorite of potential school
shooters, serial killers, and other psychopaths all across
America...but he's good to his dog...a pitbull, of course.For all of the hundreds of people he killed in the course of this farce
there wasn't a single moment of tension. Ditto this for the
hand-to-hand combat scenes. We know the result before a punch is thrown
or a bullet is fired. What a completely ridiculous mess.
