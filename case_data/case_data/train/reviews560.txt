Good movie. GREAT spy movie.

Charlize Theron is outstanding in this film. She put in a lot of work
offscreen to make her action scenes convincing. She pulled it off.
Unlike many recent action/spy films, there were no shoddy action
sequences that took me out of the movie. It elevated Theron to the
status of my favorite actress-- she can do action and drama very well.When scorching hot love scenes between Theron and Sofia Boutella seem
almost forgettable compared to the substantive content of the main
plot, you know that director David Leitch has succeeded mightily. I have minor complaints about this film- mostly that unless you know
Theron's character's actual identity, some parts of the film--
especially the ending-- might confuse you. But if I had a choice
between recent lowbrow nonsense that requires zero thought during your
viewing experience or afterward ("Suicide Squad," "Guardians of Galaxy
2") or this recondite film, I would choose it every. single. time.
