Engrossing

A perfect marriage of director and material, I can't think of anyone
else but Todd Haynes for this story of love and desire blossoming in a
desert of repression. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the
post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender
roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis
Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the
psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character
of Carol's conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could
have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's
no reason to give it anything less than full marks. I was completely
engrossed by it from start to finish.
