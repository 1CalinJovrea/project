People.....Did we see the same movie?

Absolutely horrible! People do not waste your money! I was hoping for
so much more, very disappointed. The only similarity to Misery is that
it was miserable sitting through it. Characters were extremely weak
with no substance. The performances were decent, but its hard to
elaborate on such a bad film. Sophia hope you deliver on your next
piece of work, this was atrocious.
