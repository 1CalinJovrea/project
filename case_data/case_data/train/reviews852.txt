This is not even a movie to watch when sick.

You know the feeling. Fever and ill. You think OK, lets watch some
easily digestible movies. I choose the two new Turtle movies. I was
pleasantly surprised while watching the first one. It actually was
pretty true to the original comic even it it wasn't as dark. Then this
one was up. And what an awful followup. i actually regret wasting my
time watching this.. and i have the fever! For crying out loud. Why...
i mean.. Shredder isn't even a big part of this movie. In the first he
is a skilled warrior and in this he is but a legman.No this isn't OK. i don't want to live in a world where the Twilight
saga is a better alternative then the Turtles?What happened? I was actually going to watch batman vs Superman now,
but i cant take any more crap. I don't care how bad ass you are. if you
see an alien who wants to strike a deal with you about world domination
then first give it more then 2 secs of thinking time. seriously. Was
this movie written by an 10 year old?? Oh yeah i guess so. its a
Nicolodian jam! Thank you for destroying yet another childhood IP. Spoiler warning: This movie sucks!/Seth Out!
