Surpassed My Low Expectations!

Before viewing this movie, I knew it was not going to be a masterpiece.
I already had incredibly low expectations for it and I thought I was
going to hate it. After viewing it, I can say it's a pretty bad....ass
film. It's not a great film, but it's ridiculously entertaining and
even really funny. There's lots of gore here, so people who love
endless CGI blood will fall in love with this film.Tommy Wirkola's film adds some more depth to the classic tale from the
Grimm Brothers, Hansel and Gretel. This story explores their adult
lives, where of course they would become witch hunters. They usually
get the job done, but then there is this witch who believes she is the
most powerful of all.The acting is good and it seems like everyone had a blast. Jeremy
Renner as Hansel was good and the funniest of the siblings. Gemma
Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. Peter Stormare makes for a
hard-nosed chief and Famke Janssen relishes her role as the evil witch.Overall, I must admit that I had a blast with Hansel and Gretel: Witch
Hunters. The story is not anywhere to be seen, but I wasn't in the mood
for any in-depth story. I just wanted to see witches die, and I think I
can say my wish was fulfilled. This is an action-packed horror film
that will take you for a thrilling ride. I rate this film 8/10.
