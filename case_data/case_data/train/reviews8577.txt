Hilarious b-comedy

The movie starts up a bit slow but soon you're on a roller-coaster of
non-stop party action -- and laughs, if you can appreciate them. It's
shot in the shaky hand-held camera documentary style but it doesn't
derive from it's funniness!The story line is quite predictable but pushes it to an extreme. A few
geeks throw a birthday party and not being sure if anyone shows up,
they advertise it, they even have a radio spot. And then all the hell
breaks loose, and instead of max 50 people, perhaps 2000 show up.
Ecstasy, kegs, hot naked chicks, a stoned dog, body shots, midgets,
getting laid... all the typical premises are present, but the setting
takes a place in the quiet family neighborhood, burning down, overtaken
by anarchy and all the while a SWAT team, cops, news... and the parents
take notice ... :) Happy birthday!I loved it!
