The Gambler

Morons who don't finish the movie and then right a review on the movie
they just refused to finish, should NOT be allowed to review the movie.
Their review should be erased. Anyone who said this movie had no
suspense did NOT watch the movie. Their review should be erased. With
that said, every other critique is purely subjective as always. This
movie is worth watching at least once like most movies. It might not be
great, but I didn't think it sucked. There are far worse movies you
could watch or things you could do to waste your precious time. It's
kind of hard to develop characters when the storyline takes place over
such a short period of time. What was it 2 weeks. Shoot me if I'm wrong
on that one.
