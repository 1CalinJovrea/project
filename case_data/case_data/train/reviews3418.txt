Wonder Woman (WW)'s Boring Origin Story without any Origin information

Actual Rating *** 5/10 (giving 1 here to compensate for all those fake
reviews and morons who are rating this as best ever DCEU movie.Gal Gadot was not a good choice for WW, both physically(amazon ladies
are not stick thin models surviving on lettuce leaf diet) and acting
wise(heavily accented and flat intonation with Bland delivery, you can
clearly see that she's trying to constantly remember and try not to
forget her lines). She may take note from Joe's Smell the Fart act :).Lot of plot holes: Why does Steve Trevor has to fly and die in
plane..he cannot manoeuvre it to some isolated location and parachute,
seems he missed those important logic lessons in his spy class.Oversimplification of war scenes, she runs in straight lines in
battlefield, all Nazi morons aim bullets on her bracelet so she can
deflect them. The final fight was too cartoonish and didn't make any
sense, without any explanation she suddenly finds the power to kill
Ares.-No good dialogues or punch lines, All we hear are some corny jokes and
Gal acting naive/dumb scenes. -No clear explanation of her born powers/bracelets/lasso. Oh i know
they wanna milk this secret knowledge and slowly release it in future
instalments of WW. -No good hand to hand or combat scenes with weapons for a amazon
warrior, all CGI fights for a 9 min slot in 2nd half. -Damn slow pacing and not much story material, an NCIS episode of 45
mins have more storyline/material and humour.The portrayal of World war storyline was so bad, it was made to look
oversimplified(maybe so 3 yr olds can watch this movie).On a side-note, its time to update WW's costume, it looks awkward and
more of an fancy beachwear dress.
