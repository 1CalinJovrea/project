Point-less remake...

...of a pointless original.Surfing criminals?Who the hell let this turkey escape?The original was silly enough.Anyone who ever surfed would know that most surfers don't own an alarm
clock or even possess the sort of intellect required to shoplift a Mars
bar, let alone orchestrate a bank heist.Hollywood keeps throwing out crap like this to each unsuspecting new
generation (every 25 years) and it gets dumber and dumber.Want to watch a surfing movie? Big Wednesday.Heist movie? Point Blank with Lee Marvin.I've yet to see a remake (there is no such thing as a 'reboot' - unless
you work in Hollywood or for its associated media) that bettered the
original.
