Worse, much worse than one would think

It's stunning how endlessly stupid movies can be. I've never been a big
fan of Apatov, his kind of humor never left high school, but then comes
this film along, and voila, he lowers the bar even more. This is a movie that thinks it has some kind of 'feminist' philosophy
behind it, alas, all there is are the oldest jokes that never were
funny to begin with and a story that doesn't exist. There is no wit,
there are no thoughts and for sure there is no intelligence. How in
heaven can those people who are involved in this thing become 'names'
that supposedly stand for something, whatever that is?Is it so liberating to watch more or less ugly people who pretend to be
'actors' say stupid stuff about sex? Wow. Sex and the city is an
intellectual giant compared to that flick.Resume: one of the worst sixpack movies for 'womens'. What an insult to
mankind.
