fun monster movie

I grew up watching classic monster movies at my Great Grandma's place -
Wolfman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Blob, etc. This movie made
me feel the enjoyment of discovering those movies again.I liked the fact that the movie was chronological, and made it very
obvious when it changed time or place. I hate flashbacks, and am happy
to be able to say that this movie did not make use of them. Thankfully,
it also did not make use of the "shaky camera footage" that a lot of
movies are using these days.Some big monster movies also tend to be kind of slow at the beginning,
and hide the "main character" until towards the end of the movie. Not
so with this - Kong makes his appearance right at the beginning. The
movie also doesn't really bog down anywhere. On the other hand, there
are plenty of movies that scream "eye candy" - where it seems quite
obvious that there is not much of a plot, so they are just throwing
things around to distract you. While the focus of this movie is
definitely on the giant monster battles, it is done very well.Both my wife and I give this film an A+ - it's a nicely done foundation
for the upcoming Kong vs Godzilla film.
