3
Destroys the aura of Lightning Mcqueen

The first Cars movie is a classic that will be enjoyed for a long time
to come. Cars 3 a has a few major problems. - We don't want to live in
or know about whatever 'new reality' this movie has created, where
Lightning isn't the fastest car anymore. We especially don't want to
know that there is an entire new generation of cars that are faster
than him. How depressing is that. - The movie has very little of the
heart, soul, and humor of the original. It has a very different feel,
with the 'next gen' cars speaking and acting like spoilt millennials.
Jackson Storm is a nasty piece of work. - If feels like the point of
the movie is to reinforce that 'girls can do anything' (like most
movies these days). That's all well and good, but it's not what we paid
money to actually go and see. We want to watch a movie about the
movie's actual hero and main character, Lightning Mcqueen. And we want
to see him win and NOT be depressed, old and slow most of the time.
