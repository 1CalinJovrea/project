Mesmerising

Much appreciated. Sophisticated and subtle. Great job in the sound
department.Those who have not witnessed Kiernan Shipka's talent in "Mad Men" will
surely find here some convincing material to make up their minds. The
other two main actresses were also remarkable, however for exclusively
aesthetic reasons, I must add.Concerning the plot, I believe it is important to emphasize its non
linear nature : a key element to reconstruct the overall "Stimmung".I must criticize the trailer, despite having been convinced by it to
approach the movie in the first place; the allusions to "erotic charge"
are deeply misleading and cast a negative influence on the viewers,
distracting them from the main, yet hidden, theme of the movie : the
Occult. I rarely experienced a more discrete and effectively symbolic
handling of such a complicated and debated matter. The way the Occult's
first appearance on the scene is connected to the principal plot twist
is also deeply satisfying. The final scenes also need to be focused on
: they both bring the missing pieces in the plot and offer an open,
surprising end.My only critic would regard the excessive abundance of implicit
hermeticism : some traits of the story could and should have been
properly expanded (Kat's parents, some more details about Rose, a more
complete view of the boarding school, the true origins of Kat's
"sickness", just to make a few examples).
