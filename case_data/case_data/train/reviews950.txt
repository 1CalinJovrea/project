Is it really that good??

This is based on a true story. I mean no disrespect to the actual
people but this emotional journey didn't hit me as much as I might have
liked it to. The story in reality is without any doubt touching but
while watching the movie I got bored multiple times. Kate Mara
delivered a solid performance. Her acting is the only thing that kept
me going.I think the directional choice of showing the story in a completely
emotional way was a brave choice. Not showing much of the war was
interesting. But I had issues with the third act. It felt rushed and
incoherent in times. In particular I disliked the way her pursuit for
the adoption of the dog was shown. I felt it was done in a very bad
way. They director could've done a far better job with that segment.All in all good acting & an emotional true story but it turned into an
average movie in the end.
