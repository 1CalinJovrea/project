A complete flop

There is something I just don't understand in the way people here vote
for a film and this one is a perfect example of incoherence: 7.2 when
so many reviews are negative and I completely agree with this
negativeness! I saw the movie yesterday afternoon in Paris and came out
of the theater wondering why had I lost my money and time for such a
nonsense. There is absolutely nothing in this film worth retaining. The
director and his scenery designer took obviously an immense pleasure in
presenting the story in a sophisticated setting making all they could
to mislead the spectator especially if he has not read the novel!
Aestheticism can be interesting to use but in limited amount If I may
say so, too much make up on a beautiful face will make of it a
horrifying masquerade and this is what happens here.Everything in this movie seems to come out from the glaciation ages!
There is not a single moment when the tragedy which develops before
your eyes can move you and make you take pity of any of the
protagonists; even the music score is boring and completely misused and
not in accordance with the plot.A total disaster to be forgotten as quickly as possible!
