Disappointing

What an utter disappointment. Like many fans of the original Taken, I
was looking forward to a sequel to see if it could match or in any way
surpass the original. I am afraid that as as sequel I am left perplexed
at the lack of any tension, real action and pace in the film. The
villains were not as nasty as they should be- after all they were
seeking revenge for the slaughter of friends and family and all
appeared not all intimidating. There was no sharp dialogue and some
scenes bordered on the risible especially when Liam Neeson was trying
to give directions to his daughter on his whereabouts. The finale was
rushed and overall the film lacked any bite or interest. Dull,
unimaginative-only Liam Neeson kept what glimmer of hopes alive by his
solid acting. However, a real shame the film could not even match or
equal the original. Do not waste your time- see the original Taken and
leave this sequel alone.
