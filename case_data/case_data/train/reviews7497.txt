Waste of money...

My honest rating would be 6 for that movie but I rated it 1 to balance
the "emotional" ratings. Cast and the part with Matt Damon were good.
The rest was a bad combination of Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bit
Mr. Nobody in the wrap of a lot of useless drama... If you have a
thinking mind which does not surrender to the dirty drama games of the
commercial script writers then your brain cells will hurt like a b...
after seeing that much nonsense. Unfortunately, that is the destiny of
almost all movies playing with the time concept except the Back to the
Future trilogy. What concerns me more than the quality of the movie
itself is the number of blown-up ratings threatening the credibility of
IMDb, which I always trust. Who are you people? Some fake rating
generator AI? Thousands of people voting for 1$ per day? Last words:
Don't go! They don't deserve your money because they did not put enough
effort to create a meaningful story and I would accept any meaning in
its own logic.
