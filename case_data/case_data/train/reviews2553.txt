Holy . . . one of the best movies I have ever seen.

Wow, just wow. I'm and avid fan of thriller movies, but this one give
me goosebumps. Jose Coronado always steal the show since I see him for
the first time in another great Spanish thriller, "El Cuerpo". For one
moment, you think you have all the pieces of the puzzles but the
director of this masterpiece persistently change the answers and the
questions. By the way, the director and writer of "Contratiempo" is the
same one of "El Cuerpo". That's not a coincidence, Mr. Oriol Paulo can
write. If you're a fan of thriller movies and you're having a hard time
trying to find a good movie, this is the one. I say it's better that
the 85% of the Hollywood thrillers these days. Another Spanish film
that beat a lot of Hollywood movies without the promo and a gigantic
budget. What a masterpiece!
