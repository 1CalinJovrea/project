Wild West Bandits Stoled My Money Too

Let's just say that the beginning of the film is symbolic of what Seth
McFarland and his gang are going to do to you. My wife and son seemed
to enjoy the movie, but I laughed more at my wife laughing than at the
movie itself. First, pretty much all of the supposedly-funny scenes
were shown in the previews. Second, use of the f-word in itself is not
funny unless it's used by someone totally out of character, like
grandma or a nun. Simply throwing it randomly in every so often is not
comedy. "Let's get effed up," Seth utters in one 'hilarious' scene. Ha,
ha, ha. Hadn't realized I'd walked into a spring-break movie aimed at
teens.Basically, the dialog is not very funny, and the physical comedy mostly
relies on grossing you out.I enjoyed 'Ted,' but will not likely rush out to see Seth's next
offering after this nonsense. This is right up there with the same crap
Seth Rogen makes. And to think I actually named one of my children
'Seth.' I thought it such an innocent choice at the time...
