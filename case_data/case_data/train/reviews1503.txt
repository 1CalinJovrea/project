'ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie comedy-drama flick; about an awkward high
school teen, and his young filmmaking buddy, who befriend a sick
classmate with leukemia. The film stars Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke,
Ronald Cyler II, Nick Offerman, Connie Britton, Molly Shannon,
Katherine C. Hughes and Jon Bernthal. It was directed by Alfonso
Gomez-Rejon (who's most well known for directing popular TV shows, like
'GLEE' and 'AMERICAN HORROR STORY') and it was written by first time
feature film writer Jesse Andrews (and based on his book, of the same
name). I absolutely love this movie!Greg Gaines (Mann) is a senior at Schenley High School, in Pittsburgh,
who's made it through school mostly unnoticed, by only slightly
communicating (politely) with everyone (in every social group). He
makes short film spoofs, with his best friend Earl (Cyler II); who he's
known since childhood. One day, Greg's mother (Britton) informs him
that another childhood friend, Rachel (Cooke), has been diagnosed with
leukemia. He's then forced, by his mom, to spend time with his sick
classmate; against both their wishes. A touching friendship forms. The film is quirky and hilarious, in places. The actors are all
perfectly cast and the characters are all lovable, and memorable. It's
also a very touching film, and quite depressing (at times); but it's
always beautiful to watch, and wonderfully moving. The cinematography
is gorgeous and the score is perfectly fitting. The script is
brilliant, and clever as well, and the director is definitely one to
watch out for. It's sure to become a cult classic, for many years to
come, and who wouldn't love that title?!
