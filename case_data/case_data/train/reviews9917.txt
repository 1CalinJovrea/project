Touching End But...

I spent the first hour of the movie trying to find Steve Jobs in
Michael Fassbender. He is such a nice actor, but when I watch a
biographic movie I expect the actor to surprise me in the way that he
looks like the real person. He isn't even close to Jobs' manners when
he is young (1984). In the other hand, the dialogs are amazing and
revealing about Jobs' life and relation to Lisa. The movie ends in a
really beautiful way. Kate is amazing as Joana Hoffman and Seth Rogen
shows his amazing acting skills playing Steve Wozniak, with the perfect
tone of voice. The movie itself is about the moments right before Jobs'
launches a new product. Loved the part when Jobs says to Lisa that he
would put thousands of songs into her pocket, giving us the sense of
the next innovations he had the opportunity to show the world. The
movie makes you wonder how Apple would be without Jobs being so
straight forward and if he treated people in a good way.
