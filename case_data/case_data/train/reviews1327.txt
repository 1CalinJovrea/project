Not everyone will like it as much as I did, but some might.

Let's start by saying, you can't take the title as an accurate
representation of this movie. It suits it very well though, just not in
a literal sense. Some people didn't like it because they expected an
original comedy about open relationships and got a romantic comedy
about two emotionally messed up individuals. And if you aren't
expecting it to be something else, this movie absolutely nails it.I know not everyone wants to see a movie about those kind of
characters, but I'm really sick of rom-coms about people who have a
healthy relationship with sex unless they're a bad guy or someone whose
not mean to find love. I thought it was really refreshing to see
characters with these issues and the movie was well done. Sure it's a
romantic comedy with all the right clich√©s and cheeky music, and sure
the characters aren't relatable to everyone, but for me, it was just
perfect.
