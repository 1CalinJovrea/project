A beautifully well crafted action movie by the great Clint Eastwood

Good work on Bradley Cooper's part as well, putting on the weight and
getting into character to play Chris Kyle, a sniper for the navy seals
who did four tours in Iraq protecting his fellow troops by being a
legendary shot. the Movie explores Kyle having to deal with a rival
sniper who was keeping him from doing the job of protecting his troops
and having to deal with coming home to his wife and kids feeling that
his mission was incomplete. Old man Eastwood mixed action, drama and humor in a way only a
legendary filmmaker could put together. The man still has the ability
to tell a compelling story.Bradley Cooper showed a range that is more Oscar worthy than what he
did in Silver Linings Playbook. It was nothing but enjoyable from beginning to end. Worth watching.
