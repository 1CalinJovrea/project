Horrible

Words cannot even explain how horrible this movie was. It was so hard
to follow! The quotes were changed and the storyline was also changed.
I have read and studied the book so this did not satisfy my hunger for
The Great Gatsby. Needless to say I think it's pure filth and the only
people who will love it will be people who have no idea who F.Scott
Fitzgerald is or have not read the book. The book revolved around the
1920s and the bootleg era, I'm pretty sure this was also the JAZZ era
not Jay-Z or Beyonce! The music was horrible and processed! Words
cannot explain how horrible it was. I think the director should pay for
my treatment! Director was to focused on 3D that there was a cut
everywhere. Why would anyone ruin the best Novel of all time? Why?
