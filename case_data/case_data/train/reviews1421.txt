Claflin and Clarke where to perfect

This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very
bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same
time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But
sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based
on.A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year
old who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young
billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an
accident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At
first Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up
with him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to
enjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the
question is will this last? I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels
forced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At
times Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in
most of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you
feel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this
was a perfectly well made bittersweet film.
