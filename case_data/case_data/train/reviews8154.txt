Brilliant

I have read some of the reviews about this movie, regarding a remake of
a Spanish movie, and no clue that this was a remake.For a movie I haven't heard anything about, I gave it ago based on the
actors in the movie.Pleasantly surprised at the gripping, compelling storyline. The
heartbreak and suspense, as well as the thriller aspect of the movie,
with that forever twist that I search for in movies. As The usual
Suspects being one of my ultimate favourite movies of all time, I found
that the storyline flowed well, it wasn't drawn out to the point you
get bored and want to switch to another movie. Thoroughly enjoyed this
movie and would recommend watching.
