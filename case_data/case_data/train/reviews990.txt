What a boring movie!

First part: A fat tattooed man who works as Head chef in some
restaurant in LA has a verbal battle via twitter with the most
acclaimed food critic in the city. The whole thing degenerates so fast
that within 24 hours, the chef finds himself out of work. This is a
brief overview of what you get in the first 50 minutes of the movie.
During these 50 minutes, i thought I was watching a TV movie (if it
wasn't because Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey JR and Dustin Hoffman
make a guest appearance). Honestly, nothing to see up until this point. Second part: The chef has now managed to get his hands on a food truck
that looks something like a piece of S*** on wheels. He now sells
sandwiches while lecturing his sonÂ… and then they hang around and they
talk, and nothing else happens...You know what? Please, do not waste your time with this boring movie. Positive: John Favreau is a good actor and does a good job.
Unfortunately for him, it does it in a bad movie.
