Enjoyable enough but missing something special

Fifth movie in the Mission Impossible franchise has Ethan Hunt & IMF
friends trying to stop a mysterious group known as the Syndicate,
despite the IMF being shut down by the government and Ethan being
wanted by the CIA. Enjoyable actioner but there's not much new here.
Tom Cruise continues to prove he's one of the more consistent stars out
there as he always seems to put out solid popcorn movies and
occasionally something more than that. The supporting cast is good,
with Simon Pegg stealing every scene he's in and Rebecca Ferguson as
the attractive assassin who saves Tom throughout the movie. Is she good
or is she bad? Will you care? Ving Rhames gets little to do. Sean
Harris plays the forgettable villain. Alec Baldwin is the red herring
who, along with Jeremy Renner, seems almost unnecessary in making this
work. The action is solid and the humor (mostly from Pegg) is
appreciated. I have to say that this is not my favorite Mission
Impossible movie or even top three. There's something nondescript about
it all, similar to the last film. At least the first three each had
something about them that was memorable. Now it seems the series is
satisfied just putting out a solid action thriller with more focus on
stunts than characters, plot, or even style. Watchable for fans but
really nothing special.
