Quite astray from the Old Testament story, it still is an enjoyable movie.

I remember all the controversy while this movie was being made and then
publicized. I'm sure many Bible fundamentalists were highly agitated,
but as the disclaimer at the end states, the movie is a fictional story
with fictional characters. Yet that too will upset all of us who
believe Noah and Old Testament characters really did live.But none of that upset me, I fully expected it to be a big movie with
fictional elements and lots of special effects. So, how did it do,
regarding what it tried to do?I have to say very well. It was a costly venture, and likely will only
recover its costs with after-release DVD and BD sales, rentals, and
eventual TV revenue. But if you take it for what it is you get an
entertaining movie.Perhaps the most glaring departure are the large rock-like creatures
that eventually protect Noah, his family, and the Ark as the bad people
attempt to overrun it. And the volumes of water spouting from the
ground which, along with rain, caused the great flood.But the end has a tone of hope, that the surviving people will build a
better mankind. Russell Crowe is always good and here he is good as
Noah. He was paired again with Jennifer Connelly who was his wife
Naameh. And Ray Winston was good as the villain Tubal-cain who managed
to get aboard the Ark as it sailed, and who tried to kill off Noah.
