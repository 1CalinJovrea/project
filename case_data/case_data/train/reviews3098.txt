A surprisingly good Horror Anthology

Expecting a generic Horror Anthology film, which are usually gory,
cheesy, and uninspiring, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. While
a couple of it's segments were duds, most of them were great. They had
a nice mix of being either funny, spooky, invigorating, and even in one
case having a great twist that I did not see coming whatsoever. Most of
them have great characters and plenty of awesome moments and scenarios.
I think I liked Friday the 31 or the Ransom of Rusty Rex the most, yet
Bad Seed and The Night Rusty Raised Hell were also really good. Of the
ten, I think I only disliked two; Ding Dong, which was too weird and
depressing, and Grim Grinning Ghost, which seemed to barely last and
had no satisfying ending. Of all these stories though, they all have
great sets and are very well produced. This anthology film is
definitely worth checking out, especially around Halloween.You can read this and other reviews on my blog at
