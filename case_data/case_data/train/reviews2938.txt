Can I Get My Money Back?

This was one of the worst, most boring, poorly scripted movies I've
ever seen. Clearly Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are on the downhill
slide as actors, and their attempt to revive the energy in "Wedding
Crashers" was a dismal failure. There were so many contrivances to
create laughs, and the film failed on every count. When we viewed,
there were maybe 20 people in the theater, and not one chuckle or laugh
was heard. There was one scene with Vince, Owen and Will Farrell that
tried to revive "Wedding Crashers", but was so lacking in humor, it was
truly grotesque, and completely mean-spirited. The writing on this film
was below sophomoric level, and camera work, editing equally sub-par.
If the producers were trying to portray a high tech company, like
Google, they failed miserably. If they were trying to parody high tech
culture, they also missed it by a mile! Thumbs down, my friends. This
is a real dog.
