I was very much disappointed..

A security guard protects a woman who is being targeted by a gang for
participating as a trial witness. Security was eventually a film that i
wanted to go and check out in Theaters because based on the trailer
that i saw i actually enjoyed it plus Antonio Banderas is a pretty good
actor and he does fit the hero type this days just like he did with The
Expendables 3 (2014) now what i did not expected was a boring mess of a
film with some pretty dumb lines, a cartoony and dumb security guard
that can't hold a gun straight and basically a chick that gets 2 arrows
on her knee and shoulder and yet somehow keeps on going. This isn't the
freaking Universal Soldier goddamn you this was supposed to be a fun
and entertaining flick but the only redeeming quality of the movie was
Banderas but not even he can save this movie. Ben Kingsley feels pretty
miscasted as the villain and the final confrontation between him and
Banderas was rather disappointing damn this whole movie is a big pile
of poo poo if you want to be entertained by a low budget action movie?
This is definitely not Security. (3/10)
