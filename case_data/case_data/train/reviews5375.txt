If anyone asks, I'm your sister.....

Like most teenage girls, Minnie is longing for love, acceptance and a
sense of purpose in the world. She begins to have an intimate affair with her mother's boyfriend, "the
handsomest man in the world," Monroe Rutherford. What follows is an account of one girl's sexual and artistic awakening,
without judgement.........The Diary of a Teenage Girl is just that, a girls sexual awakening and
coming of age, from her point of view, and no on else's opinion is
valid from a narrative point of view, because the narrative is told
from her musings into her tape recorder, and her drawings of probably
the most feminist caricature I've seen since Crumb picked up his
pencil.And all the while the films story is told, the Patty Hearst trial is
quite prominent on newspapers and TV, another female who didn't give in
for anybody.But the wonderful thing about the film coming from the titular
characters perspective, is that we can feel all of her emotions as they
fight one another in what could be the most emotional time for a girl
in her life, especially as her first encounter is with her Mothers
Boyfriend, played with wonderful smugness by Skarsg√•rd. We see him
through her eyes. Prominent, leading, daring. And then finally,
boorish, misleading, and childish, indicating to the viewer that Minnie
soon wises up to false idols, thanks partly to her mother and her
mothers ways.Her Mother is played down by Kristen Wiig, at once appearing as a
pathetic human being, someone who can only be active by substance, and
at once a barrier for her breaking on through to the other side, hence
the affair with Monroe.As the film goes on, it becomes more psychedelic, more hazy, noting the
fact that Minnie is now experimenting with narcotics, and veering down
the path of solace.It's pretty heavy going stuff at times, after all, everything to a 15
year old is dramatic, but throughout, there is an air of whimsy,
keeping the film from becoming depressing and too deep.Minnie is not your atypical fifteen year old girl. She is testing the
waters, at her age you can fall into any camp, sexually or personality
wise, and throughout the film she tests many a water.All in all its a pretty fascinating look into a the mind and random
thoughts of a girl coming of age.Would make a really odd double bill with Inside Out.
