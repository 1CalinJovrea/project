Elated at movie, shocked at soulless reviewers

The last time I left a cinema feeling anything close to this elated was
after Gravity. My heart was racing, I felt so joyful. I never feel like
this after a film. Big Hero 6 immediately replaces the Lego movie as my
No.1, main stream, animated film. I came onto IMDb to find out more about this entertaining, action
packed, emotional roller-coaster only to see half a dozen vicious
reviews ... I feel so somber. I can't believe anyone would loath this
film to the levels of some reviewers have gone to on this site. It was
an absolute joy. The whole cinema was ecstatic, both kids and adults. I have a 7 year old boy, and even without being a dad, I'd still love
this film. Hope it picks up the awards (Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA etc
etc) it deserves.
