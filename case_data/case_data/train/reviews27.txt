Allied Chick Flick

This is a short review. The single most important thing missing from
this film is any kind of chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion
Cotillard. Without that chemistry, even as a romantic chick flick, this
movie fails. Secondly, any student of WWII history knows that the
German Blitz over England pretty much ended in May of 1941, and yet
this movie has London being blitzed multiple times in 1943. That did
not seem likely. On the positive side, there are some nice sets, and
costumes, and some moments of tension. But my overall impression is
that the movie is a joyless affair, for the actors, and particularly
for the audience viewing it.
