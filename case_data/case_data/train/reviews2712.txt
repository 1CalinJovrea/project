Impressive adaptation of King novel released 25 years ago

STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning
** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) and Jessie Burlingame (Carla Gugino) are a
married couple who decide to make a weekend getaway to connect with
each other on a more intimate and physical level. To further ensure
this, Gerald brings along two pairs of handcuffs, which he intends to
and does use on Jessie on the bed. Initially comfortable going along
with it, Jessie becomes despondent just as Gerald gets aroused. But
when he suffers a fatal heart attack, Jessie finds herself stranded,
tied to the bed with seemingly no way out, at the mercy of external
forces, including the sinister 'Moonlight Man' (Carel Struycker), that
threaten to tear her apart.A Stephen King adaptation is always more likely to appeal to me if I've
read the book, or the short story excerpt, before hand. Although it's
almost certain to be nowhere near as good, there's just something more
intriguing and compelling to want to see someone else's interpretation
of the novel you have read and had your own conjuring of, to see how
closely it matches the presentation that has made it to the screen.
Gerald's Game was written by King twenty five years ago in 1992. I read
it in about 2001, over fifteen years ago, and at the time would have
been dying to see a film version of it. But all the same, in the
present day, this has emerged and I still was excited to see it. And,
thankfully, writer/director Mike Flanagan's film is no disappointment.The perversely inspired and intriguing concept, that really could only
have come from King's twistedly brilliant mind, has as much effect on
screen as it does in the novel, and Flanagan creates a wonderfully
isolated, eerie atmosphere that suits the mood perfectly. In Jessie's
predicament, loud, brash jump scares that permeate so much of what
passes for modern horror, are redundant, and so wisely the emphasis is
on the psychological, as Jessie lies helpless and goes insane, driven
mad by hallucinations of Gerald speaking from beyond the grave, and of
herself, as her repressed childhood traumas come to the surface and
take effect. Inspired casting also does a great job of keeping things
on the level, and all the main cast (who are pretty much all of it!)
fit their roles fine and perform perfectly.It's a pleasingly faithful version of King's novel, which I can still
remember all these years later, and while I wasn't as excited to see it
as I was then, it's no bad thing to wait for something so masterful.
