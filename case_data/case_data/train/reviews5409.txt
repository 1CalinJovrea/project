Mixed Emotions!

The movie is not that bad, but not that good either, aside from few
laughable moments and the novelty of hearing Robin Williams one last
time, movie lacks in lot of aspects, a very stale plot with very less
character building. I don't know what Director Terry Jones was exactly
thinking, but he could've have done better with an idea like that,
specially when you are casting actors like Simon Pegg and Kate
Beckinsale as your leads.In my opinion Absolutely Anything is a good idea but is executed poorly
and a waste of talented actors, movie could've done better but it
didn't.
