Intriguing and disturbing

Without the appropriate cinematic skills, this film could have sunk
completely, but thanks to Chan-wook Park being a master of
psychological thriller, it came to be a nice work of art. A great
manipulator of the audience's emotions, he meticulously constructs the
movie in such a way to get you exactly where he wants you throughout
it. He might be a little bold, but he knows how to keep the balance."Stoker" obliges you to stay fully conscious all the time to keep up
with the symbolisms and invites you to use your imagination. The
director wants a participating audience, is ambiguous on purpose, loves
to make us wonder and speculate just as much as he loves leaving us
room for interpretation when the film ends. Deliberate loose ends and
cut scenes, designed to confuse the viewer and cause uncertainty.Much like with his all-time classic, puzzling masterpiece "Oldboy",
Park wants to disturb you. An exciting, twisted story, very powerful
scenes, even scenes that many people won't be able to tolerate. A
compelling story about dark nature and sickness, about liberating
yourself and becoming aware of your desires. Violence is portrayed with
scenes focused on beauty, and sexuality is portrayed dark and
repressed. I liked the script by Wentworth Miller (although I don't think the
script gets full credit for the suspense created here), and I found Mia
Wasikowska's performance superb.This film is dark and might make you feel disgusted or uncomfortable.
But for me, the beauty of the scenes, the emotions it provokes and how
it climaxes, made me think of it as a piece of music.
