Really boring, 7 minute sex scene does not make it a quality movie

There is a misconception that if a movie has long shots of the wind
moving the tree leaves, or if it is slow, the movie is of high quality.
I don't agree. A quality movie is one which moves something inside, in
your hart. A artistic movie is one that makes me awe the aesthetics,
this movie was nether. I feel that the only reason this movie has got
so much attention is the cheep use of lesbian porn, and you can find
that a lot faster on the web without wasting three hours of your life.
Beyond that, I thought the story line was dull, and not true to
reality. I am fed up of movies showing relationships built only on sex,
and not of friendship and love, this teaches the public the wrong
thing. Don't watch!
