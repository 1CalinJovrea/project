2 Thumbs Down

I was SO disappointed with this show. I have loved all of the Tyler
Perry movies, until now. Seems he has gone downhill. This movie had
more cussing in it than all of his other movies put together!!! What
happened Tyler Perry? A movie doesn't have to have so much cussing in
it to be good! This just seems so out of character compared to his
other movies. :(
