A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids)

Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what
it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and
how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our
differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution
proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and
stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities,
etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at
least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are
plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I
will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly
appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an
animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest
thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours
well-spent.
