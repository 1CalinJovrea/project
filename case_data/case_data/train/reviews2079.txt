Where is the horror ?

I don't know how this movie is classified as Horror ?!!, the only
chilling scene is when Sam disappears and that's it ! I enjoyed
watching it but I was expecting some really scary moments that would
make me jump but NONE !! I would like to begin with Sam, did the witch just minced him or what?
I mean, did she make some youth elixir from him ?!What killed Caleb ? What happened to him at the "Witch house" ? How didn't they hear their children screaming when they were locked up
with the goats ? So many mysteries ... This movie should only be classified as Mystery.
