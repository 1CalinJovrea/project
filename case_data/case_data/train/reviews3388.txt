Better than expected, Gone lets us take chase with a chameleon in search of the last piece of an abduction puzzle.

This movie was well paced and well acted by Seyfried. I really enjoyed
the "road trip" she takes trying to track down her target. She is slick
in her conversations and smooth in her charms to converse with people
and get whatever puzzle pieces they have to offer. I really like the
mystery the movie conveys as it leads to the end. I really felt like
the path could have lead to multiple characters in the story, and as
you watch Seyfried's pace you are constantly asking yourself how much
of the story is she capable of creating herself. I hope the score for
this movie rises about the 5.6 it is at currently. Other movies float
in this range and do not bring nearly as much to the table.
