Amazing movie. Completely underestimated.

After last years Cars 2, many began to underestimate Pixar and believed
that it would begin to fall out of the radar. Well this movie will
definitely prove them wrong. This movie was a visually stunning
masterpiece with a great story. Even before the movie started it was
exciting because of the unique and creative short La Luna along with
the Monsters University teaser trailer. If you are reading this and
haven't seen the movie yet make sure you STAY TILL THE END OF THE
CREDITS for just a little scene about something that happened earlier
in the movie. Thanks to everyone at Pixar studios for creating a true
masterpiece!
