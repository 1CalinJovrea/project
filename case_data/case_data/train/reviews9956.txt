Don't Waste Your Money

I was so disappointed in this movie,and only went as my friend wanted
to see it. The script,acting,and so called humour were just terrible. I
don't know how people can have any positive feedback for this
boring,silly and stupid film. I am no prude but why was there a need
for such a gross script. A toddler pooping in his potty anywhere in the
house is supposed to be cute. I don't think so. All I remember of this
film is talk about boobs,penis',the F word,etc. Couldn't Jane Fonda and
Jason Bateman get a better movie to appear in. I kept looking at the
time and couldn't wait for it to be over. The scenes were so immature
and dumb slapstick. There were no witticisms or clever scenes and
dialogue. The siblings smoking pot in the synagogue was ridiculous.The
young rabbi looked as though he was in junior high.Even though I'm a
secular Jew,still,I found that certain traditional scenes like the
funeral,synagogue scene, etc.were very embarrassing and even insulting.
Sitting shiva after a death is to be taken serious,not the way it was
portrayed in this silly film. Don't waste your money or time to see
this stinker of a film.It's not even worth watching on DVD.Every scene
is exaggerated and each character in the family is a caricature.The
film is totally unrealistic.I was very disappointed with the weakness
in all aspects of this movie.
