Bad Movie even if you didn't read the Novel

Let's start with those of us who are huge fans of Vince Flynn, and his
numerous novels about Mitch Rapp. If you have read American Assassin, I
highly warn you NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, as it will be a complete
disappointment. The only similarities are: The title, the characters,
and the fact that Stan Hurley bites a guy's ear off. The other 92% of
the movie is pure Hollywood b/s. The movie only needs to use the book
as a guide, and take the story off the pages and onto the big screen,
and it's a blockbuster, but no - they can't do that. They have to hack
and mutilate a great story by Vince Flynn, and twist so many things
that it makes you feel like walking out of the theatre.Now - let's say that you never read Vince Flynn's novel. I still would
not recommend seeing this movie. The plot is sketchy at best. You have
actors playing roles that they can't pull off (i.e. A french-man
playing a Mossul agent). arggg. And then there is the second rate
special effects / CGI. There is a particular scene near the end of a
Navy Helicopter flying into the scene where Mitch Rapp has located the
nuclear bomb (i.e. that's not part of the book either, and it's the
premise for the movie)...but back to the chopper - it's obviously a
special effect. Fast forward 10 minutes to the end, and the USS IKE
(Aircraft Carrier) is in the ocean and there are waves crashing over
it's deck. SOOO LAME.Shame on the director, producer and anyone else who was responsible for
butchering a phenomenal novel. I pray there isn't a part 2.
