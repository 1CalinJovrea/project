follow your heart, ignore the critics

You know why the critic's hated it? Cause you have to be able to feel.
Because you have to have known grief, loss, sorrow, depression, and
trauma, all the consequences of love. That's the only way to really
understand this movie. Ignore the critics, make up your own mind, after
you've seen the movie. It wasn't perfect, the actors weren't always
perfectly believable, it could use some polishing, but, I got it, and
it was wonderful. It gives you a real good look at how grief changes
someone's life, and, what can help bring them back. I really loved the
whole concept and want to go see it again. I really think I missed a
lot...
