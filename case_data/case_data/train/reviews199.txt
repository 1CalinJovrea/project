Ridley Scott has misfired.

Awful, awful movie. Christian Bale is mediocre, Joel Edgerton is
surprisingly good, but the rest of it sucks. The whole thing lacked any
kind of oomph. No spectacular Red Sea parting, none of the atmosphere
of such a great and legendary story. Just an atheist agenda pushing
along a sad little pram of replacement theories. Truly, truly dreadful.
I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. Don't waste your money. People with
Scott's attitude toward the Bible should steer clear of anything to do
with it. He has some personal issues he needs to deal with inside a
therapist's office, and not with the funding provided by movie backers.
Get over it, Ridley. You're a sad little man.
