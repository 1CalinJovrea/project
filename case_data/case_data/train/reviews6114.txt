If you want some adrenaline...

You do not want to have anything to do with Charlise Theron, believe
you me! If you are a man and you had dreams of being a big macho guy,
you were all wrong, you haven't met Lorraine Broughton yet, her
character in "Atomic Blonde". She's stronger than men, she's fighting
with more than one at a time, she's very bad. And, at the end, she
kills them. She's gonna kick your ass too, no matter you'll do!
Charlize Theron is cool just like the ice cubes in those bath-tube she
takes in the movie. The other actors are OK, but due to Charlize's
extremely strong personality, they all seem to be just a bunch of
extras. Very good action, dynamically, nervously and spectacularly
filmed. Good '80s music too, Peter Schilling - Major Tom, Re-Flex - The
Politics Of Dancing, After The Fire - Der Kommissar, David Bowie - Cat
People(Putting Out Fire), etc. Very good job, Charlize!
