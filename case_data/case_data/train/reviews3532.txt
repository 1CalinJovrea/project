This is not a first date or even a second date movie

The movie starts slow with typical character development. You think
that Simon and Gordo were just acquaintances in high school... but
eventually you learn the truth. Didn't see that coming as Simon, really
the writer, keep that from us for most of the movie. Gordo for his part
wasn't all that normal either. The house scene with the dinner, the
notes (very creepy), and the mind-f**k at the end with the monkey mask
all played into something that I can't believe would ever really
happen.And that's why this movie works. It sucks you into the paranoia of
Simon, Gordo, and Robyn. They all have secrets and issues that they
hide and they're all on their own plot lines.Overall it's a very suspenseful movie but it does start slow. And it
leaves you to wonder, "what happens now?" And if you do watch this
movie with a significant other don't be surprised if they're looking at
you and wondering if you're a bully...What are you hiding? R
