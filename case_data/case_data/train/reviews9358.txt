A Near Perfect Tear-Jerk Thriller

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is brought to shockingly realistic life
in J. A. Bayona's ten minute sequence near the beginning of the
harrowing true-life survival tale, "The Impossible." With little to no
CGI and using mostly scale models and a giant water tank, Bayona throws
the viewers into the wave along with stars Naomi Watts (astonishing)
and young Tom Holland (revelatory as Watts' son). Told from the point
of view of a family on holiday in Thailand, the story makes for a
riveting family-centered emotional drama. The rest of the cast is
outstanding as well, and there's a strong humanist approach applied to
depicting this wide-spread multi-national disaster.It might pull on the heartstrings a bit "too much" in some sequences,
but the manipulation is apt in telling this real-life drama.Overall - an unforgettable, draining but uplifting film experience.Check out full reviews at theschleicherspin.com
