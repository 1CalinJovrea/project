Absurd, pretentious, juvenile

I'm trying to think how I'm going to generate 10 lines about this
spectacularly terrible film - certainly one of the worst I've ever
seen. The only way this can have been financed is by its inclusion of
two "bankable" stars - Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine. However what it
was that attracted them to the script beats me. Nonetheless they manage
- Michael Caine in particular - to give what must surely be the least
convincing performances of their careers. Which is hardly surprising
considering the portentous drivel that they have to spout.I've not bothered to look at anything about the team who made it but it
has the feel of a vanity project authored by a group of wealthy film
school graduates in their twenties who have minimal experience of life
but who have seen a lot of European "art cinema". One recent film it
reminded me of was "La Grande Belleza", the difference being that that
film actually had some interesting ideas and strong performances.I stopped watching twice and had a hard time convincing myself to
invest any more time on it; on the second occasion, a couple of minutes
into the concertscene, about 15 minutes before the end (it feels almost
interminable) I didn't bother to resume. Toward the end of this
pretentious and totally unconvincing farrago there are a couple of
extended expository monologues which attempt to plug the holes in the
sieve which constitutes a plot. There's so much wrong with "Youth" it's impossible to find anything
positive to say about it. To call it pretentious garbage would be to
compliment it. The two star leads should be ashamed of themselves; they
surely can't need the money.
