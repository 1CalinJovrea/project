Just Brilliant !

6 Stories - 6 masterpieces! They perfectly combine thriller, drama,
humor and the common topic is the violence.Each tale is independent from the other, but all of them have something
special that makes you really enjoy.The situations introduced in each story are actually based on real
life, of course the are intentionally exaggerated with a sense of
satire and irony that really makes you laugh.The picture is the best I have seen in an Argentina movie and the music
"made ​​in" Santaolalla is sublime.The actors/actresses are amazing (specially the bride - Erica Rivas) In
my opinion it is one of the best non-English Language movies ever.
