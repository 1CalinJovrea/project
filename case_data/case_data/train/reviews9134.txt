A Good Movie, But...

The Iceman was an enjoyable movie with very good acting, but ultimately
quite unrealistic. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski, comes off as a very sympathetic
character in the end, whereas in real life he truly was a cold
emotionless and sociopathic killer. His family weren't so much
cherished and loved as they were possessions that were his and his
alone.Much has been learned about sociopathy by interviewing Kuklinski, but
unfortunately none of this was used to shape and portray his real
character in the movie. Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing, but
more as entertainment than enlightenment about Kuklinski's life of
crime.
