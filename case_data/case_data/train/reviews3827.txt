Fun to watch and really adds to the story that everyone knows in a way that does make it seem new and exciting.

"The world of course remembers the monster not the man, but sometimes
when you look closely there's more to a tale. Sometimes the monster is
the man." Victor Frankenstein (McAvoy) is an eccentric scientist who
has a dream of creating life from death. After rescuing his assistant
Igor (Radcliffe) from the circus he has finally found someone he can
work with. After bringing to life a small animal he is approached and
asked if he can make a human. Victor and Igor set out to change the
world, but somethings should be left alone. A story this old that has
been told and seen over and over again faces an up hill battle. How can
you turn something like that into something fresh and new? This one
really pulled that off. The story you know is here, with a few needed
twists and additions. This movie deals more with the madness within
Victor rather than the actual monster itself. The best way to describe
this is a Frankenstein done in the style of the Robert Downey Jr.
Sherlock Holmes movies. A movie that is just fun to watch and really
adds to the story that everyone knows in a way that does make it seem
new and exciting. Overall, surprisingly good and a movie that I
recommend if you want to be entertained for a few hours. I give this a
B+.
