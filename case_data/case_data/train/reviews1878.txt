Chemistry saves the day.

Washington and Wahlberg, the W duo. Washington is undercover DEA agent
Bobby Trench and Wahlberg is naval intelligence officer Stig Stigman
who is undercover as well; they're both working together to try and rob
a powerful drug lord. Simple? Well, not entirely, mainly because each
one doesn't know that the other is also working undercover. This is
just the beginning of the complications and twists that they are about
to face in this thrill ride. Negatives: The movie has a few clich√©s here and there, as well as
action scenes that aren't really new in any way and in general just
feel quite lacking.Positives: Small twists and turns in the plot will keep you guessing
for a while, but what really makes this movie worth it is the
chemistry. The W duo are just excellent together, their interactions
seem genuine and are delivered in a way that is quite satisfying to
watch, especially from Wahlberg's side. Also Washington's undercover
character was superb, I believe everyone met or knows someone who is
like him.This is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, so for you to enjoy
it you must lighten up, grab a couple of friends, some popcorn and
watch the film zip away with it's fun flair.
