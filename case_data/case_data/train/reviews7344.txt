Waste of money

I hated it,I do not think spouses should cheat on their mates,and this
movie encouraged it.A love story should not contain adultery.They
should have used Lasse Hallstr√∂m for the director.He did a great job on
Safe Haven and Dear John.How can you call it a great love story when
there is so much violence and cheating.I think Nicholas Sparks needs to
quit killing the main male character.I want a happy ending in a love
story, and not someone that is cheating on their mate.I liked the
younger scenes when they were growing up as kids...I was missing that
excitement that makes me feel good about a LOVE story, and makes me
believe in romance. I kept getting really bored while watching it.
