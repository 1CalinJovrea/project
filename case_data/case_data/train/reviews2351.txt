Just saw Jack Reacher

Just saw Jack Reacher. LOVED IT! I thought it was great. There was a
lot of action, but it had some great comic relief. Jack Reacher's
interaction with everyone bordered heavily on comic relief. There is a
scene when Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is in his hotel room with Helen
Rodin (Rosamund Pike) and she asks him to put his shirt on, but he says
he only has one. Several minutes later he says it's late and they
should get some sleep, Helen mistaken thinks that he is suggesting they
sleep together and then realizes her mistake. The whole interaction is
very funny but delivered in a straight faced manner, at least on the
part of Jack Reacher. Many of Jack Reacher's other encounters
throughout the movie are along the same lines as this. The
uncomfortable interactions between Reacher and Sandy, played by Alexia
Fast, are particularly amusing as all he wants is information and she
keeps offering herself to him. After Sandy is killed and Helen is
kidnapped the comic relief is done.All this talk about comic relief by no means refers to the first ten
minutes of the movie. A sniper sets up across the river from PNC Park
in Pittsburgh and kills six people. The act is believed to be done by
James Barr, played by Joseph Sikora, a former Army Sniper. He is
arrested and in interrogation he writes one thing... Find Jack Reacher!
When Reacher arrives in Pittsburgh Barr has been beaten to the point of
being in a coma.That is all I will say about this movie as far as the plot. I give this
a vote of 9 out of 10. Tom Cruise should think of making the other Jack
Reacher books into movies.
