Cool, funny and awesome!

This movie has good cinematography and is very funny. It almost has an
80s feel to it with some ridiculous scenes. Overall though it was fun
and funny. It may not be laugh out loud funny, but it is entertaining.
Some of the scenes are over the top at scenes and over dramatic, but it
does it in a humorous way making fun of movies.
