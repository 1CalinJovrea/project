There is a difference between stupid and funny

2 Star. 1 star for Jennifer Aniston 1 star for Kevin SpaceyA comedy should be funny. Movie was not funny. They (Nick, Kurt and
Dale) are just retards running around trying to be funny. I wanted to
give one more star because they managed not to get them-self killed,
but then again that would have prevented HB3. *** Spoiler *** Saying
name over walkie repeatedly even it was pointed out they shouldn't.
Keep talking in walkie about nothing while breaking into office.
Holding button so other cant talk. And that is just one scene. Jennifer
Aniston is still hot though, and only reason I saw movie Â½ way through.
And the 10 line rule is stupid.
