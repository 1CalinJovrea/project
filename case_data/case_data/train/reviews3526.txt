Funny, Lighthearted, and Appropriate for All Ages!

I'm surprised this film got such a low overall score by users. I
thought is was a blast. I am not an animated movie fan in the least. I
normally like dark movies, dramas, sci-fi, and horror. This was the
first animated film I have seen since Avatar, (which isn't the same
type of animation really,) but when I watched the trailer last year, I
thought it would probably be good. And it was.The movie delivered exactly what it promised: laughs. It's not earth
shattering, mind blowing, and it doesn't explain the meaning of life in
90 minutes. But it's not that type of movie. It's a summer escape film,
one that is a little different from the 1000th superhero movie or
Sequel #10 of The Current Film of Mediocrity, and one that you can
bring your children to without worrying about covering their eyes and
ears every scene. There are a couple of scenes of mild violence or
almost violence, but they aren't any worse than Bugs Bunny and his
adventures with the Roadrunner (I suppose that reference dates me lol). What I liked the best about the movie is the way it demonstrates the
thoughts and behaviors of the pets to the viewer. As a Great Dane
owner, I often wonder what my dogs are thinking/doing, especially when
I'm at work, and my ideas are similar to the writers. Their thoughts
and conversations were the funniest parts of the film, and the scenes
and soundtrack combined with the dialogue to form a lighthearted,
enjoyable story.
