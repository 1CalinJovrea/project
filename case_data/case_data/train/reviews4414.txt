Nothing exceptional

I understand that many, even most, Tim Burton fans liked this movie
very much. Some go as far as claiming that this is his best work, or
that this is a refreshment to his work.I see nothing special about this movie. This is just an average Tim
Burton piece. Don't get me wrong, I love Tim Burton, but compared to
his other two animated flicks ("The Nightmare Before Christmas" and
"Corpse Bride"), this one can't be called anything better than average.
It has all the classic Tim Burton qualities - the extraordinarily weird
characters (which are just plainly weird, with no extra explanation),
some black humor, dark atmosphere, great music (courtesy of Danny
Elfman) and artistic touch; yet it lacks of that certain something that
makes movies out-stand.I must additionally comment on the fact that the movie is filmed in
black and white technique - although I understand the reasons behind
this, and generally approve of such ideas, I don't think this was as
essential to this movie; in fact perhaps it would have been better if
it were in color. Although I say this from an utterly subjective
perspective.All in all, a nice movie to watch, but nothing to enjoy much about. I'd
say this one is for the die-hard Tim Burton fans, if you are not one of
them, you can easily skip this movie, you won't have missed much.
