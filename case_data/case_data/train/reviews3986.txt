Not that great...

A lot of sex and some gore doesn't make this a good movie. You can see
clearly that the budget of this one was pretty much the same as part 3,
4 and 5. A lot of unknown and not really great English actors and
actress. I think the story was too much over the top, Declan, the director of
the previous three parts, just let the story simple (how the original
also was). I love boobs, of course, but the nudity in this one is just
too much and adds nothing to the story. Some special effects are nice, but really nothing more than that. If
you like part 3, 4 and 5 you probably like this one too. But not really
something for me.
