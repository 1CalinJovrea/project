Worth watching

Awkward. A simple and believable concept. We've probably all had a friend or
associate that was a little odd, a little intense, a little socially
inept. The plot starts off innocently enough. Aaron is an optimistic
videographer that responds to an ad on craigslist to make a film for
Josef. Suffering from a serious illness, Josef wants to make a video
for his unborn child. Josef wants to demonstrate to his unborn 'buddy' what kind of person he
really is. What a progression it is... Friendly, lighthearted, a little
awkward, rather intense, very unsettling, extremely abnormal, somewhat
terrifying... and then some. Certainly someone that lives up to the
films title. The film always keeps you guessing where it's headed...
There are several points you feel it's about to wind up and credits are
set to roll before it reaches it's gripping conclusion.More jump-scares to keep you engaged rather than terrifying horror.
Some moments that will make you laugh and cringe. Hardly a masterpiece,
but worth a watch and perhaps a sequel that is apparently forthcoming.
