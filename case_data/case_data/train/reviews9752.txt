Non-Stop Laughs,

21 Jump Street is a brilliant movie with a well developed storyline and
an outstanding comedic cast. It is filled with pure and sincere laughs
from start to finish, certainly one of the funniest comedies I've seen
in a long time, mostly made brilliant with the terrific chemistry
between leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, you could tell that they
got along very well on the set and enjoyed working together. The movie
was also quite heartwarming at times and the characters developed
surprisingly well, those are two significant things that make a movie
great, as we symphatize with the characters more, but comedies like
this usually don't bother with it, I was very impressed that this movie
did. Absoluteky hilarious and very enjoyable, I would highly recommend
21 Jump Street to anyone looking for a good comedy New police officers Schmidt and Jenko are sent on an investigation to a
high school to find and catch a group of people involved in a drug ring
occurring in the school.Best Performance: Jonah Hill Worst Performance: Jake Johnson
