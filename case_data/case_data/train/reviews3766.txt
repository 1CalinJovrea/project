too predictable for my taste

If you've never seen a movie before then this is probably tolerable.
Its always nice to see Elisabeth Shue. Jennifer Lawrence is definitely
a leading lady of the future but this does no-one associated with it
any favours.Its just too clich√©d, too predictable to be of any entertainment value.In fairness I didn't totally hate it, but it wasn't involving. Its not
a movie that you'll ever watch again or buy the DVD/ BR.This is no fault of the cast but the script which means that you'll
know how the movie ends before it is even half over. Unless you're a rabid Lawrence fan then I wouldn't bother with this
until there is a Netflix or DVD release.
