I'm Expecting more

As I have watched the trailer of wish upon, it made me interested and
Excited about this movie because as what the trailer shows it contains
curiosity and for final destination fans out there this movie is a mild
version of it. As soon as i entered the cinema, there was my excitement
and I am truly expecting for from this movie. The thing that lacks for
me the most is the parts where the death scenes are lacking of
something that can make the audience say "woah this scene!!" rather it
made me cut off my excitement because it is not creative enough but
since the main attraction of the movie is the story itself, it really
is realistic based on the experiences of the protagonist that when you
are getting bullied and there are real wishes to have, it is true that
you wanted it as if you don't care anymore so that is why it made me
still feel excited on about the characters portrayed and it was great. Story-7/10 Characters-7-10 Death scenes- 5/10 Overall:6
