A damn good film

This is a film well worth watching if you like innovative films that
draw you in to the story which gradually reveals its mysteries.I am not sure I would classify this as a horror film - in fact I am not
sure what I would class it as - but it is brilliant.The acting and production are excellent from start to finish, and you
never really know the whole story until you have been drawn deep into
the film and it is about to end.The only very slightly disappointing bit was right at the end. I would
have like to see the film carry on for a couple more minutes to see
more of what happened to the characters.
