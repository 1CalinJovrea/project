Solid Thriller

I applaud the Russo brothers and the writers Christopher Markus and
Stephen McFeely on a job well done in this action thriller The action
is riveting as are the quite scenes between the characters. There are
Good humorous punches in this script also. The returning cast are great
and expanding their roles from other movies, I am trying to be vague
here as not to ruin the movie. Also there are some great additions to
the cast as well. Anthony Mackie does a soaring job as the Falcon (pun
intended), he has a very comfortable fit to the cast and no way feel
forces in. Robert Redford is a very compelling character and presence
on screen. The action scenes were fantastic when I saw the resume of
the Russos's movies I was a little worried, now I think they might have
to worry about being type cast as action movie directors. There are a
few changes from the comic book story line but they are not
distracting. The Winter Solider is a movie that greatly expands and
shakes the foundation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Stay for the
two end credit sequences. I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it.
If it's action you want. Go see the Captain.
