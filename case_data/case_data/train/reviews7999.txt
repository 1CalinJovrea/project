9
A very good Spanish film, Hollywood must take it for example

I haven't seen many Spanish movies so far, but I can honestly say that
Contratiempo/Invisible Guest is about to be brilliant. I am not
familiarized with the actors from the cast, but I can say that their
acting is a very good performance and all the filming crew made a good
job with this one ! Filming angles, soundtrack, story line, cast, plot,
etc, all of them are a lot above the average thriller/mystery clich√©s
that Hollywood got us used to, but still it has some minor issues that,
in my opinion, of course, I would have changed. Those 'little problems'
made me to decide this movie is a 9, not a 10, a 10 would be a perfect
masterpiece, however, this one approaches perfection somehow. 1 hour
and 46 minutes are surprisingly enough for this film, even if it may
seem too little for a 9-rated movie, for the entire time I didn't get
bored or badly surprised, it was just very thrilling and full of action
and mystery. Contratiempo is, in my opinion, a must watch for
thriller/mystery enthusiasts and legal movie fans.
