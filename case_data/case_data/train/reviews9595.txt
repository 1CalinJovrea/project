I got dragged to see this. I knew it was going to suck. It sucked in a
"it's so bad it's good" kind of way. I was never bored. Mostly laughing
and saying, "You know nothing John Snow."But you know a movie is bad when it ends with a scene that is supposed
to be emotional and tragic, and the whole theater bursts out laughing.I feel like there's no point in me going over how poorly written the
characters were, because I'm sure everyone else has already done that.
The romance was extremely random. It's like they didn't even care about
the story.To be fair, the visual effects were great, but really, today there are
so many movies with great visuals, this one does nothing new. Although
it turns out that the filmmakers did their research for this film and
the set designs and the eruption were very true to fact (except for the
lava bombs and the tsunami) and even the ash-figures we see at the end
were based on (stress on based on) actual figures that were discovered.
So that raises the film a bit in my respect.Also,Atticus: Which bastard will be the one I kill today? Me: Ned Stark's
bastard.Sorry. :P
