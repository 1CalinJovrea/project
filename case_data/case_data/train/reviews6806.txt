Classic Tim Burton - Awesome

Time Burton scores again. This show is great and I will be getting it
when it comes out on Blu-ray.This is NOT a remake of Dark Shadows. It's a funny tongue-in-cheek
spoof in the lines of Burton's Alice in Wonderland. As a die-hard fan
of the TV series I can honestly say this is just a lot of fun. Depp is
great and the rest of the cast was well chosen. Even the music, which
is all of the 70's era, is perfect for the movie. Alice Cooper's
appearance was a blast and fit in well. There are twists everywhere and
it doesn't matter if you catch them or not. I bet you'll miss a few.
LOL Go see the movie. Don't over analyze it is, just enjoy it. Come back to
IMDb and rate it. It deserves a 10.
