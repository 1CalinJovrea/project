More Mysterious than Fulfilling

A middle age couple moves with their children to isolated outback town
called Naghtgara where children go missing routinely. The town exists
in a vacuum and it has no apparent reason for beginning. The family is
not happy with the new surrounding. It becomes evident that the couple
and family is highly dysfunctional.The husband played by Joseph Fiennes is also inattentive and
uninterested in his attractive wife played by Nicole Kidman. Lilly, the
young teen daughter, is sexually provocative to point of making the
viewer uneasy. But why is she this way? Her brother is distant and
cold. But why is he this way? Slowly the desert heat builds and one can
begin to discover that family has secrets. The kids disappear during
huge dust storm and we begin unravel the whys to our questions. Great
acting all the way around and Hugo Weaving steals the show with his
rugged Australia outback cop portrayal. The cinematography was
excellent it conveys the harsh reality of the outback and small towns
anywhere. This is steeped symbolism and an ambiguous ending.
