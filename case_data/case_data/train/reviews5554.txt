Quirky and heartwarming

Was expecting this film to be more predictable and very clich√© when it
came to plot line, however i was pleasantly surprised by the outcome,
Daniel Radcliffe's performance was a little stiff to begin with but
once you warm to his witty self deprecating character, you forget he
was once the embodiment of Harry Potter. Zoe Kazan is equally as like-
able with her offbeat geeky-yet-attractive girl next door character.
The chemistry between them is sweet and endearing and although they
meet at a party and instantly have a connection, they decide to stay
strictly friends (she has a boyfriend) the typical 'will they, won't
they' rapport keeps you on your toes all the way through.
