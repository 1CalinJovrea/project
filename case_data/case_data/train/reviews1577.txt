The Most Surprisingly Excellent Films This year!

First off, hats off to the acting in this film - the cast did an
amazing job. I was worried when i saw the trailer but i gave it a chance and I'm so
glad i did. Truly a very well put together film, with a plot that
carried it through and several audience members including myself cried
at times. It showed the brothers in a different light. Allowing the audience to
love them, hate them, sympathise and empathise with them. Tom hardy
played both brothers excellently and hats off to the supporting actress
who played Frances Kray - she did a fantastic job. A film you could re-watch again and again, the atmosphere and the
wardrobe were key aspects of this film and the director delivered on
pulling out all the stops. The script was beautifully written. That said, I'd ask you to remember that this film is from one take on
the Krays, they were a complex pair and short of holding a s√©ance, we
will never know what went on in their minds - this film is an
adaptation of an account. Judge it on what you see, don't waste time with trailers that spoil
parts for you. Buy a ticket and some popcorn and enjoy!
