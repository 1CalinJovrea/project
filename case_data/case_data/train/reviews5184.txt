Great visuals and Alicia Vikander really lift this adaptation of Vera Brittain's powerful memoir

Vikander's assured performance really saves this film from being just
another solemn costume drama, and it's largely thanks to her that the
passion that inspired Vera Brittain's antiwar classic still shows
through a sometimes rushed and perfunctory screenplay. Kit Harington
("Game of Thrones") is suitably intense as Vera's fiancé, Roland
Leighton (didn't recognize John Snow at first in his new guise as
beardless nature poet). The camera may seem to dwell too much on idyllic country scenes and
beautiful vistas at the expense of plot and character, though that does
help to heighten the contrast between Vera's privileged but restricted
prewar life and the new life of purpose and endless horror that awaits
her at a field hospital in France. The camera's used most effectively
when the two worlds collideto illustrate Roland's poem addressed to
the corpse of a German soldier found lying in a patch of wildflowers,
most of all in the panorama of a boundless field of dead and dying men
surrounding the hospital after a "big push" (which echoes the famous
crane shot after the Battle of Atlanta in "Gone with the Wind"). I'll
let the nitpickers figure out if the Leightons' house on the South
Coast really did have a magnificent view of what looks like the White
Cliffs of Dover, but the stormy shoreline makes the perfect backdrop
for a scene in which Roland returns angry and shellshocked from the
frontThe basic storylineVera's service in France and her romance with
Roland Leightonis skillfully dramatized and very moving; her struggle
with the conventions of Georgian family life is somewhat less
involving, one exception being an ironic episode in which she's
summoned back from the front to deal with a family "crisis," only to
find that her mother's gotten sick and has fallen behind with the
housework The much-praised '79 series with Cheryl Campbell only seems to be
available on VHS and Region 2 DVD; I wouldn't hesitate in recommending
this gorgeous and affecting new version as an alternative.
