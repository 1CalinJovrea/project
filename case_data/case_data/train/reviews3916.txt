Absolutely brilliant and surprising

I am a huge fan of Pirates of Caribbean franchise. I was desperately
waiting for this 5th installment (Salazar revenge/Dead men tell no
tails). I watched it in IMAX 3D. The movie is full of actions,
adventures and there are a lot of surprises and you will not keep your
eyes away even for a min. This franchise has some of the perfect
special effect and CGI. Every character in the movie is referenced well
and Jack is always ruling the sea. You are aware of the origin of Henry
in the movie from the trailer that he is will turner son but you are
not aware of the relation between carina and captain barbossa. That was
just amazing and emotional as well. While watching I was like OMG what
is going to happen next many times. It was very fun to watch. So far
the best movie for year 2017. And I don't agree with the critics and a
low rating on rotten tomatos. If you enjoyed and remember the movie as
a memory then it is worth watching. 10/10 for story, effects, actions
and comedy. Now waiting for its 6th installment.
