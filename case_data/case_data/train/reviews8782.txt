Dumb. Just plain dumb. Plot full of holes. Cringe worth

One of the worst films I've seen in ages. It's like those poorly made
horror films where the bad guy gets knocked down; the good guy then
turns his back on the bad guy, puts down his weapons and walks away,
while us, the audience, watches the bad guy get back up and attack the
good guy once again. Very painful to watch and I wish I walked out and
never finished the film. A total waste of two hours.Not only that, it's a piece of left wing propaganda, where corporate
America is evil and the peace loving muslims, and an obama look alike
are the good guys.As if the army would watch the president being chased across the White
House lawn, ten feet in front of them, and do nothing. Bad guys walking
around around the white house, sitting on the roof, and no one shoots
at them - but every time the bad guys shoot at the army, they decimate
the troops. The army doesn't kill a single terrorist. Asinine. Don't
watch it.
