Simply excellent entertainment

I give this film ten simply because it was way up there for sheer
entertainment, with no over the top blood and gore , something I find
mostly completely uneccessary. It made me laugh when it was meant to
and it had that 'Saturday morning pictures'(sorry all those under
60years old) feel of excitement without any of the cheap sensationalism
which so many films seem to employ these days.Maybe others call it
cheesy but I actually like it when the good guys win(a certain George
Lucas made quite a success of that). So if you like the poster(Dwain
never looked better) you want to be entertained for 98minuites without
having to work too hard, I'm gonna say this is an excellent (maybe
great) movie and I will check back in to see it again tomorrow. Oh yes
and it has two movie moments which are superb in my view, I leave you
too work out what they are but they both involved the 'Rock' at his
best even if he did need to swear for one of them, it was worth it, and
the other, well Heros always have to emerge from clouds of smoke or
flames or some such and given how hard the man worked to get himself
looking right I reckon he does one of the best emergence ever, go and
enjoy it, and watch Tinker ,Taylor, Soldier, Spy another day.
