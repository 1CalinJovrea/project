A Male's Point of View

Surprisingly, I went to see this movie on my own free will (not dragged
by my girlfriend, not with family, or even friends for good laughs). I
was not there to see the stripping, but there to see if this movie had
any sort of a plot. Here's the main focus of the plot: Mike is an
ordinary man by day and stripper by night. Although it may not seem
like it, Mike has a dream of owning his own business with stripping as
his only means of funding that dream. He then mentors a younger
co-worker (Adam) in the life and style of stripping (good and bad). As
the movie progresses, Mike becomes aware of Adam's sudden change of
personality, behavior and the movie shows the darker sides of his night
job. From then on, Mike wonders about whether he needs to leave this
lifestyle or continue to do what he does best.Seems like a generic plot but it does have a nice flow to it. Tatum
really brings out his character. There are some good laughs and
definitely not as explicit as some would've thought. We don't know much
of the supporting cast, outside of Adam, Brooke, Dallas and Tobias.
Matt McConaughey's character is very good and yet very underutilized
throughout the movie. That is one of the cons I have for the movie. I
also think the casting for Brooke was very odd as Cody Horn doesn't
seem comfortable in this role, nor is she any good for this role.Overall, it was a good movie. I know some of you will judge me for
watching this and that's okay. I'm an avid movie goer and I felt this
was an enjoyable movie to watch (even if it's targeted to females
13-50)
