Don't Bother

If your lacking sleep then this movie is for you. I think this must
have been a short film too start with, and they just filled it with
everything they could think off too make it longer. It takes so long too get going, and some off the acting was so poor it
made it hard too even get interested in the movie at all. Going by
previous Best Film awards this must be real contender too win the best
film award.So if you wont too watch it, wait and rent it so you can fall asleep at
home.So i left after an hour, to go home and watch the paint dry instead.
