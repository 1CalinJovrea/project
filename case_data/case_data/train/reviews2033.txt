Special Effects Are Spectacular-But Dialogue & Storyline Hokey As Heck

I'm usually all in for disaster flicks, and the special effects in this
one are spectacular (Colin Strause). There's an excellent cast as well,
led by Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino with good support form Alexandra
Daddario, Paul Giamatti, and Hugo Johnstone-Burt. However, I hope
you're not expecting any earth shattering (no pun intended) dialogue or
storyline, because the filmmakers here have taken every plot clich√© and
hokey line of dialogue and thrown it into this movie.All in all, this film, directed by Brad Peyton, with a screenplay from
Carlton Cuse, is just an escape filled with one tension packed scene
after another, but don't be surprised if you find yourself
unintentionally laughing out loud with some of the cheesy dialogue and
plot elements.
