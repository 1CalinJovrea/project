Amazing!

Having worked in kitchens i found this incredibly realistic and
everything in this film stays true to the life of so many chefs abusing
substances and their passion controlling their lives. I'm not normally
a fan of Bradley Cooper, however i was amazed to see his acting talents
here and how true he was to a real chef. Definitely a game changer for
his career after being unimpressed with him in hangover or wedding
crashes.If you have a passion for anything i think you'll like this film, it
simply displays every aspect of what people go through when they're
putting everything in their being into something, when it's all in, all
or nothing, life and death.9/10. A must see for all food lovers.
