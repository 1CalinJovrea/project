Gyllenhaal and Pena sell this thing. Everything else falls apart.

*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*Let's start with the good: 1. The rapport between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. Their banter
scenes in the car were my favorite in the film. And Pena actually
managed to steal the show from his costar. I liked him a lot. 2. There's some genuinely gripping material here with the opening car
chase, the home entries, and the shootouts. Kudos to Ayer for making
amateur home movie footage riveting.What bothers me about "End of Watch" is that it's a movie written
around the novelty of found footage. So much effort was put into
capturing the warzone streets (from every conceivable angle) that Ayer
forgot to throw in a decent story. It's sold as a realistic tale of the
brotherhood of two LAPD officers (brothers in arms), but it's not
really about that. This movie is ultimately about two cowboy cops who
run afoul of some evil drug lords, and they get shot up as a result.
Roll credits. I have no idea what Ayer was trying to say with this
movie because the sleight-of-hand he pulls at the end leaves me with a
completely empty feeling. If he'd at least killed both men (not the one
who didn't deserve it), we could acknowledge the nihilistic bent. But
we're supposed to feel something for Gyllenhaal's unlikable character
because he messed up. How was this at all about brotherhood?This would've been better if it was just about the cops' lives on the
streets (and their struggle to maintain humanity at shift's end). Just
leave out the Mexican cartel and their ridiculously cartoonish
assassins. The narration Gyllenhaal gives during the opening car chase
promises a far more interesting cop movie than what's presented here.
And it's crushingly disappointing that Ayer didn't follow through on
that.4/10
