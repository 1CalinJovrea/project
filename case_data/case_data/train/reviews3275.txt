A party of a film... not for the easily offended

I really should start this with a warning: This film is not for
everyone! If you are easily offended (by swearing, sexual references,
casual racism and various stereotypes) then you should read no further
and give this one a miss. However, if you are a fan of Seth
MacFarlane's other projects (Family Guy, American Dad) and maybe you
call yourself an "80's child" (so many pop culture references to this
time) you are going to love this.Sure some parts are a little disjointed, the story seems vaguely
familiar and the "moral" of it kind of gets lost but quite frankly,
it's just so darn funny none of that matters. The script is hilarious,
the cameos are fantastic and the soundtrack is perfect.Ted himself is well animated and Seth (apart from sounding a little
like Peter Griffin) voices him with the usual competence. Mark Wahlberg
delivers exactly what we have come to expect from him, and the rest of
the cast seem to have had fun filming, which comes across in the
various performances no matter how big or small. The acceptance and
interaction of everyone with a living teddy-bear adds to the simple joy
of this film, and you find yourself happy to watch and not question why
nobody is fazed by this. TED is a laugh a minute, party of a film and
I, for one, can't wait to see it again.
