really good

Flick about the bombing at the Boston marathon so you know that this is
going to be hard to watch because be honest, innocent people died
there. The acting was sublime, sadly I can't say of all the things
shown really happened that way because the pursuit between the cops and
the victims and all the bombs going off in the streets, I can't say if
that's true but it do gives this flick a special feeling about the
people in Boston all getting stronger out of the attack and working
together to hunt down the bombers.All acting is above mediocre, a thing you really need in this kind of
flicks. Another nice surprise in a year two real events were
transformed in a flick and both are really good (Sully). If you only
have seen the bombs going off and do wonder what happened afterwards go
pick this one up.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5
