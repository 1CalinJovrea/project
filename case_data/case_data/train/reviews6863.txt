Very very disappointing

I was expecting a great deal from this movie as I had enjoyed the
original Don Siegel movie of 1971. Having watched this very weak remake
I went back and watched the original again. I'm glad I did.The original 1971 movie is an interesting claustrophobic Gothic
thriller set against the backdrop of the brutally divisive American
Civil War. The original movie initially juxtaposes the caring females
who rescue the dying soldier and nurse him back to health (despite him
being the enemy), against the typically male scheming, conniving (and
ultimately violent) persona of the soldier who sets about seducing his
way to domination. The movie then subverts the narrative with the
manipulative behaviour of the jealous women and their ultimate act of
revenge brought about by his own arrogant assumptions of male
superiority. Hardly any of this is present in this remake. Furthermore,
the sexual tensions of the original movie with its disturbing take on
incest, predatory underage sex and the destructive jealousy between the
principal and the unmarried teacher which eventually leads to the
wounded soldier's demise was almost completely absent from the Coppola
movie. In addition, the new movie also removed the black slave
character and in so doing a whole subtext concerning white male
exploitation of black women and overall black subjugation by both the
Confederate and Union armies was lost. The Coppola movie never really gets going and the removal of all of the
backstories left the viewer with no idea of why the characters were
behaving in the way they did. As many other reviewers here have said it
makes for a boring turgid evening. Mercifully it was only 90 minutes
long.Viewed through modern eyes,the the 1971 film is a bit clunky but the
Coppola movie is so thin by comparison. It really does beg the question
of why bother to make it unless you can improve on the original.
