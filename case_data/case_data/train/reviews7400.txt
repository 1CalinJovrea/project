I think it was about the worst exorcism movie I've ever seen don't waste the money to see it

I expected way more out of this movie the best parts were in the
trailer! The music in the background was the worst. They're were people
in the theater laughing at the parts that were supposed to be scary to
sum it all up! Im a huge fan of Exorcisim movies and this was pretty
much a waste of money to me Id rather have just watched the Exorcism of
Emily Rose or even that T.V. show A Haunting. I mean with the budget on
this movie you would think they could have came up with something WAY
better than what they did I know I could have I mean really what the
hell was the director thinking I found the acting a bit dry and boring!
Anyways I hope this has helped some one some where save money and time
from seeing this crap movie!
