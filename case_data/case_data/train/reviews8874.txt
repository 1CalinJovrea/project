Good attempt at going for the Oscar, Mark.

I like Walhberg as an actor, and I think he's a good actor. This role
was a different step for him. I would not have imagined Mark as a one
hit wonder novelist turned lit professor from a wealthy background who
seems on the road to self destruction due to his gambling habit. He's
pulling on his ability to drive a movie, and it works. It's good that Wahlberg's performance was great (despite being very out
of content form what we'd expected from him). The movie in itself was
not really that good. I felt it acted too much like a sitcom with all
our problems being fixed and wrapped up in a thirty minute format (or
in this case two hours). Mark Wahlberg made you believe in how real
this guy's problems were only for the story itself to contradict that. Mark was not alone in carrying the movie as he also had help from the
always great John Goodman, who could have used a lot more time in the
film, and Micheal Williams who played a great antagonist to Mark's
protagonist For the most part, the movie was humorous and charming all thinks to
the acting chops of Markie Mark. I don't know if the academy will take
notice, but we all should.
