Geostorm of stupidity

"Geostorm" uses digital technology to destroy a bunch of cities and the
uninteresting screen writing assaults the dignity of several fine
actors. As much as I like Gerard Butler, this movie was a very bad
choice. It is no other than a low-quality big, dumb and boring,
disaster movie with minimal to no effort being made in the process.
Some funny dialogues don't save the film. You just have to sometimes
wonder who even thought this was a great idea to show to people. It'll
probably be most appealing to scientists looking for a good laugh.
"Geostorm" is the example of cinema as an immediate spectacle, as a
pure surface. If you enjoy those kind of movies "Geostorm" is your
thing.
