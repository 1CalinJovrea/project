Do not waste your money!!

Semi-Spoiler (But not really) Horrible movie, My wife and I walked out before the end. First it was
boring with predictable jokes and plots. Then after a half hour you
just get to listen to Justin Log scream for the rest of the movie....
That I saw anyway!! Do not waste your time!!, wait till it's free
somewhere. Truly sad, I am a fan of Kevin Smith's work but this was off
the mark!I hope the next horror movie that Kevin Creates is worth the time to
see it!!If you truly have nothing else to do and no where else to go and
looking to waste money..... just burn the cash!
