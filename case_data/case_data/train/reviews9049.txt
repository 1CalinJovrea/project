A short analysis of its failure to connect

Everyone else has made in depth reviews, but no one had explained why
this movie totally fails to live up to its inception. The premise is
established early on, Igor's perspective and his love for a woman, as
well as the promise - we know what happens in the end. The movie, 50% in, departs into the all to common trash heap of
needless violence and leaves Igor standing in the wings doing nothing.
What could have been an amazing study in humanity degrades to mindless
slashing, screaming, and absurd carnage.It was very disappointing to leave the most interesting characters and
plot points in the wings: the love interest of Igor, a brothers
immortal bond, the parable of death and life as seen through Igor. The
brother could have been a TRUE REVELATION but was cast aside for
mindless violence. An original ending would have left Igor staring at
the castle just before the "event" but not entering. We could have felt
the pathos, experienced mystery and dread, actually felt a personal
bond with the characters... but no. Mindless spectacle destroyed
everything.
