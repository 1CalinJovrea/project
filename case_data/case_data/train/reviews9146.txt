Was so very reluctant to go see this due to the amount of extremely
negative reviews, glad I didn't listen.Like all of you I was drawn to the writer, director & cast combination
which told me this film had a chance at greatness, well I'm not so sure
about greatness but this is a very good movie, one which both my wife
and I thoroughly enjoyed.The plot is secondary, only the story outline is necessary ("honest
citizen" buys into a onetime drug deal which goes bad and there are
serious consequences) to act as a framework around the events that
unfold. We do not need details of who, what , where or when regarding
the drug deal, we only need to see the greed and the evil it leads to,
play out.Yes the dialogue is metaphorical, gloriously so, and the actors deliver
this as it was intended to be delivered by the writer and the director.
This dialogue is superb in setting the ominous tone for the film, we do
not need to know who is picking up what and delivering to whom, we only
need to know that it didn't happen and somebody has to pay, pay a price
beyond imagining! While there are moments of amusement, it is a deadly
serious morality tale that does not play out to our long established
preconceptions. Decisions today can make for impossible decisions and
terrifying consequences tomorrow.Do not judge, rate or review this film within the traditional confines
of typical Hollywood movies, as it barely applies, maybe it does to the
star power but not to the content nor the execution.I really cannot wait to see this movie again, I give this an 8/10.
