Dwayne Johnson meets a tan man

I can take a comedy that doesn't have a strong plot, just as long as
it's funny. The film fails its one job, falling flat on most of its
jokes (quite literally in fact, considering the first prominent joke
involves a Cole Sprouse look-a-like*, played by Jon Bass, falling over)*To be clear, Jon Bass' character isn't meant to be an actual Cole
Sprouse look-a-like; I just wanted to point out that he really looks
like Cole Sprouse.
