A box office bomb that deserves an audience

At one stage or another it seemed as though A Monster Calls was set to
become one of 2016's breakout hits.Positive reception from initial trailers through to a fair portion of
glowing reviews, once The Orphanage and The Impossible director J.A
Bayona's film hit the public spectrum it only but enhanced this
adaptation of Patrick Ness's novel of the same name chances of becoming
a hit with a wide audience and even perhaps a hit with Academy voters.Fast forward to now and A Monster Calls can officially be described as
a box office dud that failed to make it into cinemas in Australia until
now whilst barely making a dent in the box office overseas where it was
largely forgotten about in the X-mas rush, despite a critical rating of
over 80% on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.A hard sell in many ways and an awkwardly targeted film, this is a
movie that's themes will go over many younger audience members heads
and is perhaps too "fantasy" driven for some older audiences, Bayona's
visually arresting and sometime emotionally resonate film is a film
that often feels torn between being too many things and while it's hard
not to appreciate elements of this unique take on the cancer drama
sub-genre, you almost wish it had become more of master of one than a
hodgepodge of too many ideas.One thing that is mightily evident outside of Bayona and his teams
impressive visual feats, especially when talking about Neeson's CGI
creation of the tree like Monster, is Bayona's continued solid work
with his performers and after drawing out such memorable turns from his
young cast members in The Orphanage and The Impossible, its quite clear
the director is a skilled developer of young actors.Here led by Lewis MacDougall as young boy Conor who is struggling to
cope with his mother's (played impressively by Felicity Jones) life
threatening cancer, Bayona extracts a memorable turn from the young
performer who has to do a large amount of the films heavy lifting.
While the film may struggle in ways to connect us at all times to its
hybrid of metaphorical monsters, storytelling and dramatic family
conundrums, the efforts of those involved here can't be faulted.Final say Â– Elevated by a unique visual tone, memorable acting turns and some spot
on voice work by Neeson, A Monster Calls is a solid film but one that
could've been so much more.If we look back but a few months, that talk about this film becoming a
true classic seemed to be legitimately on point but this final product
leaves one with a feeling of being let down even though emotions for
some may run deep as the runtime draws its closing periods.Still, Bayona is a director to get excited about and his upcoming
sequel to Jurassic World should likely be quite the thrill ride.3 destroyed lounge rooms out of 5
