Wonderfully refreshing look at Churchill

I'm sure I am not alone in having seen everything ever filmed about the
man.But this is nothing like I have seen before. He is so funny.We see his ability to make jokes like never before and there is more
here than just dry sarcastic references. He keeps us in stitches. He must have told 25 jokes.This film starts in the days when Chamberlain knows he cannot continue
as prime minister, alongside the crippling uncertainty of his cabinet
meetings, and through to when the entire country, as a result of his
speeches, stands firmly behind Churchill as war leader.What surprised me the most was how large a role the opposition party
played in Churchill's rise to power.Excellent supporting cast from those distinguished actors we have seen
in many BBC productions and "Game of Thrones".Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of King George VI was stunningly well done.A real delight at Tiff - too bad no Q&A for my screening.
