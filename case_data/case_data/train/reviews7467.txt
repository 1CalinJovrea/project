Visually Stunning and Emotionally Charged!

"Mama" is the first big horror film release of the year, so as a horror
movie fan, I really wanted to watch this. It has the name of Guillermo
del Toro, not as director as I first thought, but as a producer, so we
expected fantastic visuals. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jessica
Chastain there too, looking like I have not seen her before, sporting a
short dark Joan Jett-hairstyle. This film really had a lot going for
it."Mama" is a malevolent female spirit who jealously hounds the couple
Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) and Luke (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who
adopts a couple of young girls who had been found living wildly in an
abandoned cabin in the woods. Throughout this movie, in the way of
disturbing dreams and jarring apparitions, we join Annabelle try to
discover what exactly "Mama" wants that she cannot seem to get. First-time feature film director Andr√©s Muschietti succeeds to create a
horror film that was visually stunning as it was emotionally charged.
The stylish look may have been influenced by the producer, Guillermo
del Toro. The emotional ride was largely due to the restrained yet
effective performance of Jessica Chastain as a single rocker-chick who
was suddenly given the unexpected and unwelcome responsibility of being
a step-mother to two very disturbed girls.The one drawback for me was "Mama" herself, particularly how she
looked. I admit I did not really like how she reminded me so much of
Sadako (of the "Ring" films) in all its obvious computer-generated
glory. However, the camera angles used to show "Mama" and her point of
view were quite innovative. There were gaping plot holes when you think
the story through and try to give explanations to "Mama"'s illogical
behavior. But hey, she is a crazy ghost after all! Just sit back,
imbibe the creepy atmosphere and feel the emotion in the story.
