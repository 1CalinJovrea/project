4
Nice, but not that much

I gave a 4 because despite the awful story, the non-scary elements and
despite every character (monster) is a lamer version of a character
belonging to SK which apparently this writer surpasses (maybe in his
dreams) from the clown (IT) the giant praying mantis (spider end of IT)
the car (Christine) and so on. Then we have the extremely predictable
story. By the time of the parent daughter fight I knew she was a
monster. When it was revealed monsters came from books I knew she was
one. Also another problem is that you never think that maybe they will
fail or that anyone will actually die. You already know everything will
end up fine so you are in no way impressed. The whole typewriter thing
reminds me of "In the mouth of madness" and many others that hare a
similar subject. But unlike those it is never explained how come the
typewriter has that power, there is no explanation behind where those
characters came from and so on. Also a lot of characters were not
believable including Zach and Hannah. But despite all that I cannot
claim I did not enjoy it so it has a 4 from me.
