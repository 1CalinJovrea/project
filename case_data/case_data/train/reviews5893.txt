OK, but bland

It's watchable yes, but there isn't much to write home about. None of
the many avenues which would have elevated story above mediocre are
explored and no exciting territory is uncovered to give anything other
than a very even paced linear perspective of two old folks seeking out
the innocent pleasure of each others company in their twilight years.Great performances from the cast, that's for sure. The movie has
everything in good measure to make a respectable piece of cinema, but
not much else. This is really one for old folks and hopeless romantics.
Not so much because its about OAP's or senior citizens, but because is
about as conservative as you can get for material of this nature, but
it keeps an optimistic window ajar for the possibility of romance late
in life. Having said that, its just not that interesting a story, and
even the very able cast can't do much to make it special. The whole
tale is for the most part an uneventful account of elderly romance.
Even the ending which was the final opportunity to deliver an
interesting occurrence fades to black in a monumental anti-climax. This
is for those of us who like their chilli mild, and cake free from
sprinkles and toppings.Actually I liked it, but honestly, it was still just average. I can't
really recommend it as in all likelihood you'll be as blown away is wet
sand on a still day, and in truth there are far better films of this
ilk out there that you could watch with much better return.
