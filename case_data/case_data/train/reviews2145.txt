Overrated Oscar Bait

I've never taken the time to write a review for the site. But this
movie... is just too overrated. The struggle with this movie is based around the character. I am not
totally familiar with the actual personality of Jackie Kennedy, but I
walked out of the theater absolutely despising her. She acts as if she
is in the toughest position in the world, and as if nobody has ever
lost a family member before. Consistently, she displays a lack of
understanding that others just lost someone they knew as well. I
understand that we are supposed to feel compassion for her, but I just
do not.The film is a genuine trudge, with a cacophony of minor chords making
up what could be called the "theme." The soundtrack is grating, and so
is the rest of the movie. The only redeeming qualities of the movie is
a very solid performance by Peter Saarsgard, and an appearance by John
Hurt. Portman's performance is genuinely overrated, with small flashes of
quality and an overwhelming amount of "cry face". Overall, just not worth the hype, and a trudge through 90 minutes that
felt much longer.
