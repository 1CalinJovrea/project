Self-Indulgent Melodrama

No one was able to walk out of the theater this evening as the director
Gaspar Noe was in the audience. I'm certain he took note of folks
laughing at scenes meant to have profound emotional impact, like the
entire ending. Little character development with the main character's 17 yr old wife,
or 18, they had sex when she was 16, nothing more than a prop. Their
child, the unintended creation of a broken condom, is named "Gaspar".
The wife is an orphan of sorts, unwanted by her mother but somehow has
the cash and wherewithall to rent an apt in Paris and do nothing more
than go clubbing, listen to her iPod and bang strangers. Profoundly self-indulgent about lost love, but hard to take seriously
when the lost love happens between supposed college students (we never
see the college, college books or a single classmate) living and
partying in Paris, none of whom even are even remotely worth caring
about. Except perhaps the teenage wife, after she gives birth, but
again her only role is to get banged, have a kid and though otherwise
absolutely gorgeous, kind and loving as only a supermodel with minimal
lines can be, this one only serves to annoy the hell out of the main
character. Reminded me of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just
an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went
anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or
completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the
audience to know the film was over.
