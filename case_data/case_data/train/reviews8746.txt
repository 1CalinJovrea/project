Very worth watching...

I found the movie highly entertaining and thought-provoking, funny and
distressing at the same time.Couldn't help but think about how true this story is: your child
associates with the "wrong crowd" and no matter how much you try, what
you say, s/he is going down a bad path. All you can hope for is that
they'll find their real self before it's too late...I usually don't like violent movies, or films about gangsters,
druggies, and such. This has all these components in it - however, it
was very clear to me, that I would never, ever want to live in a world
as depicted there. (Not like most other movies with these topics, where
that attitude towards life is idolized and glorified...)Never mind what the critics say, watch it yourself - what have you got
to loose? 2 hours of your life. I think, these 2 hours will be much
better spent there, than watching any mainstream TV...
