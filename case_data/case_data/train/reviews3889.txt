It's a wonderful movie

The Vow is a wonderful little movie. At first blush, the movie seemed
like it's another 50 First Dates, but without the comedy. The only
similarity to 50 First Dates is that both the female leads suffer from
amnesia with their respective significant others trying to win her
heart. The Vow actually comes across having a feel more like The
Notebook.It's the story of the romance between Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige
(Rachel McAdams), and who are victims of a car accident. Leo recovers,
but Paige emerges with no memories of her whole relationship nor
marriage to Leo, and he must now make her fall in love with him again.
In her mind, as Leo says in one of the trailers for this movie, she's
still engaged to her ex-fianc√©.The movie manages to avoid cheap Hollywood writing, and gently leads
you down its plot. Just when you think you might know where the story
is going, it heads in a different direction. Details are revealed to
you layer by layer as Paige discovers them. Tatum's voice-over was
somewhat annoying, and unnecessary.In trying to remember her memories, Paige manages to gain a new life.
Opening in time for Valentine's Day, this makes for a wonderful
date-night movie.
