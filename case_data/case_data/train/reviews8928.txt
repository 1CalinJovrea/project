Paranoid and Manipulative... and Those are its Better Qualities

I felt little more than pity for Peele after watching this movie. His
sad fantasy view of white people and their motives towards black people
reveals a disturbed and paranoid world view.In some of his comedic work, he seems to be mocking this kind of
paranoia, but in Get Out he's embraced it as justified. Maybe I was
just giving him too much credit before (I'm thinking of his skit with
white zombies that won't eat black people).If a white author wrote a similar story, projecting his paranoid
visions of black stereotypes onto fictional black characters (who, of
course, are mere puppets and who have no actual control over their
actions), he would be reviled and the picture canned or banned.However, our modern double standard allows Peele to get away with. In
fact, he's apparently now celebrated for it.In addition to the above, it's just generally not an interesting story.
It's highly rated, and I was looking forward to a good horror film, but
it's not.If you're a minority who wants validation for your paranoia, or a white
person who wants to wallow in white guilt, you might get something out
of it. If not, then no.
