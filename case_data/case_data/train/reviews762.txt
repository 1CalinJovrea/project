The best bits are all in the trailer

The trailer was looking promising. Lots of laughs and clever humour.
Hopes were high as the trailer for Zootopia was inciting and that film
did not disappoint. However, Secret Life of Pets turned out to be a
fizzer. Excessively violent for a children's film, not funny or clever
and really rather odd. The characters are not developed which means
that the audience doesn't particularly care what happens on their
quest. The stand out of the film is the husky little white fluffball of
a dog. I think this film is aimed at children, though the guy down the
row from me was certainly laughing a lot (while I was taking power
naps). Not the same caliber as Despicable Me.
