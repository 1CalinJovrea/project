Waste of time. Unless you believe in astrology, tarot, numerology and reincarnation.

(First, English is not my first language. So, I apologize in advance
for any mistake.) I honestly don't understand the high rating this
awful movie got.OK. There is great actors doing a great job. But that is it. Everything
else is either plain simple or intellectually disgusting. I have never seen a movie so predictable. Am I the only one here seeing
the colossal plot-hole here? I mean, resurrection corroborated by
eye-scan? Really?! Oh, come on! That is so incredibly illogical.And not only this movie take such ridiculous premise seriously, it also
tries to give a scientific background. And that is just dishonestly.
You want go nuts, go nuts. Don't try to use science in that way,
please, it's immoral.Resuming the movie in one formula: "aww, look the cute atheist that now
believe in magical things". Not a single drop of originality.The dialogue is basically centuries-old discussions of science versus
spirituality with stereotypical characters (the smart and a bit
arrogant boy, and the lovely, bit weird, vegetarian girl). Don't watch this movie. Waste of time. Unless you believe in astrology,
numerology and reincarnation.
