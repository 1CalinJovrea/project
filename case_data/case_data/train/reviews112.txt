Megatron should not be directing movies

I do not know where to start. Taken 1 was Brilliant! Taken 2 was bad.
Taken 3 bad.The premise is worth for **** just like Taken 2. They are such amateurs
that they make the husband of Lenny the bad guy?! That and extremely
bad editing and camera movement made this close to a B movie. Also
there are so many stupid choices! I will limit them to 10.1. When they mention phone numbers with 555 it takes people out of the
movie experience. That is a stupid move and the first reason Olivier
shouldn't be directing ****.2. Mills randomly shows strangers picture of his daughter.3. When they block logos with stickers it takes people out of the movie
experience. That is a stupid move and the second reason Olivier
shouldn't be directing ****.4. Police predict Kimmy will take the bugged sweater and use it for
days so they can listen.5. Audi is labeled A8 in the police report when that car does not
exist. It is a R8. (not a big deal, but you are making a multi million
dollar movie you should not make stupid mistakes like that.6. What is it with Megatron and his boner for beeping computers.
Computers do not beep when lights flash. Idiot.7. Security cameras do not have blinking red lights on them and
definitely not BEEPING noises! Idiot! 8. Ex CIA operatives do not let arms dealers stand freely in situation
rooms.9. Phones do not randomly beep indicating there is an airport near you.10. Brian Mills would never let Lenny be married to an arms dealer.
Olivier would know this if he had bothered to watch the brilliant Taken
1 before ruining the franchise.To sum up I highly recommend everyone who watches Taken 2 and or 3 to
do so as independent movies without any connection to Taken 1. Olivier
Megaton should not be making movies of this caliber. He should not be
making movies at all. I do not understand why Luc Besson has EVER
ALLOWED THIS ABOMINATION to make sequels to his movies.
