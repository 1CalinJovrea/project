Conventional and Predictable Thriller That Entertains

The waitress of a dining Jill (Amanda Seyfried) returns early in the
morning and does not find her sister Molly (Emily Wickersham) at home.
She goes to the police department to report that her sister is missing,
but detective Powers (Daniel Sunjata) and his team do not give credit
to Jill's words. Some time ago, Jill claimed that she had been abducted by a stranger
and dropped in a hole in the middle of the Forest Park, where she found
the corpses of other missing girls. However she succeeded to escape but
the investigators did not find any evidence and Jill was sent to a
mental institution. Jill decides to investigate where Molly could be and she brings her
revolver for self-protection. When the police discover that she is
armed, they begin a manhunt to arrest her. Nobody believes that Molly
has been kidnapped and believes that Jill is delusional. Is she?"Gone" is a conventional and predictable thriller that entertains. The
story is developed in a right pace and with the usual clich√©s (car
chases, detectives that do not believe on a victim etc.), but the
conclusion is good. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "12 Horas" ("12 Hours")
