2 guns against FBI, CIA, DEA, Navy and Mexican drug lord

Those were the old days in a movie where laws chasing bad guys. Now its
time where laws fight themselves. FBI, DEA, CIA, Navy, Military and
what else. '2 Guns' tells the story of corrupted officers from
different organizations. Just like the movie 'Mr and Mrs Smith', the
movie centers around two characters Bobby and Stig. The criminal
partners who plan to rob a bank but the intense are different. They
just follow the order from their bosses. Then they realise they were
used as a bait by their superiors to recover the millions that looted
by them. Now the rest of the story tells do they join hands or work
their separate ways to fight and put back everything in the track.Solid performances, great stunts, quite good story, all in all a decent
entertaining movie. The story explains very well regarding with the
collision of different organization. One thing they made us fool that
there were not only two guns in the movie, there were hundreds. If they
were considered two lead characters as guns then okay, fine, that's a
relief. Overall it was a popcorn movie to have on the boring weekend.6.5/10
