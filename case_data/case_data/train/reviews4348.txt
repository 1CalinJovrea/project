I Contra - banned this movie from my house

This movie wasn't half as good as a Tuesday special full roast chicken
from Metro for $6.99. The movies starts off really promising with Marky
Mark lifting weights, installing security systems and driving his truck
over sidewalks. According to the special features Mark had to sit on
four phone books to reach the pedals. Speaking of Special Features the
only Special Feature Marky Mark has is that his brother Donnie has been
carrying him for years! Anyways, I digress.Contraband is a movie about a group of smug smugglers who try to
smuggle something somewhere, or something. I don't really know to be
honest. Giovanni Ribisi is trying to channel Marlon Brando, but
unfortunately for him he just sounds like somebody beat his mouth in
with a Louisville slugger. They got Ben Foster to be in the movie by
lying to him and telling him that this wasn't a Marky Mark film. Then
on the last day of shooting surprise! You've been Marked! That's what
he calls it when he tricks people to be in his movies, which obviously
he has to do. Quick, whats a good Marky Mark movie? You probably said
Notting HillÂ….but guess what?!?! Marky Mark isn't in Notting Hill, you
just got Marked!All in all I would give Contraband one VHS tape out of ten. If Marky
Mark wants to keep his career going he is going to need to do a buddy
cop movie with brother Donnie very soon and call it Baston Brothers.
