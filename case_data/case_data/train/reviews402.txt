Implausibility reigns supreme here,

What could have been a fun throwback to disaster movies from the 1970s,
about a bomb on a plane and a terrorist threat, is over complicated
with its political subtexts and wholly unbelievable contrivances.Liam Neeson is good, as usual, as an Air Marshall who begins receiving
text messages threatening to kill a passenger on board his midair
flight (from NY to London) every 20 minutes, unless a huge ransom is
paid to a bank account in Neeson's own character's name. The first
death, at the hands of Neeson's character himself, was clever and well
done, I thought. But the explanation later given for that death was
ridiculous, and that's it for originality here, unless you call
absurdly drilling a hole from the toilet to the cockpit originality.One ludicrous twist after another follows, as nearly every
stereotypical character in arm's length is turned into a red herring at
some point. Julianne Moore is mostly there just to act suspiciously,
and babble about her surgery, which is completely irrelevant to the
plot.The conclusion takes itself FAR too seriously, going from what should
have been a fun action thriller off into a political message movie, by
claiming the two men responsible for these actions were motivated by
9/11. But then the screenplay reverts to its illogical ways, as the two
men responsible for this are going to ... wait for it, wait for it,
parachute from the plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Then what?
Will they swim to the UK? Film tries to work as a mystery, but with so very many red herrings,
startling coincidences, and plot holes, it falls flat.
