A Memorable and Intense Experience

This is the kind of film that invites much thought during and
afterward. The story leads you to constantly question what is really
happening at any given moment, and whenever you are certain that you
know exactly what is going to happen, something new appears to make you
question that. There is a powerful and intense atmosphere of dread and
stress throughout, all building to a terrifying conclusion, but I was
taken unawares by how emotional the whole thing would be. This is a
very poignant film. The characters seem real, and the performances are
excellent, especially from the lead, Logan Marshall-Green. This film
casts a very potent spell and I can say that days later I am still
thinking about it. I can't think of anything quite like it. It
certainly made me frightened to visit California.
