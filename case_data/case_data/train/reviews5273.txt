Virtual Experience of war, chaos, horror and hope

From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of the
South Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSD
or dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down).
So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtually
relive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror,
fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films and
books (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights of
BATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theater
feeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well.
It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the film
draws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE.
Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segment
of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intense
version of the standard war film.Be prepared to have your life changed by this one. It's that damn good.
