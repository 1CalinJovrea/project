(heavy sigh) It's OK, but it could have been great

The core Tarzan story is not only iconic, it speaks to something deep
within us. It is at the same time the ultimate Romance and the ultimate
Action tale. It is no coincidence that, almost a century ago, when
young Hollywood looked to find a franchise for its new "talkie" motion
pictures, they turned to the Tarzan tale, and spawned a franchise so
successful that it literally outlived the shelf life of its star.In my lifetime I have seen well over a dozen versions, retellings and
re-imaginings of the Tarzan story. I have no doubt that after I am
gone, producers and writers will continue to be attracted to it and
continue to "make their bones" by bending it to their unique style.That said, this one is not especially good. After a great opening
scene, there is the filmic equivalent of "dead air" for about 35
minutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and
falls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre
editing.Alexander Skarsg√•rd has been impressive in other films (a race driver,
a superhero) and I think with different material and a different
director he could have connected. Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson
remain two of the most over-exposed stars in Hollywood and, good as
they are, they are running out of clever ways to play the same
character over and over. And over. And over.
