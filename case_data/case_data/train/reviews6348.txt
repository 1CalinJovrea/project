What a disappointment

I had high expectations for "Out of the Furnace". I'll watch any film
starring Christian Bale, and the rest of the cast -and especially the
reviews- only made me more eager to see it.I want to be careful not to spoil the plot, but frankly there's not
much to spoil. When the credits rolled I was left wondering what the
point of sitting through these two hours actually was.Casey Affleck is certainly a good actor, but he has yet to star in a
great movie. Woody Harrelson is decent as a stereotypical bad guy. Bale
is excellent as always, and the rest of cast are reduced to mere props.What a let down! 2013 is a year to forget in Hollywood.
