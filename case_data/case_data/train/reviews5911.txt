Terribly Manipulative & Sappy

This latest film from Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom, based on the
novel by Nicholas Sparks, is terribly manipulative and sappy.
Additionally, I thought the acting and dialogue were, for the most
part, stilted and wooden, with every attempt to pull at your
"heartsrings".In the opening scene, Julianne Hough, who portrays Katy (AKA Erin),
flees what appears to be a murder scene. Boarding a bus, she eventually
settles in the small town of Southport. In this idyllic town she meets
Alex, played by Josh Duhamel, a widower who owns the local general
store and lives in town with his two children, Lexie and Josh.Back in Boston, where Katy fled from, a Detective Tierney is
relentlessly trying to locate her, even issuing an APB naming her as a
murder suspect. It's only about halfway through the film that we start
to find out what's really going on.We also find out Detective Tierney is a violent, alcoholic abuser who
is actually married to Katy. His motive in finding her is to confront
her and then bring her back to Boston and naturally abuse her some
more. David Lyons, who portrays Tierney is actually fairly credible as
the despicable and disturbed Detective.Of course, by this point, we pretty much know what's in store here.
Katy and Alex will fall in love and Detective Tierney will find out
where she is and there will be a dramatic conclusion.One positive in the movie was Mimi Kirkland, as Lexie, Alex's daughter.
I thought her precociousness and likability on screen was infectious.The twist ending (not having read the book) I thought was horribly
insulting to the movie viewer and a giant set-up.Very disappointed in the award winning Hallstrom, who has given us such
wonderful films as "My Life as a Dog", "What's Eating Gilbert Grape",
and "Chocolat", among others, for giving us this melodrama.
