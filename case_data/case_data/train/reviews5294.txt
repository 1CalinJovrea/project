Different enough to be worth watching

If you are wondering what different things can they do for this very
familiar story to make it worth watching - they do succeed in giving a
fresh perspective - Igor's The cast is likable and watchable. Daniel
Radcliffe is a good actor and his roles since Harry Potter are actually
show his range. The transformation from hunchback to Igor is quite an
extreme makeover. James McAvoy is a also a very convincing actor and
acts obsessed enough. Despite both actors being small sized they can
pull off a big action movie. Jessica Brown Findlay of Downton Abbey is
a pretty love interest (for Igor no less) and her role isn't
irritating.The first resurrected creature and organs are quite morbidly
frightening for what they are.The ending is grand but kind of wonder what did Victor expect once they
brought him to life? Anyway it's not necessary to look to deep into a
story like this.Worth a watch.
