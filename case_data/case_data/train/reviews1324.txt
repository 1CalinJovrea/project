teenage girls movie

... and not a very good one too (not to say simply boring).i even couldn't force myself to watch it all. Maybe im too old for it,
bu then last week i watched "the last mimzy" (children movie) and found
it pretty good. No, if something is good you'll find it's quality even
if you're not a lover of a specific movie type.Some details: - acting - it's as artificial as the whole script itself
so i cannot blame the actors - script- look above - the whole concept
of society being divided to factions, im fine with that, but
excluding/killing people who e.g. feel compassion and declared
themselves to be soldiers, thats just ridiculous. - oo, and that hand
combat technique of holding your front-to-oponent elbow high- try that
in real life and it wont be a long one.To summarize, i agree with critics on this one.
