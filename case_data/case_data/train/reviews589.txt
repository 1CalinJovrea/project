TV movie with Cinematic production values

Based on a true story, brrr... Burton ventures into the realm of TV
movie land (that's where most true story movies dwell) although this
was a limited cinematic release and also limited success. Amy Adams
plays a painter who paints children with Big Eyes. She meets and
marries Waltz who shortly after begins to take credit for her work.
Adams is cast well as the good virtuous woman and Waltz is a bit
type-cast as the friendly but
guy-you-love-to-hate-and-wanna-punch-in-the-face bad guy. But he plays
it big and sometimes a bit comedic which makes the tone of the film
lighter. Big Eyes has a very colorful set- and production design and
looks great. The movie itself tough feels like it could have been made
by any other director and doesn't have the Burton feel. So you could
say it's the least Burton-esque film in his repertoire. Seeing it in
the cinemas won't add much value, it's more a nice Sunday afternoon
flick that works just as well on your small screen.
