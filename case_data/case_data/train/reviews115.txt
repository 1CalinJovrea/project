Top Shelf For This Genre

As a fan of the "coming of age" story structure, I am happy to report
that this film met my expectations in every single way. Some key plot
points were predictable, but the writing, performances and soundtrack
were all on point. The emotions and experiences the film conveys do not
feel artificial, and Hailee Steinfeld shines! Intelligent writing and
little twists here and there will likely leave you genuinely invested
in the life of these characters and leave you wanting more. Woody
Harrelson plays a wonderful image of a teacher dealing with his life
amidst high school drama and Kyra Sedgwick's performance as a
struggling mother was especially heart felt and real. This is not to be
missed for fans of this genre!
