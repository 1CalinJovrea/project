Although the movie doesn't posses any intellectual value it is very entertaining and interesting to watch

The movie doesn't flourish with intelligence, but does it have to? It's
genre makes it just a movie for entertainment. Jennifer Lawrence's
acting is just flawless as in every other movie, which solely can make
this video worth watching, but what I like most about it is it's
unexpected ending. This is the very rare case when I couldn't actually
guess the ending of the movie. It also sends a little message to the
viewers about bullying and aggression, although, I repeat myself, it
doesn't serve for the purpose of enlightenment of the viewer. I would
recommend to watch this movie, but only with friends, when you want to
be simply entertained.
