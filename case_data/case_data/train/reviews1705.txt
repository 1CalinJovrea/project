EverLASTING...

Once again I've gone to the movies with high expectations and been
disappointed. My expectations fell off the mountain and landed in a
heap of "what was I thinking and I want my money back!"This film was way too long for the story told. Viewers are given the
thinnest possible background of the people involved. One man is from
Texas and apparently very wealthy. He can afford to hire a helicopter
to come rescue him off the mountain. One woman is Japanese and has
climbed six other peaks. One guy is a hippie type who likes to sunbathe
in his undershorts at base camp. Another is a married man expecting his
first child. One climber is pretty old to still be climbing mountains
and doesn't seem well.So, okay. That's all we know about them. After that, it's up the
mountain they go and some of them don't make it back. It's pretty
difficult to feel scared or concerned or any other emotion about
complete strangers whose lives are not explained in the least.I'm giving the film a "3" out of "10" rating because the scenery and
the mountain itself is beautiful, but I could have found that out in a
travel documentary. Meh. Save your money.
