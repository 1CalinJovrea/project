Formulaic

War DogsOne could sum up this movie in a single word, "formulaic."If you've ever watched any of the movies about West Coast drug-dealing
of the 80s (Blow), or any movie with Benicio Del Toro in it (Snatch,
Traffic), you will quickly recognize one or more of the stylistic
techniques stamped all over this movie:- Off-camera narration by one of the protagonists talking about how
smart or stupid they were at this point in the adventure.- Wackiness in the face of danger. - Celebration of the stoner mentality.- Overhead shots using helicopters or drones.- Overuse of circular camera dolly around two subjects quibbling to
suggest "tension."- Cool music.Oddity------Choice of music. The setting for the movie is the early 2000s, and
these guys are in their 20s, yet the music is a collection golden
oldies from 60s. Is that the music the producers like? Is it aimed at
the suspected target audience?Nitpicks-------The lead character says "Bro" more times than any character in any
movie in history. Guess that's a refreshing change from "dude." LOL.Aside from all that, I still liked the movie, just thought is was
hackneyed and formulaic.
