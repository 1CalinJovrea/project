The preachy virtue signalling became too hard to swallow

So I enjoyed the film. The action, some of the characters and the
invention of the makers was really good.However, I did begin to feel the nausea of preachy moralising becoming
a little too hard to swallow or rather overtaking the film about half
way through.Yes, it's good to embolden children and individuals that they can be
what they want to be but it shouldn't be at the behest of others. I've
no problems with women being in the army and on the front line but they
should be able to do exactly the same as what a man can.Bending the rules or turning a blind to physical inadequacies are fine
in the classroom but get to the front line when someone is incapable of
physically carrying a fellow wounded soldier or lugging that ammo crate
around and your well meaning positive discrimination leads to a less
than effective fighting force.Even so I was cool with Hopps getting through the selection (albeit off
the literal backs of others) though I started to feel the embrace of
political correctness when the front desk guy was remonstrated for
calling her cute (with it's less than subtle nod to the n word).Okay, that's still fine as the world we are being presented with in the
film is fun and entertaining. The sloths are hilarious and it's all
bright and shiny.But half way through the messaging that we are wrong to judge people
and the moral posturing began to get a little overwhelming. Yes, a
utopia of rivers of chocolate and laughing children and never needing
to lock your front door is all very nice but it seemed to be preaching
that anyone who didn't think this utopia was achievable was evil or in
some way morally corrupt.It didn't seem to be a case of acting on what's right in your heart,
tempered with your head, but acting on what the liberal intelligentsia
are telling you is right. Having stomached so many 'informed' people
preaching that voting for Brexit was because I was a racist thicko, I
find it hard to ignore when I feel the air of posturing creeping into
the narrative.I've seen many reviews acknowledging what the film is about but that
it's subtle and non preachy. I certainly didn't feel that. Maybe I'm
more sensitive to it but I didn't go into the film being aware of the
moralising that was in it and hence what I felt was an organic reaction
to the film rather than having any preconceived ideas.A fun film that made me laugh in the first half/two thirds but one
where the lasting impression was that I'd just been lectured/preached
to.
