A horrific and emotional journey through every war movie cliché

I had high hopes that Fury might end the dry spell of good WWII movies.
I could have forgiven the checklist of war movie clichés Fury manages
to work in had it not been for a laughable final battle more akin to
something from The Expendables than a serious war movie. The final
battle consists of scenes where a battalion of seasoned SS soldiers run
back and forth through our heroes' machine gun fire, only stopping when
it is time for a forced emotional exchange inside the tank. While the
director chose to have every other enemy brandish an anti-tank weapon
in the ominous lead-in to the final battle, for some reason only three
of them are fired, two which miss at unrealistically close range. The
ridiculousness of it all turned me into that obnoxious movie goer that
laughs out loud during what should be a serious and emotional scene. On the positive side it does manage the singular achievement of most
war movie clichés fit into two hours:Kill a German officer on horseback - checkChristian singing hymns - checkMexican crew member made fun of for speaking Spanish - check Hardened leader with a unknown pre-war history who has a private
emotional breakdown - checkYoung replacement who struggles to fit in with seasoned veterans but
wins them over in the end - checkSoldier falls in love with local girl only to watch her die - check A final mission with impossible odds - checkMoment of doubt when facing certain death but where everyone decides to
stick together in the face of certain death - checkRetarded enemy is almost defeated only to remember how to do war, and
only after our team has completed their emotional bonding and character
development - checkOne member escapes death against all odds-checkEnemy soldier shows mercy by not revealing hiding soldier - check....and many many many more.
