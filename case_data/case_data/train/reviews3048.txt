No. Just no.

Sing is probably the worst animated movie I saw all year. I really
don't feel like saying more. Just leaving my review here. Just note
that this movie has done literally nothing new or original, has a
budget half of what other animating companies have to save expenses,
and does not have one main character, but 6 or so, so that every
conceivable social group has someone to "represent them", and will
therefore feel nice when they inevitably win, even though the whole
story was badly written and forced. Also, they are animals for no other
reason other than "it looks cute". This is lazy, bad, sloppy and just
overall badly done. Its literally like they saw a bunch of music videos
and decided to make a "movie" out of it.
