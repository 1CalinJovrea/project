Owen Wilson is so good in serious roles !!

I always enjoyed Owen Wilson's comedies but I still recall his Behind
Enemy lines role and he did it so perfect! In this movie too, I did
expect him to do a fantastic job in a serious role and he just crosses
all your expectations! Pierce Brosnon was was amazing in this movie,
though not that much of a screen time he shares, but shines in whatever
time he gets on screen. The child actors and the female lead did their
job fair n square. The slow motions used are so perfectly timed in this
movie and go so well with the background scores.It was intense and captivating throughout! A perfect "escape movie"
with tensions not subduing for any time at all. Excellent editing and
direction with good enough production values and cast. There are some
very intense action scenes throughout! This movie is I guess one of the
underrated gems! Do watch it.
