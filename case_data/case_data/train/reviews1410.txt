Taylor Sheridan has done it again

I was lucky enough to see this at the Nantucket Film Festival back in
June and I thought it was excellent. And based on the response of the
people around me in the packed theater, I wasn't the only one. The
applause at the end was loud and long. The movie ended up coming in
second at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick.I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, Hell or High Water.
Definitely more than Sicario.The scenery, the score, the dialogue and the acting were all on point.
Some of Jeremy Renner's best work. He's been spending so much time
playing spy and superhero lately that I think people tend to forget
that he was nominated for Hurt Locker and The Town. His performance
here is even better.
