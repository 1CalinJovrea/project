Unfortunately, only an action movie

Despite good casting, very good performances, more than a correct
direction, camera work, sfx, editing and music, this movie is not
excellent. It has no soul, as previous version (with Timothy Olyphant,
2007) did. Comparison is inevitable. This is only an action movie: a
good bunch of action scenes and essentially a mindless fun. However, no
character development or an explanation who, why, where, when and so
on. Previous version had it all and if someone planned sequels (or a
franchise), they should have done it eight years ago. Then it would
make sense. Don't get me wrong here. This movie is not a bad one and
the cast gave it all to make it entertaining. But for me that is just
not enough, considering the template (video game) and possibilities to
develop a good idea into a more complex and challenging story. This
movie returns all to the level of the video game (maybe even below
that). I think that these characters deserve more. So do we.
Recommended for "set-brains-to-off" fun on a weekend afternoon.
