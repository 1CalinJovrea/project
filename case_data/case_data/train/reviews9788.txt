Nymphomaniac 2 Now I liked the 1st film but this one? I couldn't get
away with I think this one makes you realize that the character has no
emotion or remorse for what she does and then the writer tries to shock
us by comparing Paedophiles to Nymphomaniacs and in my eyes trying to
justify the 1st of the two is unthinkable stating that 95% of them will
live with it without anyone ever knowing and not acting out their
fantasies! (No these people are monsters) I think he has gone on for
full on controversy by trying to defend it, but apart form that the
film is not as strong as the 1st part with a pretty poor ending which
lets it down.
