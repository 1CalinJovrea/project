awful

The beginning to middle was dreadful, middle to end was incredibly
average. I wish I didn't pay to see it as the trailer gave me false
hope. Boring as hell and consisted of the first lady walking around the
house being sad the whole time. I must admit there were about 3
interesting shots but the only bit that actually grabbed my attention
was the very short clip of JFK's head being dismantled. Disappointed
because Natalie was amazing in Black Swan and I was hoping for a more
interesting take on the story. in conclusion; this is my opinion and I
know people have different tastes in films but if you thought this film
was amazing you've clearly never seen an above average film in your
life.
