Best Movie Since Halloween

(sent from my Iphone3) Good day Madea fans! I am writing this review
from my seat in the theater, having just watched BOO2 3 times. Let me
say this, this movie is a keeper! Don't let those snoozy reviews throw
you off! You have to see this movie! From the opening credits to the
last sound, this movie will keep you on edge. That Madea cat is
something else and I have to say, my BOO2 Tshirt, just ordered from
Amazoon.com, is inbound as of yesterday! OK, back to the movie. BOO2
will keep you "howling" throughout, and if you are looking to be
tricked? Have no "fear" as this movie is a treat! Get your popcorn,
treat it with some hot saux, and sit back and relax. You will not be
disappointed. BOO2 is not a "Boo Hoo."
