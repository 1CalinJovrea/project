Exceeded Expectations

"Safe House", directed by Daniel Espinosa, is more like a 7.25 out of
10. What really works for the movie is unsurprisingly a good script and
2 seasoned likable actors. The story has some novelties along with it
as well, in no small part, the Safe Houses (hence the title) (spoiler)
which become anything but safe. I thought the action scenes mostly were
well crafted including chase scenes and close in fist-fights.
((spoiler) I especially liked Reynolds as coming off novice believably.
Aside from the stupidity of having the Reynolds character bring
Washington to a soccer match in public and the predictability of who
turns out to be a double-crosser, the movie is a good watch. It's worth
a rental anytime and exceeded my expectations. Recommended.
