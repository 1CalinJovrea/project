The Fly re-invented: less story, more gore!!

This is not a bad movie at all! Okay, it's The Fly all over again, but
with a different approach: not the whole scientific mumbo jumbo, but
just one simple bite of a never specified bug, that sets in motion the
whole transition into... well, into what specific monster is not so
clear, it could be into a human variation of an insect or into some
sort of hatching-oven for thousands of tiny frogspawn-like insect-eggs.
The main attraction of this movie is not so much the simple story-line,
but without any doubt the abundant gore, the make-up department must
have had a ball, it's all honest handmade craftsmanship and it looks
fantastic! And I don't mean just the appearance of the main character
but also the make-up of her apartment, that gradually turns into some
sort of gruesome slimy and sticky and dripping insects lair. As I said: the story-line is a bit flimsy, notwithstanding the somewhat
elaborate interpersonal complications that are brought-in, like a
virginal relationship between the main character Casey and her
boyfriend (virginal in 2015??? both seem to be grown-ups in their
twenties!), a future mother-in-law out of hell and a jealous and
conniving BFF. These extra story lines don't seem to add anything to
the main premise (i.e. changing into a human insect due to a bugs bite)
and actually lends the movie a kind of grey sixties atmosphere,
enhanced by the setting in some kind of boarding-house. It's only the
use of cell phones that reminds you it's all supposed to happen in the
present day. As far as the acting is concerned, that's hardly of any importance in
this kind of movie. Elma Begovic as Casey gives a chilling account of a
slowly deteriorating nasty monster, but this is mainly due to her
make-up. The others are barely adequate. So just go for the visual ride
in this gory, slimy machine and you're sure to be rewarded!
