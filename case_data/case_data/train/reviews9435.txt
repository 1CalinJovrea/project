Too Many Offensive Words Profaning Jesus And Son Cursing His Own Father.

{Straight Outta Compton }is a movie everyone must avoid.It has a lot of
offensive words ( Profaning Jesus As mother fuc.er) by a blasphemous
white man who often shouts in the face of his own dad and describes his
own dad as a (mother fuc.er)!!!!. This film instead of teaching people
how to respect others ,it has a destructive theme of corrupting the
youth and speaks in favor of using random drugs . Parents Beware!. It
has unnecessary violence especially against women. Feminists must
beware of this movie. Furthermore,there is no single didactic theme in
this movie except corrupting teens and instigating boys to rebel and
torture their own beloved fathers. All I know is that peaceful rebels
who want to get their rights should never ever resort to violence.
Concerning the music,it is not my type.This movie's plot is weak. I
could not find any suspense in this movie at all except boredom.
