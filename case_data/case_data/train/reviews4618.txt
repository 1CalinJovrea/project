A poorly made romcom

One would suspect that this film would offer the audience at least a
fun experience and a decent amount of humor, but That Awkward Moment
fails to deliver in every way. Not only does the film have a very
predictable storyline and clich√©d characters, it is also poorly paced
and lacks any sort of momentum. The writing is weak and provides very
few humorous moments, with the only encouraging aspect being the
performance of Miles Teller, whose comedic talent does shine through.
Overall, however, the three leading men lack any sort of chemistry,
which results in disappointing delivery and causes the characters to be
uninteresting. That Awkward Moment therefore fails to produce
characters that are relatable on a emotional level, despite that being
the film's main aim.
