One horrible movie in every aspect

This movie is so awful, that it is hard to find words to describe it. I
really can't imagine why there are so many people that are willing to
go and see in in the cinemas. This movie is not bad, because of the
idea for an affair between a rich businessman and a normal girl. It is
bad because the dialogues are flat, the characters are terrible and
without any depth, there is no actual acting in it, and for the final
the story is badly written.It is really sad, that such a badly made movies are so popular. They
destroy the idea for good movie with acting, script and everything
else. And if you expect to see at least a lot of erotic in it, you may
fell a bit disappointed at the end. The movie is far from that it
promises to its viewers.
