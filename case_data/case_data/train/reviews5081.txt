We don't see unique films like these quite often

This is one of the best films I have seen this year.I loved it ,not
because of the complexity of the story ,because this film makes you
feel the main character and the strange loneliness .The acting two main characters are superb and then there is ,the ISO .
Man,the conversation between Frank(protagonist) and the AI/ISO is just
mind-blowing. It is quite funny sometimes.The plot makes you keep guessing and guessing and it is never boring
nor slow. The story reveals from time to time and you start to love it.A must watch ,I would say .
