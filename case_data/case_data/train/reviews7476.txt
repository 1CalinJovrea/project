I liked it! Underrated

I really liked this flick! I watched it once and then again a few hours
later, someone came home and wanted to watch it and I was actually okay
with watching twice in a few hours. Solid acting, super lovable
characters, a decent but somewhat predictable story line. It's an
enjoyable film with little nuggets of intelligent humor sprinkled
between.
