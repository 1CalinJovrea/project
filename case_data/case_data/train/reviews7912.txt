Lost it's way in my opinion

Was hoping for a film more like the first half of the 1st film rather
than the 2nd, which I thought lost it's way as soon as the dream world
was introduced. This sequel is entirely made in the same vein as the
last half hour of the original. all a bit over the top with a few jumps thrown in to try and keep
horror film fans interested.I defended the first film because of the opening 45 minutes, here
there's nothing for me. Doesn't help this was released soon after some
half decent horror films like the conjuring and Sinister, This film offers more surreal and at times comedic scenes then actual
scares.
