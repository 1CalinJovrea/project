Excellent Tom Hardy

Tom Hardy first came to my notice in Inception... just for the record
my favorite film of all time and Tom Hardy was the one who made it so.If there was ever any doubt and i don't think there was that he can act
that that clears that with this film People Tom Hardy is amazing.We all saw buried right and thinking it was hard for a one man show to
really deliver then Ryan Reynolds did... then we thought it would be
too hard to do it over again....Well its been done. Tom Hardy invites you into his car and his life and
puts you in the fast Lane all the way from Brighton to London With only
him on screen and the voices in the phone, this film never lets up and
has you hanging on every word. Whatever he (tom Hardy) did and is doing
he imposes himself in your front room as your new best friend and you
are desperate for him to be OK he completely nails this. I guarantee
you will be thinking about him for weeks after this film Brilliant! btw
kudos to Andrew Scott - you really buy into this story
