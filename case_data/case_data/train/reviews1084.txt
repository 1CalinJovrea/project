A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.

Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them
receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to
change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must
be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge,
intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and
Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for
Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy
to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie
on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be
just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant
foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from
greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now
reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth.
With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it
doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive
Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up.
While investigating a "ghost" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a
message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper
learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is
looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A
recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a
whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final
and most important mission: to determine whether any of three
identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from
which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his
kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it Â– Nolan's narrative is a sprawling,
ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position
and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a
father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot
through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time
travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a
consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such
philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too
deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also
create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with
intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and
emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit,
with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the
human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to
save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne
Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the
planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for
time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the
loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the
members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes
Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail
to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the
wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final
act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what
miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept
very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film
hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that
feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying,
either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of
Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density.
Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion,
including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy
terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really
wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used
to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers
in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the
various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it
shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness
quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported
by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in,
blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion.
Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified
to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates
quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can
save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas
to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under
wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi
blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining.
In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave,
brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer
examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and
beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long
and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that
underpin its story.
