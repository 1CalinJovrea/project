over-hyped rubbish.

Two key words for this movie: boring and ridiculous. I feel like
because of the a-list casting for this movie the director felt like
they could get away with an awful a movie, and unfortunately they
probably will. I watched the film with the rest of my family, and not
one of us enjoyed it. We wanted to stop watching halfway through, to be
honest. Here are some of the main things (aside from a story told
badly) that I found wrong with the movie: 1. Yes there were loads of
actors that we all know, but the casting was still off. I thought Amy
Adams was the wrong choice for this "bad girl" role, it felt weird to
watch. Jennifer Lawrence I thought overacted. The rest of the actors
however seemed to do what they could with the ridiculous script. 2.
Some of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever had the displeasure of
watching. The point where I started out-loud laughing at the stupidity
was when the FBI agent, Richie DiMaso , bashed up his boss, Stoddard
Thorsen, and it was all fine. Oh man, that was some ridiculous stuff.
Anyway, I could go on but I can't be bothered, I'm sure this movie will
get loads of rewards and great reviews which it does not deserve, but
people are easy to give in to the hype.
