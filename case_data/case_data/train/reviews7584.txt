Superb

Superb espionage/military-drama from Kathryn Bigelow (who directed the
even more impressive The Hurt Locker). Details the search for and
elimination of Osama Bin Laden.Tight, intriguing plot. Excellent direction from Bigelow - the tension
is built, and even though you know how it ends, it stays incredibly
engrossing throughout. You hardly realise that the movie is over 2 1/2
hours long, the high level of engagement is so constant and the pace of
the movie so perfect. Great performance from Jessica Chastain in the lead role. Good support
from Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong and Jennifer Ehle. Minor
parts for Joel Edgerton and James Gandolfini.
