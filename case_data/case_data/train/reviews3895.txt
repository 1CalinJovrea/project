Bad Propaganda Flick

I've seen this movie yesterday, and since it was a long time ago I saw
a good war movie I thought this would maybe work out. Sadly, it didn't.First of all, I think it's a bad choice they went with real SEALS to
act in the movie. The objective was probably to heighten the realism,
but c'mon, you can't get more Hollywood than this flick. At no point in
the movie I got the feeling this was realistic. Every shot the SEALS
fire is spot on while terrorists are shooting all over the place. At
least show some casualties on both sides (and not only the heroic
sacrifice of the 'grenade-soldier').The lack of acting skills was very painful, as you get cliché after
cliché, and laughable (in a bad way) jokes in between to lighten things
up. The characters were as flat as can be. I can't even remember one
guy's name.The story was TERRIBLE. This may be based on real missions but at least
come up with a coherent background story, or a terrorist plot that's a
bit more sophisticated (the explosive terrorist suits, really?). On top
of that you never got the feeling the bad guys were even close to
striking. They never even got into the tunnel as our hero (who is shot
about 73 times) is still capable to gun down the last remaining bad
guy. So the threat didn't even seem imminent.I don't want to play down the job these guy do, but sorry, this was
just a bad propaganda fairy tale.
