Strictly for kids and teens

If I was 10 years younger and perhaps 10 IQ points dumber I would loved
loved this movie. This takes me back to those Nickoledian days,
particularly their famous show "Are you afraid of the dark" where a
group of kids would come together before midnight to tell scary stories
to each other and stories of monsters coming out of books were among
the most popular; so this entire movie could have fit like an extended
episode in the series.Intellectually and emotionally this is at the level of high school with
the classic high school tropes: young kid moves to a new school, falls
in love with a weird girl, geeky virgin wants to get laid so
desperately tries to be his friend, oh and there is high school prom.
Of course with the major difference that a universe of monsters from
the Goosebumps series have been accidentally unleashed on the town, and
are going to crash that prom night.Technically, a well polished movie with good monster effects work, but
which is becoming run of the mill stuff now in your typical Hollywoood
teenie pic.
