more fun than a barrel of hammers

An old idea nicely redone with top notch writing and direction.This is a breakout role for Dan Stevens who manages to commit horrible
acts while at the same time being pleasant courteous and generally the
kind of guy you'd be happy to have as your friend.In fact, this is one of those rare movies where the viewer has more fun
if you root for the bad guy (so to speak) right from the opening scene.Hard to find fault with. Even the action scenes are done with the sort
of precision you would expect from a martial arts movie.For perfectionists only -- at 1:17 in the movie, there is an outrageous
plot hole. While everyone, including the killer, is going to extremes
to keep secret the government project that started this mess, a secret
government agent agent suddenly spills the beans to a young girl for no
reason at all other than to provide backstory.Overlook that, and this is a fun flick.
