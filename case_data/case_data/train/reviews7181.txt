Worst.Film.Ever

It's hard to begin with dreadful film. I went into it with low
expectation's and was still utterly flabbergasted by how awful this
was! Knock Knock makes Batman & Robin look like Oscar worthy movie.I don't know what Keanu Reeves was thinking when he agreed to star in
this movie but after the incredible John Wick I thought he was getting
his career back on track after a run of disastrous movies but I guess
not. His performance was so terrible that the audience were laughing
out loud, laughing. I won't spoil the film for you but it's difficult to watch, I've never
seen so many people walk out of movie before, honestly.This is 99 minutes of pure hell as a viewer. It's not even in the "it's
so bad it's good" club. The film is tripe, utterly unwatchable
completely unredeemable in any sense.This film is a career killer and I suggest you stay the hell away from
it.If you want to watch an adult movie in the cinema go see Mad Max: Fury
Road. Trust me, Knock Knock is one you don't want to watch.
