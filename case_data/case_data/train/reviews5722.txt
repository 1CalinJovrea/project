Best Movie Ever!!!

Love this movie. It shows many perspective of what relationship are
like with friends, strangers, lovers, exes, etc. The real beauty of
this film is that it tells you your true strength that you don't even
know you have it. It is a beautiful movie, and not everything has to be
about intimacy or lust or showing off you skin. Sometimes you need
someone to talk to and share your feelings. This is the first time a
movie touched my heart and I am writing a review. Clean, good
storyline, delicacy, expressions, simplicity, beautiful acting and good
songs. In one word "Beautiful". Great work !!! The ending is very
beautiful and touching.
