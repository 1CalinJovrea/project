Meeehhhh....

Greetings from Lithuania."Krampus" (2015) is sometimes kinda pretty creepy, sometimes a little
scary, sometimes a little funny movie that eventually gets boring by
trying to be different and by doing that, it quickly becomes very
average. It is not a bad movie by any means, but it's just so ...
average. There is nothing in it that you would like to return for a
second viewing and nothing that you would be glued to your screen
during first viewing.Overall, "Krampus" tries to be scary and kinda original Cristmas movie,
and sometimes it succeeds, but mostly it doesn't by the end i didn't
care what will happen to one or another two dimensional character. It
is not a bad movie, but it's a quickly forgettable one.
