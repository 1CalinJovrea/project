A royal affair is simply ROYAL!!

Every now and then with a little luck, you will run across a little
know film, maybe check out some of the reviews on line, and then take a
chance and watch it. If that is the case, trust me when I say "A royal
affair" is a movie that will not disappoint. Looking at most of the
reviews on the IMDb web site, you would get the sense that this is a
good movie, but something about the era, the fact that there are sub
titles, and maybe the title might turn you off, but do yourself a huge
favor and watch this one. The story is compelling and hooks you
immediately, the acting is superb and riveting, and the drama based on
true events in Denmark in the 18th century is spell binding. This movie
has garnered nominations for best foreign language film by both The
Golden Globe and The Academy Awards, and it is richly deserving of not
only the nomination but also the award. People, there are so many bad
movies to watch, when a truly good one comes along, please make sure
you see this wonderful and moving epic.
