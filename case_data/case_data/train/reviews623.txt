Not as Funny as Despicable Me

The popularity and the huge profits of Despicable Me franchise has
driven the eagerness of Illumination Entertainment to produce a minions
spin-off solely to entertain the fans. Caught in variations of the same
scenarios, the decision to put more focus on the three minions - Kevin,
Stuart and Bob might remind audiences about Alvin and the Chipmunks or
the three daughters of Gru. While the animation does remain the fun,
hilarious and ridiculous behaviors of the characters, the theme of the
scores and the nonsensical language of the minions, it does not have a
strong villain to support the three, also it lacks of character
development, warm emotional engagement and moral values. The cuteness
of the minions is the main element for entertainment rather than the
dialogue itself in which the jokes aren't as funny as Despicable Me's
series. Nonetheless, it is still energetic, actions packed, visually
stunning and colorful for family audiences even its creative mistake
drags its overall quality, proving that these banana lovers are far
more effective and surprising to be supporting characters just as in
the main franchise.
