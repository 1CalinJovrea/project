A Joke with a Serious Crisis

In the end of 2007, the world saw one of the greatest crisis in the
United States of America, the real estate bubble that affected and
devastated the American economy. "The Big Short" is a comedy that plays with the housing mortgage fraud
of the bank and some of the players that foresaw the housing bubble and
started hedge funds to make money. The screenplay is confused for those
that are not familiar with details of the financial concepts and
investments. The cameo appearance of personalities explaining concepts
does not work well. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "A Grande Aposta" ("The Big Bet")
