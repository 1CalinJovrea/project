Another Typical Comedy where all the Good Parts are in the Trailer,

Daddy's Home is an awful movie with a very poorly developed storyline
that is all a set up for poor jokes, and an impressive comedic cast
that all just felt wasted. There are some funny parts in it, but sadly
those parts were also in the trailer, so we are left with good bits
that are no longer funny cause we've seen them all already, and a ton
of lame, immature jokes such as watching Will Ferrell get electrocuted
or a ridiculous dance off between Mark Wahlberg and Bill Burr. Ferrell
and Wahlberg really weren't the stars of this movie because any
chemistry that the two certainly have is thrown away with poor
development, as well as the fact that both of their characters are
unlikeable, it was hard to tell who we were suppose to root for,
neither of them was really an antagonist or protagonist. The only two
people who really seemed to enjoy being a part of this movie were
Thomas Haden Church and Hannibal Buress, they did have me genuinely
laughing in their scenes, and for the time they're on screen we can
forget about how poor, unfunny, poorly edited and regretful this movie
is. Lacking energy, heart and original comedy, Daddy's Home kills any
potential it has, and you would be much better off avoiding it. Brad finally gets the two children of his wife to look up to him as a
father figure, but all his effort is thrown away when their dead beat
father returns. Best Performance: Thomas Haden Church
