A juvenile film seemingly made by juveniles

It started promisingly. Then I heard an Australian accent and my heart
sank. Then I realized that this film was to be all about kids and my
heart sank further. After a few burbled inanities intoned as if they
were the deepest of profundities it hit me that I was in for a long and
boring ride if I wanted to finish this film. And I wanted to be fair,
perhaps I was judging prematurely, perhaps after all the skateboarding,
teenage angst and childish fantasy the film would deliver something
worthwhile. I thus gritted my teeth and waited.The movie is over. I'm still waiting. Avoid unless your interest is in
supporting film-making for children.
