An Aging Franchise Overstays its welcome

Pirates of the Caribbean, when it came out in the early 2000s, was one
of the most original and unique movies to be released in recent memory.
It was a great mix of comedy, adventure and action that could appeal to
the whole family. Depp's boozy Captain Jack Sparrow was part ruthless
pirate and part sly wink. You never knew which one you would get. The
first one got it all right: a great story, a ton of adventure and a lot
of fun. However, the series has dropped in quality a bit more with each
subsequent release, to the point that now I find the whole thing
boring, trite and overdone. Depp's Sparrow continues his act, but now
it's more canned and predictable. The story seems to be written as it
goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what
and why we even care. It deals with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swain's
son and that he wants to join an evil pirate group and yada yada. Some
explosions, sword fights, Sparrow drunk walking and some boats on the
water. Ho hum. The good news was at two hours, this was one of the
shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has
long overstayed its welcome.
