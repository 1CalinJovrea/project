An Excellent Original Horror Film

I was anxiously awaiting this film's release because I loved the
director's previous film, The Loved Ones, and this movie had a really
cool trailer. So I watched it last night and absolutely loved it. I
really enjoyed how it played with a lot of the common horror tropes, as
a result creating something very original and different. The set-up of
the movie has been done hundreds of times, where a family moves into a
new house after the previous occupants died. At first you think it's
going to be something like Amityville, but The Devil's Candy switches
things up by having the murderer of the previous occupants still being
alive. There are also some very interesting things where it seems like
the father, who is an artist, might also be hearing voices, and maybe
the house is haunted, or perhaps he's just catching a glimpse into the
mind of the crazed killer and/or his victims. Whatever it is, it's
inspiring him and his art in a way nothing else has. So there's a
temptation to embrace whatever's happening or fight against it.All of the acting in the film is very well done, and I loved how every
character was unique. The father and daughter have a really interesting
relationship, and they're both metal heads. The mom has a little less
characterization, but she's still definitely not generic. The killer
(that kind of looks like an evil Santa Claus) was great too; he was
definitely a creepy demented person. My only problem with the film is
that it is a pretty short movie at around 1 hour and 17 minutes. I
would have liked a couple of more scenes with the family just existing
before everything gets weird, or even more of a buildup of the evil
presence or whatever it was before the end of the movie.Still, I'd highly recommend this film, especially if you're a fan of
original horror movies. If you want to see my video review for the
