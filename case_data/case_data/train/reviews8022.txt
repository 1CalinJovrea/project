Refreshing, sensitive and intelligent!

I'm going to make it short. I'd rather not go into elaborate analyses
and proper assessment the more so because I don't want to sound
pretentious. Let me just say, that I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It is
funny, thoughtful (but not overdramatised), clever and sensitive at the
same time. Finally a film where love, a man and a woman and the
relationship between them is treated with respect, gentleness and is
elevating, and refreshing. The script is great, the acting is superb,
the dialogues, those subtle gestures, looks, smiles are all in place.
Nothing overdone just treated with natural care. What little glitches
there are in this movie simply add to its charm. Watching this film is
a great experience, it's great entertainment. I warmly recommend
watching it.
