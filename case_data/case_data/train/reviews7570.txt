Bachelorette  Parties are the Pits

A group of girlfriends go to Costa Rica for a bachelorette party. Casey
is having doubts about marrying her beau (Jared) because he immediately
wants children and she does not--PLUS, she knows she's still too much
of a party animal. While searching for what the locals call paradise,
she is bitten by something. She is about to begin her new journey..."Bite" is a decent attempt at horror that had many good things going
for it: First, the acting was better here than in most movies like
this. Yes, the writing could have been a little better. Some lines
worked; while others did not. I particularly loved when her friend
tried to tell Casey (during Casey's metamorphosis) "People go to Costa
Rica for vacations. I'm sure the doctors have seen this a million
times." I will also say that even though there is not a ton of blood in
the movie, the goo and puke factor had me cringing many times. I would
have liked to have seen what bit Casey, but I can also understand how
by not showing it that also helped build the tension.Rated "R" for graphic violence, very disturbing images, brief nudity,
and language, "Bite" certainly isn't the best movie you will ever see,
but it will be far from the worst.
