Exactly What I Wanted

Film quality was great, acting on par, and action appropriately over
the top but enjoyable. I had the awesome experience of watching this
while pulling a 24 hour duty shift for the Army. It was exactly what I
expected, and is one of the best bromance comedy-action movies of
recent years. The way that Denzel W. and Mark W. banter back in forth
is hilarious, and the action scenes are well shot out and entertaining
at perfect levels of crazy. The characters in general in this movie are
great by reaching perfect levels of what they are suppose to be in a
clich√© type film such as this one. They are annoying without being at
the lame end of the spectrum. There is also a great level of....shall
we say...bare skin to attract people in a sensual manner as well.
Overall exactly what I expected in a movie of this variety, and if you
want a great action flick, watch this one. I give this 8/10 stars and I
will be buying this on BluRay/DVD.
