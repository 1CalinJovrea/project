Entertaining, informative and original

Watched this movie at a sneak preview last night, and I enjoyed it!The assassination of Obergruppenfuhrer of the SS Reinhard Heydrich is a
story worth telling. Several movies did (in some way); Operation
Daybreak (1975), Lidice (2011) and the more recently released
Anthropoid (2016). HHhH chose a slightly different angle, in twofold.
The first part of the movie centers around Heydrich and his rise to
power. The second part focuses on his assassination, told from the
viewpoint of the Czech resistance, Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis in
particular. The first part is slow, prioritizing character development.
The second part is faster, making it a completely different (and
original!) movie.I read some negative reviews complaining about the two movies in one
structure. I understand, it feels a little unsatisfied and rushed at
times. Rosamund Pikes character as Heydrichs wife is not used to its
full potential in my opinion, and some details are left out of the
story (Kubis did not actually commit suicide but was fatally wounded
and died in the hospital, not only Gabcik but they both shot at
Heydrich in the carÂ…etc). Nevertheless, I found in highly entertaining,
informative and original. And the casting of Stephen Graham as Himmler
is beyond scary.Well worth a watch! Makes you at least want to know more about this
very interesting story when you leave the theater.One more thing, we should stop comparing present day Nazi characters in
movies with the representation of Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth in
Schindler's List. It just unfair :)
