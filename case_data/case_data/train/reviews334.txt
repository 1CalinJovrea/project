The very essence of a bad movie

It's beyond comprehension how bad this movie is. Yes, that's an
exaggeration...but this is a review so I'm allowed to exaggerate a
little bit right?I saw this at a sneak preview. During the break, when 80% of the people
had already left the theater, people started clapping their hands out
of misery...wondering why they were there.Story: three young movie makers to be crash at Reese Witherspoons
(guest)house, while they play with the big boys of Hollywood to turn
their short movie into a big one. In the meantime, they fill the void
in Reese's life in terms of sex, cooking, nannying and ICTing. And THIS is why this movie should me avoided at all costs:- Flat, one-dimensional characters - A brainfart of a story- A typical unrealistic Hollywood fantasy without any comedy- What's up with all the sitting around the table and laughing scenes? - A fat Martin Sheen in a stupid role (this one doesn't really count
but it bothered me)- How in EARTHS name does Reese pay for things? It's daddy's house, OK.
But how does she pay for all her sh*t? Going out to dinner with
friends, having a macbook, raising two kids and driving a bl**dy Volvo
XC90 T6? Without a (steady) job?? Only in Hollywood fantasyland!I wonder what the target group for this movie is. Here, in Holland, we
are way too 'down to earth' for these kind of movies (yes, that's a
flaw too). And for all of you calling this 'lighthearted' and 'sweet', shame on
you! By allowing yourself to believe that THIS is an OK movie, we as
audience set the bar sub-zero for Hollywood bag boy's.It's forgettable, utter rubbish and it hurts the eyes (to end with
exaggeration again).
