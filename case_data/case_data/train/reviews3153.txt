If I hadn't seen Rebecca Hall in any other movie I guess I wouldn't
have been amazed by the transformation or her performance in general in
this movie. You really buy her ... let's call it naive nature, she puts
on display here. Bruce Willis is pretty passive, which works in a way,
but not throughout. Joshua and Catherine are not used in the best way
possible, but the main focus is on Rebecca so that can be forgiven.Story-wise, there is not that much exciting or new happening, the jokes
are not always working, but the movie has a low budget charm to it (if
you can accept that and not look at it as a star vehicle movie with a
big budget). It's a nice little movie, that has more potential than it
shows on screen.
