Cant believe, all this hype!

This movie was done so poorly, i saw 12 people get up and walk out of
the theater last night just got mad because they spent money to see the
film, I on the other hand stayed to finish the movie because i was
hoping it would get better but to my wonders eyes what happened??? it
didn't get any better it got worse! and i say that with a capitol W.
This movie was poorly written, Directed and the story was so slow and
boring and whats up with the R-Rating? it doesn't deserve it, I've seen
PG horror movies scarier then this piece of work. Don't get me wrong, I
love the director of this film, he does wonderful work such pictures
like Saw, and Insidious and Patrick Wilson stars in this picture and
also was the father in Insidious, Part 2 by the way comes out on
September 13th(Friday the 13th) which i hope ends up being better then
this crap. but this movie wasn't all bad, the camera work was decent...
and the cast was great and knowing that its all based on a true story
gets your blood pumping. but all in all i didn't like the movie but
thats just my opinion, hopefully everyone will see this movie for what
it truly is just another B-movie horror flick. but that ends my
review.. its just a movie and thats why i gave it a 3/10 rating.
