Very enjoyable indeed!

I'm a forty-something male and I loved this movie. I didn't quite know
what to expect, saw some less than glowing reviews, but decided to
favor the more positive reviews and head to the theater. I'm glad I
did. If you like science fiction, this has it. If you like romance, this has
it. If you like excellent special effects, this has it. If you like a
good story, yes, this movie has that too. This isn't a Star-Trek style high-octane Sci-Fi action movie. It's a
solid blend of drama, romance, action, intrigue, stunning visuals,
occasional suspense, human psychology, and for me was a winning
combination.
