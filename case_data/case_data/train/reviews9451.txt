A Movie for Teens by Teens

Do yourself a favor and watch another movie. I was deceived by IMDb's
high rating. I'm giving this movie a 1-star to even out the high
ratings. It should really be about a 4 or 5.This is a scary movie about teens written by teens. The main character
gets cursed by a walking ghost when she has sex with her high school
date. The ghost begins following her no matter where she goes. If it
gets close enough to touch her, she will die, and the curse will pass
back to the previous person, her high school date. So she must have sex
to pass on the curse and save herself! Except she'll never really be
free because the curse will reverse when a victim is killed and move
back to the previous person. The curse can kill all the victims up to
and including the original person whom we know nothing about (this is
actually explained in the film but it's never explained why or how they
know this). Logically the only solution is to have lots of sex and
there's no real danger of anyone dying.What you end up with is 100minutes of fake scares with several PG13 sex
scenes and a dead mom ghost mom humping her dead son (spoiler alert:
the high school date dies)The last person passes on the curse to a hooker, whom you assume dies
because in the final scene you see the main character walking casually
down the sidewalk care free because she passed on the curse, but behind
her you can see the ghost walking.
