Real and genuine - a cut above the rest

This is a well balanced romantic drama. The movie has a good balance
between family tragedy of a horrific car accident and teen romance of
young love. Also the theme of music is well shared between classical
cello and Pacific Northwest rock band. The romance is a convincing tale
- not too passionate for their age but with the real problems of
differing paths and East Coast (Juillard) vs West Coast (rock band).
This is a problem that face many couples and it's good to see proper
issues as the problem instead of trumped up melodrama. The story felt
more real than "The Fault in Our Stars" and less sentimental too. In
fact although the tale is a sad one, it's the best of the recent teen
based romance movies far better than "The Giver".Chloe Grace Moretz proves she can do anything from horror (Carrie) to
action (Kick Ass) to moving romantic drama. Her face is sensitive and
expressive. Even though she is very pretty she is such a good actress
she can still pull off the shy musical prodigy without being fake. Her
love interest is played by Jamie Blackley who does a good job without
overacting. He isn't too good looking so it's a believable romance. The
ex rocker type parents seem like they couldn't have had such a
beautiful daughter but never mind. Stacy Keach is surprisingly
effective as her grandfather.Well done - moving, involving, rings true.
