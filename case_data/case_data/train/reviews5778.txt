WASTED time. A LOT of wasted time."Cold war style propaganda", that I
thought was supposed to end decades ago. Overrated "movie" by overrated
director. There was absolutely nothing of the story I could catch in
first hour, maybe hour and half, if not the whole two! I don't really
understand why this was created. Maybe if the main actress was Dennis
Rodman. Maybe if there was Chuck Norris in the SEAL team. Maybe if
there was at least 1/5 of the facts accurate (and Im talking about
facts that are just known about this manhunt). Maybe if there was a
team of transformers or comic cartoon heroes supporting this action.
Maybe if somewhere in Pakistan, Charlie Chaplin fell into sewer because
of some banana . Then maybe it would have 2 stars from me.
