Guy Ritchie's snooze fest.

Wow! Did not expect this.This was one of the most boring spy movies I ever seen.The action is so slow it seems outdated for modern cinema.However the
rating here suggests I missed something or masses of people actually
like this numbed down piece of nothingness.Well,not nothing,it had nice set pieces but that's not enough to make a
good movie.The actors had no real chemistry and the story was to dull and a lot of
scenes felt really forced trying to be funny by playing the obvious
east against west card.Besides that a lot of "interesting" things happen off camera which
reduces the action even more so you start thinking ,who did they make
this movie for?. Teens that like 60's spy series?or adults that like
teen rated movies?There once was a Guy that made "lock stock"and"snatch", can't we have
that Guy back.The trailer for his next flick better be of that level cos in the
future i'm really gonna pass on these kids flicks.Compared to Bond or Bourne and even Hunt this really falls flat and
adds nothing more to the genre than what somebody else hasn't done
before this was released.I hope the next "Guy" is better.
