Not much

This movie was pretty awful on so many levels. First, Diesel seems to
sleep walk through his lines and scenes. The slight tilt of the head
and cute smirk got old after the first 5 minutes. Donnie Yen's fight
scenes were really good, and that's about the best this film brings.
The writing was atrocious. The snarky, too-cute and clich√© lines at
every turn. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or reading the
one-liner comebacks from a comedy show. It's too bad because this movie
had a good cast. Toni Colette needs to stick to heavier roles; she
looked out of place in this role. And more Samuel Jackson. I've been
hoping for better films to come out of the new China-owned studios, but
so many have disappointed lately. Maybe Jet Li could have saved this
film, I'm not sure.
