Unwatchable

No spoilers here, because I had to turn it off after about 25 minutes.
That was literally as much waiting to see anything remotely funny or
interesting as I could stand. And which makes me sad since I've liked,
and even loved, other Adam Sandler films. When given a decent script
with true humor and character development, he's displayed enough goofy
charm and heart to overcome far-fetched situations, over-the-top,
cartoonish, secondary characters, and a propensity for bad accents.
This script wasn't even close to decent. The premise was totally
unfunny at best, and probably takes the cake for sadness and sickness.
Crudity substituted for freshness and humor, and not only were all the
secondary characters cartoonish and undeveloped, but so were most of
the leads. Sandler's character was totally devoid of charm, and his
accent may have been the worst ever. Since his company produced it, he
has no one to blame for a pathetic, crude, boring script but himself.
And his choice begs the question: what was he thinking?
