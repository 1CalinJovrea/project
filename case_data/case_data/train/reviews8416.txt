Give it a Swerve

Wow, I don't know how I can even have given it 2 points - everything
about this movie sucks; it's badly written, bad acting, totally unfunny
and a bunch of characters I couldn't care less about. It's absolute
rubbish, totally predictable and you've seen it a million times before
- you have been warned, watch at your own peril!
