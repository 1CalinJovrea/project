1.5 hours of watching a guy drive and curse

This movie gets grating after a while. Basically the entirety of the
movie takes place with the lead actor behind the wheel, dashing from
place to place while visibly upset and making liberal use of foul
language. After about 1/2 of that (if not sooner) it starts to get old
and I just wanted it to be over.
