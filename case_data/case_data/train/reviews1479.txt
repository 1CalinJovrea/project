REVIEW - GOODBYE CHRISTOPHER ROBIN Honestly didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film. As
its based (loosely) around the creation of the Winnie The Poo stories I
thought it was going to be a children's film but.......The film itself is actually and surprising very good, touching on the
family dynamic of the upper classes during the 1930s to 1940s.Very stand offish parents who seem to care about their social standing
rather than their son (Christopher Robin) and how this impacts on all
of their lives. Looking at how one person can force the hand of another, in this case
forcing father and son to actually spend time together and bond. Lessons can be learnt from this film, no matter how much you work, your
children want you.Thoroughly enjoyable film on many levels. Rating 10 out of 10
