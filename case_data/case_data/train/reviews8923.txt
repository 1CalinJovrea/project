Predictable rubbish

I like a good 'underdog triumphs over adversity' movie but we have been
here before with Denzil (Man On Fire!) who I previously much respected
for his earlier works. If you have seen any film in the genre you have
already seen this which offers nothing original. Seems like Denzil had
a spare couple of months and million (also producer credit) and thought
his name could carry this predictable rehash of Edward Woodward's
original, much more believable brand. As expected, DW is a great actor
but he should be ashamed of this carbon copy as should those who voted
to bring this to an IMDb 7. I am losing faith in this scoring. I know
people liked this but I guess expectations are currently low.
