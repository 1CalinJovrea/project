Being unable to appreciate a movie like this says more about their intellect then it says about the movie

This movie might not go hand in hand with everyone's perception of what
a good movie should be like, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.
People that want to hear mellow background music and standard Hollywood
family issues taken care of in a standard Hollywood fashion, yes, they
will be disappointed. Being unable to appreciate a movie like this says
more about their intellect then it says about the movie. It's a
brilliant movie with brilliant dialogues in the life of a brilliant and
somewhat cocky man. 9/10!
