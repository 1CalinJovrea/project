Once Bitten...

Allow me to say that I enjoyed this film right from the start - pretty
girls, lots of fun in the sun, swimming in infested waters, extremely
bad decisions by characters...it has it all! We know the story - girls
go to Costa Rica, one is bitten by something, she comes home and
changes into a nasty beasty. The make-up is great, the production
design not bad and the acting better than most films in this genre. I
only have two questions for the writers - Why does the fianc√© not once
question the disappearance of his mother whom he is meant to be so
close to...and why would anyone even step over the threshold of that
apartment when they see all those clingy cobweb things and the
glistening eggs (that look like bubble bath capsules btw!), let alone
go into the apartment and walk deeper and deeper into the dreadful
stench and oozing slime? Apart from the above, this film isn't too bad
and can hold its own in the B-grade body-horror film market.
