A very unexpected and entertaining movie.

Genreally, I like zombie movies a lot because of their post-
apocalyptic vibe.Normally though, I find the genre comes in 2 distinct flavours; serious
stuff like "28 Days/Weeks Later" or campy B flavoured offerings like
"The Scouts Guide To The Apocalypse".This movie however defies the genre. The closest comparisons I could
make would be "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" or "Penny Dreadful" but
with more humour. It follows the story of Pride and Prejudice so
closely I kept looking for Keira Knightly to appear.The production quality however is what surprised me the most; it's
incredibly high with great sets, realistic costumes, lighting and
cinematography. There was a lot of attention to detail.This is a very unique and interesting mash-up which I quite enjoyed. I
am surprised it's not rated higher on IMDb but I believe it deserves a
watch regardless.
