Ribald, funny, merciless fun at the expense of politicians and politics

A very, very funny movie that's very, very coarse. If you are not
amused by jokes about sex, body parts and bodily functions, effeminate
men, scantily-clad women, politics, and politicians then this isn't
your movie. If you like that sort of thing, then you need to see this
movie now. Light, fluffy entertainment. No thinking required (or
desired). Good guys win. Bad guys either lose or are redeemed. I run
hot and cold on Will Farrel movies. This one's a keeper for him but the
real star of this movie is Zach Galifianakis who seems to replicate
Jack Black's character in "Bernie" but with a completely different
take. This movie will make you feel better about what's coming to
American politics in the next three months.
