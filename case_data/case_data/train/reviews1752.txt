Liam does what he can with a bad script

I know movies aren't real - they're make believe. But can't we inject 

just a little realism in here for a second.



I loved Taken. It was a fun thrill ride with realistic characters and 

plot lines. I walked away with a good feeling. 



Taken 2 was a different story. I just walked away.



Let's pretend that September 11th never happened and you can fly into 

any airport in the world carrying a case willed with guns and 

explosives no questions asked.



Let's pretend that wealthy Arabs in Turkey have to hire retired 

Americans for security because there is no one local who can fill this 

purpose.



Let's pretend that a teenage girl who had the living sh** scare out of 

her in the first movie and can't be relied upon to even answer her phone is going to be cool-headed and responsible enough to 

fight terrorist and rescue her parents.



Let's pretend that said teenage girl can throw a hand grenade all the 

way across a street and onto a parking structure blowing up the only 

car that's parked there because the explosion from the grenade alone 

wouldn't be heard 4.5 kilometers away.



Let's pretend that hotel security investigating a shooting inside the 

hotel won't react to a grenade blowing up a car right across the 

street. 



That was about the point where I walked out. But hey, if none of this 

sounds implausible to you then go see the movie.
