Good exercise for your cheeks

First of all, big complements to the protagonists. The chemistry
between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their
on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need
to prepare yourself for something amusing. The jokes are fast paced and
relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is
actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid
due to some absurdity.22 Jump Street is self-aware of what it is, and pokes fun of itself for
being a sequel that follows the formula. However, addressing this fault
in that comedic way will not be enough for everyone to forgive it. At
the other hand, I think this is something that you can easily look past
because of how enjoyable the movie is. The requirement of a comedy is
to make you laugh, and 22 Jump Street fulfills it totally. Your cheeks
will definitely have a good exercise! ;)
