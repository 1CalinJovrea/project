This Was actually pretty damn good

As a fan of the book and the original 1976 film my expectations for
this were mixed. But just yesterday I saw this with two friends and
loved every minute of it. It is very faithful to the original source
material with a few modern takes on the story. There was also a bit
more blood . Chloe grace moretz is not my first choice to play carrie
but from what I saw she did very well. You feel for her and feel the
pain she's going Through and understand why she does what she does in
the end. Julianne Moore did especially well as the crazy religious
bitch mother. The original was a little silly and over the top but
Moore plays it so well it feels like I'm watching it for the first
time. The prom scene is straight up awesome and has some very intense
death scenes . Overall the film is very good And I highly recommend it.
