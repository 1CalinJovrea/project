Based on Saramago's book? Come on! Really??

I was looking forward to watching this movie once I knew it was based
on a book by Jos√© Saramago. I read the book a few years ago and when I
finished reading it I thought it would make a great movie. How
disappointed! Saramago probably rolled over in his grave! The only
thing that reminds the book is the duplicated man - that's all! Nothing
else resembles the complexity and intensity of the book. I liked the leading actor though. He was really good. What was that with a stupid spider?? What about that Antony's "second
hidden life"?? I had the feeling they wanted the viewers to think that
they were actually the same person. Is that it? Was Antony supposed to
be Adam's alter-ego?? That has absolutely nothing to do with Saramago's
book. If you, like me, want to watch this movie because you loved the book,
just don't. You will probably be disappointed.
