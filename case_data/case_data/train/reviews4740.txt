If George Lucas and Tolkien Had Written The Bible...

This may well be the worst film I've ever seen at a cinema. It will
sweep the board when it comes to the Razzies, I have no doubt about
that. Russell Crowe and Emma Watson are slightly above average but the
rest of the cast may as well have been washed away in the flood. Even
Anthony Hopkins's cameo as Obiwan Methuselah (use the seed, Noah) can't
rescue this piece of celluloid crap. Some of the special effects are so
bad I found myself rolling my eyes and the animal shots at the end must
have been nicked from a Walt Disney documentary from the 60s or 70s, so
poor was the quality. The eco-warrior message of this movie overwhelms
all else. Yes, we get it, we're all bad people for driving cars and
owning gadgets. The cast and crew could've done their bit for the
environment by not making this tosh. In hindsight, perhaps they wish
they had.
