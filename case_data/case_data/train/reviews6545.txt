Best of all xmen movies

simply said it was well directed and well acted with good pacing,great
cgi effects and epic soundtrack. what more can you expect from a
superhero movie? X-Men might be my favorite superhero movie (except
wolverine spin off), and DOFP might be the best of them. It's an all
star movie with a good director (everything not related to
professionalism is irrelevant), in paper it's guaranteed to be at least
a decent movie,and boy, they didn't disappoint me at all, really
surpassed my expectation.I am absorbed, nothing else matter except the scenes in front of me.It
already had my attention since the overview of the future narrated by
professor X. The story has a good pacing,not to slow but not to fast. I
didn't notice any plot holes, and there's nothing in the script that
annoyed me. Bryan Singer could handle the dramatic and epic scenes very
well. the dramatic scenes makes me teared up a little,the epic scenes
put me on the edge of my seat. And he sew the humor seamlessly, it was
appropriate and subtle,just what I like.They said that DOFP lack of any definitive villains, but any movie
doesn't need definitive villains to be good. X-Men movies is always
about fighting the enemy inside every humans and mutants, it's always
about self struggle, defeating the darkness inside of you.4/5 (cause nothing's perfect)
