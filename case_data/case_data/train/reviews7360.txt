Popular to hate Sandler these days.

Seems every movie Sandler does these days gets hated on. People saying
this is the worst movie ever made in history...really? You people must
not have seen many movies. Regardless of what Sandler does the rest of
his career its now popular to point out how it sucks and not as funny
as his old movies. I enjoyed this movie, laughing out loud several
times. Sandler does a great job playing the father. The bachelor party
scenes are epic, really feel for the characters. Uncle Vanny?
Hilarious. At no point in this movie did I think "oh man this is the
worst thing I've seen in my life." Had good feeling, good comedy, a
solid entry to Sandlers recent works. Much much better than the one
where he played his sister.
