9
Well-acted, dark and disturbing, fantastic!!!

Just wanted to give my two cents on a great movie that is not getting a
lot of recognition. I went to the movie because I wanted to see James
McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe in a movie together. Not really because I
like the story Frankenstein. I was pleasantly surprised by an
interesting, intense, and very believable film. The cinematography was
dark, sort of like the Moulin Rouge movie. It was just really good from
start to finish. Clean acting and engrossing story. The scenes where
they are bringing dead things back to life can be very graphic and
disturbing at times. I thought this would have been a better release
around Halloween with an R rating. But overall awesome movie. I liked
it better than Bond, Mocking jay (both good), and the Good Dinosaur
(not that good). I reflected on the movie long after I left the
theater, which to me, means I saw a movie that got me thinking! Only
reason I gave it a 9 is, well, a 10 is a tough score to get!
