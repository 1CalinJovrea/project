Alejandro is the Real Deal

This movie really touch my soul in very different ways, I was laughing
and crying at the same time when I was watching it. Alejandro's clean
smooth directing really states a new canon in the way a movie is
conducted, I was blown away with Michael Keaton's perfect performance
and the rest of the cast did well around him. I had never seen this
kind of genre called "Magical realism" as well as in this movie, it
really submerge you inside the head of the main character and the
brilliant drum-based score helps to explain the situation by the
minute. I am very happy with the Oscars won by Alejandro (well
deserved) especially because I am Mexican too. I know that this kind of
movie is not for everyone, some people said that it is boring,
pretentious, over-the- top, strange, difficult to understand, hideous.
But let me tell you this movie is fascinating, touching, funny, sad,
eloquent, fantastic and dramatic. I liked very much how it makes fun of
big-budget summer-blockbusters hero-movies which easily Alejandro will
have done if he had wanted but no, he preferred an artistic low budget
movie that make you feel instead of make you eat popcorn.
