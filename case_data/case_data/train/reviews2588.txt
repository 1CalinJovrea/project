What a waste of time to watch something so unreal!

Unbelievable bad movie!I mean come on, i watched Titanic, and the same guy dies of Hypotermia
in 5 minutes of cold water!!!***spoiler*** Now he not only sleeps on the snow while totally ruined
and left to death after a bear attack, he crawls for miles, take swims
in a river with snow and ice around, get outside, sleeps a bit more
then make a fire from a spark, on the snow, then kill some, then fall
off the cliff with a horse and then he shows that he knows how Han Solo
saved Luke on planet Hoth from dying.It could be such a good movie if bear killed him at the start. Or at
least i wouldn't have wasted so much time watching it...
