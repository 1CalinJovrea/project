Enjoyable!

This movie might be considered a B-movie because of the budget and
released straight to DVD, but honestly, it's a really good movie.
Antonio Banderas is underrated, and should really be given the chance
to go back to mainstream, especially action films.The movie isn't perfect, and characters could've been fleshed out more
but other than that, this is a nice movie to watch on a lazy afternoon
on your day off.The action sequences are great. Ben Kingsley, another underrated actor,
was also great.It's a well-done action movie with a simple story. If you want to be
entertained for an hour and 45mins, this is not a bad choice.
