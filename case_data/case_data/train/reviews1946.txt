Expected it to be garbage. Did not disappoint.

I had very low expectations going into this film. The trailer made it
look like a very typical action film that would possibly have a plot
twist in it to keep us interested. Typical it was. Plot twist? Nope. I
was bored the entire time.The plot is straight forward. A super intelligent former marine, war
hero, who recovered from a wound he acquired saving his fellow marines,
becomes an analyst for the CIA. He stumbles upon a terrorist plot
straight out of the Cold War, and then gets thrown into the mix,
becomes a field agent overnight, and saves America.At no point are you trying to figure out what is going on? Who is the
villain? Who is behind the plot? What is the plot? The answers to these
questions are all handed to us on a silver platter. I was left with other questions, addressing the gaping plot holes. Why
did the King of Qarth try killing Jack Ryan? How did the bad guys
already know he was after them? Why didn't they send more people when
he didn't return? How did the FBI already know about a sleeper agent?
Why wasn't the plot uncovered earlier if Chris Pine, Kiera Knightly and
Kevin Costner can piece it together in 5 minutes on a plane? Why didn't
the Sleeper agent stab Chris Pine when he had the chance...twice? I am glad I didn't have to pay to see this. Don't waste your money. It
isn't even worthy of a casual viewing because you are bored and don't
want to think. Watch S.W.A.T. instead.
