Funny and emotional!

Review: I must be becoming soppy in my old age, because I really
enjoyed this heartwarming tale about a guy who is down on his luck, but
he has an amazing talent to sing opera and he follows his dreams by
becoming a success. The characters were well chosen by the director and
the storyline is written very well. You grow to like the main character
and you feel for his amazing trail of bad luck throughout his life. The
love story is really sweet, and his parents support was witty and
emotional. To be honest, I wasn't expecting that much from this film,
but I really enjoyed the mixture of emotions. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It's amazing to see how far James Corden has come from his
early years in Gavin & Stacey to winning many awards and now starring
in a very well made movie. Everyone can't help but like the guy which
is why we see him on the TV quite a lot nowadays. Julie Walters is
getting better with age, along with Colm Meaney who seems to be popping
up in loads of movies nowadays. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth
a watch if you into witty, emotional dramas.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $7.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there witty biopics about
an opera singers journey to fame. 6/10
