Muddled, boring and lacking tension. (possible spoilers)

I saw this at a midnight preview and I was really looking forward to
it. I'm a big fan of Alien, but I was really disappointed; this is a
bloated mess.In Alien, the creature presented an abstract threat to earth but the
plot centered on the immediate, physical threat to the crew. In
Prometheus, the threat is purely abstract and while SOME bad stuff
happens to the characters, they are all unsympathetic so it is
difficult to care. Characters are established with simplistic dialog;
this is the cool black guy, this is the incautious explorer, this is
the obnoxious mercenary cyberpunk (who, for no reason, is also a
scientist), this is the uptight corporate type.The scientists don't behave like scientists, they don't talk like
scientists. The nerdy biologist (who has to walk off to be monster
fodder later), walks away from an alien corpse because it's not his
field of interest. Huh? Archeologists suddenly turn into medical
experts and people exploring an alien ecosystem for the first time
remove helmets without regard for contamination of the environment or
themselves. Often, the only justification for character actions seems
to be to set up later plot points.Alien worked because it focused on believable characters stuck in a
terrible situation, without that believability the film would be
greatly lessened. Prometheus, lacking that, is uninteresting.Prometheus puts me in mind of Avatar. The use of 3D is excellent and
the art direction is amazing. However, as with Avatar, technical
excellence cannot make up for a terrible plot, sub-standard
characterisation and meaningless dialogue.
