Truly the most wonderful movie I have ever seen

I am 24 year old fairly macho male,but I love animated movies. Me and
my wife went and saw this movie on date night and hands down best
Christmas movie of all times. It was full of wonderment,amazement and
magic.I teared up at least 4 different times during the movie. It made
me feel like a kid again it made me believe. I found myself gasping and
laughing at the same parts as the the 3 year old little girl sitting 3
seats away was and any movie that can do that is worth seeing. best
holiday movie of all times.I am the wife :) and I found the movie to be equally moving and evoked
emotions about the holidays and that I hadn't felt since I was a child.
This may seem like a simple children's movie, but it is so much more
than that if you really allow yourself to feel the characters. :) I
hope you and your family enjoy the movie as much as we did!
