Let this Ship Sink

I can't believe this movie missed on so many levels. Forget about being
a true adaptation to the account in Genesis, but even being a viable
film sustaining itself and just being decent. There are so many missed
opportunities, wrong roads traveled, plot holes, weird plot devices,
etc. Arnofsky is a strange guy. If you've seen "Black Swan", or "The
Fountain" you know he is no stranger to trippy adventures with his own
style and dynamic. I personally am not a fan of this style. At one
point he was attached to "The Wolverine" sequel, and luckily he didn't
stay attached because I feel that would have been a blow Marvel may not
have recovered from unless they maintained enough production control.
The producers kept their hands in this movie as well which is why you
can at least recognize the story and maybe they are to blame for the
lameness or weird decisions. Crowe salvaged this for me from being a
complete and utter disaster. The end result is justÂ…pathetic.
