mesmerizing visuals with thriller

The second film from designer turned directory Tom Ford was not just a
visual masterpiece but had great narrative. The plot of the movie which
is three narratives combined into one and tells the story of Susan
Morrow (Amy Adams) an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript of
her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) thriller novel dedicated to her. The
way that the story was told was bold, strange and very unique to me.
Even though a movie with three narratives might sound clumsy but it
wasn't, the stories of different time lines did not overlap each other
rather it made the story complete with showing different aspects of the
characters.Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as Ray Marcus was definitely my
favorite, he was so creep and repulsive to watch. The brilliant Michael
Shannon was also in this movie as Bobby Andes with great Oscar worthy
performance. Overall, I loved this movie for it's visual look and
appeal of it's leading characters. While I was watching the movie I
liked Tom Ford's directing style, storytelling, cinematography and
after watching it I started to think about it while connecting the dots
between the different narratives and it easily became my favorite movie
to think about. If you really like movies that makes you think and
eventually re-watch them over again then this movie is for you.
