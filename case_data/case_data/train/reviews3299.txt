Terrible.. Extremely terrible

I've read some of the reviews that people have left on this movie and
it's clear that they have no idea what they're talking about,
especially the point where they mistake the main villains name but I
digress.At the start it's believable that it shall be a good movie, the action
the jokes, even the death scenes all pretty good... at firstSilver Lion was the ultimate bad guy IMO. Betrayed his Leader and even
tried killing the kid so that he can't take revengeBut the issue?the movie doesn't know who they want the focus to be onAt first they introduce Jack Knife but it was obvious he was just a
background characters. I can't explain it but you'd know if you seen itAfter that they introduce Gold Lions son, Xblade who seems like he's
the main focus of the story seeing as how he's going for revenge but he
gets knocked out 10 minutes after his introduction and is out for most
the rest of the movieand then they start focusing on the blacksmith... the narrator.. they
could have really done without that. Would you really care if a
background character suddenly start getting all the focus? I mean all
of a sudden he gets his arms chopped off he gets a back story and
flashback too? and they really had to chop off his hands? i mean he
makes their weapons.. and he chopped off his hands of all thingsThe ONLY constant thing that was easy to understand about it was the
fact that they were going after the gold..please for gods sake do not go see this movie
