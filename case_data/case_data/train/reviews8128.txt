Cringeworthy

I am so angry that I wasted my time watch this crappy movie.The storyline was completely unoriginal and devoid of real humor and
intelligence.The jokes were tired and pointless and we have heard it all before,
many times. The script was flimsy, and full of holes. The initial
reason why Vera left Mikey rang hollow. Surely if you had a problem
with your partners spontaneity, you would just tell them instead of
requesting a divorce. And suddenly, after one act of spontaneous love
making, they are on the road to recovery. I mean, how ridiculous is
that. Just one of many, many examples of this foolish story.The acting was the pits; Zac Efron is just not a good enough actor to
be leading man material. The rest didn't impress me much either. There
was complete lack of charisma and absolutely zero chemistry between any
of the couples. Not funny, not fun and not interesting in the
slightest!
