Two of Hardy's best performances in a movie with not much else going for it.

Legend is a gripping movie, there's no doubt about it. Seeing Tom Hardy
on screen, whether he's playing Reggie, Ronald, or both, is absolutely
captivating. He owns the roles, and despite their identical looks you
feel that they're completely different people because of how well Hardy
portrays them. Reggie is sophisticated, methodical, affable; Ronnie is
impulsive, unpredictable, paranoid. As a vehicle for Tom Hardy's acting
chops, Legend is a home run. Unfortunately, that is where the positives
of the movie end.The movie is tonally confused from scene to scene. It can be romantic
one minute, ultra-violent the next, then reserved and introspective the
minute after that. It's clunky writing; every time the movie begins to
gain momentum it trips on itself one way or another. Also, you really
don't care about any character other than the twins. I mean, thankfully
they're in just about every scene, but they're always surrounded by
faceless goons, or with a generic love interest, or no-name cops - not
fully fleshed out characters. This is in no way a fault of the actors
though. Christopher Eccleston is wasted yet again as a villain after
Thor: The Dark World. Here he's in an antihero role as the cop assigned
to the Kray's case, but his lines lack any form of personality. He does
what he can but he really has nothing to work with. Chazz Palminteri
makes an appearance for about 5 minutes total as his usual gangster
self, but in the end you're left scratching your head. So many
characters, so much potential, but the only thing holding the movie
together is Tom Hardy.So as you can infer, Legend is worth a watch if you're a Tom Hardy fan.
He's scarily good in these roles, and two Tom Hardys are better than
one. For that reason alone I can't give this movie a lower score.
However, if you're looking for substance in a gangster biopic, you'll
have to look elsewhere.
