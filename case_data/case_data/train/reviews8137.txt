'He's a good person. He wanted me before I was smart.'

Screenwriter Tom Flynn offers a well-considered and genuinely moving
story about how we deal with gifted children  and adults. GIFTED is
also about family connections and the impact on children whose parents
are lost to them by separation whether in death by natural causes, by
suicide, or by desertion. Marc Webb who has gathered an impeccable cast
to enact this touching drama directs his sensitive story with aplomb.Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is a single man raising a child prodigy - his
spirited young niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in a coastal town in Florida.
Frank's plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the
seven-year-old's mathematical abilities come to the attention of
Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her
granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer
plays Roberta, Frank and Mary's landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate
is Mary's teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student
develops into a connection with her uncle as well. The story explores
the relationship between a caring uncle who salvaged his niece when the
mother of the girl (a brilliant mathematician) commits suicide 
yearning to offer the brilliant gifted niece a 'normal life' despite
custody battles and grandmother opinions.Chris Evans continues to prove that he is one of our more important
serious actors of the day and eleven year old Mckenna Grace
demonstrates why she is on of the most frequently seen young actresses
in the young role parts. Octavia Spencer and Lindsay Duncan offer
definitive performances in tough roles. This is a film with many levels
of message and one that should be seen by a very wide audience.
