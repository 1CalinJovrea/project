Too much badly done propaganda

If this was cut to around 50 minutes and consisted of just action
sequences, I'd give it a 10. In that department it actually beats most
recent action movies.Problem is, the other 60 minutes is nothing but treating viewer like
he/she is an imbecile with endless propaganda.There are scenes where SEAL's do not shoot women. If that were true in
reality, SEAL's would all have died due to their stupidity. When elite
combat force attacks enemy encampment in middle of the night they shoot
everything. Women, children, dogs, cats, everything. If it moves, it
dies. In this movie, these guys are all white knights full of self
sacrifice. What a bunch of bs.If you watch this movie objectively, without taking sides (which is
hard as suicide bombers are full retards), it pops out that SEAL's as
portrayed in this movie are as fanatical as what they are fighting.I can totally see idiots joining US Army/Navy after watching this crap.
If any of those are reading this, don't be stupid, real military is far
from entertaining, just visit any vet hospital and talk to those
people.
