Please, just make the voice-over stop

There are many bad things about this movie, but let's list the good
things first. The plot makes sense, kind of. It's nicely shot, and the
beach looked pretty. And... I guess John Travolta looked as though he
was having fun? Which is more than I could say for the poor buggers who
had to sit through this mess.Your two leads, ladies and gentlemen, are Aaron Johnson, last seen
being upstaged by a preteen girl, and Taylor Kitsch, who Hollywood
keeps casting as the lead in blockbusters which then tank spectacularly
at the box office. You know why that is, Hollywood? It's because Taylor
Kitsch has no charisma. None. The furniture was more interesting than
he was, and had more emotional range. Even he's better than Johnson, a
black hole of tedium from which nothing interesting can escape. These
are two of the blandest leads I've ever seen, and I've seen movies that
starred rappers.But dear God in heaven, they are much, much better than Blake Lively. I
haven't seen much else of her acting, so I can only think she can do
much better than this. But here she's playing a 30-year-old ing√©nue, a
woman-child who knows Shakespeare but doesn't know what 'savages'
means. She's meant to be sexy and alluring, but she comes across as so
boundlessly stupid that no man could seriously find her attractive. I
don't think that's her fault, but the no-nudity clause that made the
sex scenes in this movie so absurd? Yeah, that was her fault.Even that isn't the worst. There's still... that voice-over. The
narration that infests this whole movie, but especially the early
scenes, is some of the worst writing I've ever heard. 'I had orgasms,
he had wargasms' is a phrase that will live with me until I die. And
now, even if you haven't seen the movie, it'll haunt your nightmares,
too. You're welcome.
