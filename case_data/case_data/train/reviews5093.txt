Here's a thought......

Here's a thought. If you're going to create a movie from a well known
book perhaps you should read the book first. Doesn't that seem like a
good idea? It is a pretty good book after all. Just like the movie Noah
this movie pretends to be something that it isn't. Trying to cash in on
what seems like "the year of the Bible movie" and yet not much biblical
truth to be found in this movie. The people, the relationships and even
God are portrayed as quite different from what is told in the Bible.
The effects are impressive. You can't deny Hollywood is great at
special effect. But they take the people of the Bible and twist the
story and meaning. It's not a Biblical movie.
