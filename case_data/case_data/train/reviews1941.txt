OK But Far From Great

I went into this movie with an open mind to a Star Wars story as
distinct from the Star Wars series of movies. I left feeling
disappointed.. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of very good things in this movie
but the script was very, very ordinary. Endless dialogue that was quiet
frankly boring and pointless at times. Being a huge SW fan most of my
life, i really wanted to love another SW movie but not this one. I can
see why they reshot scenes and were worried about this film.Pros: Last 40 mins of film was great - awesome battle; Good special
effects; Likable main characters; Great new vehicles - i can see the
toys coming; Lots of nods and references for die hard fans.Cons: Incoherent and boring script; Numerous mentions of "the force"
but with no heart to them; Planets/worlds could have been developed
with more imagination; Stormtroopers are killed so easily in this film-
just have to look at them; Too long. More editing required to move it
along faster; Some characters were pointless or not developed properly.I am feeling very nervous about Star Wars VIII now!
