Suitable Change for Banderas

One wouldn't imagine that Banderas would take a role like this but he
pulls it off.Combat skills are convincing enough and the story line is
predictable but entertaining.The budget is not huge given that entire
film was shot in one location but the videography was nicely done.I
would have preferred a different ending altogether but the film was
enjoyable and worth the time.
