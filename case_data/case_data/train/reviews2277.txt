Really a pleasant surprise - delightfully not full of cheese!

I was expecting a cheesy film. I am not into musicals so was hesitant
to commit to this film, in a theatre. But, I was pleasantly surprised.
I find some of Ruffalos work, like Now you see me, to be hard to sit
through. I did not dislike that film, but I hated his performance. Part
of it was how vapid the character was. In this film it is the opposite.
He is charming, roguish, creative, and delightful to watch. Quite
frankly I did not think Knightly was up to this either. Was I ever
surprised. She was great. Well written, well directed, and very good
overall. In these days of Hollywood losing its edge, and producing more
and more low quality, derivative work, it is refreshing to see a film
like this one. And I did not even need to use my earplugs. Transformer
this film was not. Thankfully.
