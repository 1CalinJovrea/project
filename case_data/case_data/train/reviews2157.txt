Anti-White Trash

"Kill White guys and get paid for it? What's not to like" So says the
main character at one stage in this farce of a movie. This racist
(against Whites) attitude is so all-pervasive and in your face
throughout Django that you would have to be blind and deaf not to
notice it. Apparently the premise is White people are awful and
horrible and deserve to be shot (multiple times, with as much gory
detail as possible) - all except the token good White guy who of course
dies for his black friends in the end. Basically the entire movie is
just this one black guy going on a rampage and killing dozens and
dozens of "evil" Whites, and not much else. Booooring. ALso, the "N"
word is tossed around like confetti throughout this overlong,
underedited exhibition. It's almost as though Tarantino is trying to
shock us, with the amount of violence, the amount of racism, the amount
of needless gore. In the end I was just rolling my eyes and trying not
to let my thoughts wander. If you are extremely self-hating, and enjoy
watching a Black guy revel in killing Whites (including a woman), then
you might just like this film (obviously a high number of people given
the good score). As for me, I think I'll pass.
