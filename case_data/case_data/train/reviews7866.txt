Diffusive

The real-life link: the obvious-even the best friends can not take care
of you forever because they too have their own lives. It makes you
think how unless you have a partner that cares for you, no one else
that is not family will never become family. People get shown this
often that sparkly why people rush into relationships as long as it is
a relationship. But is that true? Is it true that when your family is
gone, unless you have a girlfriend/boyfriends wife/husband no one will
ever become your family? Plausibility: poor. When you loose your family, two friends showing by
your door will not make you totally forget what happened. This movies
seems to believe that they do. Character development: we do see growth. We see Ethan realising that he
needs to accept change and its fears in order to be able to grow. We
see him and the others realising that things will inevitably change and
that change needs to be accepted. Diana is a character I liked. She
knew that Ethan proposing to her was on pure intentions, he just wanted
to escape the fear of abandonment, she knew that he still had not
reflected on what was the actual reason why she did not want to be with
him. She knew she wanted commitment and hope for a future, family. She
realised that she won't get that from Ethan until he accepted that
change was necessary and that he wanted that change. She did not get
back with him until he understood that. That is a strong character. Storytelling: poor. The story moves slow and as much as the nutcracker
party tries to steer the movie in one direction, the story lie falls
apart and in some instances even becomes boring. Not to mention some
Christmas clich√©s that the movie has.
