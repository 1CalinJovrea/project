I thought it was pretty damn good

This won't be everyone's cup of tea. I however have watched plenty of
absolute rubbish and this film is well acted, filmed and written. I'm a
big Walking Dead fan and this reminded me quite a bit on it, although
more a slower stronger tequila without zombies than the beery dead. The
atmosphere is palpable and a lot is left to the imagination as to the
whys and whats however the interplay in a low number of characters is
pretty intense. You do need to be able to enjoy this kind of thing and
there's a lot of subtext social commentary in here, not much is in your
face explicit generic movie script that spells everything out. Shot
beautifully in Ireland, intense stuff with no laughs, but I thought
pretty fresh.
