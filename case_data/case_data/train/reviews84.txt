One Hell of a Ride

Finally another great western movie!To be sure, all the western clich√©s are found in this movie; and I
don't have a problem with that! One of the things I liked best about
this western was the pacing, sometimes I find westerns to be a little
too slow (for my personal taste - subjective, I know) but I felt this
movie nailed it, even with a run time a little over 2 hours.The action scenes are great, very well done. The casting and acting was
great - Denzel does a great job as the leader of this rag tag group of
guys. Pratt, of course, nails the comedic relief role.The movie carried a surprising amount of "heart" throughout it all the
way to the end. Here is the bottom line: Yes, this movie is worth your hard earned
money to go see in the theater.
