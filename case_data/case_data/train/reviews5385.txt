Not a typical Sci-fi, thats what makes it great

The trailer of the movie talks about the black sheep, that is being
different, So I would say this one was the black sheep in the world of
sci-fi movies.The story of a robot, which is being depicted in unbiased manner( not
robot-as-a-monster or robot-as-an-angel movie) is quiet refreshing. The
robot Chappie not just marvels you but make you emotional at times. So
be prepared to get your eyes drenched at times. I think these are some
of those moments when you feel this is not a sci-fi or action
stereotype, but that is what makes it wonderful.Action cuts are great(very less of them), actor have done wonderful job
(especially the lady who acts as Chappies "mommie")Loved it.P.S. Don't do on critic reviews, I have no idea why this movie is
bashed so much
