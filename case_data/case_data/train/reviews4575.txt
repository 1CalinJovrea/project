More than a Chick Flick

When I went with my two friends to see this movie, I thought we were in
for a ladies night out and a teary chick flick. I was pleasantly
surprised. The drama and dialog were very believable and realistic, and
it was pleasingly funny in places. The fact that the setting was
clearly Chicago without any effort to try and hide street signs and
restaurant placards only added to the charm and believability of the
movie. Quickly into the film I was wishing I was friends with this
couple and could hang out with them and be part of their lives. When
the credits started rolling I desired our relationship to continue.
O.k. maybe I had a couple of tears, but I would definitely see this
movie again and take my husband. After seeing the number of men in the
audience who enjoyed it, I think he would feel comfortable attending
and glad that he went.
