It's fun Summer Fare, Enjoy !

I saw the Broadway play with the original cast and had a great time.
The movie didn't disappoint me either. A cheesy love story tied
together with great music from the hair band 80's was on purpose.
Re-living that era, priceless. Go. Enjoy. This will definitely become a
cult favorite in future years, bless 'em for preserving some amazing
rock history. Ignore the professional critics, go have fun!This is my first review attempt on IMDb, with hopes this helps those
who are turned off by People, EW, local and national news professional
(aka, paid) reviewers. I'm a pop culture junkie and a grandma, I don't
always agree with the pros. I'm sorry Rock of Ages had a poor box
office start out of the gate, but hopefully my little review piece will
bring some fun to those clinging to their entertainment dollars. Great
party experience!
