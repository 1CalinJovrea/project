Really wanted to like it

This is the kind of film I go in to with a very forgiving attitude.
Historical dramas are among my top choices and it was fantastic
watching two of my all-time favorite stars trying to play multi-layered
characters and doing pretty good. Then Zemeckis decided to add coke
heads and other modern Hollywood projections in scenes of WW2 Britain.
Not only was the language, behavior and attitude not historically
accurate, it was so distracting and unnecessary in a period piece.
Beautiful cinematography and set pieces and a good story all ruined by
a need to desecrate old, traditional behavior and values. And by the
way, people in the 40's rarely said F but here it was in every
sentence. Sad and disappointing.
