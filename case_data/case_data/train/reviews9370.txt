Quite possibly the most tedious revenge movie ever made.

Drive, the previous movie from director Nicholas Winding Refn and actor
Ryan Gosling, utilised a deliberate and rather stilted style that not
only resulted in a unique air of cool but which also had the effect of
making the movie's explosive scenes of violence more impactful. In Only
God Forgives, Refn and Gosling repeat this sparing, slow-burn
technique, but take it to the nth degree; this time around the effect
is to completely bore the crap out of the viewer.Quite simply, Only God forgives has got to be one of the most
excruciating exercises in cinema it has ever been my misfortune to
witness. Every pan, track or zoom is agonisingly drawn out, the camera
movement often being almost imperceptible. A good percentage of scenes
comprise of corridors, or people not moving, or people moving very
slowly, or karaoke performances (slow songs, of course). Virtually
every scene is lit in either red or blue, which gets extremely
irritating. Gosling's brooding expression remains the same throughout
the entire film. Conversations take an age to unfold. Minutes seem like
hours. Hours seem like days. Time eventually loses all meaning.Even the film's few scenes of brutal violence are shot in such a way as
to render them totally boring.Art-house types will love the film (or at least pretend to), finding
hidden meaning and symbolism in its languorous plot and mind-bogglingly
dull execution, but most right-minded people will quite rightly dismiss
this for the utter garbage that it is.
