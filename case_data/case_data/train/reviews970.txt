Nice art!

As I am about to express my artistic review creation (or there, lack
of) of the movie "Big Eyes", I must inform you that this "Big Eyes"
review has plenty of cornea puns; I mean corny puns. See what I mean!
OK, this Tim Burton directed movie is based on the incredible true
story of painter Margaret Keane, who in the 60's painted popular
paintings of sad children with big eyes. However, the eyeroller here is
that her emotionally abusive husband Walter Keane was taking credit for
the paintings, and no one was aware that is was Margaret who was the
true artist. I am glad that Burton hid his grandiose castles and
imaginary worlds this time around, and decided to go back to the
passionate authentic human element as he did with "Ed Wood". So yea,
nice job Tim. Moreover, we get a solid screenplay from legendary movie
scripters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Amy Adams' big
performance as Margaret was something for your eyes to see, and
Christoph Waltz' work as Water was no fake work. We also get some good
supporting work from Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, Jason Schwartzman,
and Krysten Ritter. So therefore, I think you should give some Keane
awareness to "Big Eyes". **** Good
