Minor flaws throughout, but otherwise a solid thrill...

I would want to say that this film feels different, yet somehow it felt 

familiar. The film felt different thanks to the climactic volcanic 

eruption, which added an extra dimension to the final act, yet in every 

other minor plot detail, it felt as if I've seen the act many times 

before. Overall, though, it is a joy to watch, despite the minor flaws 

throughout the film.



One strong point in which I enjoy the film were the action sequences, 

which mostly are very practical sword fights, that turns out to be 

quite fun and enjoyable with the fast & swift hits. And then throughout 

the end, the suspense of the danger can be felt, which I attribute 

mostly to the decent soundtrack. Soundtracks which are supportive 

towards the appropriate situation is always a great thing to have. And 

while the visual effects were not perfect, it didn't really matter in 

terms of the overall experience.



Yet the film is dragged down by minor flaws along the way. There was no 

humour in the mix, and while there is no deep emotional drama as well, 

at least I can still feel for the character. There are times where I 

felt that the scenes were not supposed to happen yet, although in the 

end, I could at least care about what's going to happen to these 

characters. And the closing scenes were too abrupt, where they could 

instead have added some finishing lines/quotes or maybe give some 

aftermath/future scenes. These minor details kind of let down what 

would otherwise be a solid thrilling disaster film.



VERDICT:



Good: Great action sequences, Decent soundtrack & suspense



Bad: No humour, Lack of emotional touches, Abrupt ending, (Minor flaws)



SCORE: 7.0
