Brilliant

Normally I stay away from drug related films, as I don't understand it
all too much. But seeing as the film had Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer
Aniston in, I thought I'd give it ago. I was surprised to say the
least, and impressed because it wasn't what I thought. Will Poulter
created a perfect socially awkward Kenny Miller and Jason Sudeikis
really kicked it up a gear. I found it hilarious from start to finish,
as the plot unveiled the storyline became clearer. It was honestly a
great movie, and I found myself laughing 85% of the time, with a great
cast but simple enough storyline, the film delivered on many levels.
Must see movie, even if you just watch Jennifer Aniston.
