suspense thriller about girl who beats the odds against her

1. there is a review here that is at least 1000 words about how much
that person hated this movie. that alone tells me there is more to this
flick than the reviewer will admit.2. as my title above states this is a suspense thriller about a girl
who beats the odds against her. these odds are coming from the
traditional good (police & doctor) and the bad (abductor). the support
group (police & friends) don't believe her story. but she knows better
and takes the situation into hand.3. the suspense is continuous and good enough to keep you guessing what
she will do next. yes - some of it is a bit unbelievable. but isn't
that the theme of the movie - nobody believes her - not even the movie
watcher.4. ignore the naysayers and check out this thriller --- very kewl
ending!
