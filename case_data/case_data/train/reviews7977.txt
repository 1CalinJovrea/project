Friends with Baggage (but No Benefits)

Addie, a lonely widow in a small Colorado town, makes a widowed
neighbor an offer he can't refuse. Based on one of Kent Haruf's High
Plains novels, this Netflix original still has a modest, indie flavor,
despite the two stellar attractions, and almost enough plot to see us
through to the credits. Fifty years after "Barefoot in the Park," Bob
and Jane have no trouble playing ten years younger than their
chronological selves. Belgian-born Matthias Schoenaerts steps up as Addie's judgy, resentful
grown son, the only non-life-affirming character in sight (not counting
Bruce Dern's cameo as the same small-town ahole he played in
Alexander Payne's "Nebraska"). Iain Armitage ("Young Sheldon"!) is
convincing as Addy's grandson, a mopey video gamer who learns to
appreciate the old-school distractions of a train set and a rescue dog. The only problem is, IMHO, that episodes that were portrayed as
flashbacks in the novel are dispatched in a few lines of reticent
dialogue in the film, which flattens out the dramatic highpoints and
makes Addie's life-changing decision in the final scenes seem a bit
contrived. Otherwise it's all gooddefinitely worth watching, though be
prepared for a slight letdown towards the end.
