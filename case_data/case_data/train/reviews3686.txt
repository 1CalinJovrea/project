Remember it's only a movie.....it's not that bad.

I actually liked this movie. As I watched this movie I was somewhat
reminded of The Lord of the Flies, but with a lot of science fiction
thrown in there. Yes, this movie has flaws, but what movie doesn't? Is
it believable? No, but so what. Is Star Wars, The Avengers, Batman,
Captain America, and The Hunger Games believable? No. I have read a lot
of reviews on here that pan this movie, but that's just it...it is only
a movie. Just sit back and let yourself enjoy the fantasy. And if it
was really that bad why would they be making a sequel? It must have
done well at the box office. I bought the DVD for my son, and I am sure
that he will enjoy it more than I did.
