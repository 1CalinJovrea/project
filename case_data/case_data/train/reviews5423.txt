Well worth the watching

Hello readers. This is my first review of a movie on here and I was
inspired to do it after reading petit76 negative view on the film. I am
also an avid horror fan pretty much seen them all and I thought this
film was excellent! Acting was very good and the storyline is as good
as you will get with horror films nowadays which is such hard genre to
be original with.Thats the problem with IMDb nowadays almost every film gets a negative
review. This was a most enjoyable horror with some nice fright scenes
and I would recommend it to anyone with a spare 90 Min's. A solid 8/10
from me folks enjoy!!
