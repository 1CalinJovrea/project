Inspired by the Bre-X scandal, it's 1988 Reno. Hard drinking Kenny
Wells (Matthew McConaughey) and girlfriend Kay (Bryce Dallas Howard)
are struggling. He's a lifelong wildcat prospector working for his
respected father until his sudden death. With nothing left in business,
he goes to Indonesia and connects with geologist Michael Acosta (Édgar
Ramírez) who has a revolutionary theory. They head into the jungle and
become gold mining legends.I do remember Bre-X. Some of it came back to me along with the movie. I
remember one of the reporters telling the story of a souvenir core
sample. They handed out samples to reporters and investors. As the
scandal broke, they went back to test those samples. I think there is a
missing character. It needs an investigative reporter who uncovers the
scandal. Kenny and Kay's breakup seems abrupt. The second half seems a
bit rushed although the two hour running time probably forced some
cutting. McConaughey may be trying too hard shooting for an award.
There is a compelling character story here if not fully realized as a
thriller.
