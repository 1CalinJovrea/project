A movie that was good, but was an extra element away from being really good. Seyfried is a great choice for this though. I say B

"He's back! He came back for me, broke into my house and took my sister
because I wasn't there." When Jill (Seyfried) comes home from work to
help her sister study she finds her missing. Convinced that the man
that took her a few years ago has returned she goes to the cops. When
they don't believe her she decides to track him down herself. This is
another movie I had high expectations for based on the preview. This is
not really an original idea but still seemed interesting. Amanda
Seyfried was believable in this movie as a paranoid victim trying to
prove she is right. The movie is tense in parts and frustrating in
others and keeps you guessing all the way to the end. There was just
something missing in this to make it really good. The plot is simple,
almost too simple for a main stream movie like this one. This would
have been a really good "Without A Trace" show or a "48 Hours Mystery"
hour show though. It's still worth a watch. Overall, a good movie that
could have been better if it added an extra element. Maybe a better
ending would have also helped. I give it a B.
