Dark, depressing, it's great zombie film at a different scale!!

Today, zombie has become more than horror, thriller or slasher, it
became his own genre. There are many development of it since George A.
Romero invented the "virus" in Night of the Living Dead at the
low/minimalist scale, then he's expanded the universe in many series of
the Living Dead at the much more massive scale. It's a lavish idea that
can't be bought by money. That's the story of Romero created the future
cinema. In Maggie, I found it's a different scale. I can't found a
scream, bloody violence or mass panic. It just a father and daughter
relationship and love between them. It's an interesting part. We tried
to see something hidden behind it mankind doomsday. Henry Hobson direction it's surprisingly gives something special for
this genre at his feature debut. We can see, it's dark and depressing
in every minutes. Maybe there are no the real horrifying scenes, but
with the mood and he's simple quite direction, I think it's done to
feel the real situation. Especially in the last minutes, it's so
hauntingly beautiful. I liked the way to see Arnie Schwarzenegger without a jump, shoot, and
killed many people. I think it's probably strongest performance ever at
his phenomenal career. Love to see Abigail Breslin too, first mature
character and executed in great way. Overall, I think if we measured at
a different scale, it's a great zombie apocalypse piece of work.
