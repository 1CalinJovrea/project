Just Plain Bad

If someone ever figures out the point of this film, don't bother
telling me.In 1812 Germany Hansel and Gretel run around hunting witches with
everything from modern revolvers, pump shotguns, belt fed machines
guns, and tasers. There's even a appearance by a phonograph. Oh yes,
and pumpkins. Plenty of pumpkins around Halloween in Germany.I could forgive all this historic silliness if the film had any
entertainment value. It doesn't.There's nothing really to say accept that this film is poorly made and
is completely devoid of any plot, characters, or actors.Why such a high rating on IMDb.com? Because as usual the studio's
social media advertisers have fully infiltrated the page with fake
reviews.
