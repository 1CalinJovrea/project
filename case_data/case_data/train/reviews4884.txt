Actually really good

The movie is really good i expected it to be boring, to get lost in the
story quick etc. but it keeps you pumped.Directing is good,actors are
great.At some parts i did lose focus and couldn't tell who is who, but
i managed to figure it out.Plot twist is great, something you wouldn't
expect.I would definitely recommend this movie!
