A prime example where the computer age is going.

What would be bigger than Twitter and Facebook, the answer is The
Circle.Mae(Emma Watson) gets her dream to work at a popular website known has
The Circle. Has she becomes settled in, but soon the dream job becomes
more then she bargained for her, When Mae The Circle becomes bigger
than her.Emma Watson gives a terrific performance here, you feel the emotions
she gives, and the other part she comes across she is in over her head.
Tom Hanks is alright, has kind of The Steve Jobs of The Circle, he
doesn't do very much, does shine in the scenes he is in, but leaves
more for Watson. Patton Oswalt is also good in a dramatic role. But
John Boyega(The Force Awakens) is good too, but I wished the movie
could have used him more then they did. But still a good movie, it
really makes us think. And also good performance by the late great Bill
Paxton, who plays Watson dad.
