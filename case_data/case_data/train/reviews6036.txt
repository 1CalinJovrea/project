Ben Stillers best picture? I think so.

I would like to open with one word; Wow. I had been wanting to watch
this movie since I had seen the first trailer. After being invited to
an advanced showing I got very excited. The movie was outstanding. The
cinematography was perfect and the character development was
extraordinary. The film was very well paced and at no point did i
believe the film was too short or that I felt rushed during the movie.
It has its action moments and satire, but overall it is a very happy
film. I will most likely see the film in the future again because this
is up there with Forrest Gump and Django Unchained as a near perfect
movie.
