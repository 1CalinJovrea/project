Weak story with all the wrong plot choices

This movie had no dimension beyond Lightning McQueen trying to win one
more race only to never actually race one more race. The other
characters of the original movie make scarce appearance, and we
basically spend the whole movie watching Lightning McQueen get ready to
race the final big race but then never actually race the big final race
(because he "passes the torch" to this flat and uninteresting new racer
car called Cruz Ramirez who is about as interesting as a 1982 Toyota
Corolla).Doc Hudson is nowhere to be found, and without explanation, and the
movie has no other plot line to speak of. There is also little humor to
speak of, and the only good thing I can say about this snorefest is
that it was better than Cars 2. Wait, no, actually this was the worst
of the three cars movies.Who does Disney get to write these lame scripts? A 12-year old?Save your money and wait until this atrocity comes out on DVD if you
really want to waste two hours of your life.
