Annoying babbling

If you like annoying babble with characters talking over each other,
you'll love HB 2. I found the relentless cross talk terribly
annoying... mostly because it occur so often in the sequel. Charlie Day as Dale Arbus was totally annoying.The movie has moments of comedy, but many of the scenes are just ruined
by annoying babbling.For me, Chris Pine was the standout actor and character. Kevin Spacey,
Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Fox all do a good job with their characters
too.I was really looking forward to HB 2, as I liked the first movie. I
felt the plot had many holes in it and there was many actions that just
seemed to be put into the script just for a giggle - with no follow- up
or follow-through.
