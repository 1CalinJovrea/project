Survivor - Ireland

Stumbled across this title and it looked interesting and promising, so
I gave it a watch. I made it to the end without getting angry nor
finding anything fundamentally wrong with it, so that's a positive for
me. I like the way it was filmed, liked the minimal dialogue, liked the
pacing and overall felt it was worthy of 7/10.However I couldn't help think that what I witnessed was essentially
this:1. Man is doing his best on his own. Obviously watched and took
detailed notes from Bear Grylls and Les Stroud (Survivorman) and has a
one man farm in the woods up and running smoothly and efficiently. 2. Women arrive and it all goes downhill for him from there. The moral of the story - Women. Can't live with them, can't kill them. But in this case he could have and should have.
