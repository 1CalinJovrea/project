Dreadful

I'm really going to be the exception here and pan this film. I was no
non-plussed about it that I can barely be bothered to review it
properly. The amount of dead space (for example a 75 second scene
showing Soloman just looking at the scenery) was astonishing - any
other director would have dealt with the subject matter in about 30
minutes. Both my girlfriend and I were close to walking out with the
boredom.But we didn't because we were expecting the stage to be set for a
finale whereby through complex legal machinations, the injustice is
uncovered and Soloman is reunited with his family. So what complex
genius might effect his release? He writes a letter to a friend! A
LETTER! Genius - amazed he could devise such a complex solution given a
mere 12 years! So once reunited, will we be treated to the legal
wranglings to ensure this can't happen again and that those responsible
are brought to justice? Nope.So, basically, man gets kidnapped, lives as a slave working for three
different "Masters", witnesses hard work and unfair treatment of slaves
including murder and rape, and eventually gets to go home after writing
a letter to a friend who comes and picks him up. Hardly noteworthy at
all, and in my worst five films of all time.
