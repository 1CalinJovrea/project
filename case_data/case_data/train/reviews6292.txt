Went with high hopes left with utter disgust

The movie is bad. My now grown kids went with the wife and I. Kids wife
and I loved the cartoon version some 25 plus years back. This movie
don't compare in any way. Kids are also life long Harry Potter fans and
thought they loved Emma Watson they went truly wishing to love this
movie they left feeling there money was stolen and swearing off Disney.
I felt I was stuck on a 2 hour lecture about the greatness of being a
liberal and found the movie sickening. Hey to each there own but I wish
never wasted a penny on this movie and I am a life long cartoon and kid
movie fan
