Looks like an extended music video

This is a strange film. On the one hand, it looks likes an extended
music video, filled with mindless scenes of teenagers having one big
party. On the other hand, there's clearly more to it. Some characters
are so one-dimensional and cartoon-like, that the whole film becomes a
sort of mockery of the modern teenage culture. This ambiguity is very
clever, because the film appeals to a teenage audience as well as to
the art-house audience Harmony Korine is usually associated with. But at the same time, this ambiguity stands in the way of 'Spring
Breakers' being a really good film. Unlike other serious movies about
teenage culture, like 'Thirteen', 'Ghost World', Korine's own 'Kids' or
the recent 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', this film looks too easy.
The temptation of showing lots of girls in bikini has been stronger
than the ambition of trying to tell something meaningful. Still, there are some nice moments. The hold-up in the restaurant is
beautifully filmed from the window of a car slowly passing by. It's
nice that, later on in the film, the director shows some short moments
of what happened inside the restaurant. I would have liked more
ambitious film making like that, and less footage of wild parties.
