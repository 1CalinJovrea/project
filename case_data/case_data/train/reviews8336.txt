Felt like I was in the Twilight Zone

I was a big fan of "Kids" and expected the same amount of
intellectually subtle social commentary in this movie. I could not wait
to get out of the theater.. If I had not paid so much for my ticket, I
would have gotten up and left halfway through the movie. IT IS AWFUL!
It is astonishing to me that this generation finds a movie this
horribly scripted, filmed, and thought-out to be good. It is not
controversial, racy, or thought- provoking. It gives no insight,
message, or underlying theme. It isn't that I do not like
controversial, bad-ass, or vulgar films.. I do. This film offered none
of that! I love films that give insight into a generation or group of
people that others do not generally interact with; but this movie did
not even accurately portray these things. I want this movie to get
buried forever.
