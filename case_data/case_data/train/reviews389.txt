Underworld: Underbaked

Like most here, I'd have to say that I was pretty excited to see a new
Underworld coming to the screen. My excitement was quickly snuffed out
by disappointment from the very beginning and all the way up through
the very end. This movie was full of undesirable 3D gimmicks, poor and
sloppy use of CGI, and a weak story line. Once again, we've been given
a film that was quickly thrown together for an additional squeeze on
the franchise name, and a final milking of the of a reasonable fan
base. This film didn't last more than 1.5 hours, leaving the audience
with an underdeveloped story line and cast of characters. I wasn't too
happy with a majority of the character selections. No one seemed to
fill their role well. The acting/directing was mediocre at best. As for
the CGI, many of the scenes seemed like a under-budgeted video game
rather than a well designed special effect. Rest assured, this film
will not win any awards and we've probably seen the last installment as
this film just seemed as though it was coming for it's last breath of
air before going under completely. At best, you can add this one to the
long list of pop-corn entertainers best viewed on a rainy day when
nothing better is available to do.
