Very silly but enjoyable

Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by
Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from
their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back
home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will
enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics.
The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one
exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception
was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be
funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets
annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the
eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is
there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film.
Recommended.
