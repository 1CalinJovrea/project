Good twist, but not clear enough. An audience with lowered expectations will be rewarded.

If watching HatEotS has taught me anything (taught me again, actually)
is that many times a film's worst enemy could be the buzz around it.
Had it not been for all the talk about it, I might have had lowered
expectations and therefore a smaller sense of disappointment.As the Horror freak that I am, I've always loved Psychological
Thriller/Horror films with a sophisticated twist towards the end. This
film makes an attempt on having such a twist, but personally, for me,
it didn't work.Let's start off with the good things: the acting was very good,
especially by Max Thieriot as Ryan. The way he talked, the look in his
eyes, everything was simply perfect for the role. Jennifer Lawrence
wasn't bad either, but sadly the best part about her acting was her not
being an eyesore, not at all. Great job also by Elisbabeth Shue as a
teenagers's mother!As for the story - I find it difficult to pinpoint my problem with it.
The build up seemed sufficient and the twist was surprising enough, and
kept up getting deeper and more evolved. Perhaps it's the difficulty to
fully grasp and comprehend what had happened happened that took some of
the excitement away. I was too busy figuring out one detail when the
next hit. So perhaps other viewers will enjoy it more.All in all, watching this has been a fun experience, though not overly.
I can't say "don't watch it!", nor can I recommend it too
enthusiastically. If you don't expect too much - you could be in for a
treat.
