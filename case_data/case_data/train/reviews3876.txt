Cheesy. Okay. *Just* Okay.

"Pompeii" is cheesy and okay. Just okay. The special effects are good
enough, and the cast is very good, so it could have been a much better
film than it is. Ooooh well. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje stood out for me as Atticus a noble,
undefeated gladiator. I couldn't help but think that this guy should be
a bigger star, and that perhaps his difficult name stood in his way.
Kit Harington is charismatic and believable as Milo, a sensitive,
horse- loving Celt who is forced to fight as a gladiator. He charms
Cassia, a rich Roman girl (Emily Browning) and their love is
believable. Kiefer Sutherland is an evil Roman Senator. Sutherland
camps it up, doing a Boris Karloff imitation throughout the film. Not
sure why he picked Karloff; perhaps just to see if anyone would notice.
Sasha Roiz, who is from Israel, has a face, head and hair right off of
a Roman mosaic, and he's good as yet another sadistic Roman officer,
Sutherland's right-hand man. This movie is obviously thrown together with little thought or heart,
and it's a shame that more was not done with it. There's a scene where
Milo and Cassia escape on horseback. That scene could have been classic
Â– you've got a handsome slave who faces nothing but death in the arena,
a beautiful maiden being menaced by a predatory Roman senator, and a
nighttime escape on a gorgeous white horse: so much to work with!
Instead their escape is just plopped on screen with no artistry at all.
You're watching a rehearsal, not a real movie. Special effects include aerial views of ancient Pompeii, earthquakes,
cracking villas, sinkholes, volcanic eruption, and a tsunami. These are
all okay, but I bet you could see equally good footage, if not better,
on televised nature documentaries. There is lots of gladiatorial
combat. I'm not qualified to judge these scenes. I usually squint my
eyes and grimace throughout them and I have no idea how accurate they
are. Somehow the consistency with which Milo and Atticus are able to
defeat many more, and better armored opponents didn't convince me. While watching this movie I couldn't help but reflect on Cecil-B-
Demille-style sword and sandal movies from the fifties and early
sixties. Those movies had special effects, but they also focused on
gripping storytelling, larger than life stars like Charlton Heston, Yul
Brynner, and Richard Burton, and they had some larger point. Even
without the CGI, those movies were often more satisfying than more
recent films who sink everything in special effects and ignore more old
fashioned storytelling craft.
