An unusually honest and brutal tale of love and coming of age

Marielle Heller's debut film is not for the faint hearted. An unusually
honest and brutal tale of love and coming of age - a story unlike most
others in Hollywood. A gritty yet touching portrayal of 1970s San
Fransisco with a shocking story like to fit the times. It's a good
watch.
