Medieval Period Comedy

The Little Hours is a quirky B-list comedy centered around a nunnery in
Medieval Europe. It's strong suits include great performances from
Plaza, Reilly, and surprisingly, Franco, a solid utilization of the
rural setting, and hilarious side plots helmed by Fred Armisen and Nick
Offerman. My issues with the film lie with the quick moving and at
times confusing plot, the underdevelopment of some characters in an
already tightly-cast film, and a largely unsatisfying ending.
