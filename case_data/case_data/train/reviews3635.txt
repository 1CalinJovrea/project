Nothing happened and I couldn't care less about the characters

37 minutes was all I lasted. Apart from the opening action scene which,
as is usual for this type of film, has little to do with the rest of
the story, nothing else happened to the point I lost the will to carry
on. Given Guy Richie's previous films have generally been excellent and
is the only director to have ever made Jason Statham look like an actor
I am both surprised and disappointed that I got to the point of
quitting. Style seems to have been the only consideration rather than
telling a story.The characters couldn't have been less interesting if they tried to be.
I simply didn't find any of them likable and neither did I care what
happened to them. No actor is going to win any awards for this. The
possible exceptions being any actor appearing after I left. The script
didn't help the actors by playing to the least likable aspect of their
characters. Solo comes across as a greasy spiv and Kuryakin as an
unstable psychopath.The production values were good but that's about it. This is one trip
down memory lane that would have been best not taken.
