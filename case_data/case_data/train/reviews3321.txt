Ignorance is arrogant bliss.

So, incidentally, Frances is an apprentice dancer for a professional
dance company in NYC at the age of 27. This is absurdly out of touch
with the realities of the dance world. If she were so fortunate to be
associated with a professional dance company, she would have had to be
focused and disciplined enough to endure a physical regimen that would
have trumped all of this silly girl's petty indulgences. The movie is a
fantasy about an ignorant and condescending, wannabe charmer who has no
idea nor any interest in the art of dance or the daily struggles of
anyone anywhere. Please, who cares what happens to this phony, self-
indulgent poseur and her gang of narcissistic friends. No mention of
the harsh realities that prevail outside her bubble world. A movie that
inadvertently but perfectly indicts the superficial sensibilities of
these spoiled children and the makers of this movie. Americans are
pretty much reviled amongst much of Europe these days. Self-indulgent,
destructive and oblivious certainly. Charming? In a word, no.
