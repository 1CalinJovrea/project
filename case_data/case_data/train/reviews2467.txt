Great content, just not the tightest story.

Tough movie to get through at times, but over all worth the long
silences, or is it? What you have here is a very strongly acted film,
and a lot of great actors giving great performances. However in my
opinion, this story is not good enough for all of the effort that went
into it. Oh and the ending is just too on the nose kind of real, but
again, I was not happy with that final scene, and think it just wasn't
needed. Like I said there is a lot of slow silent time in this movie,
and it felt a lot like Gran Torino in it's stoic stern American man
against it all including America. The relationships all felt very
solid. You should never ask yourself in a movie would they ever do
that, but just know people do the most surprising things then you can
suspend your disbelief just that much longer. So I Enjoyed the film,
but did not Enjoy the story. I would say see this, but only on a lazy
Sunday, it is a nearly full 2 hours, and sometimes you feel it. Don't
try this one late after a hard day at work.Jesse of www.jesse.ca
