Violence and profanity isn't funny

The target audience for this one seems to be high school boys. The well
deserved R rating presents a challenge to get them into the theater.While comedy is subjective, and there are some laughs, the repeated
foul language and shooting people isn't funny.Jonah Hill won't get an award nomination for this performance. He puts
on the same braces that Ben Stiller wore in "Something About Mary" a
far better comedy. The overall average acting is exposed in a two
minute cameo by one of the best actors of our time.The end credit sequence is a total assault on the senses. No need to
rush out to see this. It will be just as bad on DVD or cable shortly.
