Star Trek is now dead to me.

Let me just thank the genius who decided to put gay crap in a Star Trek
movie. You completely ruined this for me. Ya know, just once I would
like to watch a freaking movie that didn't have 2 guys kissing. I mean,
are you serious? Leave that junk out of Star Trek please, although it
doesn't matter to me now, because I'll never watch another one. Thanks
a whole lot you morons. I hope they don't waste everybody's time by
making more. And anyone who thinks I'm being mean, I don't care, enough
is enough. After seeing that, I won't even be able to watch the first
couple now, because that gross image will pop into my head. Like I
said, thanks for ruining Star Trek.
