A bit disappointing

I watched the first and was impressed at the way it was filmed, the
characters were at times hard to watch but compelling viewing. I could
relate to their life style and was drawn in and made to care about the
people I was watching. Enough about the original. This sequel was
uncomfortable watching and not in a good way. We are given a blow by
blow introduction the original cast. I was waiting throughout the movie
to actually give a damn for anybody. It left me cold, and I was one
waiting with anticipation for T2. I don't know if it was the director,
the writing or the acting. Someones to blame. Even throughout the
movie, the original soundtrack is hinted but nothing solid. Choose
life... maybe not this sequel. Perhaps worth a watch, but do not have
high expectations.
