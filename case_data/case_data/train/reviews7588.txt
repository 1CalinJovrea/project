"Passengers" offers more than the reviews are giving credit!

I read many of the reviews too, and while I always say that every movie
will treat everyone in a different way, I am a little surprised by the
amount of people who didn't enjoy it! I thought this movie was
beautiful!If you want a movie with conflict, space exploration, romance, and
sci-fi...this movie is for you. While it's not loaded with 'blow em up'
action, the movie is filled with tension and does have some great
action scenes. The best aspect of the movie (to me) is that the
filmmakers were very successful at turning a situation so incredible
into something simple and human. I walked away from this movie not wanting it to end. Screw the bad
reviews, see it for yourself and maybe you'll see what I saw!
