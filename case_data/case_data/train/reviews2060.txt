Get Out is a racist movie

***spoilers***First, let me say I loved Key and Peele's comedy sketches. They're
refreshing and make light of racism in America. However, their movie is
not as good as the reviews say it is.There isn't one good Caucasion in this movie. Every single one is
racist, egocentric, deluded, deceitful, immoral, and the list goes on.
Every single African-American are down to earth, authentic, humorous,
and so on. During the movie, I was watching evil vs good or black vs
white, which was clear as day. However, this is an anti-racism movie,
isn't it? Then why are there so many stark contrasts? Abolishing racism
isn't about creating two polar opposites, in fact, that is exactly what
racism is!If you want to create something with any sense of seriousness, then
make something that shows reality: show that doesn't matter what
ethnicity you are, you are capable of good and bad. What was the point
of this movie other than to show how horribly evil Caucasians are, oh
an one Asian guy?Unfortunately, the comedy is lost within all this nuanced racist
rhetoric. I'd rather describe this movie as a light torture-porn with
subliminal racism. If the movie was described as that, then I could
give it a 10/10. If this was based on reality then I could accept it as
such but it's not(like portraying history). As Foucault and Morgan
Freeman tried to express: it's time to get rid of the barriers and
rather celebrate the unity. If you don't quite understand my point, imagine this movie but reverse
the races. Imagine the hero is running away from African-American
hypnotizing slavers because white people are, I dunno, in fashion?
Wouldn't be so funny anymore, would it? Even if the context of the
movie was satirically humorous, the theme alone would brand everyone
involved a racist.If you like this movie, then good for you. However, see it as it really
is - not an ant-racism movie. That, it certainly is not.
