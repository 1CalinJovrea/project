Worst movie I've seen. Description and trailer are a lie.

Omg, I'm very open person but for the first time I went out of a movie
after 30minutes. Feeling sick. We didn't know what to do with
ourselves. Went to a shop to buy anything and everything to reset our
brains. :) I just made an account here, only to express that it is
simply not fair! I feel cheated. How people can lie so much in the
description of the movie. I can't believe those actors took part in it.
What a shame. Why? Why! This is only for people who laughs at
obscenities and profanity. And defecation. But if you surprisingly
don't, it's not funny at all. I was waiting for any story behind it
but.. no. There was nothing there.Wait for a DVD or sth if all those negative reviews made you
interested. Really don't pay for the cinema ticket. Really.
