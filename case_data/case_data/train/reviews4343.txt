If You Liked The First Wives Club...

This was a hilarious movie of revenge and consequences. One thing we
know for a fact is that there are a lot of women who have been cheated
on, and there are a lot of women who have unknowingly been the other
woman. As women, we're told not to blame the other woman for the
affair, but instead the blame should be placed on the married man,
because, after all, he knew what he was doing the entire time. "The
Other Woman" is a lot of women's fantasy on film; a depiction of women
getting together to get back at the cheating, lying man in their lives,
who brought them heartache due to his selfishness and deceit. "The
Other Woman" is cleverly written, has a lot of relatable humor and
shows that out of the heartbreak that comes from cheating, not only can
their be vindication, but a friendship can develop between women due to
that unfortunate, yet common bond. Cameron Diaz was the funniest I
think she's been since "There's Something About Mary" and "The Other
Woman" if worth going to see if you want to laugh out loud. This is the
best 'wife revenge' movie since the "First Wives Club". So if you liked
"The First Wives Club", you will love "The Other Woman"!
