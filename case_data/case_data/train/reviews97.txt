At times I felt like I was watching Transformers

It is hard for me to justify 4 out of 10 for this movie. I thought part
one was refreshing and different from other superhero movies. However,
this one felt forced at everything that part one excelled at. I thought
there was just too much music, visuals reminded me of transformers, and
story-telling was just that story-telling. It also felt like they tried
cramming in too many characters' and their back stories. You get Yondu,
Mantis, Nebula, Ego. I would advise waiting for DVD.
