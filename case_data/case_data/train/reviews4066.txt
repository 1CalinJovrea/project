Perfect mix of drama and dark comedy, very heavy but real and authentic.

I went into watching this movie with no expectations, without even
seeing the trailer and trust me that's the best way of seeing this
film. Demolition shocks you in the beginning and then you can follow a
numb recovery mixed with dark humour, where someone has to deal with
losing a person closest to them. While trying to move forward the Davis
also has to look back into his life and relationship to make sense of
it all.The acting is superb especially on the part of Jake Gyllenhaal and it
engulfs you in a sea of varying emotions where sometimes you're
laughing and then you might be crying.
