Loved it! mixes a few different horror genres together :)

I loved The Conjuring when it came out was up there with my favourite
movies from last year. Annabelle when first seen the trailers wasn't
sure if was going to a good movie on its own. But I was wrong.Don't know how many times I jumped in my seat watching this movie and
some of the reactions it was getting from other people in the crowd. It
really keeps up the scares and frights and tries to keep them at a good
pace throughout the movie. Now this is by no means better than The Conjuring but it is pretty
close. The doll is terrifying and I imagine a lot of people won't be
looking at their dolls the same again after watching this.
