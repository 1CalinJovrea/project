A movie that I did ultimately like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it was going for.

"Eventually a debt gets too big to pay." Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) is an
English professor at a major college, as well as being a high stakes
gambler. He isn't very good at either. When he falls into an
insurmountable debt to a ruthless loan shark one life begins to bleed
into the other and his life, and the lives of those around him, is in
danger. Going in I thought this movie could go 1 of 2 ways. It could
either be tense and good, or slow and boring. After watching it I would
have to say it is more tense and good, but also nothing amazing. I did
like this quite a bit and recommend this, but it just seems like they
could have done so much more with this character. Another down side of
this movie is that it is pretty much like every other movie about
gambling. The best part of this movie is John Goodman, but he is so
under used that it is a little upsetting. If he was in it more the
movie would have been better. Overall, a movie that I did ultimately
like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it
was going for. I give it a B.
