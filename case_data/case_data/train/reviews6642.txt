Self indulgent with no thought for the audience

I went for a haircut a few years ago and a hairdresser I'd never had
before, waxed lyrical about how she wasn't just a hairdresser..she was
an artist. I ended up bored to death and paying a fortune for the worst
haircut I've ever had. I'd never had a comparable experience until I
watched this film. Some of the shots were so long it felt like it had
been paused, I mean you could literally go and have a meal and miss
nothing. There is no deep meaning to this that none of us has
discovered yet. This film would have been a whole lot better if he had
just gone into the light at the start. I like films that are different
and that do make you feel something but this just isn't one of them.
