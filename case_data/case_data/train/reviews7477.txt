Maybe I am missing something?

I really wanted to LOVE this movie, as I rarely get out to watch movies
so I am very selective about the ones I will go watch. I love both
Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and the reviews have been so
overwhelmingly positive I was sure I couldn't lose!To me, this film is a typical clich√©d rom com with some mental illness
and character twists thrown in. Boy meets girl, boy and girl pretend to
just be friends for a while, boy and girl get thrown into a situation
where they have intense prolonged contact, boy and girl fall in love
and end up together. YAWN. THIS is what is getting so much hype? I found Bradley Cooper to be magnetic and intense. Great work. I have
enjoyed him since his small role in Wedding Crashers and thought he was
just superb in Limitless. He is the best part of this movie. The guy is
super talented! I really was not that impressed with the other performances despite the
fact I thought I should be. To be fair, no one stunk it up or ruined
the movie. But I thought anyone could have played the other roles. I
like Jennifer Lawrence but I didn't think she was that great in this. I
thought the parents were played well but again, I didn't think De Niro
was that special in this. I'm not really sure I'd recommend this. I'd probably either wait for
DVD or even cable. It's OK.
