Awful movie

How come Michael Bay has made this movie? And how come anyone expect to
viewers watch such a awful movie!! The rating of the movie may please
be changed to "strictly for infants" instead of "PG-13".No story, no thrill!Its just 2&1/2 hours of time waste.Why the Megatron (regenerated) robots where transforming to car and
trucks? They could have been a helicopter or a supersonic jet! They are
build to take any shape they want! Thus could have saved some time of
the viewer. Looks like Hollywood directors have started to follow a few
Bollywood directors! To extend the movie they can go up to any extent.And how transformers managed to destroy if the Megarton with superior
technology are designed to destroy the transformers!! I've never seen
such a waste movie ever!
