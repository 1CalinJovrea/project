Gobsmackingly good

This is an exceptionally challenging film and most won't be able to
stay with it as it hurtles, repeatedly, from hysterical comedy to
blackest tragedy in almost the same breath - the term "tragicomedy"
never fit a film so well ...There are some stupendous performances here, Meryl Streep in particular
but Roberts is outstanding too amongst a superb ensemble cast - the
script is firecrackingly terrific and the (less is more when you've got
this much going on ...) direction is perfect too ...You know something? I'm a 48 year old guy with way over a thousand
films under my belt and this may well creep into my all-time top 10,
it's that good ...10
