Disappointing

Disappointing, it summarizes Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film is not
bad, it's cool just cool, it is frustrating because all the world
expected to be better than the first Avengers Ultron which is one of
the best villains of the Marvel Comics he is simply poorly executed in
this movie, really the film beginning excited about the action scenes,
the effects are excellent, the CGI movie is hardly exaggerated, Mercury
and another character very badly used, as the scarlet witch for a
future in this universe Marvel, the film is unnecessary scenes, the
jokes are always in the wrong time it breaks the film's climax, and the
end where the Hulk flees the ship hope to explain in the Civil War
film, now the worst thing in the movie, Hawkeye it has more space than
owed it gets to be ridiculous, he can tip the witch and the mercury
that was really ridiculous, the final scene of the movie was good most
not enough to thrill, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not even bad, far from
it, more we expected so that was better than the first to disappoint.
