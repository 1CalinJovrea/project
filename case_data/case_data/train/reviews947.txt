What a total waste of time

My wife and I went to see this movie yesterday. We both like the stars
of the movie so we gave it a chance. From the beginning every scene was
drawn out for several minutes I guess for dramatic purposes however if
that was the reason it didn't work. There was a scene that was about 10
minutes long just watching a pie being eaten. The movie had hardly any
dialogue and was like the pie eating scene just a cobbled together
bunch of long drawn out scenes for no apparent reason. It would have
been more exciting to watch my 30.00 swirl down the toilet than
watching this complete boor fest.
