Little gem.

So, you're scrolling through IMDb top 250 looking for something. It
doesn't have to be an awesome blockbuster or a life-changing
experience. BUT you do want to see something decent. This is your
movie.If you are looking for that run of the mill hack and slash horror
movie(including flying heads and such) keep looking. But, if, like me, your looking for that tiny jewel you just so happened
to miss, you've just hit the jackpot. The beginning of the movie is raw and slow. But not too raw or slow.
However, slow and raw enough that pop-corn munching blockbuster- loving
idiots will be bored.Movies that start like this can develop in works that make you feel
like hell for 2 hours and then leave you with nothing. So, I started
doubting whether this movie was going to be too much "slice of life".But then...You are rewarded for putting up with harsh reality.When the main characters are introduced to each other this movie
changes. The dialogue is fascinating. The plot is introduced quickly
yet gently, and completely sucks you in.You're on a creepy ride which you think might break down at any
moment...But it doesn't. The movie really keeps momentum and leaves you with a satisfying
experience.The characters are fleshed out well and the "horror" part eases in
smoothly.All in all, I would watch this movie again just to see my loved ones
react to it. Watch this movie, and be positively surprised, you have
just found yourself a little gem.
