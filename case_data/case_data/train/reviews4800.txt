Freaking awesome

It's the Philadelphia Film Festival right now and I was bored and
looking for something to do, so I looked through the showings, found
Coherence, it looked good and it was free, so even more reason to go!
My roommate and I both went and we both LOVED it. It was so good, my
roommate and I both walked out of the theater speechless. It had the
perfect mixture of laughter, suspense, thinking, keeping you on the
edge of your seat! And finally something NEW!!! So many scary or sci-fi
movies all seem the same. This was definitely nothing like I've ever
seen before. So creative. I highly recommend for anyone to see. My only
complaint would be that I didn't want it to end!
