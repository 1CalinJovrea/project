Spoiler alert. BORING. This movie was a total waste of time. A few
gimmicks and they think they have a movie! I can't believe they would
release something as meaningless and trivial as this. Casey Affleck
hasn't acted in a movie yet and this one is no exception. They had over
a 1,000 people rating this movie. It must have been the actors, the
crew, and their families. Unless someone wants to spend their $$ and
sit through an hour of boring stuff, otherwise forget it.
