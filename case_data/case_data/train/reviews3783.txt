Beyond an insult to intelligence

Watched the entire movie overlooking enormous plot holes and
nonsensical actions by the characters because some of the acting was
quite good, given the material the actors had to work with. But the
very last part where the two surviving sisters forgive the actions of
the sister who betrayed them and whose actions led to the death of four
other sisters, because "all she wanted to do is protect her own
children" made me profoundly regret the time wasted watching this
movie.
