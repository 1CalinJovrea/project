Good Fun Entertainment

.... And a bit of historical nostalgia and a nod to BJK's contribution
to our society's two-steps- forward- two and a half- back progress in
attaining equal rights and privileges for... well, everybody. Great
acting, as we've come to expect from Carell and Stone, and good story
development. They did what I thought was an odd thing with the tennis
scenes and I get why they did it but it felt off: they slowed down the
action to look like what I see when I'm out on the local courts
watching pretty good players duff around. Professional women regularly
clock speeds of 120mph on their serve and the power of their returns
would blow your mind. The producers made it look like a weekend amateur
could manage a volley with either of these pros. Very unrealistic,
which is the only reason I subtracted a point!
