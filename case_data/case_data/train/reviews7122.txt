Be cautious about what you're signing for!

Do you remember the Kubrick's film 'A Clockwork Orange', well, I'm not
saying it is the same or similar film or storyline, but it reminded how
it affects those people who are involved in a similar kind experiment.
This is not too violent like that film, but it has its share where some
might feel uncomfortable. Except in the opening and some other parts,
the entire film takes place in a single location, most likely a studio
setting. That part was well done, including the screenplay and
direction. One of the rare films, about the rare subject, in some way
it is a must see, but seems not suitable for everyone.It is a nice concept, but it was based on the real. It all begins when
a university professor decides to conduct an experiment in the summer
holiday where some students came forward to be the part of it. It is a
two week long project, so the first day goes off well and then the real
problem begins when a small incident leads to a series of others in the
following days. How the remaining days goes and what were the results
of the experiment is disclosed in the later parts.There are many edgy events; I thought it might get ugly at some point
of the narration, but stayed real and ended with a good intention. It
is a collection of good performances, everyone did their parts well.
Particularly those student cast. Not many of them are famous, but the
film provided quite an equal share of screenspace. It is not just an
entertaining film, a character study as well. First of all, it is not a
usual story, so if you decide to watch it, expect accordingly. I think
it is a good film to give a try for once.7/10
