Hits all the right notes

When people say they don't make movies like they used to, here's proof
that they still do sometimes. "One Chance" has the charm of the old
Earling Comedies and maybe even a touch of the magic of Frank Capra.This is the almost true story of Paul Potts (James Corden), a shy young
mobile phone salesman with a great voice. He wants nothing more than to
be an opera singer. After scraping the money together to attend an
opera school in Venice, he blows an audition in front of Pavarotti
(Stanley Townsend). Crest fallen, he regains his confidence only to
have an accident that damages his throat. However, he comes back again
with the help of his girlfriend, Julz (Alexandra Roach), and becomes a
sensation when he wins the first "Britain's Got Talent" in 2007.The film actually ends at the audition because it's hard to beat a
climax where James Corden as Paul Potts has the judges and the audience
gulping back the tears as he lifts to that final sustained note,
"Vincero", in "Nessun Dorma"; the operatic equivalent of clearing the
bar and setting a new world record in the Olympic pole-vault. It's a
stunning scene Â– as it was in real life.There is so much to like about this movie. Sure, the filmmakers took
the crash course in 'Feel Good Movies 101', it's predictable and
sentimental with the highs and lows in all the right places, but it
works.There are a number of scenes I love: when Paul first meets Julz, his
online girlfriend at the station; another when the crowd in the club
falls silent as they are stunned by the power of Paul's voice; the
scene in Venice when he dines beside the canal with the family of
Alessandra (Vileria Bilello), the beautiful Italian opera singer; and
finally, the look on Simon Cowell's face when he realises that the
hesitant, shy, slightly awkward contestant possesses show-stopping
talent, "I wasn't expecting that Paul"."One Chance" has perfect casting for mum and dad (Julie Waters and Colm
Meaney), witty lines and some opera that cuts though all the Rap, Death
Metal and New Weird we are surrounded by today. To paraphrase Simon
Cowell's comment to the real Paul Potts on the night of his "BGT"
audition, "This is a complete breath of fresh air".
