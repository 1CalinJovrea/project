Don't say I didn't warn you

I live in the Uk and saw this film last night. On the plus side it
looks good and the ship and crew of the Covenant vessel are reminiscent
of the original classic Alien. On the down side these people are too
stupid to live. They answer not a distress beacon, but a garbled
rendition of John Denvers Take me Home. The go to a dead planet and
don't take any precautions. They land a couple of miles away from a vast Gothic alien city as big
and bold as the Vactic city and they don't notice it. I remember
thinking at the time 'I can see how they'd miss that' The alien attacks
when they occur are really well done, but then there is the question of
the ending. The bad android David who killed not only all the Engineers who had
inhabited this and all other non-plant they find and even the nice Dr.
Elizabeth Shaw who put his head back on is basically worse than Hitler.
He deliberately created the acid blooded xenomorph to wipe out humans
and so it seems all other animal life just for good measure. He's
basically android Doctor Frankenstein. In the incredibly dumb ending he
somehow kills the more advanced nice android Walter who is part of the
landing party and takes his place. Swapping clothes and chopping off
his own hand to resemble they injury Walter picked up saving Daniels
the Katherine Waterson character who tells her idiot crew-mates what a
bad idea this mission is before they start dying horribly. He'd already
cut his hair to look like his 'brother' Walter and no alarm bells rang
amongst the crew despite Davids home resembling a Hironimous Bosch
version of Hell. It ends with David in charge of the colony ship ready to turn all the
people in cryo stasis into his nasty little monsters. To the tune of
Das Rheingold the entry of the gods into Valhalla.
