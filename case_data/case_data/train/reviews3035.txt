Great for all ages! Book readers and non alike!

I grew up reading Goosebumps and could not wait for this film. There
were no expectations going into this, knowing it was not an adaptation
of one singular novel. It was a fantastic surprise! I'm in my late 20s
so I was thrilled to see my favorite monsters on the screen. But even
young children would burst out in laughter. Jack Black is one of the
greatest character actors of this generation and does not disappoint as
Stine. Dylan Minette proved his talent and range as the teenaged
protagonist. The film had great flow while offering character
development. It's not an Oscar contender by any means, but if you want
to see a great family friendly film that makes you laugh or feel you
with nostalgia, I recommend Goosebumps!
