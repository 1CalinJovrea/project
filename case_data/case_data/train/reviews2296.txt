A thriller for people who don't watch horror films

I'm not going to give a review of this film. I'll leave that to others
who can argue whether it was worth watch or not. For me, I feel it was
one of the best thrillers with a horror bent that I have seen in a long
while. But here's the thing, I don't really like horror films, avoid
them most of the time, unless I heard a good word of mouth from
someone. That's how I found The Invitation.After reading the reviews here, I would say the criticism falls in to
two opposing camps. Those that thought it was thrilling, terrifying and
well done movie and those who thought it was a waste of their time,
slow and they saw all the punches coming.I think the difference is this, the latter camp watches a lot of horror
films, nothing surprises them, they are looking for all the little
nuances of all the other horror movies they have watched and are
comparing them to the film they are currently watching. They are two -
three steps ahead of a conventional audience and thus, nothing
surprises them. To these folks, I can understand why the film fell
flat, it's clear if you put the movie under a microscope you can tell
what's going to happen and naturally with the purposefully drawn out
pace of this film, they get bored waiting for the payoff.I, as well as the people who I have give / shown this film to, fall in
to the other camp. We rarely watch films like this and therefore are
willing to let it all play out without trying the guess what's going to
happen next. It's certainly a creepy film and while we might imagine
where it's going, we are willing to suspend our expectations and go
along for the ride.My advice, watch this if you enjoy the ride up on the climbing roller
coaster without thinking about the plunge when you reach the top.
