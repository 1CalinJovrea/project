not interesting and pointless

The fact that every person in this movie (Tsjech, German) speaks
English among each other already bothered me from the very start of
this movie.Other then that the story is a very cheap one, the first focus of the
movie is to show how bad Heydrich was and the second focus of the story
is on 2 befriended resistance fighters.Also none of the characters ever get interesting.
