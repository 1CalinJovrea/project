Entertaining from start to finish

'Warm Bodies' is a fantastic film about a zombie named 'R' who falls in
love with a human and tries his best to protect her from the rest of
the zombies.The plot is very strange but if you embrace its weirdness and
eccentricity then it is brilliant. A lot of people have described it as
being like Twilight except with zombies but it is far better  there's
depth to the characters, a lot of really funny and embarrassing scenes
but there is also a lot of really frightening parts which I did not
expect. I am glad there were some scary moments, with zombies you
expect a little scare here and there regardless of the genre but, I am
surprised at the films' 12a rating. The plot is well paced and you're
not bored or waiting for something interesting to happen  the film
entertains you from start to finish.Nicholas Hoult is brilliant in this; it must have been difficult to do
this role  especially without blinking most of the time. It's good to
see that he is making it in large popular films now because he fully
deserves it. Theresa Palmer is also really good; it's nice to see a
female lead have some humorous scenes for a change compared to the
mind- numbingly dull Bella in Twilight. Dave Franco was also really
good here but he was not in the film for very long which is a shame
because he can be really funny.Overall, this is a really funny film with a decent amount of horror
included. If you are considering taking children between 8 and12 you
should know that there are some pretty frightening scenes. There's a
fairly small amount of gore but the 'boneys' can be quite scary 
particularly towards the end. However, the film is really nice, funny
and even heart-warming sometimes.
