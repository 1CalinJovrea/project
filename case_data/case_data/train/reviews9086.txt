Destination Twilight

This movie was awful. It was like I was watching a mix between Twilight
and Final Destination. Being a fan of the anime series I was skeptical
about watching the film, but decided to go through with it anyways.
There are so many things wrong with the movie that just stray away from
the anime/manga entirely: 1.) Misa or as they call her in the movie "Mia" was more obsessed with
the death note than Light and ultimately chose the death note over him. 2.) Light was an emo, who got bullied. Not a "perfect" person who
viewed himself as a god. 3.) L was too emotional, jumped to conclusions, violent and just
overall off-putting (not in the way he should have been) 4.) "Mia" is able to write in the death note, touch the death note, yet
she is still unable to see Ryuk. Now I could go on and on about the way in which this movie has
incorrectly represented death note, but if we separate the anime from
this movie then we still have a horrible film. The actors were god
awful, I couldn't tell if the movie was being satirical or serious half
the time. The CGI was not good. Things just felt over the top and goofy
most of the time. The characters were not likable what-so-ever, just
whiny teenagers who were mad at the world. Overall this film gets a
1/10 from me; if I could give negative stars I would. To those of you
who want to spare yourself, don't watch this movie.
