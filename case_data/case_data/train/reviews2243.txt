Holy crap this is a horrible @#$@! movie!!!!

Holy crap this is a horrible @#$@! movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH
IT. Watching the combination of Afflack "acting" and "directing" is
worse than watching paint dry! I heard he's in debt on this trash flick
to the tune of around $70,000,000.00! He got off easy; at least he
didn't have to watch the $&#%* thing! NOTHING in this movie was good in the least! Please, I beg you learning
how to knit for the hour an a half run-time would do more for you than
watching this. We could talk now about the cinematography, the
lighting, the special effects, the acting, the story, but in the end
there is nothing left to say. This was a huge waste of time, I wish I
had rearranged my sock drawer instead.At this point I'm running out of analogies. So I'm sorry but. I'm never
going to give you up, never going to let you down, never going to run
around and desert you. Never going to make you cry, never going to say
good bye. Never going to tell a lie and hurt you. Like this show did.But hey, on the bright side, this lib-retard who cheats on his
beautiful wife and children is such a role-model for the rest of
HollyWierd.YUCK!
