Surprise!  This movie is actually pretty darn good!

Yeap. Better than I thought it was going to be. A lot of clearheaded
thinking went into script of this movie. All the bits of dialogue have
their way of meshing together in a tightly knit story that is both
surprising and full of suspense. There isn't a wasted word in this film
and not one that is out of place. There's a constant battle in the film
between "she's crazy" and "she's not crazy" that does not get resolved
until the end. It keeps you on edge much like a photo finish at a horse
race.And, well...I guess you'll have to watch it to see which horse wins.Amanda Seyfried, I haven't seen much of your work (If I've seen any of
it at all), but you did good here ;)
