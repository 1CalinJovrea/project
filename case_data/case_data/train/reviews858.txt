Total B Movie Genius

This movie clearly has a small budget and is casted with no name actors
we barely recognize except for the "David" character which apparently
used to be on Downtown Abbey, a very popular show I refused to watch.The movie starts out as unrealistically as you can imagine. A naive
middle Americana family just allows this total stranger to stay at
their house for as long as he likes because he served with their
deceased son in the military and the photo in their living room proved
it.Without safety precautions or logical common sense both parents
basically allows this complete stranger free reign over their home,
kids, and even allows him to drive their car and mentor their troubled
son. The only person with enough common sense to check on David's back
story is the 20 year old daughter whose single phone call to the
military checking up on him unravels a series of events that makes for
one of the better action b-movies I've seen in a long time.Yes, it's low budget, predictable, and corny, but it's very exciting,
bloody, heart pumping and satisfies your guiltiest B movie pleasures.
