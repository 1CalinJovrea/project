Slow paced but definitely worth the investment

First, I must confess that I am little acquainted with the Wonder Woman
comic books. I loved the Wonder Woman series with Lynda Carter and I
absolutely loved and am obsessed with the movie starring Gal Gadot. I
watched this movie at once because I was curious about the background
of the comic book author and because it stars two actors I really
admire, Luke Evans and Rebecca Hall. I was pleasantly surprised at how
much I enjoyed this movie. The pacing was right, I felt, for the story.
I loved how the story was about him but the main focus was always,
rightly so, on the two amazing and powerful women who shaped Wonder
Woman as much as they influence and shaped the man who created the
character from what he saw as the best of both women. The nudity/love
scenes in this movie were not graphic and were done, again, my opinion,
tastefully and with reverence to the story. I highly recommend this
movie to everyone. I loved Wonder Woman before, I now understand why.
