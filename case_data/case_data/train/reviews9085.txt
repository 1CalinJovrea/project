Lacking subtlety.

Easy on the eye but not worthy of the hype and the Oscar nomination. An
interesting story has been directed in a very heavy handed way, which
to me was constantly irritating. Almost every scene is overstated to
the point that, as others have said, there is a propaganda feel to the
film. Did the director really need to portray every white person, bar
two, as vigorously racist or anti-women, even though virtually all the
characters are clearly intelligent and from well educated backgrounds?
This is a film where the message would have been stronger and more
credible if a degree of balance and subtlety had been added to the mix.
The things I enjoyed: some strong performances by a very capable cast,
a very authentic period setting, a story which is totally engaging. The
thing which turned me off: the exaggeration.
