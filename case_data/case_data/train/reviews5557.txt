Sadly people are blinded by nostalgia. This is 'THE' definition of a cash grab.

Checked IMDb before watching. Saw the rave reviews but sadly these
people seem to be blinded by nostalgia. Please don't believe the
fanboy-ism.Take away the nostalgic factor and you're left with mediocrity. A
generic uninspired by-the-numbers production that has nothing in common
with the original only the name and the same familiar faces.Sadly this seems to be the norm these days and fits in with modern
times perfectly of generic sequels and reboots without any substance.
Gone are the days of creativity and originality that gave birth to
classic movies like trainspotting in the past.Worst part: The plot is so paper thin it might as well have been
written for a cartoon. Zero effort has been put into the storyline. It
felt lazy, soulless, uninspired. No creativity whatsoever.It says a lot when the best part of a movie are the flashbacks to the
original 21 year old predecessor. A sad state of affairs.
