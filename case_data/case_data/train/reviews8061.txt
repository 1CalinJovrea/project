Should Have Gone to Richmond Instead

Normally I wouldn't have gone and seen a film like this, except that I
saw the original a while ago with a group of friends (and when I saw a
while ago, I mean quite a long time ago, back when video stores still
hired out video cassettes) and really enjoyed it. As such a part of me
wanted to see this one, and then watch the original and compare the
two, and to be honest, I really should have just watched the original
and left this one to pretty much flounder and die for the travesty that
it happens to be.At first I was planning on watching the original so as to compare them,
but due to other events I ended up simply watching this film. In the
end I am glad that it worked out that was because I doubt that I would
have been able to watch too much Flatliners in one weekend, and will
simply leave the original for another time, if I end up actually
getting around to watching it again (considering that there are so many
other movies out there to watch).Anyway, the film is about a group of medical students who decide that
they want to see what happens when people die, and to also measure it
scientifically. So they basically kill each other, measure what is
going on, and then revive them (and I wonder whether this has actually
happened in real life). On the positive side, this near death
experience changes them for the better, making them smarter and able to
recall things much better, but on the negative side it actually digs up
sins of the past to haunt them.This is interesting because the idea of being confronted with one's
sins is something that is not just apparent in the Christian faith, but
in numerous other faiths as well. Sure, many of us in the modern world
simply believe that when we die then that is it, but the film does
actually confront us with this other idea that what death brings about
is a sense of guilt over what we have done in our lives, and that in
dying these sins will constantly hound us.However, going away from the theological perspective of the film, in
the end it was pretty bad. It simply seemed to be like a lot of other
films coming out of late which are taking what was a pretty awesome
concept years ago and simply butchering them. It is almost as if
Hollywood is looking back at some of these films, thinking that they
have been sufficiently forgotten, and that modern audiences aren't all
that impressed with the technology at the time, and attempting to up
the ante Â– and failing abysmally. In the end, maybe just leave this
films as if, and if you want to bring them back, digitally enhance the
original, rather than creating something new.
