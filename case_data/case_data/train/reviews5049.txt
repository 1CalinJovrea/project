Awesome

This movie is awesome. One of the best pictures I've ever seen. Very
strong emotionally. The performances are top notch; all of them. But In
my opinion, this is Jessica Chastain's all time best role. She deserved
at least an "actress in a leading role" nomination. She achieves a
better performance level than Natalie Portman - "jackie", Isabelle
Huppert - Elle" or even the winner - Emma Stone in "La La Land". Again,
my opinion, of course. The interest prediction on this movie describes
an ideal curve, growing strongly from the start till the end. And at
the end it explodes in a rainbow of emotions you could never predict.
It's absolutely astonishing. Loved it.
