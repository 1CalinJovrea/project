You want Hell House LLC. Not This. Turn Back.

The only reason I'm giving this a 2 is because of the interesting
content that may or may not be real revolving around their interviews
with haunted house workers. It's boring, predictable, and I think by
now everyone with a clown phobia has made a decision to avoid movies
like this, not flock to them. For those of us looking for a thoughtful movie, a scary movie, a movie
that you'll look back on the next day and go "Damn, that was good,"
this is not it. This is lazy, self-indulgent and drags across the
screen like the corpse we never get dragged off camera but kind of wish
we do, since nobody is the least bit likable. You sit through the end
because you think, as with most FF movies, the slow build will pay off.
It does not. If you think you can guess the ending, you're probably
right, if you're over the age of eight. That's about as much worldly
experience you need to call it. You want to be scared sleepless? You want amazing writing and genius
use of FF perspective? You want Hell House LLC. That movie kicks this
house's butt, on so, so many levels. I watched this thinking I'd get a least a similar thrill ride, and what
I got was held hostage on a stupid RV for an hour and a half of my
life. Oh, and hey, literally everyone involved with this movie? I also
see there's a sequel who's trailer advertises any semblance of what you
wanted us to believe about the endingÂ—that right there kills your
market for those who you wanted to leave hanging. You guys need to get
off this ride before you dig your own grave.
