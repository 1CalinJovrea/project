You just wanna watch the first movie instead of this piece of...

So the Movie starts off with a pretty OK fighting scene.Take care of this moment because this is probably the only scene that
will live up to your expectations.I will not over analyze the Movie because its just not Worth the
effort.The Movie was plain simple boring. Every scene was just taking your
expectations away bit for bit and makes you realise the inevitable
truth that this Movie will take Place on the goddamn ships the whole
time. Except of course when they are have shitty romantic speeches
about freedom and how awesome it is to be lame. The true heart of the first 300 was the brilliant fighting scenes and
the simple principle: - You want to change how we live? - Oh yeah? F
you and everyone that looks like you, you shitheads! We rather F our
mothers than surrender.The sequel is the complete opposite: - Ooh, look at us. We have to have
this bullshit democracy and F up Everything because we have our
freedoms. Lets be lame and use Home-Alone-Traps for defense instead of
real fighting scenes pumped up with some Persian-hating testosterone.I Went to the Cinema this evening expecting a sure to be awesome Movie
and all I got was this bullshit.Im gonna spend my remaining Days praying that all the involved people
in this Movie will spend the rest of their lives flipping Burgers at
Burger King.
