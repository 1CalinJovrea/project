Better than reviewed.

I admit, I watched this film with half a mind on the original and hence
it should have been doomed before the opening credits had rolled by.
Reading various other reviews, the film was never going to be a hit
with the so called "connoisieur" However, once I got over my own
pomposity, I was pleasantly surprised and, admittedly with a nod to the
original, don't think a much better job of a remake could have been
managed.The remake is not as good a film as the original. That out of the way -
as a stand alone and to the viewer who does not know about the 2003
film, this is very good viewing.The fight scenes were entertaining. Acting good. Good pace. Story good.
Basically,nothing bad. I actually thought the photography better than
the original. (I also liked the nod to the original's octopus).In summary, if you have seen the original you are always going to be
judging one against the other and Korea will win. Also dismiss me as a
Philistine but I don't enjoy subtitled movies as much as English
speaking ones. I don't have the intellect to understand every (or
indeed any) foreign film without having to miss half the cinematography
reading.If you haven't seen the original, watch this. It is good. It's just
that some critics have got there heads so far up their .............!
