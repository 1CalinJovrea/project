The stupidest movie I've ever seen

Give me a break. This movie was awful. Full of clichés and the most
ridiculous twist that, quite frankly, ruins anything good that happened
in this train-wreck of a movie in the first place. Is this really what
passes for good horror today?SPOILER TO FOLLOW Are you ready? This is all a high-tech way to
sacrifice humans for Gods that live underground on an earth that is
obviously not ours. Once you know the big "secret" you really don't
give a damn. Of course the victims that live in this alternate earth
don't even have a clue that they may be part of the high-tech
sacrifices that have been going on forever. Put that together with a
bunch of overused horror and slasher clichés (and some awful comedy
that was done far better in truly original movies like "Scream") and
you have this garbage.
