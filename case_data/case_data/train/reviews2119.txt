morbidity or maturity mortality?

The acting in this I cannot fault, though Adeline has a very low range
of emotions given the material, her demure persona is a sign of the
times in which she was raised. Perhaps it was the stiff upper lip if
the early 20th century? I have never seen the male lead and he suited
his part well.I watched this with my mother and daughters ( sobbing continued on both
sides with both generations for different reasons, but both centred
around loss). I felt torn, suitably watching this with both
generations, as to what part of the film affected me most. Those with
children and aging parents will understand when viewing this. The soundtrack was beautiful and the song played during the most
emotive scenes is both beautiful and haunting enough for me to seek it
out. A beautiful movie, which is a little in the fantasy realm in its
explanation behind the mortality/immortality aspect which makes it
almost fairy tale like, but beautifully executed, and gorgeously told.
See it with your mother or daughter, or like I did, both! Take your
tissues!
