A daring pearl of a film good will the last drop.

Imagine, if George Cloonys smug Oscar speech magically Pinocchio'd into
a man like director and made a movie. Well that movie would be called
Argo. The tension in this film is so well done it's ... over cooked. Yeah I
said it.Wow the car won't start and wait, spoiler alert, it starts. The
security guard is staring at her fake passport for what seems to be an
eternity, is this the end, spoiler alert, he passes it back and sends
them on through. And that's not all each tension filled moment is
followed by an even more tension filled moment like a boss level in
Super Mario World. First it's just some jumps, but wait fireballs and
what's this the ceiling is falling, very stressful.Oh that's something else this movie lacks, suspense. I didn't feel any
of these so called hostages were in any danger. Except when the
Iranians were chasing them near the end but we're they really chasing
them because since they had no idea they were being chased...hmmm if a
tree falls in a forest...and something I forget, nevermind. Anyway this
movie has it all and Ben Afflect.
