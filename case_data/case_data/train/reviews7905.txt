9
Funny, Violent, Heart-warming, Heart-wrenching, Thought-provoking story

I went into Chappie as a huge fan of the gritty action and social
commentary of District 9. I expected that this would be more of the
same. Both are still present, but surprisingly, with laughs.This is one of the more entertaining movies from every angle that I've
seen in awhile. I described it as I left as funny, sad, uplifting,
dark, light, silly, and tense.The center of the story is Chappie. He is a hero you want to shelter,
even though you want him to learn. But even as you love his curiosity,
you fear his naivet√©. He is the most complex character, and gives a
fascinating paradigm into how children must receive and process human
society and contradiction. There are some inconsistencies in Chappie's
character (is he already programmed to raise his voice if he's scared,
or did he learn that?), but he still succeeds as a dynamic, independent
being.Yes, the humans characters are flat. They are merely roles. The Maker.
The Villain. Mommy and Daddy. The friend. But as Chappie begins to
learn, you see why they have to be flat. They are trying to exert
influence on a (robotic) child. Therefore, they must simplify their own
motivations and desires into the most basic explanations possible for
Chappie to understand. This leads to hilarious imitation and
thought-provoking perspectives.Chappie's curiosity was once ours. Chappie's confusion was once ours.
Watching Chappie is like watching a sped-up version of childhood social
and moral development, with all of the Hollywood tension, explosions,
and naughty words to keep you interested, too. There are parts to laugh
at because it's funny, parts to laugh at because the costuming and set
design is ridiculous, but you still end up thinking seriously the whole
time.Give it a chance. You might love it. I did.
