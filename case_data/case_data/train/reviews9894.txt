Corporate product

This movie is a result from corporate decision making based on
marketing data. You take everything that has been known to work in this
franchise and you mash it in a single installment. Make sure you have
an opening for a sequel in there for cash flow continuity!Where's creativity? where's the story? where is the plot? It's a
typical Hollywood by the numbers movie production that we see all the
time these days. Your DC movies, your marvel movies etc. etc. It's all
by the numbers. Hence a by the numbers score of a 6. It's so very
average without a standout anywhere.
