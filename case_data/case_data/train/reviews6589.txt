Outstanding!

Real or not this movie is one hell of a journey! The story is truly
serious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography of
action scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCU
villain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. She
looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big
step, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epic
moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the ne
"Revengers" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again!
Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it
again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes,
I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three
Thor movies. Firstly because it feels like whole new story telling, and
secondly it's also one of the best MCU movies. Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies,
and like a die hard MARVEL fan I appreciate that.I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you
to enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela is
epic, Odin got his role in Ragnarok and there are some HUGE details
that'll lead to Infinity War and you'll lose your mind when you see
them. MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!
