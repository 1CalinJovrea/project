Into the Wild with Reese Witherspoon

A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good
film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a
sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life
in the wake of her mother's (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds
everyone what a good actress she is; I haven't been this impressed by
her as an actress since "Election" way back in 1999 (and that includes
her overrated Oscar-winning performance in "Walk the Line"). And it's
nice to see Laura Dern again, who's popped up here and there over the
past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The
movie's editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon
together with the character's hike through the wild, and avoids the
monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.One of the minor miracles of "Wild" is how subtly it explores not just
the trials and dangers one would encounter in such a hike, but
specifically how those trials and dangers are heightened, or at least
are of a different nature, for a woman. Only once in the film is it
overtly addressed, but before that scene late in the film, the director
and Witherspoon have already conveyed without words how perilous such
an adventure could be for a young woman, for whom every encounter with
a strange man carries with it the possibility of sexual predation, even
if it doesn't materialize (which, the film acknowledges, in most cases
it doesn't). At the same time, the film restores one's faith a little
bit in humanity, suggesting that most people are decent and kind and
willing to help, no strings attached.Witherspoon and Dern were both justly Oscar nominated for their
performances, and the gorgeous Pacific West scenery deserved an award
of its own.Grade: A
