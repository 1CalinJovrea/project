The worst thing about this movie

Spoilers below. The worst thing about about this movie was that everything is so hard
to believe because it's such nonsense. It doesn't follow basic physic
laws. It doesn't take much to get me invested in a movie as a viewer,
but this just goes too far. The absolute worst flaw is not even all the
fake science, nor I'd it the overuse of disco music or the fact that
the astronaut doesn't really get desperate and only makes cheesy
jokes... No, it's the fact that China's space program has some secret
spaceship which they want to reveal and give up for the eyes of the
world to save one unknown American dude. That just doesn't make any
sense. First of all, China could care less, also, why give up a rocket
on which you've been apparently working in secret, just to send food up
to space? And if all this would happen for some strange reason...
America responds with 'ok. I see. Thank you'. Hangs up and goes '
yessssssss.' Idiotic.
