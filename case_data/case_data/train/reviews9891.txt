Can you rate it lower than 1?

I'm not a prude. Far from it. BUT, I don't know ANYONE who feels the
need to drop the F-bomb, in every sentence, like they did in this
movie. Sometimes, more than once, in a sentence? Why? What is the
point? I'm friends with college kids, and they don't talk like that!
So, I don't really think it's an age thing. And this couple has a small baby, that they leave at home alone? Just
taking a baby monitor with them, to check on the baby? What kind of
parents are these? Basically, the mentality level here, is more
elementary school, than college.Okay, okay.... maybe I'm just in a different frame of mind. I only paid
$5.00 to see the movie. They should have paid me to watch it.
