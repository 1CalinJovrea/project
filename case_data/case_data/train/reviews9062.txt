A movie to slit your wrists to!

As I always make an annual ritual of watching the Oscar contenders last
night I gave 'Manchester' a viewing. What can one say? My wife and I
sat through XXX minutes (whatever it was it seemed an eternity) of one
of the most excruciatingly depressing movies I can remember. The
narrative made no attempt to redeem itself with any 'feel good' content
- it was a movie to slit you wrists to! Our lead character played by
Casey Affleck spends the entire movie in an unsuccessful attempt at
redeeming himself for having been negligently responsible for the
deaths of his three children in a house fire and that is as good as it
gets! The director annoyingly kept inter-mingling past and present to
such a degree that you were trying to spot things to establish some
kind of time line. There was an early scene where our main man tries to
grab an officer's weapon to kill himself at the police station. Boy,
don't you wish he had succeeded!
