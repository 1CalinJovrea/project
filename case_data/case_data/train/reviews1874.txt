Grab The Raid

A woman has a bachelorette vacation in the tropics with her friends and
gets bit by an unknown insect. When she arrives back home she starts
having different colour goops coming out of her wound. Slowly her whole
body starts transforming into some kind of bug. The whole apartment
becomes a sticky, goopy full of eggs kind of place.The effects in this one are awesome. The job on the apartment alone
must of took a bit. The story is basically a newer version of The Fly
but it is entertaining. One of her new talents she discovers is the
ability to shoot an acid mist out of her mouth melting peoples faces
and holes in her hands that secrete a deadly blue liquid.Not bad at all. You will feel like grabbing a can of Raid afterwards.
