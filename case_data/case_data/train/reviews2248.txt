Extremely disappointing!

Unfortunately, Nocturnal Animals was completely unbelievable right from
the beginning, with dialog that seemed written by a machine. Given the
'novel' idea, that might have been excused, but all the dialog in the
supposed 'real world' was just as bad. The only actor able to shine
through this pretentious crap was Michael Shannon, but after a time his
character just disappeared from the story. And what was Michael Sheen
doing in this movie? And the nude fat dancers? It really added up to
nothing. And oh my goodness, what a payback for leaving a man and
aborting his child: He got her to go to a dinner meeting AND DIDN'T
SHOW UP! Wow! Now that's payback in a BIG WAY! Sorry, but this exercise
in audience manipulation was a real disappointment after A Single Man.
