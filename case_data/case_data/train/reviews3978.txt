Many Bad Reviews

First, I had seen the four other in Underworld franchise. I should have
avoided the the reviews as they ruined it. But, I do not watch bad
movies twice, so there you go. Waiting to see Eve return in #6. Again,
I very much enjoyed watching it again. I think there was money paid out
for those bad reviews. And for pity's sake if you've got it in for this
genre, tell that to editor or if none, the public.
