Load of unimaginative tripe using Clichés by the number.

Sad that this rates well with todays youth.I can understand why, it unsubtly hits all the marketing buttons. So here is how the focus group wrote this pile of drivel. First you "research" teenagers. What are their interests and very
limited knowledge?1. Computer games where you dress up, wander around and slash/hit/shoot
things2. Zombie/apocalypses3. "Reality" TV shows like Survivor4. Speaking in a grab bag selection of clichésThen you crudely fashion the outsider (but special) thrown into a group
of strangers who ultimately recognise that you are special and then
follow you through (pathetic) adversity aka schmutzed dress- ups.Being too lazy or incompetent to craft story and dialogue you toss dice
to sequence the most appallingly grating clichés. Throw in a girl
(let's not go overboard), some CGI to make it "interesting" using
slightly adapted monsters from other equally unimaginative efforts that
made money. Then spend a pointless hour and a half to reach a lame
conclusion which is a set-up for more drivel.Same time, same place, next year... but I won't be there next time.
