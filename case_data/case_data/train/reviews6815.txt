Wasted Potential

In The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Russian Ryan Gosling and German Jennifer
Lawrence team up with Superman to save the world or something.I struggled to phrase that because the plot is never established
properly. There are Neo-Nazis building a bomb? Okay, I suppose that's
self-evidently threatening, but we're never told exactly what their
plan is. Nor is there a clear villain, which goes a long way to
explaining why the ending to this film felt so devoid of tension or
significance. Not that the villains are the only ones to suffer from inadequate
characterisation - we're given the "suave" American spy and his
ultra-serious, literal-minded Russian partner in a reluctant marriage
of convenience. The characters lack any depth - it's as if the audience
is served up this partnership and told "You know how this dynamic
works, just go with it - it's a recipe for great action and comedy
gold, right?" Well, I can accept paper-thin characters operating within a paper-thin
dynamic to serve the purposes of a movie solely focused on action,
sure. But despite the promise of its brilliant opening, very little of
U.N.C.L.E. is actually taken up with action. I get the feeling this was
intended to be a real character piece - after all, this is the first of
a new franchise, so subordinating action to character establishment
would be perfectly reasonable. But as a character movie, this fails;
it's not simply that the characters and their relationships lack depth
- they're not particularly likable either. Henry Cavill plays Solo, supposed to be like old-school Bond - and I
welcome this, especially as the actual Bond films have become very
serious and dark lately. But Solo just comes across as a perfect
example of what we Brits call a "wanker", with no charm whatsoever. I
felt the same way towards Robert Downey Junior's portrayal of Sherlock
Holmes in the films also directed by Ritchie - no charm, just
know-it-all American swagger. If you consider the characters portrayed
by Jason Statham in Ritchie's Lock Stock and Snatch, or Gerard Butler
in RocknRolla, they have the same relentless self-confidence - but
their characters are flawed and really quite dumb, which makes them
endearing and human. Instead Solo is just a perfect super-agent.His Russian counterpart Illya is very much a stock character, precisely
what you expect as the super-serious counterpoint to Solo's swagger.
Aside from a brief mention of his childhood - basically designed to
answer the question "Why does Illya like hitting people?" - his
character is given little development. I'll reiterate - this would be
fine if the film spent most of its time on action, but this isn't the
case. Illya is also given a deliberately awkward romance. I'm not sure
why this was inserted into the film except to create some combination
of comedy and sexual tension. A love-triangle between Solo, Illya and
Gaby would have been more interesting; this would have created more
tension and also more fully integrated the story lines and
characterisations of the three protagonists - as it is, the film
features two effectively separate relationships (Solo-Illya and
Illya-Gaby). I feel bad writing this review, because I love Guy Ritchie; Snatch and
Lock Stock are two of my favourite films. U.N.C.L.E. did have some
typical Guy Ritchie tropes Â– great stylised action and the integration
of the soundtrack is masterful as ever. I was glad to see these
elements, as I felt Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes films felt too
conventionally directed, lacking experimentation or inventiveness. But
in U.N.C.L.E., you get the feeling Ritchie hasn't really been let off
the leash, and he and the other 3 screenwriters have certainly tried to
compromise between his stylised masterpieces and the requirements of
the increasingly homogenised blockbuster. That's understandable - but I
think the biggest disappointment of this film is its squandered
potential. I'll give three examples. Setting: The opening takes place in East Germany and, along with a
fantastic montage documenting the polarisation of world politics, it
really sets the Cold War tone. Unfortunately, the film mostly takes
place in Italy, and the Cold War is barely referenced. What a waste! If
you want a Russian and an American spy in an uneasy working
relationship, you could have had it in the modern day. The recent
Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy film did an excellent job of exploiting
the Cold War setting for tension and tone - if only U.N.C.L.E. remained
in Germany.Action: There's not enough of it. As discussed, the protagonists are
too weak to make this a character piece. Nor does the plot contain any
sort of mystery or suspense - when the agents briefed, they're told
exactly what to do. They don't have to discover anything; basically
they've just got to take out the generic movie doomsday device. This is
acceptable if it sets up an action romp. Unfortunately, whilst the
action is great whenever it does occur, the vast majority of this film
is spent in what we Brits call "faffing around".Characters: Solo is meant to be a former post-war black-market
profiteer serving the CIA to escape his prison sentence. Clearly
there's great potential here - it would have been interesting to see
Solo chafing against his superiors or employing his "maverick"
qualities. But he never disobeys orders and once on his mission, his
superiors largely leave him to it - and as for his unorthodox past, he
never puts to use any of his unique skills or knowledge. This was the
whole reason he was recruited, right? I don't see him doing much
different to a regular spy. Although I guess Henry Cavill can hide
gadgets or weapons or getaway vehicles inside his chin. Not terrible overall - it's just too slow, too shallow and sometimes
too safe - I really think a younger, unencumbered Ritchie could have
made a spy film 10 times funnier, cooler and more exciting than this.
