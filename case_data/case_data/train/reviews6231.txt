Magnificent!!!

I don't give many films a ten and even when I do, I manage to find a
fault or two. This film is about as close to cinematic perfection as it
gets. It's a tender love story, a heart rending drama, a well done war
picture, a powerful suspense film, an accurate historical rendering.
The casting is perfect. The acting is magnificent. The photography is
creative. It's neither too short nor too long. The atmosphere is
enveloping. Even the damn titles are great! If I wrote a one word
review it would be WOW! Nor does it fall into the trap of making all
the Germans bad guys and all the French heroes, in fact it's quite the
opposite in places. The story is many things, But essentially it
documents the impossible and irresolvable personal conflicts that war
produces. Okay...one minor error I see somebody else has caught and
which I wondered about myself as I watched. The film is set in June of
1940, immediately after the fall of France. Neither Charles DeGaulle
nor the Free French had yet emerged. But that minor flaw is outweighed
by the sheer magnificence and power of this production. One helluva
movie!
