Grand Waste of a Stellar Cast

Having been to a few of Wes Anderson's films, the twee, absurd
caricature, dead-pan precious, lush, scenic, cardboard Tim Burton-esque
cinematography that many insisted is synonymous with "intelligent
humour" were all expected. What wasn't is the insufferable, sophomoric
idiocy of the story, gratuitous characters and shallowness of the plot,
the script, the character development, the entire purpose of the making
of this film. What on earth is it suppose to say?! What deeper layers
are there to uncover other than it being a madcap caper about
promiscuous hotel staff carrying on with obscenely rich geriatrics,
murderous villains and relatives, an outrageous and unbelievable
jailbreak adventure? What is the point to this wedding cake indulgence
of a film, exactly? And please don't sniff haughtily with a "You just
don't get its brilliance/genius/subversion/provocation,
blah..blah...blah...go watch a Tom Cruise flick!" retort. I honestly
don't get much more from this film than its gruel thin plot.
