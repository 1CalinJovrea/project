Giggles from start to finish

11 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - 22 Jump
Street. This film was a hoot!!! I only watched 21 Jump Street at the
weekend in preparation for the sequel and although I enjoyed it I have
to say the sequel was much better. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a
great double act and the film provides just the right amount of
slapstick humour combined with witty banter and the serious side of
undercover police work. Imagine if you will two undercover cops, not
the brightest pair, sent back to college to infiltrate the latest drug
ring. Whatever you are imagining.....it's in this sequel. Hill and
Tatum are tight.....they have each other's backs and are best buds but
going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their
friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging
and that oh so American Institution.......Spring Break. A giggle from
start to finish and Channing Tatum's not bad to look at either. Stay
for the credits!!!!
