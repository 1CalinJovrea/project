5.8/10 from 28,215 users, I know it will be bad but I cannot help it
I have to watch it~! I have grew up with the love for the original
game. Unfortunately, some people like to take advantage of the fame of
good games, and make bad films, pulling many original fans into a
pitfall. I feel like a moth flying towards a fire will I get burnt?6 minutes  terrible not even one game had such ridiculous action
going on + 47 doesn't even remotely look like the original 8 minutes  another scene looks like a copy of John Wick (2014) but it
is much more cringe-worthy 15 minutes  WTF is this s*** Aleksander Bach should be banned from the
film industry the guy has no clue 51 minutes  I have decided to watch this film despite of the negative
ratings, in hope that I can say something good for a change but I
really cannot. It feels like a mixture of Terminator/Resident
Evil/Matrix films, but only when you take everything what is bad from
them 1h 10minutes  the main character is quite likable, even when he
doesn't have much in common with 47If I would rate it solely, on how truthfully they have presented agent
47 from the games, the rating would be -4 /10 Terrible from the
beginning to the very end, avoid like a poo.tgchan's rating: 4 /10
