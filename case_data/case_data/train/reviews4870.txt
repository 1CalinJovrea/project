Some good acting in an utterly disappointing movie

Mark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I
feel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream
of the screenplay. I am quite a fan of spy movies. That is exactly why
I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie. Seeing Steven
Spielberg's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on
the funeral cake. The direction and the editing are the two most
disappointing elements of this production. Then parts of the story. It
is all so predictable, so cliché, so déjà-vu. I happened to watch this
film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5-part series
entitled "London Spy". That is everything a spy-film fan can wish for.
"Bridge of Spies" is everything but that. Underwhelming at best...
