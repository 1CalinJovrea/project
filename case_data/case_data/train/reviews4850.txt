Very good character study and period piece

Within about 35 minutes within this movie it reminded me of 'Stand By
Me'. One of my all time favorites. The two young actors are excellent
and everything regarding their divorcing parents, life
situation,growing up etc. are completely realistic. Some other IMDb
posters complain that that this film is much too slow with not enough
'action'? I will gladly take slow character study over action
explosions in other films. Tye Sheridan as 'Ellis'is fantastic! Matthew
McConaughey is excellent as always too! Great performances all around.
I really liked this film and highly recommend it to other film lovers.
If you liked 'stand by me' as much as I did, It will not disappoint!
