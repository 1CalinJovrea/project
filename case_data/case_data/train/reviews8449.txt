Cruise is superb. Entertaining film about a morally questionable real-life character.

Cruise is superb in this film, and (in my opinion) his performance
captures the audience's attention throughout the film. For me Sarah
Wright (the main character's wife), and Alejandro Edda (a Cartel
character) also made a mark on the film, with other actors being
overshadowed. All in all this was a high-octane and highly entertaining
film about real-life historical events that deserved to be made. On the
negative side, I would say that it glamorizes the life of Barry Seal
and makes him seem like a 'nice fun guy' which is unfortunate. The
real-life Barry Seal was a drug smuggler who must have cared nothing
for the people who suffered as a result of his drug-running, including
the numerous victims of his Cartel 'friends'. Due to the controversial
historical and political events portrayed (and also hinted at) in the
film, it may have been deemed necessary to do this in order to produce
the film in the first place...
