Why all the hate?

I thought this movie did it's job! It was a great sequel, that
delivered what was expected. The sole point of a movie is to entertain,
and Wrath of the Titans did just that. The final scene was just epic,
although I wish it were a little longer. I honestly don't see why so
many people are hating on it. It had everything an action film lover
would want. The action scenes were ridiculously well made, and the
computer graphics were one of the best I've scene in a while. The
acting was great and so were the characters. For those who liked the
first movie, you'll like the second one too. Very entertaining and I
tip my hat of to the producers and directors. Good Job!
