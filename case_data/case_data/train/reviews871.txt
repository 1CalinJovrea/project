Man did the writers take the easy way out on this one...

I love action movies without aliens and superheroes so I was exited to
see this movie where Halle Berry goes all out in her attempts to safe
her kid. The base of the story isn't that bad but oh how I hate it when writers
can't come up with logical behavior even in high pressure situations.With a little bit more creativity this actually could have been a very
decent movie, but they took the easy way and at times it just was
annoying how the story developed.So a big disappointment.
