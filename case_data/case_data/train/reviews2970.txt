Definitely worth your time

This is a movie for those who both like and dislike vampire movies. My
wife is in the former category and I am in the latter. We both enjoyed
this film equally.From the opening scene to the closing credits, it is laugh out loud
funny. It pokes fun at every part of the vampire mythology without
resorting to simply being a parody of other movies.The film simply follows the life (if I can call it that) of four
vampires of various ages sharing a run down flat in Wellington, New
Zealand. It hilariously showcases the disadvantages of being a vampire
from trying to see how you look when you have no reflection to
attempting to get a bouncer to actually invite you in to a nightclub. Regrading the criticisms of the film quality, it is totally in keeping
with the mockumentary style but should not be confused with the quality
of the special effects. While there are no shots of super villains
smashing up cities or firefights in deep space, the special effects are
good enough to make you forget that they are special effects.
