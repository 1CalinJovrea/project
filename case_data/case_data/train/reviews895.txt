dull , long, no direction ,mess

i love james bond,I've seen all the films, and i can say this is the
worst one, dull , meandering script, at times i had no idea what the
plot was. lots of confusiion ,SPOILER ALERT: like aeroplanes appearing
from no where,daniel craig didn't appear to act at all, just the same
bemused face all the way through, im surprised he doesn't want to do
any more.there are good stunts, car chases, fights, but lots of
boredem, and often i was lost, the side story of oo dept being scrapped
was just annoying, often extra would disappear completely, i wouldn't
recommend this film to anybody. if james bond ahdnt been in it, id
thinkit was a b movie made for TV
