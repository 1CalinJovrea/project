Atrocious - surprisingly so

What a disappointment! Gee, I thought I had been a big admirer of Noah
Baumbach. Butt this film might have utterly destroyed my faith in him.
Nothing comes across as genuine. Scenes exist for no cogent reason. Is
this a satire on Woody Allen? The lead character is an unappealing bore. She is unlike any
20-something I have ever known in New York. As written, she appears to
been mentally unbalanced and without charm. In what world is she a
dancer? After 15 minutes I'm praying for her to shut-up. I am a native
Ne Yorker, and I don't get the characters at all. I'm sorry for an
uncharacteristic hostile review but this is a real letdown. Sorry Noah
and Adam, but I give this a 1.
