Not bad as critics say. Give it a try. You will love it.

This movie is in my watchlist for 8 months. And tonight it screamed to
me. The movie cover said "Watch me! Critics are wrong!" And I watched
it. The plot is there is a man and there is a woman and of course there
is only one night. They stuck in their lives and both of them having a
bad time. They met accidentally. They want to help each other. Thats
all. Perfect plot for a drama movie because it is similar to 'Before
Sunrise' (8.1 IMDb rating) and 'Once' (7.9 IMDb rating)."But there is something wrong with Before We Go" thats what critics
say. I think it is not bad as they say. I mean it doesn't deserves a 31
metascore. It should be 60+. And the Box Office of that film is very
bad. I think Chris Evans did a good job at directing and Alice Eve fits the
role perfectly. Before We Go's cinematography is not good as Before
Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight but it is not bad. When it ends it gives you pain deep in your heart. Because of that I
give the title 8/10. I mean I feel that. It touches your heart. You can
feel pain, heartbreak, despair, passion and love in that movie. I
remember a tagline from the movie "Virgin Suicides" it was 'Just Like
Life'. I think that Before We Go is just like life too.
