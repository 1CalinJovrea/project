Underrated

Greetings from Lithuania.I found "Colossal" (2016) much more interesting, dark and deep then i
thought i will be after reading a premise. This isn't your typical
comedy staring Jason Sudeikis - it isn't funny movie, except if you are
looking for some very dark comedy. Premise here looks like from a mind of Spike Jonze of Charlie Kaufman.
Although it isn't as brilliant as those two might have made this movie
- i loved the story overall and movie itself. Ovreall, "Colossal" is a kinda fresh take on a premise. There is a very
dark humor down below, but i enjoyed it very much in a first place
because of very solid writing, pacing (at running time 1 h 43 min this
movie never dragged) and not by "a numbers" movie. Good, underrated
movie.
