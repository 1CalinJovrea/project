Unbelievable true, but preposterous tale

Watching Pain&Gain today I was thinking that this film could have been
handled as a straight drama. But given the absolutely preposterous
nature of this true story I think playing it as a black comedy was the
only way to go.The film reminded me a whole lot of Fargo with a bit of Casino and
Goodfellas thrown in. Three bodybuilders who become jealous and
resentful of the wealthy clients they have at a health club they work
at conceive of a plan to rob one they truly think is an obnoxious rich
fool. That client Tony Shalhoub is just that is besides the point,
these guys are like the hired criminals in Fargo and everything that
can go wrong does. This film is exponential Murphy's Law. And Shalhoub
proves to be tougher than these he men can imagine.The three muscle bound Moriartys are Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson and
Anthony Mackie. Their back stories are provided with their own
narration as Scorsese did in his crime classics, but these guys have
results like Fargo though not at first. Their own weaknesses in the end
defeat them.Pain&Gain is laced with humor with a dash of pathos in as far as the
criminal masterminds are concerned. They've sculpted themselves into
the bodies beautiful and such Adonis/Apollo features deserve the best
that life can offer. They think some cosmic joke is being played on
them that an arrogant little worm like Tony Shalhoub should have so
much wealth with all the big boy toys he can possess because of same.
So Wahlberg, Mackie, and Johnson resolve to fix things as a matter of
justice and entitlement. I think if you have a quirky and bizarre sense of humor and a jaundiced
view of life, you'll go for Pain&Gain.
