One of few Rom-Com this year that is really a Rom-Com

Nicely directed , the cast is Hilarious from Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza
to Topher Grace .. started with a well put Hilarious bits , tuned down
then the romance peaked which just the definition of romance comedy.The scenario escalated gently and understandably , the "Narrator"
explained exactly how things work on a romance comedy then the movie
just stared showing what has been explained , also the flashbacks for
each story any of the guys tell was spot on. the only thing i'v noticed , which not just here in this movie but also
in the recent ones is that the writers generally trying to spread the
idea of "it's okay to cheat on your partner if you're trying to finding
love" !!! i don't know but it feels kinda wrong to me, yet it wouldn't
serve the purpose of the movie here or the concatenation of the
event..but still ;)
