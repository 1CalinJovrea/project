Gory First Person Shooter with a note of comedy and nudity

Excellent First Person Perspective movie with a lot of fast paced
action and its fair share of comedy moments. Recommended for a mature
and insensitive audience as the movie is filled with bloody gory
goodness. Long story short it's pretty much Deadpool in First Person
Perspective
