It's one that you'd rather be mauled by sharks over and over again than watch, and that's if the continuity doesn't kill you before then.

47 Meters Down was indeed one of the worst movies I have seen in recent
time. It features some of the worst continuity, characters, acting, and
writing that I can recall, and was ultimately a great concept torn

47 Meters Down ultimately got a "Very Bad" on theVade Review Bar or a 1
out of 10, which is a first here on theVade. Skip this one folks, as it
is one that you'd rather be mauled by sharks over and over again than
watch, and that's if the continuity doesn't kill you before then.Read more at theVade.
