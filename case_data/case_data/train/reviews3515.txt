'Coherence' is a thrilling mind bender!

Re-energizing the low budget scifi genre, this mind bender centers
around a single dinner party on a night where a comet is passing over
Earth, causing some strange occurrences. The film keeps you at the edge
of your seat from the first frame to the last, primarily a result of
the experimental production process by which director James Ward Byrkit
only gave the actors notes about their goals for each scene (there was
no script). This allowed the actors to fully improvise the moments when
and how they'd attempt to achieve their goals. The tight setting and
masterful editing keeps us super close to the action, sometimes
purposefully uncomfortably close. The result is that 'Coherence'
becomes an instant scifi crowd pleaser...and hopefully the start of a
new filmmaking trend. The twists and turns kept me thinking for days,
and I can't wait to watch it again. See it with friends -- I guarantee
it'll spark some really fun debates.
