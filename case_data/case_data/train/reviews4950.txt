Surprisingly lovely

This film isn't your usual Zombie film, yes there is a load of zombies
in it but it is with a twist. This time it is about good zombies. There
is still quite a few fight scenes but nothing over the top/too gory.I didn't think this plot could work, a zombie and a human forming a
relationship? it sounds silly but it actually works! The excellent
Nicholas Hoult portrays 'R' the zombie extremely well and the on screen
friendship he forms with Julie (Teresa Palmer) is really touching. OK
it is a bit predictable but the way it all developed is great and we
are left with a great ending.I think this film will really surprise a few people, it is definitely
worth watching. A romantic film which includes zombies and is also
funny, a winner for me.8/10
