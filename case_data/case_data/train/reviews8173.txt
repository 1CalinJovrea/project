Brilliant, Fresh & Stimulating in every sense...

Whenever you have a groundbreaking film that redefines Form, you are
going to have some that either love it or hate it. Having said that, as
I get older I more often find reading the user comments on IMDb fills
me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss Under The Skin
as "boring" they must have no interest in human consciousness, science,
technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I
understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous -
they understand their audience."Under The Skin" is unique among films in content and scope. The
cinematography is out-of-this-world, breathtaking, and the musical
score is sublime. I rarely use the word "masterpiece" to describe a
movie. But Jonathan Glazer's "Under The Skin" is art in the highest
sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa", or Vincent Van Gogh's "The
Starry Night".The film requires you to watch in a different way than you normally
watch films. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images
without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed
characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good,
but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are
different KINDS of film, and to enjoy 'Under The Sin' you must tune
your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of
beauty, PURE beauty, 'the vast unknown' and an Alien perspective,
unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films."Under The Skin" is a absolutely unique movie experience. Those who
miss out on it do so at the detriment of their own intellectual and
imaginative capacities.
