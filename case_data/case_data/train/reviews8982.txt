Home Again is the new Nancy Meyers produced Reese Witherspoon movie. It
centers around Witherspoon's character, Alice. Alice is a single mother
with two daughters who has separated from her husband and has moved
back to California. She invites three young struggling male filmmakers
to stay in her guesthouse, since they, at that time, have nowhere else
to go. Alice gets romantically involved with one of those three men and
then things get a bit complicated. Also, her husband she is separated
from decides to pay a visit and things get even more complicated. I
absolutely adore Nancy Meyers! She is one of the best in the industry
in my opinion. So, I thought it was a pretty safe bet to say that I was
going to have a positive reaction to this movie. Turns out, that was a
safe bet, because I enjoyed home again very much. If you like romantic
comedies, you'll love it. If you like sentimental dramas, then you will
definitely enjoy it. And if you like the stars, then there's a good
chance you'll like it too. The writing is good and the dialogue is very
well written, this movie is all about the characters, and the writing
enhances the connections between them. 8/10 for Home Again, it's a
worthwhile sweet movie to enjoy if you're in the right mood for this
kind of film.
