a men version of " Gone Girl " !!

a Great movie , it reminded me another great movie " Gone Girl " by
David fincher, I didn't read the novel but the scenario was quiet good
and the plot was nicely done, what made me like this book is Emily
Blunt and her astonishing performance, I'm not saying that other
members of the cast didn't perform, they REALLY did a great job, but
Emily was the best. I also liked Halet Benett character, she's a good
actress with a bright future, I've seen her this year on "The
Magnificent Seven" too. I haven't seen any other works for the director
Tate Taylor, but he has done a very good job with this, I'm looking
forward to see his future works.
