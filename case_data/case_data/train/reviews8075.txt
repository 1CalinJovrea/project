X-Men : Days of Future Triomph

Right now, I'm still trying really hard to find out one bad thing from
the X-Men movie I've just seen: The characters maybe ? No: every single character is perfectly
represented,interpreted (in particularly with a stunning James McAvoy
and an impressive Michael Fassbender) and useful to the story. Maybe
the plot then ? No: you'll get easily into it, because it is very well
written for the screen, meaning you will be transported as Bryan Singer
seems to know perfectly how to put in place a very cinematic puzzle.
Emotions ? You will get some, as long as you loved the original X-Men
characters. The soundtrack ? It is spotless and superbly fitting.
Visual Effects ? Always there when we want them to be, and not when it
is unnecessary. Action scenes ? You'll be amazed, thrilled and
captivated when you will realize that every single scene has a purpose,
whether it has some action or simple emotions and character's
development.All these qualities put together are forming a very classical but
excellent & accomplished movie, completed by a skilled sense of
cinematic continuity that we didn't have since Singer left the
franchise (at least until X-Men First Class). In other words, you
should not be afraid to see this movie, because if you don't want to be
disappointed, I can tell : you won't be. But is the future of this X-Men movie truly set ? This is something
you'll have to figure out by yourselves, and this until the very end of
the credits...
