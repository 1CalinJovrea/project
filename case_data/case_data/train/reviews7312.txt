The Magic is the Disappearing Story Line

A every poor script, bad direction and wooden acting drove this
Channing Tatum vehicle right over the cliff. There is too much time
spent on the males dancer scenes and no time spent on a story or
character development. Yes, Tatum started as a male stripper and this
is nothing but a sad grab for movie-goers wallets by showing what that
world is like. Who cares? Horrible dialogue and bad camera work were
the least of this pictures problems. Oh, did I mention the sound was
terrible as well but the abysmal soundtrack was at concert volume. I am
not interested in watching male dancers but that is not the main reason
I disliked this film. After it was established that they did different
routines in their acts it was unnecessary to keep showing them doing
that. Unless you are a hardcore Channing Tatum fan this is not worth
the time spent to watch it. Even then...think about it before you do.
