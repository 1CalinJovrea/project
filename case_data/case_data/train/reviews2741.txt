So very much more than meets the eye

At first glance, you would think this movie would be just another
generic Katherine Heiglesque rom-com that dominates the box office and
empties your soul. But classifying it as such is like saying Jaws was a
nice little fishing movie. It's so very much more and what makes it all
the more wonderful is that it comes as such a pleasant surprise.I mean, seriously, who would have thought that Bradley Cooper could
convey such angst and heartache? Or that De Niro still had a great
performance in him after a decade of caricaturing his old self? And
Jennifer Lawrence - just wow. There's so much more to say but best to
just let you experience it for yourself.Watch - this movie's rep will build through terrific word-of-mouth and
it'll end up as a modern day classic. This is why you go see movies in
the first place.
