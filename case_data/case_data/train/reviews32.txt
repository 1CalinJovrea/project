totally disappointing

this is only the second time I have ever posted a comment on a movie
the last was the birdman. now this was classed as a western and the
only thing I seen was a stage ride to a cabin where the movie stayed.
now this is Kurt Russell's 2nd western I have seen and the last I
turned off after the first ten minutes. Now with this being a Quentin
Tarantino film and the people I talked to about it said it is a typical
film of his then my fault shame on me I should never have watched it
but the wife wanted to hang in there and see where it went which I did
and sadly went no where. Samuel L Jackson is one of my favorite actors
and find it totally disappointing that he needed the money that bad to
do this movie. it's unfortunate that they are both heading the way of
Bruce Willis just doing anything to make a buck. it took an hour and
half of my life I can't get back so I am bitter. Kurt maybe think of
retiring and come up to Canada with Goldie Hawn and relax at your
Muskoka Lake resort and let someone turn out a good western worth
watching. Sorry I am still really bitter on wasting my time
