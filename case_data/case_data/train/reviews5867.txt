You should lower your expectations

I watched the movie yesterday in the evening and honestly I did not
enjoy it at all. Firstly we were shown 50 minutes ( yes 50 minutes!) of
advertisement. I can proudly say I know all the kid's toys now.I was expecting much more better Thor movie however I was wrong. First
half was "Narnia" and the second half was "London City Guide for
Tourists" founded by some ministers probably. Odin was same , he always makes mistakes and Thor is always right. It
was very weird to watch how they connect Jane Foster character and her
fellow friends to the movie . Things happening all the time without any
sense. Crazy weirdo scientists ( Hollywood likes to show weirdo crazy
British scientist lately - Pasific Rim - Agents of Shield etc..), a
very bad villain and thousands of Asgardian Guardians (Lets say
headless chickens), very amateur Asgardian King( I do not even let him
to drive my car, he is the king of stupidity.). I do not believe
someone else could write this movie worse than them. 110 minutes of
getting bored just to watch a complete disaster. By the way weirdos saved the universe with a game-boy and couple of
sticks. We do not need any superhero anymore.If you are 12 okay you will enjoy I am sure. Stay away!!.And to Hollywood : Guys OK you can make special effects but please
learn how to shoot a proper movie.
