well done and pointless

Why does Denzel do these things, ultra violence in service to what?
Turns out there are bad people who do government spying, they appear to
be, hope you're sitting down, duplicitous, greedy, violent. I know, who
would have thunk it? The movie essentially has a bunch of murderers of
one CIA stripe killing a bunch of murderers of another CIA stripe,
that's pretty much the beginning and end of it. Nothing else at stake,
no giant Maguffin, nuclear annihilation, the discovery of the holy
grail, whether Lindsey Lohan will ever pull out of her dive, nothing
here. And really good actors doing mostly nothing of interest in
service to nothing of consequence. No one was seen in a good light
here, oops, save the French girlfriend and one simply perfectly shot
aerial scene of a car going vertically up the screen through fields, a
relatively short shot, but magnificent nonetheless, painterly, in fact.
Otherwise, when its done you just had to ask yourself, how did this get
funded? What was the decision process for this?
