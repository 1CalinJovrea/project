Funny, entertaining and refreshing

I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with
Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory,
unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy,
where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a
comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this
character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant
to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with
action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable
for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on
comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far
more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry,
but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it
without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and
directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies.
That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many
movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching
it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.
