I Love Will Ferrell- But not THIS!!

This was possibly the worst film I have seen in a very long time. Not
only were the jokes absolutely terrible the characters were so immature
you genuinely didn't know whether they were the parents or the
children. Will Ferrell played his typical childlike male figure which
is amazing for films like Elf or Step-Brothers but when you need to be
acting like a parent? No good. It seemed like Amy Poehler felt the need
to then act exactly the same as Ferrell and to be quite frank she was
awful! But, I can't blame the actors for all of this god awful movie.
It just felt like no one knows how to produce, direct and act in films
anymore.Please don't waste your time.
