good movie, but disappointing ending

there is something good living next to the German border. they get
movies in their cinemas, many months (even up to 1 year) before they
come in the danish cinemas. this time me and my friends went to see
mama. having heard many positive things about it we were excited. how
did it go? the first thing i noticed, was how beautiful this movie was
shot, and all the atmosphere surrounding it. the story was also pretty
good, and original for 3/4 of the movie. the last 1/4 took a trip
downhill, especially because of the monster. yeah the monster, what can
i say about that. the first 2/3 of the movie, they really build up to
the reveal of the monster, and i personally thought the drawings were
pretty effective. the build up, did by the way scare some of my
friends, so good was it. but when they showed us the monster, we
laughed. it just looked so stupid! and of course it had its
similarities to the grudge monster (how original). but what really
ruined it, was the use of the monster in the ending. if you were ever
frightened by it, you weren't any more at the end. so all in all, its a
beautiful movie, with some great mystique in the beginning. and despite
the disappointing ending, i will still recommend it, especially to
watch with friends, but wait for the DVD release, its not worth paying
a ticket for each person.
