Is The Video Game Curse Broken?

First off, i would like to point out Duncan Jones has made another
fantastic flick. Better than source code, but me personally i loved
moon so.... Warcraft isn't good enough to beat it lol. So Everything
about this movie felt right. And i would like to point out this movie
is about the warcraft storyline (First game) Not World Of Warcraft. The
acting was good, the pacing was great. The CGI was amazing! Gul'dan was
an awesome villain. Never heard of Daniel Wu But i feel like he will be
voice acting more characters soon. I love how they wear that ridiculous
armor that a normal person can't stand up in. Lothar was an amazing
main character, and I only know Travis Fimmel because he's in the show
vikings but i feel like if the rest of the critics like this movie this
could be his breakthrough movie. If there is a sequel then i would
definitely go and see it. And lads, The Video game curse is broken!
Hopefully Assassins Creed will live up to the hype! Fans will love it,
people who like lord of the rings or the hobbit will love it, just
regular people who has never played WoW will love it! All in all, i
think that the hype was well worth it and it is definitely going to be
a recommend for me! After you have seen Captain America go see
Warcraft, you wont regret it.
