Fast-paced action with loads of humor- Awesome!!!

I had the privilege of seeing this at an advanced screening and I was
already looking forward to seeing this film and it exceeded all my
expectations. Knowing that this film was directed by Matthew
Vaughn(Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) I had a pretty good idea that this
film was going to be really good. If you love fast-paced, stylish,
humorous, and all around awesome flicks, then this is a definite must
see! The action was amazing and I really loved watching Colin Firth
kick some ass! Samuel L. Jackson was very fun to watch as a villain as
well. I don't think I've had that much fun watching a film in a really
long time. The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero
genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie
genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service. I can guarantee a film like this
won't win any major awards but I can guarantee that you will have an
entertaining time with this film. Must see 10/10
