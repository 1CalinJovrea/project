All got lost in the sand storm

I can't believe that it wasn't obvious at the first reading that the
script was letting it down. Basic idiosyncratic transitions and poor
dialogue abounds. Hugo Weaving (something of a fixture in Australian
films) manages to make the best of his scenes, and gives a good
credible performance throughout. Nicol Kidman works wonders to give the
other credible performance. Mr Fiennes is miscast and struggles from
his first frame to his last, to even convince us that he belongs there
at all.The rest of the great problem with this film is down to the appalling
direction. Basic character relationships are ignored, logic is ignored,
some the smaller roles seem to have been left to tag along by
themselves, dramatic tension is frequently killed in its infancy by
casual happenstance, and there are too many red rock dessert shots,
that look for all the world, like stock footage.It no doubt made great headway as it stood the test of the template
during the funding process, as it was labeled a feminist story (it even
failed at that) it was to be directed by a woman, it was to be set
within a sand storm in country Australiana, and it even featured a
smattering of indigenous characters and folk law.It's a shame that the piece could not have been saved by skillful work
shopping during the early stages of production, and good film making
throughout.
