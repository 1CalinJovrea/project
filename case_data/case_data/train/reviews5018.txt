White people want to enslave you out of envy... and pay $2.00 to Redbox this movie.

So predictable that you can complete the story arc in your head twenty
minutes into the movie (I'm being generous; the trailers pretty much
give it away). Ridiculous overacting: the acting in the early
plantation scenes was so B-grade awful that I almost couldn't tell
whether Peele was satirizing a kind of black paranoia regarding
socially-awkward white behavior or trying to set them up as creepy
villains. Moves at a snail's pace towards the obvious: the white people
actually want to subjugate all of the black people in the movie.
Shocker there!Not that it would have helped, but even the ending fails to line up
with the worldview, and comes off as completely arbitrary - the hero
rides off into the night with his comic relief buddy. I half-expected
Kaluuya's character to either get shot or imprisoned in this movie of
inescapable and systemic racism, and was surprised at how anticlimactic
it ended up being. Peele's talent is wasted here; he should stick to
comedy.
