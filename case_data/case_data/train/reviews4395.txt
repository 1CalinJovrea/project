All Playing Together Like One Big Happy Family

starred in films that were a bit more meaningful than this load of
trash. Anyway, didn't the Partridge Family already cover this material
in 4 seasons and 96 obnoxious television episodes featuring an annoying
family performing in random venues as well as their garage? Don't the
Cowsills get any credit here? At least the Archies were a cartoon band
and didn't tarnish their acting careers like Ruffalo and Knightley do
in this dreadful production. The guitarist twanging a collection of
sour notes containing multiple special audio effects to hide the actual
proficiency of musical talent made me cringe. And where is the
tambourine player that I hear on nearly every song? I suppose this was
a way for the everyone in the production to let loose and have a good
time but it felt like having to watch a bad episode of The Monkees
again and again. Hopefully this film and all the worn out conventions
and superficial heart rending plot devices will take a nose dive with
this so we never have to view this kind of entertainment ever again. At
least the neck stubble and self importance of Adam Levine were
offensive enough to let us see him for what he really is.
