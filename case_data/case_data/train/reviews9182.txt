Witch hunters with automatic machine guns

Hansel and Gretel, two orphans, who barely escaped being devoured by a
witch, stroll the world with automatic machine guns to kill witches.They're called into a village to fight an assembly of ugly witches that
planned to cook children in order to become permanently prettier
ladies.Note that the witches are super human type of creatures (super fast,
super powerful. A bit like our regular vampire from around the corner.A bit ironic, but this is mainly the storyline for this movie. I really
wonder such a budget could be spent on that kind of movie, which has
absolutely no entertainment beside what you've seen in the trailer.The story is poor, there is bare sympathy for the characters. The
burlesque is lost to the missing irony, and you can almost tell after
20mn what will be the finish line.I even wonder how the writer could find a producer for his script.
Well, if it was up to me, waste your time and money on a better movie.
