Big smile after watching this spectacular movie!

My first review - it's worth. I have always loved Spanish cinema and
this film has defended all the good that comes from this country. A
seemingly naive movie has turned into a whole mystery where nothing is
known, but the most memorable is the end that left a big smile on my
face because it is the biggest surprise I have ever seen in a single
drama. Rating: 10 and recommendations that everyone who likes the
surprise factor will be sighted by him. Bravo!
