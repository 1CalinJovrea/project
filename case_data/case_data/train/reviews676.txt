Absolutely Terrible , Not one funny moment or near Giggle

Man just when you thought it could not get any worse along comes
complete rubbish like this.With Will Ferrel in a Movie you would expect
it to be OK at with a couple of laughs in it maybe even brought in by
him but WOW this is not fit to be called a comedy or a movie it should
be De-Released Amy Phoeler or however you spell her due name "intended
spell error " Blows so bad in it you want to smack the face of her..Wil
also blows so bad it took about 25 to 30 minutes to realize that this
movie is getting worse by the second, Few friends also tried to watch
it but they killed it after 15 minutes .. they had a sense .avoid this
garbage at all cost unless you hate yourself and love terrible eh movie
/ extended show Trust me AVOID
