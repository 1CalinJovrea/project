Fantastic

wow, i did not see that coming. unfortunately , it's rare to see this
amount of dedication and talent in contemporary mainstream American
cinema these days. i was expecting a dull drama with good actors and an
OK script, and i got this: pure , unfiltered , proper effort , applied
in modern American commercial standards. Alejandro González Iñárritu's
brilliant direction creates a mesmerizing blend of genres , it's
captivating from first shot,bittersweet and painfully realistic. made
with high technical complexity and deep character study - and with so
much to say about love , art and the the human soul, "birdman" is still
coherent and crystal clear. great performances by all actors ,Michael
Keaton is pushing the limits here (in a good way), Emma Stone and Naomi
Watts are sharp and enigmatic , and Norton is kicking like it's 1999.
with an outstanding script to support their performances ,and original
and intriguing soundtrack. no wonder it's the real deal.a new favorite
for me.
