Waste of time

This is my first review at IMDb, and I cannot withstand from warning
the people reading the reviews: this movie is very bad. If I could give
a zero, I'd do that. I've read so many reviews that really helped me a
lot to choose the movie I'd like to watch. Pompeii (2014) is one of a
few movies I didn't inspect properly before watching. And that was a
big mistake. This movie has no sense, no story, actions are amateurish,
emotions are artificial, dialogues are brainless. We laughed a lot
during the movie on how stupid many scenes and dialogues could be. Paul
Anderson should really retire. I read his books and I liked them, but
as a movie director, I'm sorry it's probably not for him. After two
hours watching this movie and after the last sequence of scenes, I
really wonder what all that was about? Even if considering a love
genre, this movie doesn't belong to it either. Love between the main
characters was very funny and superficial. Please, don't waste your
time on this movie. It's completely worthless.P.S. By the way, the volcano eruption was so funny. Most of the time it
shoot fire bombs instead of producing lava. And the shoots were really
bully. I think Paul Anderson took this from Starship Troopers where the
huge alien insects shoot the similar bombs in space.
