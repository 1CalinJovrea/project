A badass movie with an emotional tribute to Paul Walker.

Furious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous
installments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had
great camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham
and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was
cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also
hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was
interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've
been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along
with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There
are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually
filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass
one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace
Paul Walker.
