I don't like it

It's an utterly predicable manipulative piece of garbage, the songs are
so unoriginal since all of them was taken from other artists, there
aren't much reasons why these characters are animals, and the title
itself, "Sing" is so self-explanatory and uncreative, I already knew
how bad this movies is going to be without even watching it. Also why?
They overuse the same design of characters and locations over and over
and it's so lazy and dull. The budget is significantly low compared to
other big-budget animation studios like Disney and Dreamworks. There is
nothing special about this film whatsoever, they're so lazy they just
took other artist's song and put it into the movie None of them were
really from themselves!
