Boring

I do reckon that at 31 years - i am not the target audience of this
movie. There are of course movies that address both, children and
adults alike - but this is not one of those.The plot was ... pretty stupid. Not stupid in a comedic way - but
stupid in a "that makes no sense" way. There was no notable character
progression, the minions were a snooze and the newly introduced
characters made no sense. Shedding light on Grus past might have been
interesting, especially since there was the scene of a young Gru in the
minions movie - but instead we got a kind of family reunion with little
to no impact at all. So they just got to know each other - and they
like each other .. well, good. Thats it.The villain - the most important part of such a movie - was rather
weak, too for my taste. Memorable in design and behaviour, but rather
weak in terms of motivation and threat. (considering Gru had to deal
with a genius villain that was trying to steal the moon in the first
movie ... the villain in the 3rd was just a substantial step down)Jokes fell mostly flat - but there weren't many for an adult audience.I d say - a nice movie for kids, but in contrast to some of the classic
pixar movies ... not for adults.
