Body horror. It's for people who love movies like Cronenberg's The Fly,
or Carpenter's The Thing, it's the kind of horror that makes some
people throw up or feel faint watching it. Now we have Bite. A POV shot
horror about a girl on vacay with some friends. She gets bitten by what
seems like any other insect, but when she returns home, s*&t gets real.
Where this flick excels, is with its visual effects. Creators Black
Fawn are true horror genre lovers and it shows, with Practical Effects
being used for everything. The nest. The eggs. The way our heroine
'changes' . It's really well done and sometimes hard to watch. The
negs. Well simply put, the effort is put into the effects, but the
story and the acting is so-so. It's just all surface. By that I mean,
The Fly was about people's fear of AIDS . The Thing is a movie that
looks at isolation and paranoia. Bite is just a movie about a girl
being bitten by an insect and turning into an insect herself. You could
argue it represents her insecurities but I just don't by it. So check
this one out, if Body Horror gets your gory juices flowing and I give
Bite....
