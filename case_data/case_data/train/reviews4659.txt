Fantastic Movie & Documentary

This is possibly one of the best documentaries/stories I have seen yet
on the Benghazi incident it is absolutely stunning and depicts a true
story.It is a bit long but it just the right length for a movie of this kind.
I can't say too much bad about it and don't want to spoil it for those
who want to see it. I will highly recommend the movie to those wanting
see a good war movie about the Benghazi incident and those wanting to
see what happened . Go see it! You won't regret it. I think the
character development is pretty good, and the story is well developed.
The producer does a good job on pretty much on all aspects on the movie
and some parts of the movie are gut-wrenching and riveting.
