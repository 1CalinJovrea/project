Late to the party with nothing new

**Contains Spoilers & Gripes!** I saw the trailer for The Visit and was
hooked instantly - it really looked great, had fantastic atmosphere and
suspense. Unfortunately it was one of those cases where the guy who
edited the trailer should have made the movie as the bar had been set
much higher than the finished product came near to delivering.Firstly this movie is (yet another) "found footage" film, a sub-genre
which has arguably overstayed its welcome and I started getting itchy
feet within the first few opening scenes. Secondly (based on the
trailer)I thought I was in for a supernatural thriller but it's not.
That's not to say it's without its moments of suspense and laughs on
our trip to Grandma's house but sometimes these laughs feel almost
unintentional. Speaking of unintentional, The dialogue of the two young
protagonists is clearly the words of a 45 year old man trying to write
for what he remembers young teenagers speaking like 20 years ago (and
the camera-work for young teenagers with cheap hand-held cameras is
almost Hollywood-like cinematography).Overall a film that's oddly less than the sum of its parts and a clear
missed opportunity. It'll be a long time before I get suckered again to
see another M Night Shyamalan film.
