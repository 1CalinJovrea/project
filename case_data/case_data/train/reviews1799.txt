no where near as good as i was hoping

The first thing to say about this film is its at least 30 minutes too
long. Why almost everyone now has to stretch films out to running times
that do not warrant the story is beyond me. It is a simple and true
tale of a man battling great odds, which i think could have been told
in a better way. We never get to see how is family are coping with the
situation, this would have given the film its much needed emotional
kick. The thing the carries the film is Tom Hanks' obvious charisma,
but even with that half way through it starts to become tedious, the
lifeboat section seemed to go on and on, there was too much repetition
and no movement forward just so that the film makers could get the film
to over two hours. It also has a terrible ending with the Captain being
shouted at by a nurse with one of the worst voices i have come across,
she just does not shut up, this was supposed to be therapeutic but was
very grating.
