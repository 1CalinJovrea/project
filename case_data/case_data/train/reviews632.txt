Maleficent? More like Magnificent!

IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going
in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a
somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in
the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers
an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one-
dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also
managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three
coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing
sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent
of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as "Hellboy 2" and
"Pan's Labyrinth". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw
you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you
wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your
imagination.Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling,
the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores
the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she
encounters.The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring
the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is
trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and
white, good or evil, etc.I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover
I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with
kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the
film but I won't discuss those here.
