An inspiring and heartfelt story

My favourite film so far this year : Sally Hawkins is mesmerising as
Maudie and gives a performance,which is truly Academy Award worthy.
Ethan Hawke is equally good as her crusty damaged husband Everett. He
describes their relationship as " two odd socks "and they fit perfectly
together with quite a few holes. If you get a chance this is a not to
be missed movie it's like a Mahler symphony and is quite inspirational.
So grateful we have Mt Vic Flix in the mountains if it wasn't for their
existence we wouldn't see quality cinema. You don't need a mega budget
or Hollywood for that matter to produce a gem of a movie.
