I've never like Lars Von Trier's films, but this one looked promising.

But, this is a two part movie, each of which were around 1:50 minutes
each. I could barely sit through the first half, I had to stop 2
minutes into Volume II. I love the way his films are shot, they look
amazing. But watching 2 hours of a movie, with a plot that basically
doesn't exist in my eyes. Just a lot of sex scenes and talking. If you
want to watch this to see the nudity and/or sex scenes, it's really not
worth it. I have no idea why people think Lars is such a good
filmmaker. This movie was a complete waste of time. The only redeeming
factor is that he pushes the envelope by putting scenes of sex scenes
that are not simulated. You're better off watching some free porn on
the internet. Don't waste your time with this garbage.
