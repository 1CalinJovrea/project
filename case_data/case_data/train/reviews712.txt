The film loosely combines 'The Monkey's Paw" and "Mean Girls" to create
a teen horror/drama. Clare (Joey King) is a plain teen girl bullied at
school by the popular girl (Josephine Langford). Her dad practices the
age old honored profession of mudlarking in local dumpsters. Here he
discovers an old Chinese music box which he gives to his daughter. She
makes wishes on the box which grants them to her, but at a price, which
for the first half of the film seems coincidental.The ability to wish your problems away and be popular with the
boyfriend of your choosing is every teen girl's dream, and I would
imagine this production will be greatly appreciated by that audience,
more so than a non-teen male, like myself. I didn't feel the intensity.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.
