family ties

I heard that adam sandler "doesn't suck". and it's true. he is actually
pretty good. as is ben stiller. two actors I am not that crazy about.
with the addition of Elizabeth marvel (very good) the three are half
siblings contending with dustin Hoffman, an inadequate father, to say
the least. he's been married four times. his current wife is emma
thompson, sadly miscast, in a non existent role. so it's very ny. a
bunch of vignettes, really, telling everyone's back story. no episode
lasts that long, so just when you are getting bored or tired, a new
tale starts. no new territory covered, but it's an enjoyable time.
