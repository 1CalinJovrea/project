tgchan says NO / tgchan.pl

6.7 /10 from 138,754 users. I would say it is a decent rating for
something that is almost like a mini-serial. There have been so many
parts I can barely remember what it is all about. Let's see if it will
be of any joy.7 minutes - it starts like a TV-series not a film. I doubt anyone would
watch it without previously seeing the first part, but it starts right
from the moment where it left off 24 minutes - oh now I remember. This is the film about how propaganda
works and how easy is to manipulate masses 1h 14 minutes - there is nothing to complain about really. It feels
like any other film from the series, just decent 1h 31 minutes - I do not know if the film intends to insult my
intelligence or just the director is missing some of it 1h 45 minutes - and it started to intrigue me a little bit Meh... the ending was nice, the series and this one in particular not
so much.tgchan's rating: 5 /10
