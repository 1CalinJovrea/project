Seriously?

What's up with all the rave reviews?Look, it's not the worst movie ever made, but it's one of the most
pointless. The first was a force of nature that gripped you from the
beginning and took you on an adventure in a world foreign to most of
us. And it was hilarious, filled with unforgettable scenes and belly
laughs. This sequel is a nostalgic, where are they know, look back at
the main characters from the original.It starts out choppy, never picks up a real driving force, and kind of
meanders around until it finds a way to end. Begbie is supposed to be
the villain that makes this thing move, but the rest of the crew aren't
stupid kids anymore, and the fear he instills in the other characters
just doesn't seem genuine. The Veronika character seems so forced.
There's no groundwork laid to set up her relationship with Sick Boy or
Renton. Her character is just too wise and put together to be a hooker
hanging out with this sad lot of old junkies.Trainspotting had a compelling dynamic based on doomed friendships of
young junkies, and the attempt to escape the impending doom by the
protagonist. There was a force driving the movie from start to end. And
there were non-stop laughs along the way mixed in with junkie
philosophy and trippy drug-fueled scenes. That's all missing in this
sad sequel, which walks in the footsteps of its predecessor,
half-heartedly mimicking it. I wish I had just watched the first one
again instead.
