A prequel we never asked for

I cant say that i had that much expectations from this movie, let alone
hoped for a good story. If you thought the remake from 2013 (Texas
Chainsaw) was dull and cringe, this one no is difference. For more than half of the movie, I questioned myself why is called
Leatherface, the action never calling for the well known killer nor his
reputation. If you had no knowledge of him, one would assume is just
another movie about a mentally ill killer, scaring off some teenagers
and hunting them down. The acting is not bad but could be a lot better, the plot is probably
the biggest downside of this prequel, having too many stupid scenes.
Not that many references to Leatherface at all, apart from the
beginning and the ending. A foreseable ending was also a big downside,
which made me to set a 6 out of 10 just as a pityful note because I
like the TCM as a series.Only watch this if you have time to spare on a rainy day.
