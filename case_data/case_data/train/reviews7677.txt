Has James franco ever been funny?

The jokes are sadly cringe worthy,and unfunny. I feel the whole script
is underdeveloped.There is so much fun you can have with the whole My
parents don't like my boyfriend. Instead they go for the easy, overly
used up stuff instead. I also feel very little chemistry between the
actors but, that maybe just the way they're suppose to act.James Franco haven't got what it takes to be funny. Even in Freaks and
geeks he was this brooding guy.The funniest moments in the movie is,the dad arguing, with the in house
computer system.Actually the in-house computer system should have a
lead instead of the rest of the cast
