A ton of stupid fun

I seriously enjoyed this film-- it had more gore than Mel Gibson could
shake a fist at, some very cute actors, and didn't waste time with
excessive back-story and details, and gave me many good laughs.Its not an intellectually stimulating movie... duh. Its made to a
hilariously entertaining popcorn flick with over-the-top action and
unrealistic weapons that wouldn't have existed given the 'time period'
this movie seems to be set in. So you folks out there giving it bad rap
for not meeting your standards, calm down. Its clearly not trying to.
:).This movie's violence reminded me of the Expendables-- but this film
never takes itself too seriously like the other film does... I found
this much more fun to watch.
