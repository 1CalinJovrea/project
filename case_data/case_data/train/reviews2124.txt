There Is Nothing Like A Dane

We didn't get too much Danish history at my school nor, I suspect, at
most schools in England, so I came to this film more or less ignorant
of the facts yet happy to accept that it was based on historical fact.
At the beginning there are some stunning visuals that lull the viewer
into a pleasant mood but we are soon disabused of the notion that this
is yet another chocolate box potted history. After the briefest of
sojourns in England we are whisked - along with Caroline, wed to a man
she has yet to meet - to a Denmark where the politico/religio axis has
the country in a headlock but we are smack dab in the centre of the Age
of Enlightenment and things are about to change and then change again.
The King - a beautifully judged performance by Mikkel Boe Folsgaard -
is little more than an overgrown child with minimal interest in his
bride - another fine performance by Alicia Vikander - and the catalyst
in the woodpile is not the young Negro boy he treats as a pet so much
as the German physician (Mads Mikkelson), a devotee of Rousseau who
quickly gains the King's ear and the Queen's bed with the result that
soon all three unite in a non-sexual menage a trois and push through
several important reforms. It does, of course, end in tears but it also
keeps us riveted for some two and a quarter hours. A fine effort.
