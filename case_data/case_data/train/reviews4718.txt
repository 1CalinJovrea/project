Decent Action Movie for mindless fun

What makes this movie stand out from other heist movies is also its
weakness: the perspective. I admire the ambition of shooting from just the car (very briefly does
it ever leave the car and follow a person), but the first act is pretty
boring because of it. It's mainly phone calls and cursing.It picks up after awhile and starts to get heavy near the end, but I
can definitely see some people just turning it off by then.If you stay until the end, it's a decent sit-on-your-couch mindless
fun.
