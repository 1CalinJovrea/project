Entertaining

Grettings from Lithuania."Hercules" (2014) is entertaining pop corn flick from start till
finish. Turn your brain off and enjoy it. It has cool action, bigger
than life Dwayne Johnson as Hercules and good supporting stuff. I was
laughing each time regarding running gag about Ian McShane death -
funny stuff. This flick is miles better than bad movie that came out
also this year "The Legend of Hercules", skip this one and watch
"Hercules" instead - it's not the best summer movie of this year, but
it's worth spending 90 min. on evening with some friends and beer.Overall, "Hercules" isn't great art, it's not even very memorable
popcorn flick, but it does it job well for while it last, it entertains
you - not in the most sophisticated way to the least, but it's a fun
movie.
