Nice story about the impostor Keane

When it's a biography I am always more interested because of the fact
that there is non fiction involved. And the story of Margaret Keane and
her husband the plagiarist Walter Keane is certainly worth making a
movie out of it. It's not the typical movie Tim Burton normally makes
but I certainly did enjoy it a lot. The sympathy you have for Walter
Keane (played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz) quickly turns into deep
hate for his person. Well done with the acting. Margaret Keane (played
by Amy Adams) is an abused woman you feel sorry for all the time. You
wish she would stand up against all the injustice and when she finally
does you really hope she will win. If you like true stories with a bit
of drama then you will enjoy this movie. Well, I for sure did.
