So, so funny (but very bloody)

It took a while for me to get my bearings on this filmvery deadpan (in
keeping with the mock-umentary format) and very gory, which is an odd
combobut once I stopped expecting one long episode of Flight of the
Conchords (although it definitely is reminiscent, and has some great
cross-over), it killed me. Definitely a movie that gets funnier and
funnier the more times you watch it. Just brilliant and witty and sweet
and silly. But, you know, with vampires. With New Zealand accents.
Another plus, this movie is shortabout an hour and a half, I think.
With the norm moving towards 3+ hours, it was a delight to not spend
the entire evening in the theater. Again, there are some really bloody
bits, so I might not suggest it as a first-date movie, depending on the
date, but it's one of my favorite films from this year.
