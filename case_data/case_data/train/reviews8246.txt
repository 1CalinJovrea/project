A little disjointed but still very good

I do find myself agreeing with some of the comments about this being
disjointed.It feels like there should be more story; in particular Arnie's family,
who are basically relegated to a few shots and the torture scene. Without that build up the audience can't connect. It feels like there's
a good 15 to 20 minutes missing. I hope we get to see the directors cut
as I have really enjoyed David Ayers transition from fantastic writer
to a great directorDespite being disjointed it's still a very good movie. Lots of
trademark Ayer shots, the flick between hand-held and first person
shooter pov's. The dialogue is good, not the best that ayer's done but
still a cut above. Arnie as usual is awesome and Sam worthington is just plain nuts in
this (in a good way). The violence does leave you cold - the opposite
of what it did in End of Watch. There just wasn't that sense of danger
and foreboding that existed in End of Watch.Anyway, I enjoyed it and look forward to Ayers next film.
