Not the real story

Walt Disney was nothing like the man Tom Hanks portrays in this movie.Disney was an American icon, whose studio and theme parks have played
significant roles in American pop culture. However, Disney was an
enigmatic man unlike anything shown in this movie. Disney was far from
the beloved, grandfatherly executive Hanks plays on screen. In fact,
Disney was known to be a difficult and sometimes unpleasant man who
paid low wages and worked his animators to exhaustion. In short, life
in the Disney creative offices was not the great big party depicted in
Saving Mr. Banks.I understand it's a family movie, and clearly most people have enjoyed
the show. But I have trouble getting on board something that plays very
loose with how things really went down.
