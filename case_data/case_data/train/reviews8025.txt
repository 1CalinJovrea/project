Simply Awful

Not sure what film others, who actually voted this as a good film, were
watching. It must have been something totally different to what I saw
because I think it must be the worst film I have ever seen and in the
56 years of my being on this planet I have seen a lot of movies. Apart
from being a Commercial for Google from the first minute, there were
not a single good gag in there and it was at times embarrassing to
watch. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are good actors and one has to
wonder how much Google paid such usually good actors to appear in a C
movie like that. If I would not have been accompanied by my wife, I
think I would have left after 20 minutes.
