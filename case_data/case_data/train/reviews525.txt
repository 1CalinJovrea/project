Well... That stunk

I am not a die hard movie buff. I enjoy watching several different
genres and have several favorite actors. But I would not say that I am
a opening night have to see it kinda guy. Saying that I was excited
that GI Joe was coming out with the second movie. I understood that
many people didn't like the first one. I did not only because of the
story line but also because of the special effects. (SPOILER) But
killing off a top name actor in the first act is pretty much crap. Not
only did you kill him off in the first act I didn't feel anything from
the other Joe's. besides "Johnson's" little scene of him taking the dog
tag. So you killed off a great actor and "Duke" one of the larger names
associated with the toys and cartoon in the first act and never brought
him back later in the story line or made his death mean anything...
SPOILER) I tell you what if you want anybody to see the next film,"if
there even is one" send me a ticket. I won't be buying one at the
theaters.
