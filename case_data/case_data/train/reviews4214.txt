I liked it!

In my opinion it's not even half as bad as people say it is. The movie
is first of all entertaining which is one of the reasons why you would
watch it? But also it is well made. The plot is very good and as far as
i know original. The way it was filmed was great, any other way
wouldn't be the same. I thought the director of this movie was great
before and my opinion def didn't change after seeing this one. The
acting was good. It says that it's a comedy/horror, you cant really
expect to get scared in it like some people complain about. I wouldn't
recommend it to a friend but it's worth the watch if you have spare
time and don't know what to do with it.
