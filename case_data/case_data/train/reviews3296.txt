If your open minded give it a try

I am surprised by the amount of negative criticism about this film as I
found it mesmerising and intriguing. If your expecting some Hollywood
movie about a sexy alien killing lots of dull characters in a gory and
sensationalised way (with lots of explosions thrown in), then you will
be disappointed. The pace is slow however I felt that this contributed
to the whole feel and atmosphere. I liked the use of Scotland as a
setting especially the way it contrasted the natural beauty of Scotland
with some of the urban ugliness that exists. I also liked the way
Scarlett Johansson played the main role - cool, sexy and almost
emotionless. I am glad I didn't watch this at the cinema as watching it
at home meant I could discuss the film during the many periods of calm.
There were a few arty scenes in the film but I did not feel these were
pretentious or contrived, again they added to the feel of the film. The
ending was a little disappointing in my opinion but I still feel this
film is classy, original and will make most people think!
