Bizarre, Wild and Fantastic

The story is about Jake who stumbles upon an orphanage where there are
beings with extraordinary gifts. He meets Miss Peregrine, who invites
him to be a part of the family. Burton delivers a breathtaking movie,
with gorgeous visuals. As he brings a fairy tale to the silver screen.
At the end, I found myself unable to stand, As "Miss Peregrine's Home
for Peculiar Children" tuggs on all the right strings and plays a
nearly perfect symphony. What stands out in this particular orchestra
is the soundtrack, As it breaths life into the story. As for the acting, Eva Green is perfectly cast as she plays an
estranged and peculiar mother figure. This is a Burton classic, if you
aren't a fan of his style, it's best to steer clear. The story is based
on the novel Ransom Riggs published in 2011. With Jane Goldman's
polishing touch, Burton crafts a mesmerizing adventure.
