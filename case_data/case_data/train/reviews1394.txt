This Is The McDonalds Of Movies

Awful.darned.awful.Working on this film or appearing in it is the movie business
equivalent of having McJob. It is low quality, bad for you, bottom of
the barrel and you will regret it afterwards.When did it become fashionable for men to have the brains of an algae,
for the women to be gross and severely unattractive and for us to pay
to watch it all? At least this film proves that it is best to read
reviews before watching films even if the film has an attractive
pedigree. reboots, sequels, aaarrrghhh
