Beautifully humane film that at times recalls Italian Neo-Realism, at
other times the child-based films that are so popular in Iran. That it
was made in the USA, with a real if humble budget, seems surprising and
is a testament to the commitment of the filmmakers. Subtly going back and forth between the perspectives of the child and
adult characters, the film has, at times, an almost magical realist
vibe, though nothing remotely supernatural or surreal transpires.
Indeed, this is a film steeped in harsh reality, but also one that
captures the almost mystical sense of discovering life on the part of
the children and sometimes, momentarily at least, even the adults. On the other hand, the film also offers a very visceral sense of the
stress of trying to survive amidst the scarcity of the margins of
American capitalism. The acting is incredible, all the more so given that, with the very
notable exception of Willem Dafoe, the performers are all either non-
actors or unknowns.
