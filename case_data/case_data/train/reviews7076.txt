Mind=Blown

This movie is hands down one of the Greatest Sci-fi films of the
century. The acting was great, the plot was amazing, and it kept
everyone on the edge of their seats. This plot has so many twists and
turns it leaves the audience scratching their heads. I have watched a
SH!T TON of movies in my life time and this is by-far the greatest. it
kept me up all night trying to think of how this movie even happened.
If i were to explain this movie in one sentence it would be - "DON'T
BLINK, YOU'LL MISS THE BEST PART". If you have not yet watched this
movie you absolutely NEED to! I rated a 10/10 because i think cant
think of a reason not to(because my mind exploded several times
throughout the movie).
