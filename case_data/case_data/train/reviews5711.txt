Good Old Fashioned Horror

No spoilers in this review but having come away from watching this
film, on my own at the local Empire Cinema on Friday 13th I would say
this is a good horror film for those who are bored senseless by the
endless tide of "jump scare but not scary really" horror films we have
to endure these days.This is a proper story with a proper start, middle and end.At times unsettling, at times creepy, at times a bit distressing whilst
always being restrained (its not an utter gore fest and the violence is
all the more affecting for that) this is a decent film elevated by good
characterisation and very good acting.Whilst nothing utterly original is on offer here, it is a film that
does what it says on the tin and it is all done well. Special mention
to Rafe Spall who, just like his dad, Timothy, continues to be
brilliant in everything he's in.Solid 7/10 and one for fans of proper horror. It deserves to be seen at
the cinema as well so I'd urge people to get to watch this.
