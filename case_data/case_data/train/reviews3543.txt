Don't watch if you read the book...

kind of SPOILER... It doesn't matter casting, direction, location,
production, acting and anything if the best part of the book, the
GLORIOUS AND GREAT FINALE that made Dan Brown a genius was changed to
the most common, stupid ending of a silly Hollywood mystery/thriller
movie. It's like if in 'The Empire strikes back', Darth Vader answered:
"yes, I killed your father..." or in 'Seven', Kevin Spacey is caught by
Brad Pitt just in time to save his wife. What the hell were the
producers thinking? They had the chance to make one of the best movies
in 2016 and just wasted it. Too much shame on Ron Howard for being such
a poor director and for Dan Brown for allowing it.
