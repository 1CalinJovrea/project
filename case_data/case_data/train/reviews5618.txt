Cardellini saves a weak Will Ferrell outing

Will Ferrell is so associated with his roles in 'Elf' and 'Anchorman'
that I often find it difficult to see him play other parts.However, this is the sort of comedy that he could make in his sleep and
to be fair does a good job in his role.It's a one joke comedy really, with lots of irrational things happening
to stretch things out. I found it odd that the DVD box touts it as
being a 'family comedy' when some of the jokes are inappropriate.Ferrell and Wahlberg have good chemistry, and this is clear throughout,
though the saving grace is Linda Cardellini, who I wish would make more
films.This is an average comedy that will mainly appeal to those who follow
Ferrell's work.
