don't waste your $$

The short version: Gravity is a real stinker ... what's all the hype?
Clichéd, BORING,technically lame, not worth 3-D, and beyond Bullock's
abilities ... Don't waste your $$.The longer version: WHY is this movie receiving so much hype? What a
LOSER! Not only is it BORING, but dishonors the brave men and women who
are REAL astronauts. Sorry, Neil Armstrong ... not even a BABY STEP for
mankind in this stinker.Every possible cliché is at work here: the damsel in distress, the
"strip" of the damsel, the depression of the damsel, the refusal of the
damsel to obey orders, the damsel repeatedly wailing "what do I do
nowwwwww?", etc. How this lame-o "brilliant medical engineer" EVER
qualified to be an astronaut is not explained (must be due to all the
budget cut-backs). Similarly, the other "astronaut," George Clooney, a know-it-all wise
guy, suicidally releases himself into deep space early on for no good
reason ... so we're stuck with Ms. Lame-o and weak special effects for
most of the movie ...Said damsel is the flyweight actress Sandra Bullock -- whining,
preceding every other line with a snurfff (Best Boy! get that woman
some Benadryl!), and heavy breathing sum up her portrayal. You wouldn't
want HER along as a member of the team, well, anywhere ... even Disney
World ... WhyEVER would George Clooney lend his name to such bunkum?Don't waste your money ... and the 3-D ... laughable -- not EVEN worth
it ...
