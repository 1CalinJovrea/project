Excellent movie

I watched this movie tonight because of the great reviews I'd seen, so
I thought I would give it a watch. I was not disappointed. This was an
excellent film. To briefly and vaguely summarize, these kids in a band
get a gig and accidentally get themselves in a situation they have no
idea how to handle.I have seen this movie called horror, which I suppose it is, but not in
the context of what is normally considered horror. If you are looking
for slasher/ghost story/monster type of horror, this is not that type.
It's horror in a more real life situation context. I don't want to give
anything away. If you are like me, I like to know the least amount of
information as possible because I like the element of surprise. Let's
just say that there is blood, gore and an excellent story to go along
with it. It is very well written, directed, acted, and it was
refreshingly original. It kept me on the edge of my seat and it was a
bit scary at times. I highly recommend this movie. It is currently
streaming on Amazon (if you have Prime, there is no addt'l charge to
watch). Take some time and please watch this movie. If you like tension
and terror with blood and gore, you will not be disappointed.
