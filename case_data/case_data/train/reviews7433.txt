A double-bill of THE BEGUILED 1971 and 2017

A double-bill of THE BEGUILED, Thomas Cullinan's source novel is a
civil-war drama positing a tantalizing scenario where a wounded union
soldier fetches up in a southern all-girls' school, nurtured to
recovery by the apparently good-willed women but also subjected to
temptations from female gazes and one false move, he will go through
purgatory of his sorry life. The 1971 version is directed by Don Siegel, the third of his five
collaborations with Clint Eastwood, who plays the Yankee Corporal John
McBurney, and is discovered by a 12-year-old Amy (Ferdin, an absorbing
talent), to whom he indulges with a peck on her lips, a blatant way to
take away a child's first kiss (also pretty provocative by today's
regressive yardstick), instantly, what Siegel hammers home to viewers
is that he is not a humdinger, and through glimpses of fleeting
flashback interleaved into the narrative, John emerges as a congenital
liar, flippant and manipulative, currying favor from his petticoat
accompany to slough from a possible fall of incarceration, whether it
is Miss Marsha (Page), the headmistress of the seminary school, Edwina
(Hartman), the virginal teacher to whom he claims his attraction, a
nubile 17-year-old student Carol (Ann Harris), who is sexually active,
even the slave Hallie (Mercer, a defiant soul hampered by her
identity), cannot evade his come-ons. The advent of a hot-blooded albeit bedridden male inevitably causes an
erotic disruption among the exclusive distaff clique, whose members are
circumspectly secluded from the battlefield merely outside their
perimeter and sexually repressed, for pert, callow girls, they are
inclined to project John as a perfect specimen of their untested sexual
allure versus the opposite sex, in the cases of Edwina and Carol, one
is the prudish committed type and the other is a wanton nymphet. But
the most complex character amongst them is no doubt Miss Marsha, whose
incest past and subliminal lesbian proclivity get a full treatment in
the audacious script and visual presentation, the latter is even
coalesced with a flagrant religious connotation to soup up the film's
maverick idiom. When the crunches arrives, a man's conceit in his
potency is punished by blunt castration and signifies a rude awakening
of the priapic worship. On top of his virile stallion credence, Clint Eastwood imbues a
cunning, almost overweening facade which audience isn't familiar with,
not cut from the same cloth from his hard-boiled tough-guy legend.
Geraldine Page, emboldened by her matriarchal gravitas and demanding
onus, doesn't shy away from any extraneous intrusion (the Union and the
Confederacy alike) and builds a palpably beguiling tension through the
mind games she plays with Eastwood yet holds the rein from stem to
stern in unyielding resolution of taking the escalating situation in
her own hands. Elizabeth Hartman, the fragile Oscar-nominated actress
whose premature demise was a harrowing tragedy ripe for cinematic
transposition, brings about something equally tangible and visceral as
she is bedeviled by the discord between a man's promise and his action,
but still holds out the last remaining benevolence out of her own
impressionable nature. Crowned BEST DIRECTOR in Cannes, Sofia Coppola's remake is an
aesthetically beguiling psychological intrigue, superbly recreates a
mystical Gothic quaintness in the closing days of the civil war
entrapped within the terrain of a majestic mansion of the antebellum
south, which certainly is a scintillating upgrade from the 1971
version's sepia retro flair. But story-wise, Sofia's script not only eviscerates the role of Hallie
(which is a double-edged sword since she claims that out of the respect
of this sensitive issue, she doesn't want to tread lightly, but also
can be easily accused of racially insensitive), but also leaves no
allusions of all the taboo issues tackled in Siegel's movie, lesbian
kiss, incest depravity and of course, that inappropriate kiss between a
grown-up man and a teenage girl, are outright sanitized, and in fact,
the whole story has been strenuously internalized, for instance, John's
transgression, where is given a plausible justification in Siegel's
film, is carried out in a slipshod manner, indicating that it is
nothing less than a spur of horniness. Atmospherical over dramatic, it is beyond reproach that Coppola opts to
tell the allegory with her own agent, but unfortunately, the resultant
impact doesn't meet up with expectation, especially when juxtaposed
with its far more entrancing antecedent. Nicole Kidman intrepidly takes
the mantle from Ms. Page, and actualizes an extremely sensual
sponge-washing scene with Colin Farrell's less forthcoming and more
sympathetic portrayal of a soldier turns paraplegic when he is
subjected to an ambiguous retribution out of the necessity of saving
his life. Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning don't make a splash in the
shoes of Hartman and Ann Harris respectively, save Oona Laurence, whose
Amy, precisely captures a child's malleable mentality.So, the jury is out, the remake is humbled by the original, which is
quite a shocker because on the paper, Coppola's feminine sensitivity
seems to be more adept to parse this age-old gender axe battle than an
action-inclined Mr. Siegel, again there is no sure thing in the film
industry, and that is exactly why it keeps us intrigued every time.
