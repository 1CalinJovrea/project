Waste of time

I watched this film for two hours. Two whole hours that are gone.
Forever. The film takes place in Miami. It's about a young black boy
who grows up gay in a tough neighborhood. That's it. Lots of sitting on
the beach. Lots of talking that doesn't go ANYWHERE. Overall, the film
followed a tired format that paints a pretty bland and shallow picture
about life in the "hood." Stereotypical characterization of black
women. I honestly couldn't tell you the point of this film or write a
more a more comprehensive summary because it's a waste of time.Why is this up for an award? With the exception of Ali--who is a really
good actor whose talent is wasted in this film--I don't get it.
