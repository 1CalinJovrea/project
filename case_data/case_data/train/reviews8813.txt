Discards so many details, The best part of the book was missing

The movie was good but not good enough as the book was, if you read the
book you can imagine a better movie, when the movie started i tried to
concentrate on small details which were missing but that was changed
when Langdon and sienna have been separated until that point the movie
was quite similar to the core concept of the book except that Langdon
were able to solve the mystery easily and too fast.. after that point
the movie took different direction than Dan brown him self the killing
at the end of movie was ejection from Ron Howard in the book they couldn't contend the virus and they were late six days
they get there in the last day where the virus became widespread and
they couldn't do any thing. sienna was trying to help and she didn't
kill any body at the end also she told Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey what is
the virus the message of the book wasn't delivered enoughthe bad part is that maybe some audiences didn't understand the essence
of the virus
