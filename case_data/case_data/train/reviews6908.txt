A waste of time even for light entertainment

Soapy cheese fest that don't cohere. Could well have been the script of
an 80s music videoclip. Despite the decent enough production value, it
can in fact be described as 90 odd minutes of two nice-looking people
who fall in love trying (in vain, as far as sound story-telling goes)
to find cosmic significance in their feelings. They do so through a
mary-go-round story that uses all the trappings of the "stuck in a
moment in time" motif without any of the logical puzzles, metaphysical
ponderings, or even plain suspense that a situation like that may
create. Love proper may reverberate down the ages, but this love
affair's photons get trapped in the movie's scripting black hole and
never make it out. Utterly forgettable.5 points to production value but nothing more than this.
