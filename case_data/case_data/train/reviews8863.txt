Outstanding

I must strongly disagree with those who say this is a dysfunctional
family film with nothing new. On the contrary, there are elements of
dysfunction I've never seen addressed before in a film, and they were
handled exceptionally well and were catharsis-promoting for those of us
who have experienced this particular kind of dysfunction. Those who
have said the film is difficult to watch have certainly never
experienced the same kind of dysfunction.For myself, I found the film very satisfying and am grateful to have my
story out there with such understanding. A truly great film - the
writing, the editing, the acting. Perfection.
