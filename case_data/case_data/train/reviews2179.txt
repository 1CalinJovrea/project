Modern Cinema Masterpiece!

I never believed that filth would be anything more than a stupid
controversial dark comedy.My friends were begging me to see this and i
gave it a chance and let me tell you , I WAS DEAD WRONG.This movie
really surprised me , the acting was master class especially from James
McAvoy , the directing was revolutionary and some times it was similar
to movies like snatch , trainspotting and two smoking barrels.But the
storyline was the greatest surprise of all.You follow Bruce Robertson
in his emotional and physical journey to the inspector promotion to win
his wife and daughter back.And for a known plot , this movie outdoes it
self.Let me tell you that you wont be able even to try to guess what
will happen in this movie and i wont say anything cause i don't wont to
spoil anything.Also the soundtrack was freaking Brilliant.The
supporting cast was also well developed with great performances from
Eddie marsan(so underrated actor) Jamie bell and Jim broadbent.This
must be the most underrated movie of the recent 15 years.This movie is
a MUST SEE for every cinema fan.Not only underrated BUT COMPLETELY
MISUNDERSTOOD.
