Les Miserables is miserable

When so many people love this movie I get to thinking why am I so off
track with my feelings about this musical. Maybe I just don't get it,
maybe it's because I wasn't that familiar with the Broadway production,
maybe it's because I went to this movie to be entertained....big
mistake. Now don't get me wrong, the production sets, acting, costumes,
and big screen epic stature are all there, but what was missing was the
emotional story and connection to the audience. I guess I knew this
wasn't for me about 10 minutes into this seemingly long slow moving
movie when I found I was already wondering how long until it would be
over. Now I'll admit the only song I really knew going into this movie
was " I dreamed a dream" however, the endless non melodic off key
vocalization by the entire cast with the exception of Anne Hathaway in
my humble opinion simply ruined any chance this production would work
for me and those movie goers who were seeking a memorable story put to
music. I like the 1998 movie production staring Liam Neesom so much
more than this miserable attempt. Simply put this movie was a huge
disappointment, no in truth it STUNK...sorry but I call them as I see
them.
