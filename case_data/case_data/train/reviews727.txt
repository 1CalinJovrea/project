This is very bad!

Will Ferrell is a good actor, he has his own specific original comic
charm. But nothing of that can save this film from the disaster. It's
so bad that probably you'll leave the cinema hating all those who made
the film and there are real chances that you'll never want to see Will
Ferrell again, in another movie, with this one he lost a lot of his
audience. Amy Poehler probably thinks she's funny, but she's just the
opposite, she's just annoying. All the other actors, including Jason
Mantzoukas, Ryan Simpkins, Nick Kroll, Allison Tolman, Rob Huebel, are
really frustrating. These people don't know at all what entertainment
means! Ridiculous!
