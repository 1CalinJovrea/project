A very enjoyable tale of life and love

Sometimes a flawed and somewhat predictable movie can be enjoyed by the
watcher due to its charm and inoffensive manner, Richard Curtis's time
traveling love story About Time is one of those films, a film that
provides enough laughs and heartfelt moments that only Scrooge himself
could not find enjoyment in this tale.Brendan Gleeson's very own Domhnall Gleeson gets his first big leading
role here as our lovable ginger time traveling lawyer Tim and he does a
fine job at being a lovable red haired version of Hugh Grant. Gleeson's
chemistry with season rom-com veteran Rachel McAdams is made believable
also with her slightly underused talents coming to the fore in most of
their scenes and the eventual on screen romance plays out in a
believable manner despite all the time traveling business occurring
throughout. While this love story is a major part of About Time, Curtis
has also positioned the film to be more than a man meets girl tale with
a twist, and with this choice has made a film all the better for it.Playing Tim's Dad is veteran British actor Bill Nighy, who with Gleeson
gives the film another side that usual rom-coms would be hard pressed
to have. It's within this relationship between time traveling father
and son that the movie finds many relatable and confronting issues to
deal with and by films end the audience's emotional investment has been
well and truly earned thanks to it. In concerns to Curtis as a
director, it's also a departure for the man who has not shown this side
of himself as a director before but that's not to say the film lacks a
few well-earned laughs and Curtis usual array of colorful supporting
characters, which is evidenced in Tom Hollander's playwright Harry.Coming in at roughly 2 hours About Time covers a lot of ground and in
doing so it would be fair to say that the films first half pales in
comparison to its much more concise and impactful second half, but as a
whole it all comes together in such a way that it's hard to fully
criticize. Watched with the right mindset About Time is the perfect
movie for a night in and stepping stone for lead Gleeson to find his
feet in the world of big budget tent pole movies.3 and a half clenched fists out of 5
