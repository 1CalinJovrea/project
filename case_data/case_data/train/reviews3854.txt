another pathetic movie of Ridiculous Scott

because I care about the future, I looked forward to this movie. But
while i watched it, it was a struggle to make it to the end. I'm very
disappointed. Easily i blame the director, but there is a bigger
production team who failed. They created a film of shallow, lame,
cliché stereotypes with bad developed characters.It's all about the hero. It's not about "Matt Damon in his best role".
When he's suppose to be funny, it's the worst. Jessica Chastain was
brilliant in Interstellar, so now she lights up another successful
chapter of imaginary human spaceflight ? Sorry, I much more think of a
massive loss of image.If you wish to make future NASA look smart, cute and sexy, do not pick
Jeff Daniels as it's director ! Every time 'Teddy' shows up, I expected
Jim Carrey dancing to the disco sound. It wasn't even funny once to
blame Lewis for her taste of music, and it wasn't funny to blame her
again and again. Please, Mister Scott, if you grab one more time into the box of
stereotypes and transform actors like Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff
Daniels Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain and Michael Peña into fools:
retire ! Thank you.P. S. Hold on, you didn't fail on Mackenzie Davis, she made NASA look
cute.
