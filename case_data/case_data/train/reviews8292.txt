Enjoyable romantic movie

My initial interest in the movie wasn't very high from the previews but
the offer of a free screening lead me to study the preview a little
more. I decided to order the free tickets if they were still available
in my area. I was blessed to get 2 tickets. I was pleasantly surprised
with the film throughout and my friend enjoyed it also. I liked it so
well that I plan to buy the bluray when it comes out. I like to collect
nice romances for future reviewing. I initially thought a few
characters didn't look much like their parents but as the movie played
out it was not a problem for me. Their acting was so good I could over
look that. Blake Lively did an excellent acting job in the movie. I was
impressed with Harrison Ford's acting in the movie. In summary I
enjoyed the movie very much. I enjoyed the clean crisp time period
photography. I would consider this a good date movie.
