Well done and Witty

What we do in the shadows was a witty and entertaining movie that
covered a large amount of ground, and was filled with plenty of
genuinely funny humor. Being some what of a fan of the directors prior
movie "eagle vs shark," i found "What we do in the shadows" to be
significantly better, all the while keeping the dry sense of humor and
laid back style of storytelling.This movie was well shot, and did not seem overly cheap in production
value. The satire found throughout was well executed, and it felt that
no stone was left unturned in its analysis of the vampire mythos.Being a mockumentary, everything was done right and explained, and a
feeling of realism emanated as the movie progressed. A degree of true
horror aspect was held throughout the main backdrop making the humorous
aspects all the more enjoyable.Exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend giving this one a
watch for any fans of mockumentary films, vampire/horror movies and
comedies.8/10
