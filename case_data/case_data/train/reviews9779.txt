8
A Very Good throwback to 80s horror.

Plot: A boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a
Christmas demon to his family home.This was a fun movie to watch, the kind of film I've been wanting to
see done with much love and respect to the fans of the genre. Each of
the cast does a good job portraying their characters even if the
characters are not the friendliest people in the world. The practical
effects are terrific and are a huge relief from all the CGI these days.
Even though I don't hate CGI, a lot of filmmakers tend to overuse it
these days. This film only used CGI when necessary which is something
that most filmmakers should learn.I only have 2 problems hence why I gave this an 8 and that is the
ending is kind of weak and not every joke worked for me, but that's it.
This film is a really good throwback to the 80s with a really good
cast, script, story and great practical effects. Please go see this,
these type of films need to be made nowadays, not reboots of movies and
TV shows.
