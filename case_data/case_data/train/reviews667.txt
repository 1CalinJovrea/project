A fantastic movie

Synopsis: In a world where families are limited to one child due to
overpopulation, a set of identical siblings (7 of them) (played by
Noomi Rapace) must avoid being put to a long sleep by the government
coupled with dangerous infighting among the sisters while investigating
the disappearance of one of their own.Review:Â  To be honest, when I first watched the trailer, I didn't
expect much from it. I expected it to be a rip-off of Orphan Black. I
finally decided to watch it when I had nothing else to watch and trust
me when I say that it's one of the best movies I've watched this year.
Noomi Rapace plays the characters of the Settman sisters incredibly
even more so that each of the seven have different personalities. Even
the supporting casts were all phenomenal in their respective roles. The
plot twists in this movie are exceptional and the synopsis is
excellent. Netflix haven't had much success with movies in recent times
but "What happened to Monday" could possibly change that. I definitely
recommend this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.Rating: 8/10
