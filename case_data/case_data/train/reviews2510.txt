What's worse than cannibalism?

Sitting through this painful movie. I'm surprised people are even
discussing its merits - it doesn't have any!!! Except for the cool look
of the natives. Speaking of natives, all they do is jump around with
spears. It looks like a racist bugs bunny cartoon from the 40's. Also
the Director keeps showing basically the same shot over and over of the
natives, that being a wide shot of the village. The shooting is cheap
cheap cheap cheap cheap. It looks like an iphone. Seriously. I was
Wondering early on what kind of camera they used because it was hideous
to look at. This guy's friends with Tarantino? The setup is super weak
and goes on forever. I fidgeted the whole time, nodding off at one
point. There is 1 scene of cannibalism, it's half decent but brief.
Most of the scenes in the movie are trite and simple minded. I read an
interview with Roth recently and he said he would never do another
Hostile because it would be like going back to High School, he's grown
that much as a director. I'm sorry Eli but you've done exactly the
opposite - you've regressed: This is as bad as many a 1st- timer's
efforts.
