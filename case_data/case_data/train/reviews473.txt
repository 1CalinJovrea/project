Just a very sexy average comedy

This is not the best comedy out there but this is also not the worst
comedy either.The story wasn't something that would blow someone's mind off. Its
jokes are not gonna make someone laughing and rolling on the floor at
the same time. But its a movie that is funny and enjoyable enough to
make one feel like...'Meh, it was alright' The 75% of the main cast is
very attractive. So I must say this is easy on eyes. On the other hand
acting of the cast wasn't that great. More than often it felt average
and the attractiveness would help swallow some of the bad stuffs
happening on the screen.This is a movie no one would watch for a second time(except for those
Gadot fans). But its a good enough comedy that deserves to be
watched...just once.
