Truly Exceptional

May I start this off by saying that I'm astonished at the extremely
unfair negative, even 'mixed' reviews the film has gotten so far... The
film is not even remotely close to being average, it's far, far, beyond
magnificent. By now you probably know the synopsis, so I'll add for those who
haven't seen the film that it's visually stunning, the acting is superb
(special mention to phenomenal newcomer Sunny Pawar, who plays 5 year
old Saroo) and the story is so gripping and moving, that there wasn't a
dry eye in the house when the film reached it's emotional climax. I've been thinking about this film since I saw it, there's drama,
mystery, romance, a whirlwind of emotions throughout the 2 hours - in
the best way possible.
