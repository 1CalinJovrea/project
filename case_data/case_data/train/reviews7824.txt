Wait Till it Comes to the Small Screen

Let's see, well it was worth seeing for me; however, I wished I had
waited till is came out on television -- Because it was really a "movie
of the week"... do they still have those? To say this movie was weak on
facts would imply they got it ALL wrong - Yes, they made some things up
doing the "hollywood thing" but they didn't even attempt half the
history so they couldn't have gotten it ALL wrong! Parts of his life
missing were glaring!They glossed over years -- Heck decades at points, concentrating on
Apple more than Steve Jobs in my opinion... maybe a better name would
have been "Apple & jobs - Some of the Years"!Wait for the movie to hit your TV and know you will still be missing
more than half the story!
