Amazing Cap, Just Amazing!!!!!

Another hit from marvel!!! can they do anything wrong.With the success of the recent marvel films, this one again is sure to
do well at the box office. whats more pleasantly surprising is that
this film is probably the best they've made so far, even rivalling the
avengers. I'm sure that with these positive reviews this movie will
make upwards of 600 million, beating Thor: the dark world, but i doubt
that it will beat iron man 3. however with the success of this movie, i
feel that many more people with be eagerly waiting for the third
instalment so watch out Batman V superman!! The acting as expected from Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans and Samuel
L. Jackson was excellent. Robert Redford was impeccable in his role and
he was worth the effort that Marvel put in to get him on board. The
rest of the cast all play their roles extremely well and Marvel have
done the right thing by bringing the Falcon in the movie, which was
played well by Anthony Mackie.The movie is a great political thriller and i must admit, even without
the bonus of superheroes, the script/story is a great movie. The
superheroes is what we pay and want to see but the amazing flow of the
movie itself should leave many satisfied. The superheroes and villains
were all great and i hope we continue seeing the Falcon in the future
along with Black Widow. This movie is the most closely linked with The
Avengers and also Avengers Age of Ultron, from the rest of the phase 2
films. This is a great movie and one that i highly recommend watching.BTW stay for the end credits for an extra bonus!
