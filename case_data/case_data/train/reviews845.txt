Snow Job

Having read John Krakauer's account of the doomed Everest climb in his
book "Into Thin Air" I was anticipating a much more dramatic film with
a gripping script. The wonderful ensemble of actors didn't have much to
work with. The film is monotone with no edge-of-seat moments -- given
the life-or-death extreme setting. And not much of a dramatic
soundtrack either. The film has no cadence at all and just comes off as
a flat docudrama. The only highly emotional moment is when a dying Rob
Hall makes a final call to his wife in New Zealand. I am especially disappointed that a compelling part of Krakauer's
narrative is almost completely left out. If there is one pivotal
anti-hero in this story it is the NY socialite Sandy Pittman Hill.
She's accused of causing many of the crucial delays to the other
clients' ascent. Without these delays the climbers likely would have
likely gotten back to base camp before the storm came. The film shows
one of these critical delays in the absence of rope lines being fixed
to the summit. But the film never bothers to explain why this happened.
In reality Pittman's distraction of the Sherpa responsible for
installing rope lines is to blame Â– at least according to Krakauer. This would have made for high drama, but the filmmakers inexplicably
show her character in just a few brief shots. One wonders if they were
threatened with a libel suit by Pittman, or simply co-opted by her
when, I assume, they interviewed her for background.The blend of special effect and cinematography is excellent, and it's
not to be missed in 3D. But the story suffers from lack of oxygen.
