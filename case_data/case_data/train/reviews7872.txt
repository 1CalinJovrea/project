It would be selfless of you to go see this snooze fest ! BLEAH

I found so many flaws in this movie that I could write a small novel.
But I do not want to bore anyone more than this movie would ( Hint
hint!)First of all, the movie lacks major continuity. I know it is supposed
to be a sci-fi so I do not expect real stuff in it, but come on! The
movie first portraits the main character as vain, selfish, super rich.
As the movie goes along, our character turns out to be super selfless
and caring about some strange woman and child. Nothing happens in order
to push this Damian to change. Basically he pays 250 million to
transfer his mind in a younger body. When he finds out that the body
belonged to a guy who sold it for millions of dollars, he feels bad and
wants to "return" it. SERIOUSLY?? All that because the previous owner
of the body had a wife and a daughter who by the way received all that
fortune after his "death". The wife is played by a plain actress, does
not inspire any feelings or emotions. She is supposed to be "latina",
but her name Is Maddie. Also the whole movie she looks like a peasant's
wife, with her simple messy braid. No, no, no ! The whole movie makes
no sense and has a typical SUPER PREDICTABLE ending. The guy who sold
his body simply pops in back in his body and lives happily ever after
on a Carabbian island with his peasant wife and daughter out of
Damian's fortune.
