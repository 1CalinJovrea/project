Worst movie I've seen

Full erect penis was unnecessary. That ruined the whole movie and it's
where I stopped watching. You might as well watch a porn movie with
your family, friends, and wife. absolutely disgusting. They could have
censored it but I guess this generation loves it. There is way too much
profanity as well. It switches between comedy and stupid. For some
weird odd reason, MCCARTHY's movies all seem the same! I decided this
will be the last movie I ever watch with her. Totally predictable as
well. I only wanted to watch it because of the rating on here but it's
definitely is not worth that rating! I give it a 1 out of 10. Please do
yourself a favor and save your time by not watching this movie. All the
people involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. This
movie is nothing but proof that our world is degrading.
