Unfaithful Wife

The movie "Daddy's Home" is a quite awful movie keeping in view the
great cast inducted in the movie. Once the divorce has been made why
the ex-husband came to see the kids and stayed in the home for a week,
either the American's are too broad minded or they don't have the
concept of shame at all? The acting of the wife Linda Cardellini was
pathetic as being remarried again she is still taking side of the
ex-husband and zeroing the new husband in every possible way. What is
this happening throughout in the movie and the second husband Will
Farrell is being humiliated altogether. What is shown might be a custom
or tradition in US families; well it's not a custom in other societies
that after the second marriage the ex-husband is that much welcomed in
the house as in this movie. The wife tilting sometimes towards the new
husband and sometime towards the ex is very strange and quite difficult
to grasp. I gave this movie 4 out of 10 being too clumsy and way too
different than actual marriage relation.
