Refreshing and Excellent

Came back from 'Escape Plan'and I liked it. Seeing 2 of the 80s action
icons Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone together was great.
The plot was really unique and something new for a change and the small
twist between Arnold and Stallone at the ending was just hilarious for
me Once again Arnold really stole the show for me with some of his best
liners and action 'n the movie. Stallone for me on the otherhand tried
too hard but couldn't match Arnold's performance but both still managed
to do a solid job. Hopefully, they'll team up again in the future but
with Arnold as the main hero instead next time. The rest of the cast
played their rolls well too especially Jim Carviezel and Faran Tahir Overall, an enjoyable movie and definitely in my top 5 of the year
