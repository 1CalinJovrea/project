Stunning movie

I'm not sure if I'm bias towards Disney films, but I personally thought
this movie was incredible. I could connect with Cinderella and the
design was absolutely stunning. The dress was beautiful and I loved how
Cinderella changed from the beginning to the end but still held on to
her values as a person. I also loved how I could understand the
Stepmother and why she does what she does. When I finished this movie
the message stayed with me. I don't usually like movies with "true
love" but this movie made it work. I would definitely recommend this
movie to anyone. Cinderella's motives were very clear and I was rooting
for her the entire movie
