Corny and predictable

Talk about corny jokes, this movie is full of them. The story is so
predictable and the characters are not good at all. Will Smith as
Deadshot, bad, Harley Quinn, annoying, Killer Croc unbelievable,
boomerang dumb, Joker just ridiculous.How did this movie get a 6.8? This was just dumb and the plot made no
sense. Where are all the regular super heroes that originally caught
the ss? Flash, Batman, etc...I really didn't want to see this to begin with cause even the previews
looked corny and bad but my son wanted to go so I took him. Save your money and watch it on video, it won't be long.
