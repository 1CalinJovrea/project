Best Film Ever

Watched PK! It's by far the best film I have ever seen in my life.
Aamir has given performance of his life.Best film of Rajkumar Hirani
and Aamir Khan's career. This film is once in a lifetime experience.
This film is made with a lot of hard work which can be seen
clearly.Aamir is a legend. Anushka has done wonderful work too. Sushant
is brilliant in a small role..Also great act by Saurabh Shukla. each
and everyone has done their work brilliantly..this film is father of
3idiots.This is a must watch film. message is very strong. this film
makes u cry , laugh and force u to think. this is a brilliant film.
once in a lifetime experience. I am going with full 10/10 with this
film.
