Life of a bunch of lowlifes

If by voting this a 3 or lower I could send the real life versions of
these losers along with their shameless "gimme ma money dawg" sellout
"actors" to jail, I'd still vote a 1, and so only because I cannot cast
a lower vote.What's there to say? If the reviewers who gave this a 10 are paid to
raise the rating (and this is most certainly the overwhelming case)
then please do not have children! You are moral sellouts. If on the
other hand you actually enjoyed this movie, sorry, but you're an idiot. A story--er nightmare, about scumbag filth who prostituted their way
through the 80's and 90's as the moral fabric of society was being
systematically destroyed by a new brand of media and television, and
used this gap in evolution, as these types always use any possible
opportunity to capitalize where the least amount of intellect or work
is necessary, to make themselves downright rich so they can then spend
the rest of their useless, oxygen-thieving carbon waste lives to
further deconstruct decency by telling their tale of filth to the world
with actors who don't have the skills necessary to clean a truck stop
restroom. The lower your IQ the higher your rating will be. For those
who have not seen it and wish to retain some sense of dignity, don't
even watch this on pirated sites. You'll lose over an hour of your life
for nothing. Read a book instead - even a comic book! Your time will be
better spent.This movie is testament to the fact that this generation is lost and
worthless. Anything good to come out of the last 2 decades seems so
rare that it deserves a statue. One can only hope that this trend ends
and soon, so the world can start rebuilding a sense of pride and
decency again. Yuck! Ugh! Blah! No amount of Listerine rinses will help
you get the taste of this movie out of your mouth.
