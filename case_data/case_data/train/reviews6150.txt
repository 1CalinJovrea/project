Makes no sense

How can you get involved in a movie, when treated so serious, when
nothing make sense?I not know if in the US, a drunk driver, would be in a high security
prison with high profile criminals. Possible.But, that the main character from day one is strong enough to change
from a "man in suit" to hard; rough guy, getting friends with criminals
and for 2 years effective prison, ruins his and family future is too
much. That later he wants to protect his family I understand, not his
ability an to kill and choices.If there was an evolution of his character, what got him there, that he
had no other choice (the rape of the black man is not a reason to
change your personality overnight), but no, he becomes the tough guy,
like he was raised in criminal surroundings.Then nothing works in this movie. The acting is not bad, but again,
makes no sense.
