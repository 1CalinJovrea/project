A tremendous achievement in low-budget filmmaking.

The next in a long line of "found footage" flicks that have been
flooding our cinemas over the last few years, Chronicle breaks free of
the usual constraints within that sub genre to concoct a truly
memorable sci-fi thriller. Retracing the steps of three teenage friends
who are gifted with telekinesis after a chance encounter with something
(intelligently, the movie never stipulates what exactly), the story
focuses on the varying paths they take with their new found talent, but
not until they have had some juvenile fun with it first. This is an
amazingly accomplished debut feature for writer-director Josh Trank
(who co-penned the script with Max "son of John" Landis); his technical
veracity is utterly mind-blowing  especially when you consider the
shoestring funds he had to work with  and his narrative pacing is
impeccable. The icing on the already yummy cake is the marvellous CGI
that allows our protagonists to fly, crush cars and stop baseballs in
mid air  all seamlessly and photo-realistically. Chronicle is a
tremendous achievement in low-budget, big-concept filmmaking.
