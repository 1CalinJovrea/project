Are all these people nuts?

What utter garbage this movie was. Sure, the CGI was good... and that's
about it.That anyone found this movie a spiritual eye-opener shocks, and
actually kind of horrifies me. Why are there so many people just
wandering around like zombies not questioning their own existence? Did
this movie just serve to make them actually put down their lattes and
credit cards for one second to see a different perspective on life? I
have no other explanation for how well received this movie was.I tried to see it as just a story on it's own merits but the religious
nonsense was just so thick, it's impossible to separate. Life of Pi
heaves with religious overtones - constantly. But none of it goes
"deeper" than what you would assume every person has pondered at least
once or twice in their lifetime: Is God real? Why do people believe? Is
it better to believe or disbelieve, and does this change if God is
real, or not real?Let me point this out: PI DOES NOT LEARN ANYTHING, NOR CHANGE DURING
THE MOVIE. Pi starts out gullible and foolish, looking for meaning in
life to the point of seeing religion and "God" in everything where none
exists. At the end, after a painfully long journey (for both
protagonist and viewer), Pi is still seeing religion and "God" in
everything - except now he is also a liar. A religious version of castaway that asks no new questions, provides no
new answers, and is better off missed.
