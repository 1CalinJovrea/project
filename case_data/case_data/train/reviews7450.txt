A perfect reunion...

I love this movie. It is my second favorite in all of the American Pie
movies. My order: 1. American Pie 2 - 2. American Reunion - 3. American Wedding - 4.
American PieI really think this is so funny. You finally get to see all of your
favorite characters come back, after such a long time away. Jim and
Michelle have children, and for some reason, Stifler is driving a
school bus. And I'm pretty sure, he got with Finch's mum, after all
those times that Finch got with Stifler's mum.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I don't think they could
have made it any better.
