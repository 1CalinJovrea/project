Time lost hurt me more than the money I spent.

Alright, I was kinda hyped for this movie, since everybody was like
"see this if you are not easily scared".They forgot to add "because you will get a yawn fest".I have to admit the movie looks pretty. It is really pretty. The cast
are pretty, the sets are pretty. The light is pretty, the intro is
pretty. After the intro, the movie is pretty...... ..dumb.And not "horror-dumb" kind of way, rather dumb in a "this is plain
dumb" way.The decisions the characters make, the lame and
way-too-much-straight-into- your-face expositions. The jump scares that
made no sense. The lack of character development. It all made me yawn
at about 1/3rd of the movie. And later on was only worse. The
dialogues, the music/sound effects, the monster, the reveal, the lack
of character depth made me wish for them to die, rather the opposite.
The ways to fight the monster back were ridiculous. And the ending? The
dumbest ending I have seen in a long time.Christ, this movie made me angry. So promising and yet - ultimate
letdown.Rent it. Or not. Better not.
