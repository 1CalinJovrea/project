Amiable but trite

A young woman goes on the run following a violent incident. Changing
her hair colour and calling herself Katie, she arrives at a small
seaside town where she soon makes friends, including a handsome young
man, conveniently widowed with two young children. However, a police
officer is on her trail...What we have here is a romance, cross-pollinated with a mystery about
Katie's backstory and a suspense thriller about the police officer who
is after her, coupled with a couple of other cross-genre oddments (the
young son who can't let go of his mother, will he bond with Katie or
reject her, and so on). I am lucky: I have not read the book on which
this film is based, nor have I seen Sleeping With The Enemy (on account
of my cordial dislike of the vastly overrated Julia Roberts) so, for
me, this movie was not totally devoid of surprises. Having said that, I
didn't find too much here to make my jaw drop.The main strength of the film is Julianne Hough as Katie. This is the
third film I have seen her in, and she is both easy on the eye and able
to project an innate likability. The part of Katie stretches her a
little more than Footloose and Rock Of Ages did, and she does well
enough. Josh Duhamel as sensitive and hunky widower Alex is sensitive
and hunky, David Lyons as nemesis Tierney is satisfactorily over the
top in a caricature part, and Mimi Kirkland as moppet Lexie walks away
on diminutive legs with every scene she is in.This is mostly a nice film - overflowing with niceness in fact which,
in some quarters, might be regarded as a criticism - leavened with a
touch of nastiness. I liked it, but was under no illusions that it was
anything other than a potboiler (with a rather daft and unnecessary
twist at the end).
