This movie should be hit with a frying Pan

Disclaimer: normally when I rate a movie I combine what I think is the
quality of the movie and how enjoyable it was for me. In this review I
mainly focus on how enjoyable it was for me because I was too bored to
look at the acting, plot, character arc, etc.I would not recommend this movie. I didn't enjoy, if you did enjoy it
more power to you, but I didn't. I have never been interested in fairy
tales and that type of magic. But it is my friends favorite movie, he
said it was the good version of Pan, this is the only Peter Pan movie I
have seen but I can say for certain that it is the worst. So when the
movie began I wasn't exactly excited, but I was like "I can give it a
chance" so I did. Not even halfway into the movie I was so bored that i
started saying "that's physically impossible" sadly I could only say 5
- 6 times because my friends have sort of a lack of critical thinking
and wanted to watch the movie seriously. So I had to suffer through it
while I couldn't make fun of it. My friends still hate it when I say
"that's physically impossible". One thing I do remember about the movie
is that the special effects in the end battle blend in pretty well. The
main reason that I didn't enjoy this movie is because I couldn't make
fun of it, if you want to see a bad movie that you can make fun of with
your friends, then this is the movie for you. If you want to make fun
of a movie but your friends don't want to, then I'm sorry you had to
suffer through it. If you want to watch this movie alone don't, it much
better to make fun of with friends.Conclusion: Pan is not a good movie, but the perfect movie to make fun
of and laugh at with your friends.
