rocky 3 or rookie 5

The Movie reminds me Rocky 3, our hero loses face on a younger rival,
his mentor does not exist anymore, it is necessary for him to find
other reference marks.Whereas the one was an improbable film and supers funny  The second
was a pastiche of spy film, on the ecological wave with a beautiful
competition between two cars so different but animated with the same
desire of victories.This one is too dramatic, lacks of jokes and genuine story line  It is
a mixture between a victorious come back and the hand-over between the
master and the rookie..So it is very confusing, the plot is then impossible and bad written..
how a car/pilot can finish a race started by another car/pilot ?At the end, I did not laugh and I did not like the plot
