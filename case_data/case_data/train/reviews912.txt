Surprising villain / Diesel & Rock / Fast 7

Just watched it in France, gonna admit it is just explosive and best
action movie so far this year: Well balanced timing, good fight
featuring Rodriguez, a great tag team tornado match for the grand
finally. Don't even think about story line because this kind of movie
can make you believe anything as long as punchlines from each
characters, punches from the main ones, put a step further to the never
seen before one of a kind car chasing (e.g tank vs old cars / aircraft
vs muscle cars) You have to remember a wrestlemania like match feat.
Rock/Diesel which is as good as Superman/Batman fighting together. Over
the top : ending preparing the Fast and Furious team Vs The Transporter
: 2014 great year upcoming...
