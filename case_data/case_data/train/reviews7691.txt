Awful........... Just AWFUL!

Lets get one thing straight, Will Ferrell is a comedy genius! However
this movie sucked from start to finish. There is no LOL moments. The
story was OK i suppose but the actual comedy in the film is lacking BIG
TIME. Do not pay to go and see this movie you are wasting your money.
Stay home with a big glass of scotch and watch anchorman on DVD. AVOID
AT ALL COSTS!
