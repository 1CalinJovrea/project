'Non-Stop ' is right...

Some may accuse Liam Neeson of being typecast, as YET AGAIN he stars in
a violent action film... but this was quite different from the Taken
movies. For a start, he has to save a whole plane full of people,
rather than various family members. He doesn't take down foe after foe
without respite either... he must play the sleuth a bit as well....
working his way down a list of suspects until he finds the one(s)
responsible for the imminent threat.The way the plot tosses up some hints, only to change direction at a
moment's notice works well in keeping the nerves a-jangling. And the
fact everyone thinks HE'S the terrorist adds a bit of extra spice,
already adding to a thoroughly absorbing experience. When we eventually
do find out who is behind the oh-so-intricate plan, it is very clever
in the unveiling, and we don't feel a bit cheated.My only real complaint is the brief fight scenes are so speedily edited
that I found it hard to see what was going on, though the sound effects
made it more than clear. Perhaps a bit more clarity next time...? That
aside, it's nice to watch a thriller which keeps the brain occupied
rather than just going for the testosterone factor, and as long as Liam
Neeson keeps churning out genre films of this quality, who cares if
he's become pigeonholed? 7/10
