Another "I'm fat so I'm funny" movie

Terrible in all it's glory. Fat jokes because it stars a fat chick,
terribly degrading Melissa's persona. One would think that the movie
actually adds something with that cast but it doesn't. It not only has
the "last minute unexpected hero spy" recipe but the "I'm fat so I make
fat jokes" ingredient. The movie was almost unbearable to watch and
very "american" style of laughing at steriotypes. It's sad to see that
Jude Law and Jason Statham participated in this since they have so much
more potential and thinking that they wasted time filming this and not
something of quality makes me sad.This movie is what's wrong with society nowadays. Do not recommend.
