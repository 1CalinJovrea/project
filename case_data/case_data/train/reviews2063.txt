heartbreaking

i don't know if the movie is meant to teach us a lesson about being a
straight A father and not to f^ck total strangers no matter how pretty
they are or if the movie is just straight A piece of crap. i am so
sorry, there was just tons of loose ends, it was KINDA interesting,
just enough for you to not push the stop button while watching but
really, this is just HEARTBREAKING. i was expecting a lot since we have
keanu in the movie and the girls were just damn fine but i still feel
that i just wasted my time on this. the movie ended with an
UNSATISFYING feeling. it's just empty, everything does not make sense
at all. i should have just fapped myself to sleep.
