A PR puff piece

I spent 20+ years in corporate PR (not Apple), and if we'd wanted to
spend big bucks to lionize the founder, this would have been the
result.Oliver Stone should have made this movie. Then we would have seen the
egomaniac who treated people like slaves and threw them away (for me,
the measure of an executive is as much his/her respect for other human
beings as the products that result). We would have seen Jobs' lordly apathy towards body odor (mentioned
once) and license plates, as if he weren't subject to the rules that
mere mortals have to obey. We would have seen the famous eye-to-eye
stare, as if The Master could force obedience just by looking at you.We would have seen Jobs' obsession with closed systems (I've heard that
Apple products are difficult if not impossible to physically open), as
opposed to Gates' openness. We would have seen how Jobs' monumental ego doomed him to death: his
cancer was initially operable, but he didn't want people cutting open
his precious body, so he opted for one strange diet after another, as
if he were exempt from the principles of medicine and nutrition.Maybe Stone would even have thrown in a scene from "The Simpsons"
episode in which Lisa tries to see "Steve Mobs" about her astronomical
usage charges, only to find him in a secluded, godlike glass chamber.
He offers her a job, but it turns out to be a menial one - standing on
the street handing out Apple fliers.The movie spent only a few minutes on Jobs' dark side, which was just
as important as his gadgets. As I watch people entranced by the toys he created (and crashing their
cars and killing each other as they do so), I realize that there is no
way he is in the same league as Edison or other industrial giants to
which he has been compared, and I recall the words of an article in The
Atlantic: "we are all Jobs' slaves now."And that's exactly how he would have wanted it.
