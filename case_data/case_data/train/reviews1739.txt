8
I am a fan don't ask me.

I was going to give a 10 simply due to opening scene but then movie
started to slow a little bit.Also, unnecessarily, the stone lady on the
head of the ship started to jump ship to ship and try to hunt Jack with
a giant stone spear,in a sudden.Nonetheless, I will surely watch this
movie again. Seeing Jack moving around is always worth watching the
whole movie.So it is a smiling 8.
