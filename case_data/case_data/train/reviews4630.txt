For anybody that is a Goosebumps fan, or will be after this movie.

The Goosebumps book series where a big sellers in the 90's, so was the
T.V. series, which was The Twilight Zone for preteens. R.L. Stine
proves he had a creative mind with such bizarre tales and some insane
plot twist. So having some of the Goosebumps characters come alive in
the real world, is quite a tribute to R.L. Stine's work.Jack Black is quite enjoyable, seems to having the most fun has Stine,
at times he is a little over the top, but in a good way. Odeya Rush is
good has Hannah. But it's Dylan Minnette and Ryan Lee who play Zach and
Champ, really bring the comedy here, those two have such comedic
chemistry they are like a comedy team. The effects are incredible, an
amusing CGI fest. The movie never takes itself seriously, if you like
The Monster Squad(1987), so I'll bet you'll get an good ride out of
Goosebumps.
