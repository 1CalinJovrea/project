She met Dave in the best day of her life!

It has been a long time since I watched such an awesome teen movie. I
always want to find a movie which can represent our feeling when it
comes to first love. And this movie is the ONE! Aubrey is sexy and dependent, more mature than girls of her own age.
Dave is smart but shy most of the time. Both of them are great people
and when they meet each other, the chemical just burst.It is so hard to
find someone you can just keep talking to. So when they are talking
about dream, traveling, hobby, I can't help smiling because this is so
real. Although some of our experience is way much personal, we just
want to share our thoughts with the ONE for no reason. This movie also reminds me of Flipped. Both of them are about first
love. The most different part for me is that Julie in Flipped is brave
while Aubrey is more vulnerable and sensitive.But at the end of the
day, you'll have your own happy ending.In addition, I used to check the ranking before I watch a movie. After
watching this, ranking is of no importance any longer. This movie is
just so real, so romantic and so awesome!!!
