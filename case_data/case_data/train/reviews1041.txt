Wolverine Is At An All Time Low

Okay, before I get into it, allow me to highlight some glitches in the
movie. First, Wolverine, when in the Japanese prison camp (of which I'm
pretty sure there were none in Nagasaki) says something to the effect
of 'that's a B-52 bomber. no one's gonna outrun that.' Did he know
about the project code named 'Big Boy?' Did he know that it was the
atomic bomb? And if so, how the heck would he know that? Also, he slept
with his friend's granddaughter. Isn't that against some unwritten code
of honor? Also, almost the only factor in the entire movie that moved
anybody even a little bit was his relationship with his Japanese
friend, and how he sustained an atomic blast to protect him. Then, in
the end, we came to find out that he was only looking to take advantage
of Wolverine and reclaim his youth. Nicely done. Bonus: there were some
funny parts, like in the porno hotel and with the 'doctor.. sort of.
veterinarian.. student' and I'll admit, the beginning part with the
bear was pretty sad and Wolverine's rage was pretty justified. And the
train fight scene was awesome! However, this movie was just like that
train, except way too slow paced at times, and it didn't know where it
was going. Like, I'm pretty positive the director pulled the ending
right out of his butt. Pretty bad. 5/10
