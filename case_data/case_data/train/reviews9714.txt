13 Reasons Why I Either Laughed My Ass Off Or Had A Shot (In no particular order)

BELOW- FAIR WARNING**********************13. The faces and noises Light makes when he meets Ryuk for the first
time and also when he and Mia are falling off of the Ferris Wheel.12. Additionally, the background music playing while Mia and Light are
falling, as well as other choice moments when they decide to phone in
contemporary pop/rock. These moments belong in dog-food commercials
somehow.11. Death Note: the Soap? Since when was Death note ever about the
melodramatics of teen life? It was like watching an episode of "Gossip
Girl" put in a blender with Tim Burton artwork and pulsed once or
twice.10. L is a downright spaz. Especially when he goes Rambo when Watari
gets Death-Noted into looking for L's records... speaking of which...9. Watari gets Death-Noted into looking for L's records... not only is
his actual and full name "Watari," but as per rules of the notebook he
can be controlled by Light over the phone to do something before he
gets gunned down.... also speaking of Light...8. Light has a conscience. He was just heavily influenced by Mia to
take things to the extreme that they were taken to. Nice message
there... nevermind Light's arc of an Icarus flying too close to the
sun, it was basically all Mia's fault.7. Death Note and chill, anyone?... 6. Mia's drool. I felt like she was spitting on me the entire time...5. The rogue ladder decapitation... the setup for the death was pretty
intense and interesting, but... huh? I can see like, getting concussed
or maybe knocked into something but no ladder can slice through human
skull like a knife through jello.4. MR. TURNER! DETENTION! Wait... Light sells homework forgeries and
he's actually a delinquent? He is a misunderstood rascal instead of the
pinnacle straight-A student with top honors all across the board?3. "Light Turner"... while Americanization can be a curse at the best
of times, there is just no excuse for this...2. L has a sweet-tooth, remember? Well, the movie did, for about the
first half. Then suddenly the plot happens and an endearing character
trait takes a backseat to hyper-protective emo-L.1. Emo-L holds Lights life in his hands. Uh... I thought L didn't let
emotions overtake his rationale... or his morals... or his duty as an
unbiased detective.BONUS ROUND: The page with Light's name on it floating conveniently
like a Forrest Gump feather into the plot-fire.Without ranting much, it's obvious to see that "DEATH NOTE" suffers
from the same afflictions as "THE LAST AIRBENDER" and more. That is to
say: consolidation of too much material into too short a time frame,
abysmal casting (except Ryuk, the only redeemable quality of the movie,
and that's not saying much), and a complete and unwelcome departure
from major points of the story.**********************SPOILERS ABOVE- FAIR WARNING SPOILERS ABOVE- FAIR WARNING SPOILERS
