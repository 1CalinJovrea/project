Worth watching even with its flaws

This is not a review per se, but a discussion of certain aspects of the
film. As a teacher I was curious to see if Ben had discovered new ways
to excite his kids about life and themselves. The jury was still out
when Ben takes them into civilization and teaches them to steal food
from a supermarket. What great life lesson was gleaned from that act I
wonder? It didn't fit into any other principle or idea they were
learning. It's OK to take things from others if you need them without
paying. I didn't look at the movie the same after that. And then he
sends his daughter on a Ninja mission that almost cripples her . . . .
one that was bound to fail anyway since her goal of capturing her
brother was unrealistic since he didn't want to be captured. After that
the kids come to realize how valuable their father is to them and they
sneak away with him. OK, I'll buy that. Question: Won't the grandfather
come after them? So are they hiding out? Using aliases? "What the
Flick's" Matt and Alonso praise the movie for not painting either
"side" as having all the right answers . . . . for being brave. I can
see that point of view but I was hoping for one side to be the clear
winner. That just didn't happen. Enjoyed the ride anyway.
