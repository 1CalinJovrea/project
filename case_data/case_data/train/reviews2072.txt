Interesting premise but poor execution

On paper, The Babadook had a lot of potential and seemed to promise
something refreshing to a genre that desperately needs it.
Unfortunately, it suffers from all the usual tropes of horror films,
without bringing anything new to the table. I found both lead actors to
be particularly annoying : the always whining and screaming boy and the
clinically depressed hushing mother. I couldn't care less about their
fate ! As far as the monster is concerned, the director didn't bother
to explain its origin, meaning or how to defeat it. As always in this
case, some may like the fact that it leaves things purposefully open to
interpretation, and others, like me, would have preferred if some hints
were dropped here and there ! Either way, the ending is really
unsatisfying and dull.I'm sure the film is meant as a metaphor for the mother's grief, but it
could have been better if they had more carefully and subtly built the
tension, and if the cinematography and score were more sinister. It had
potential but I found the pacing to be a bit off and the scary bits
were quite cheap. In fact, I'm not even sure you can call The Babadook
a horror film. It felt more like a psychological thriller and should
have been advertised as such. 5 out of 10.
