Elaborate and careful construction, psychological game

Since the first moment you get attached to the characters, their
stories seem plausible and you don't feel any of them are guilty. But
not everything can be true and the careful construction of the events,
like in Agatha Christie novels keeps you intrigued till the end.Excellent play for the main actor, Mario Casas, but even better for the
lawyer, Ana Wagener.
