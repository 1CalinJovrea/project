Absolutely Disappointing

"Joy" is one of the most disappointing films of the year (if not the
most). The great cast with names such as Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De
Niro, Bradley Cooper, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Isabella
Rossellini gives the sensation to the viewer that "Joy" might be a
great film. However, the storyline of a creative woman that lives with
her dysfunctional family and invents a mop, becoming a successful
woman, has a boring and dull story and consequently screenplay; in
addition, the soundtrack is annoying. In the end, "Joy" is a waste of
time and talented cast. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Joy: O Nome do Sucesso" ("Joy: The Name of the
Success")
