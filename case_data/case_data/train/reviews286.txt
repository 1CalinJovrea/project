Has IMDb been hacked?

I'm struggling to understand how this got such good reviews. I usually
rate the IMDb score as the gold standard but something has gone
seriously wrong here. I did see the trailer, it was good and contained
the only laughs of the movie. The movie was truly the most tedious
thing I have ever experienced. Why did it get such good reviews from
critics and such a high score on IMDb? User reviews here are spot on.
Not a single good review. The reviewer above who mentioned he had sat
down to more entertaining bowel movements surpassed any joke in the
film.Something is very wrong here.
