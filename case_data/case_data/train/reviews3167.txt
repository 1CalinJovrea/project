Two Hearts One Mind

Absolutely beautiful, a total sensory experience! Over the years I have
seen various movies about Vincent and read about his close relationship
with his brother Theo. What I found amazing about this movie was the
imaginative approach that was taken to unravel his life and work. So
many details were revealed that I had no idea of, and put into such
interesting context. The choice of actors was brilliant and we see how
close they resemble the actual people during the credit roll at the end
of the film - also highly imaginative. I love the rich colours, the
Cerulean blue and bright yellows. Truly a starry night! Don't miss.
