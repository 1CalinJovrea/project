Worthy sequel

I'm not going to spoil the plot or any of the most memorable action
scenes from the movie, I'll just write this: John Wick: Chapter 2 is a worthy successor of the first movie, it
expands the universe, giving you insight into the interior of the world
of assassins and maintains the insanity of action sequences from the
first movie. Memorable scenes, unexpected humorous tone of some dialogues and
shootouts, really interesting world and Keanu Reeves who, as usual,
commits 100% to the action sequences (just watch his training videos on
youtube, mad respect for this guy!) I believe that true efforts to entertain you should be rewarded. In a
world of shitty, worthless, cashgrab sequels (like, say, Fifty Shades
Darker, released the same day as John Wick 2), sequels like JW:C2
deserve to be praised. Amazing movie! 9/10
