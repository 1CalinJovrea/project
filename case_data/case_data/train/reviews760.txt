Excellent,  ultimately bleak

Accomplished and informative movie from Adam McKay and his team.
Special kudos to Hank Corwin for his fast but never flashy editing.Superbly acted, with a nice little part for co-producer Brad Pitt, who
is always at his best in supporting roles.Looking at some of the message board postings about this movie, it's
evident that the blame game for the financial meltdown of 2007/8
continues, which kind of misses the point of the movie, which is that
the whole thing has started up again. Neither governments, nor banks,
nor the public seem to care enough about the damage of a cycle of boom
and bust to really do anything about it. They  we  smell money.Excellent film. Mostly funny. Ultimately bleak.
