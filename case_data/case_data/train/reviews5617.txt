All American heroes, of course...

While the action scenes in the movie were quite good and nicely filmed,
and the fact that 90% of the movie was all action, then the all
American propaganda that permeated the movie was a bitter pill to
swallow. The movie was entertaining, if you like war action movies.There is little acting in the movie, as most of it is all action and
tactical combat. But still, given the story and premise of the movie,
the lack of acting wasn't particularly catastrophic to the movie.
However, the movie could have done without the scenes where it switched
to the helmet-mounted cameras and sort of turned into a first person
shooter experience.As mentioned earlier, the pro-American propaganda was ruining some of
the enjoyment of the movie. As a non-American person it just left a
foul taste in my mouth. I can understand patriotism and such, but not
in movies that are meant for entertainment. It was a bit too much as if
this was a showcasing of the superiority of the US army."Act of Valor" is the type of movie that you watch once, then never
again, because the story doesn't have enough meat to sustain more than
a single viewing.An entertaining war movie for what it was, just a shame it had to be
put on a red, white and blue pedestal.
