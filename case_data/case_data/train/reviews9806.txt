Enjoyable

I was expecting this to be hardcore car racing action movie.But this movie, Need for Speed, gave me pleasant surprise.It has action but story is good too. Does not bore the viewer.Director exactly know what needs to be fed to viewer in what quantity.Acting is well delivered. Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots are matching
pair, especially the eyes. Dominic Cooper delivers well too.I had an impression that this movie will be in line of Fast and
Furious. But it is not.Both are good but different. Overall, enjoyable movie.
