Utterly plot less drivel

If could give it a 0/10 I would.I'm not going to cry p.c. nonsense about the crude humour, I like crude
humour, but in spades, this film was just a continuous attempt at badly
executed shock value (food orgy) with absolutely no real story wrapped
around it, they find out the world is "evil", kill the store staff, but
never question the giant plot holes involved, such as:If it is a film about talking food, how come a toilet roll and a douche
can talk, but no other inanimate objects can't talk? Among other logic
defying questions.It reached a point where at the end they ran out of ideas and decided
to build a StarGate to find the actors who voice them in real life for
some reason or another, at that point I had checked out completely.To conclude, it's too adult for kids, yet too stupid for adults.Avoid.
