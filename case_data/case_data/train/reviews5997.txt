A Very Entertaining Film

As a constant film goer I was really impressed with this film. It was
entertaining. The story worked well. The acting was great. And the
effects were really impressive. I watched it on a big screen in Bangkok
and enjoyed the experience. The sound was equally impressive. I just can't understand why the really negative reviews abound. Some
are cursing it for having foreign actors. Others about the political
situation etc. And the poor director is even getting a caning. The story is about a legend. And it was wonderful to just sit back and
let someone tell a story. I nearly didn't go because of all the bad
reviews but I am glad I went and made up my own mind.Go and see it.
