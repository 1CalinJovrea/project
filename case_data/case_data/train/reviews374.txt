Not slow, just building character and context

I took a punt on this and bought it on Blu Ray without seeing it first.
I'd read the reviews warning of it being slow but didn't find it so. To
me it was establishing characters in realistic ways.I like it's attention to real details, the importance of tending your
horses, packing food, making sure to rest etc.I liked all of the 4 main characters but thought Matthew Fox was
fabulous. Really enjoyed his performance and portrayal of the
character.A most enjoyable film and people really shouldn't be put off by the
warnings of it being slow. If you were okay with the pacing of The
American with George Clooney, then you'll have no problems with this.
