Safe house oh yeah.. Not so safe movie.

A stupid movie. I managed about 35-40 minutes. And the rating is 6.8?Safe house are not safe. Car chase where the "hero" driving like an
idiot, to call attention? Our hero call headquarters during car chase.
What a script.?? In The headquarters are many people who pretend to
work with this case , headquarters does not not have permission to use
surveillance satellite, it is just for the military. What a script.??
Something headquarters did not know. What a script.?? Remember people
we are talking top secret service.Wild driving and car crashes, our hero takes no damage, bullets flying
around his head, car windows shot out. Our hero are in one piece, not a
detriment. What a script.?? More wild driving. The car (BMW) are full
of bullet holes, our hero has come away and into a garage where he
opens the trunk and the person in the trunk are not damaged, like a
miracle, he also escaped the bullets. Here I stopped the movie - enough
are enough.What I wonder is: Why do Adults play in such a lousy movie? OK for the
money I understand it, but not my money I have not paid anything to see
this parody of a film
