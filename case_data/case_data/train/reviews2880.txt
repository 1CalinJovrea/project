A fulfilling end to a legendary trilogy!

As this movie was the most awaited movie of the decade, I obviously
wanted to watch it as soon as possible. My friend won some contest
online and so, I got to watch it a few days earlier FOR FREE.The movie is everything you want it to be. The story is very well told
and there is enough of Nolan-kind twists. Tom Hardy has some powerful
lines as Bane but the enhanced voice doesn't work at all. But, he still
does his character justice and performs to his full potential. For the
first time in the trilogy, Batman wasn't the strongest. This gave a
chance to Christian Bale to show off his acting skills without the mask
and he did a fine job. The veterans Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and
Michael Caine went about their job as if it was just another day at the
office. But, a major surprise was Joseph Gordon-Levitt who portrays an
ordinary police officer and pulls of an unexpectedly awesome
performance. The special effects, sound and action were out of the world. Nolan
spent a lot of money and he made it visible in the movie. The movie
connects all the dots from the previous movies and provides a fitting
end to the saga. Although, personally I liked The Dark Knight better.
But, TDKR certainly came very close it.Finally, I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman
in a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best
trilogy of all time.
