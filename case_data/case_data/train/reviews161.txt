Surprisingly Entertaining Illumination Flick

Ever since the release of Despicable Me back in 2010, Illumination has
really stepped up from their previous animated movies. Whether it be
the aforementioned film, its sequel, its spin-off Minions, or the 2012
adaptation of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, it was quite a change with their
latest entry The Secret Life of Pets.The plot centers around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier living happily with
his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in New York City, but when she
adopts a bigger dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) to live with them,
Max is overwhelmed by his new roommate. The two opposing dogs must then
work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the
big city.For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow
off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet
it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life
which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max,
Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love
interest Gidget, and 'Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke.
With quick-witted, slapstick humor that feels reminiscent of Looney
Tunes (even with a tendency to adlib lines in some scenes), the real
scene stealer among this talented cast goes to comedian Kevin Hart
voicing adorable, yet antagonistic rabbit Snowball.While the littler ones will be kept engaged and entertained by the
humorous animal characters as well as the obstacles they come across,
to me personally the story feels rushed, especially the need for a
little more emotional depth and better character development. I know
there's a lot more to offer in this story's universe, so a sequel can't
be far behind from this underrated animated flick. Nevertheless, it
certainly kept me laughing nearly throughout the movie's 90-minute run
time and it's something that shouldn't be taken for granted. I enjoyed
it.
