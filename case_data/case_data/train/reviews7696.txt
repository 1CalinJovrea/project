Shallow, predictable, and patronising

What a monumental waste of A-class actors! On paper, this film ticks all the right boxes: topical sci-fi, great
actors in fitting roles, plot ingredients that should create great
suspense...and yet, it completely fails to deliver at all levels.I wanted to like this film, so I ignored the first few warning signs:
the characters start off a bit one-dimensional, a slightly uninspired
representation of Google/Facebook/Amazon-ehm I mean-"The Circle's"
headquarters...But then came a couple of scenes that could (no
exaggeration) be right out of a CollegeHumor parody video - except they
were meant to be serious- and I knew something had gone really wrong
with the script and direction.15-20 minutes into the film everything becomes completely predictable.
There isn't a single moment that has you on edge or wondering what's
coming next, because everything is as blatant and simplistic as it
could be. There's nothing novel about any of the characters or the
major plot points. What is worse, the script just can't stop preaching:"loosing all our privacy is bad...mmkay?" "big corporations shouldn't spy on us all the time...mmkay?" "sacrificing your personal life in the name of a morally dubious career
can have regrettable repercussions...mmkay?" -NO SH!T movie! Thanks for letting us know, because, you know, we
didn't have to write enough 10th grade essays about these things!Bottom line: I know it's tempting, but don't watch unless you have time
to waste. It's not even "so-bad-it's-good" bad, it's just incredibly
dull.
