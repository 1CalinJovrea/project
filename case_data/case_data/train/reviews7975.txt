One of the most disappointing movies in Shyamalan's career

What is going on with M. Night Shyamalan lately? I used to like him in
earlier films like Unbreakable and Signs, but he hasn't made the
critics and audiences gifted as it would probably if his directing
career is in serious jeopardy. One of the biggest and toughest question
is that simple: Why is M. Night Shyamalan directing in a new
post-apocalyptic adventure starring Will and Jaden Smith? Did he ever
asked to direct After Earth or did Sony wanted to choose any director
that Smith had previously worked for instead of Shyamalan? For those
who don't know, this is the first lowest-rated movie for Will Smith
since 1999's disappointing mess "Wild Wild West," one for Jaden since
"The Day the Earth Stood Still," and another bomb for Shyamalan.After Earth feels like a re-cut of "Battlefield Earth" (Ya know, the
Travolta movie we don't even care anymore) and sometimes half-"I Am
Legend" and half-"Hunger Games." But to me, maybe it's the whole
Scientology thing that starts to ruin the whole story.The story is ridiculous, poorly acted (Smith sounded like James Earl
Jones), mediocre sci-fi elements. How can this movie be much worse? I
wished the late Roger Ebert was here giving a harsh review on "After
Earth." Bottom Line: It's not going to be a big summer success, but
it's another letdown for fans of Will Smith. I'll just pass on the
movie instead of renting it on DVD.** 1/2 out of 5 stars
