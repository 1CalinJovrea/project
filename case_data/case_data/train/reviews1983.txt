As if made for the subtlety-impaired

Whew, with cable everyone knows the basic story of "Carrie," thanks to
the very effective film put together by the not-so-closet misogynist
Brian ("How many times can I kill my wife the actress in my own films")
DePalma. Along with the gore, it was anchored by two tremendous
performances from Piper Laurie as her nutty mom and an Academy Award
nominated performance by a radiant and truly gifted Sissy Spacek. Ms. Moore and Ms. Moretz are also gifted actresses, but for the love of
anything with cinematic worth, who thought this script was even
competent? (SPOILER) It's not enough that the religious fanatic mom (a
stereotype that was old and tired long before the original film) is so
stupid she doesn't know she's pregnant, no, we have to show she's extra
disturbed by having her gouge herself with fingernails and sewing
implements.Ms. Moretz was let down not only by the script, but by the director.
Chloe convincingly shows us a frightened, abused child, but then it's
time to (SPOILER) bust out the library books and discover, really early
on, that she has powers. And she's playing with the powers through the
movie until the end. In the DePalma film Carrie's response to the
horrible hazing was a primal psychic scream of inchoate outrage, the
abused child striking out blindly against all those who had tormented
her (real and imagined), a terrified tantrum, but in this far inferior
remake, Moretz's Carrie is consciously vengeful, stalking and striking
and finding in a way that made her far less sympathetic than Spacek's
Carrie.Sorry, it was just a waste of time. Ms. Moretz, you can do so much
better than this.
