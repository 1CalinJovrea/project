A video game you can't play.

I love America, but come on. This movie was two hours of propaganda
with too many first person shots, too much product placement, and
unbearable acting (I know they're real SEALS, but that's part of the
movie so I have to take it into effect). I've seen reviews that say "as
real as it gets" and "real life, not Hollywood" and they couldn't be
farther from the truth. This movie is of the most unrealistic things
I've seen in a long time. I've come prepared with examples: A SEAL is
shot with a rocket launcher from 5 feet away and it sticks into his
uniform (doesn't detonate) and all he does is stumble back a little.
They say "good thing it was a dud". Realistically, he'd be killed or at
least injured by the force of a 10 pound projectile at 600 mph. There's
more, but I think that gets the picture across. If you want a war
movie, there are plenty of good ones: Saving Private Ryan, Platoon,Hurt
Locker, etc...
