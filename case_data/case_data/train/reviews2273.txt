Complete. Nonsense.

The movie starts with a guy who makes many expensive parties in his
mansion, to get the presence of the girl he has always been in love
with. 1.- It never explains why he can't just go to her, which the book
does. This makes an awful ridiculousness of "Why didn't he just go to
her?" for years. 2.- After he finally meets her, the entire plot for
ENTIRE 30 MINUTES is about her not being able to make up her mind about
Gatsby or her husband. 3.- The "climax" of the story is when Daisy's
husband discovers he used to be poor. He breaks out in rage, and Daisy
gets scared. That's it. Most of the story wouldn't mean much without
the visuals, and most of the reviews were obviously bought. The only
thing that makes the movie bearable was Leonardo Di Caprio's
performance. The characters' entire importance and ego based on
materialism and money are justified not with interesting deep stories,
but with plain image and the love Gatsby felt to "give her everything",
implying a love story strongly based on materialism.
