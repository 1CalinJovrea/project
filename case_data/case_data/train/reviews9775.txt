I can't believe I paid $8.00!

There was not one redeeming quality to this movie; in fact, the
producers should be force to refund our money. No chemistry, no humor,
not one good scene, rather, we spent the ride home listing the top 10
worst scenes only to realize we needed a Top 100 list!There were multiple disjointed scenes where the script writer obviously
was not concerned. For example, in the opening scenes, we're told of a
world at peace where there had been no wars for 20 years. A couple of
scenes, we're treated to a scene where a "warlord" is introduced who
appeared anything but peaceful.Bill Pullman needs a cane at the beginning of the movie, near the end,
he's a Top Gun pilot willing to sacrifice his life to deliver the
package. The list could go on. It really was that bad.Do not waste your time. I was prepared for a mediocre film that was
mildly entertaining but rather received a movie that was beyond bad. If you feel you must see it, wait a year and go pick up a discounted
copy in a reduced price bin at Walmart.You have been warned!
