Don't do it.

Expecting a comedy? This isn't what you had in mind. It is difficult to
mix genres. Here they are trying to mix comedy with blood bath
violence. The violence is over the top.The comedy doesn't work. The premise of being relocated to Normandy
feels like a needed stretch to get the financial participation to get
the film made. The performances are good, but you don't care about any
character in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones is getting too old for these
roles.There is a good score but it's often loud and too noticeable. The movie
is too long and drags in the middle on the way to the blood bath
ending. Don't let the cast or fun trailer suck you in. This is a no fun
waste of time and money.
