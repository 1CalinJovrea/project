10
Did you see the film I saw ?

I don't know why people are saying that this film was an abomination
and advising others not to see it, because it has all if the element
required in a fantastic horror.For me it re-ignited the flame in what was a dying genre, being
poisoned by numerous of extremely bad films. Not only did it make it's
way into my favorite horrors of all time, but it makes me have faith
that people can once again create a true horror. Now there are only
remakes of horrors, ( Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street ....)
or prequels, ( Prometheus ).This movie is full of twists and turns you don't know what way it's
going to go. It's smart, funny, gory and sexy with fantastic acting by
all the cast. I was on the edge of my seat hungry for more.Overall, I rated this movie a 10 because it deserved it. This was one
of the best films I've seen in a very long time and is one that I'll be
watching over and over again.
