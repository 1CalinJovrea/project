Starts out great, falls apart halfway through

This movie had a lot of potential. It started out great, but it began
to fall apart rapidly just after the halfway mark. A more complicated plot could have developed, but the second half just
seems rushed. The movie could have gone in several different and more
fulfilling directions, but it went full cheese instead. Disappointing.
It ends up being just a variation of "The Last Ride" (2004). SPOILER ALERT It's a given that being in debt to a crime boss means your debt will
never really be cleared, so that's okay for a movie.And you can suspend disbelief for driving physics and non-deploying
airbags...But...Doc sending the third crew to meet with arms dealers was totally
unnecessary for the job they had the next day, because they already had
all the equipment they needed, so that whole scene was forced just for
a plot device.Bats proved he was willing to kill for no reason, so there's really no
reason he would have left Joe alive.There is no way Buddy would have been able to escape all those cops
swarming him downtown. Then Buddy shows up again later after getting
shot in the chest. Superhuman villains in a non-superhero movie tend to
ruin the whole thing.Doc remaining in the place from where the heist was launched at risk of
being caught for no reason (even though he knew it was botched) made no
sense, just like his sudden change of heart in "helping" Baby made no
sense.Oh and Jon Bernthal is only in the movie for about 10 minutes, so not
sure why he was given top billing, when he's pretty much just an extra
with a couple of lines. Baby's deaf foster dad had more lines (sign
language) than Bernthal, yet he's not considered a main character.
