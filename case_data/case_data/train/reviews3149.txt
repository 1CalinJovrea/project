A Dreadful Bore

Perhaps one of the worst films to start the year off with; the film
began simply enough, with a few flash backs and a few references to
general guiding story lines of the movie, but then it all went downhill
from there. In this film, there is not really a climax, nor really any
kind of action/plot at all. It is basically Affleck avoiding his past
when he has to go and take care of his brother's kid, who is just
another awkward twist to the movie. The kid is an egomaniac, who has
two girlfriends, is a general jacka** to everyone, and is generally
obnoxious during the whole movie. The part that really got me, and
several other people who left the movie before it ended (I stayed
hoping it was going to get better) was the extremely awkward scenes, or
the awkward persona of Casey Affleck. There would be minutes of just
sitting around, which became common enough that about 40% of the film
is just awkward conversation or awkward encounters, which is probably
why such a film with no actual substance lasted a horrifying 2 hours
long. And then to top it all off, the Bostonian ethnicity shared by
everyone in the movie made every conversation appear like an argument,
with great amounts of language, which although trying to accurately
portray the regional people, became more of an ear sore for those who
can have conversations without abysmal amounts of language.I would give it a 2/10 for the occasional laugh that it gave, but for 2
hours of screen time, I can't find a reason why it would deserve it.(This film is highly rated on this website, but me and most people I
have talked to who have seen it all agree it was not that great. It
definitely was not a highlight film, so perhaps those who did see it
are refreshed by some of the themes? Regardless, I did not enjoy the
film, and will be seeing La La Land to make up for it tomorrow.)
