Hate/Loved it

i loved it for the fact that they both fell for each other yet hated it
because they missed each other at opportunities for them to be together
i love films where best friends fall in love with each other and this
is one i love. If you hope for happy Movies throughout don't watch this
it goes from happy to sad to happy to sad then happy i loved it for the fact that they both fell for each other yet hated it
