Had a feeling it would be bad, but it was worse than bad

Just saw this with a friend. Saw the trailer, and thought that it
looked a bit pointless, but gave it a chance anyway. The two main
characters didn't have any chemistry, if you ask me. Nothing in the
movie was realistic. It's annoying to see a movie with cops, who is
that stupid. Ice Cube can't be taken seriously as a boss in a police
stationen, with a street gangster attitude. If you like the series,
don't watch this, something will happen that ruins the old classic,
just avoid. I really don't get why so many people like this, maybe
someone just voted 9-10, to trick others. If this is the future for
other movies, I'm just watching my old movies again, gladly. Me and my
friend don't agree on every movie, but we both think this was the worst
this year. On to the next....
