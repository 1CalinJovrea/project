Too narrow in the focus

The movie's subject is indeed intriguing, similar to what the other
movie Experimenter talks about, that people can deliberately abuse
power even if it's just a fake power. On the other hand the prisoners
also tend to let things happen to them because they see the authority,
again even if they know that the authority is a fake one. But I think
the movie becomes boring after a while. Yes it's well acted, I give you
that, but the movie didn't present any variations beside the visiting
day. There's just literally repetitions of the same practice of the
psychological torture, albeit with new participants as replacements.
With the movie didn't introducing the background of the experiment, it
makes the two hour duration feels so long and boring. But the acting is
something good. It's good that these young talents are acting out the
real reactions of psychological torture to incite fear on the
audience's eyes. Ezra Miller's acting of faking the freak out makes the
suspense grew. Thomas Mann's character displaying resolve is also
something nice to see.
