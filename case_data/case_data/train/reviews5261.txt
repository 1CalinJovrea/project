A Movie Destined To Become A Classic!

This movie is magical and utterly charming. In this film DreamWorks did
it all exactly right. Every voice is precisely as it should be.
Perfection! Chris Pine, Jude Law, Hugh Jackman, too many to list if
you didn't know that was Alec Baldwin doing the Russian accent for
Santa, you would never guess it. The characters, all of them, are
endearing, totally engaging. Sad moments, glad moments, hilarious
moments. I haven't laughed this much in an animated movie since.well,
never, actually. As I said, this one is destined to become a classic. A
wonderful family movie and best of all it doesn't just appeal to the
children, adults will love it too. Every adult in the audience,while I
was there, seemed as captivated as the kids. And how many movies do you
go to these days where, at the end, people applaud? They did for this
one. And rightly so. I know I came out of that theater wishing I could
somehow have my own Little Baby Tooth...and the friend I was with
wished even more that she could have one of the Feisty Elves. You'll
totally understand what I mean after you see this delightful movie.
Don't miss this one!
