Damn right insulting to the human race.

*Spoilers*My girlfriend put this movie on, so I had no prior knowledge of this
movie. I kept on thinking throughout the movie that there is some
supernatural twist, some mystical twist, something hidden; boy was I
wrong. To summarize this piece of garbage: they're all nuts.The mother is such a useless character that has temper tantrums and
does nothing all day. The brother's real character is that of a child.
The main character is shallow and shows no emotion. I can't relate to
any of these characters. The moral of the story, if there is one, is a
grim one at best.This horrendous movie really upset me. The acting was okay for the
characters they were playing, the cinematography kept me in suspense.
However, I couldn't relate to anyone. Nearly every character was out to
get her, as though she was always the victim. It seems as if there is a
hidden secret behind her motives and mysterious past, yet, when it
comes down to it there is nothing; only a sour taste for the viewer
when this disaster ends.Stoker only shows how how human beings can murder, and how easy they
can get away with it. At least make the bad guy funny, or give them a
reason to do what they do.If you hate humanity in some way, you love this movie.
