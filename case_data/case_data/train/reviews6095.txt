Slick production, decent acting, but a poor script

Yet another retelling of Mary Shelley's horror tale Frankenstein, this
one focuses more on action and downplays the horror. I went in with low
expectations after the reviewers mostly panned it. Daniel Radcliffe stars as the hunchback Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's
assistant. He works as a clown in the circus, backstory that was
extrapolated on since Igor isn't even in the original novel. The
hunchback is quickly dispelled in some ridiculous fashion about a puss
filled growth on his back and his spine is straightened by a
contraption so that Radcliffe can walk around normally and be a
handsome lead. His performance wasn't terrible and I hope the Harry
Potter actor continues to get interesting roles in movies.James McAvoy was entertaining as always as the mad scientist himself.
He seemed trapped within the confines of the script and the tired
retelling but usually he lights up the screen in any performance. There
was a hint at a sequel at the end but I think that was just wishful
thinking.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
