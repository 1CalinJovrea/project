Hollywood, go to your room.

Hollywood, we spoke about this just last week. I know you're young and
I know that sometimes means you want to steal ideas from others and
think that by changing language and adding "stars" you will make
something better but you know it doesn't work. We talked about 9 Quenns
just the other day but now you've done it again. A poetic,
heartbreaking, beautifully acted, thriller from Argintinia gets turned
into barely watchable mush. So, go to you room, no dinner and don't do
it again. And once you have realised the error of your ways we will
watch the original and realise that having to read and watch a film
isn't the end of the world and even better, opens you up to the idea
that the action, the great stories, the films that treat the viewer as
an adult, generally, don't come out of Hollywood anymore. Argintinia
alone has been steadily putting out gem after gem, maybe we will have a
mini fest on that country's output and forget bad remakes for a while.
