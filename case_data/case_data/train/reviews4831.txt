Everything in this film is so clichéd that you stood nearly ten feet ahead of it.

House At The End of the Street stars Jennifer Lawrence and is about a
daughter and mother who move into a house where the next door
neighbor's's daughter killed her parents and fled the scene. She only
left one surviving family member which was her brother.A terrible name, terrible plot. Everything about this film is so
clichéd that you stood nearly 10 feet ahead of it. There was no
suspense and scenes that made you want to scream at the characters.
And, just mentioning the characters, they were VERY one-dimensional. I
didn't care about them, what happened to them, or what they will do.
They all felt too generic to even listen to sometimes. I kind of got the impression they were attempting a modernized Psycho-
twist for teens. But it didn't come off, at all. The first half or
maybe quarter was all right. But it went down-hill way too fast for me
to comprehend. I thought the film could have went one direction, but
when it came to the intersection, it looked at the right direction,
gave it the finger, and went in the wrong one. I really had hopes for
this one but it didn't deliver.All in all, a terrible film. The only good thing about it is the first
20-30 minutes, some well-directed sequences and Jennifer Lawrence.
That's all. Best to avoid this one, if you know what's good for you. A low 4/10.
