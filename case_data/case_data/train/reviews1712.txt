Raw...Real  & Gutsy

This was a real unique journey in drama. A mix of studio camera and
innovative character cameras interwoven with the story. Casting brought
two very strong actors together and their chemistry was right on
target. The plot was simple but the ingredient that put this film over
the top was realism and believability. Yes it is very raw and if I got
a dollar for every "F-bomb" I could by a home in Malibu for sure.
Realism is the main course and this film would not lose it's true
identity. I found what really put this movie in the must see category
is that ...One minute your laughing and the next you're crying. There
are very few films that can achieve this element with this level of
quality. This is, without a doubt, one of the very best films of the
year.
