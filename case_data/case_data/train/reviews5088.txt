Stupidity as an Art of Comedy

The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black
is a excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create
hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes Â— absurd in a
comic way. The gags are all unexpected; I was constantly asking myself
"What the hell is going on?", and then burst into laughter. The plot
could seem weird at the beginning, but it's not the main point in this
movie, it is only used to create a context to the jokes. People in the
theater couldn't stop laughing. There is a new and original joke every
two minutes. Russell Crowe plays his part very well, but Ryan Gosling's
performance is already cult. All is in the look in his eyes, and that
stupid expression on his face. Two stupid and impulsive men in an
outrageous world full of porn stars and guns, fighting for...money. And
truth, of course. Always the old truth about some kind of conspiracy
(the only weakness in the movie). Hopefully, Shane Black doesn't insist
too much on that and concentrates himself on the constant jokes. I
guarantee you, you will laugh a lot. I know I've just watched an
excellent movie when I feel sad during the credits, because it's
already over. And then, it's just pure happiness.
