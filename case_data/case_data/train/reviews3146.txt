Another Wonderful Adventure

When Scrat accidentally provokes a continental cataclysm with storm,
Manny is separated from Ellie and Peaches in an iceberg with Diego, Sid
and Granny but he promises that he will find a way to return home. While crossing the ocean, they are captured by the cruel pirate Captain
Gutt and his crew. However they escape and Manny plots a plan to steal
Captain Gutt's ship and return to his homeland in a dangerous voyage
through the sea. But the cruel pirates seek revenge against Manny and
his family and friends."Ice Age: Continental Drift" is another wonderful adventure of Manny,
Diego and Sid and their family and friends. I love this franchise that
support the funny plots in positive values such as love, family,
friendship and loyalty that seem to be forgotten in the present days of
worldwide intolerance, selfishness and corruption. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "A Era do Gelo 4" ("The Ice Age 4")
