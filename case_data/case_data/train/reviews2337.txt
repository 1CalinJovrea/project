First of all, I hate this movie...

I hate this movie.Why might you ask have I rated it 10/10 then? Because it is possibly
the most completely wonderful story I have ever watched.I'm getting on now, I'm a guy in my late 30's who is into action and
violence and explosions and big robots smashing things and never before
have I seen a movie which moved me to tears.There were elements which reminded me of silly things which I have done
in the past and wished I could have done over, moments I wish I could
relive and times I wish I could get - even writing this makes me want
to cry! Damn you Richard Curtis, you've made me into a sissy with your
perfect casting in this bloody beautiful, touching movie!!!I don't usually do sentimentality but this isn't the reason I hate this
movie... No I hate this movie because I think it has replaced the
Princess Bride as my no. 1! And yes I know that was a soppy romance but
it had pirates in it so it was fine!!!See this movie.
