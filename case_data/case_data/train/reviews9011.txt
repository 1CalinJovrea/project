Great dialogue in a flawed movie about a very aggressive girl

Here's the thing, this movie paints a very authentic portrayal as life
as a teenager, and the dialogue is fantastically well written, being
funny, cutting and emphatic. The problem is the main character quite
literally creates almost all her own drama and problems through being
aggressive to everyone around her, and then does it again, again and
again.It's not the teenage angst or the introverted awkwardness (both of
which she has in spades and which are reasonable character traits for
her to have), it's the fact that she consistently verbal attacks her
friend & family, especially when they are trying to apologise or reason
with her kindly; and this aggression is often the only thing driving
the story. I guess that could be considered perfectly realistic, but it
makes everything in the movie so predictable and hard to feel much
sympathy for her.(SPOILERS) Unsurprisingly life gets consistently worse and worse for
her and if you stop the movie when she goes to bed five minutes before
the end, the main character is exactly the same as at the beginning:
selfish, aggressive and with no confidence (so zero character
development there). Lo and behold she wakes up a completely different
person: confident, polite and kind to all around her - an utterly
unbelievable and unrealistic transformation, literally overnight.So I'd have to say it's a mostly fun movie, with well written dialogue,
but a repetitive story and a sloppy tacked-on ending.
