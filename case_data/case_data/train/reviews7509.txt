In 1926, in Copenhagen, the successful landscape painter Einar Wegener
(Eddie Redmayne) is happily married with the portrait painter Gerda
(Alicia Vikander) and they have been trying to have a baby for six
years. When the model Ulla (Amber Heard) does not come to their
apartment, Gerda asks Einar to pose as a woman for her to proceed her
work and Einar uses the alias Lili Elbe. There is a party and Gerda
convinces Einar to pose of Lili to play a prank in the guests. However,
Einar leaves his identity behind and unleashes the personality of Lili.
He lives in a constant dilemma until the day he meets Dr. Kurt
Warnekros (Sebastian Koch) that offers a dangerous surgery to change
his sex. What will Einar do?"The Danish Girl" is a film with the story of a woman trapped in a man
's body and one of the first surgeries to change the sex. The theme may
be attractive for a few people, but the cinematography is magnificent
and the performances are top-notch. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "A Garota Dinamarquesa" ("The Danish Girl")
