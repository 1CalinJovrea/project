Hugely Enjoyable!

Although I too enjoy super hero movies, action movies blah blah - they
are getting tired. Good directors can get the pacing, directing and
acting so right that the same-ol story can be told while still be
entertaining. Especially in science fiction, it seems there are no
original ideas any more.Then comes along Valerian - WOW! What a refreshing and imaginative
world they've developed and an exciting movie they've created! The
trailers truly do not do this movie justice. I watched this movie just
for Luc Besson, because the trailer made the movie look like the usual
Hollywood drivel. What I got instead was an extremely pleasing and
original story that was superbly executed.What I love about the movie is that the plot isn't your typical sci-fi
plot. It plays like a detective story intermingled with action and
amazing visuals, culminating in a very satisfying ending that made me
yearn for sequels to learn more about the universe Besson has created.Well done! This movie deserves to live on! Watch it in the theaters and
be thrilled!
