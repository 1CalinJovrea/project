The movie knows it's stupid and has fun with it

This is not a quality film and I don't think they even meant it to be
good or memorable. If you watched the trailers and *didn't* expect it
to be terrible, I'd be very, very surprised. I would never have paid to
see this. I only saw it because I got passes to a free advance
screening. And it was just as ridiculous as I expected - and I was
pretty entertained. We were laughing pretty hard the whole time.The movie wasn't trying to have a good plot or a surprise twist.
Clocking in at a little over an hour, it could have been season finale
of a B-grade TV series of the same premise. I think movie was just
trying to be funny, and I think their jokes worked. Like how Hansel has
a "medical condition" (not spoiling it here). It doesn't work in a
physiological sense - but who cares? It was really funny that they even
made that connection! There was an incredible amount of gore in this movie; but I suppose
that itself was a joke, given the premise of the movie. Their other
jokes relied on anachronisms (weapons, fanboys, crime investigations).
But they were careful enough that the anachronisms were funny in the
context of the world-building instead of being glaring anomalies.There might be some people complaining about what an inadequate film
this was with respect to plot, but that would be missing the point.
Don't watch this expecting to take away anything - it's really only
just for the lawls.
