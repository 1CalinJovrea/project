Confusing usage of flashbacks.

In this movie, there were way too many flashback scenes and it was
often way too confusing to tell if it was a flashback scene or not.
Each time it cut to a new scene, you had to figure out each time if it
was from 2002 or 2015. Further complicating the matter was how the
actors and actresses had the exact same hair-styles and looked the same
ages in the 2002 and the 2015 scenes. If they would've shot the
2002-era scenes first and then had a make-up and hair crew change the
hairstyles and make-up enough to make it easier to tell which decade
the scenes were from, that would've helped a lot. Better yet, just
doing the film in chronological order would've made the move far better
and a lot more enjoyable to watch. Using flashbacks when everyone
involved was too lazy and unprofessional to make it work knocked the
movie down from a solid 7 to a weak 4.
