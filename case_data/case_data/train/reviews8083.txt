The worst movie I have seen in a long time

I felt compelled to write a review on this movie to warn people away
for this piece of rubbish! I even signed up to IMDb so I could write
this, thats how bad this movie really is. I am still trying to work out
how anyone in their right mind could possibly get any enjoyment from
this total waste of time...I want my 90 minutes of life back! When i
took it back to the video shop I felt like asking for my $6 back. About
20 minutes into it i was hitting the fast forward button and jumping
ahead, hoping it would get better...but it only got worse! I am a guy
but I don't mind the occasional chick flick as long as it is
amusing...this wasn't! Just as other reviewers have said it was full of
every chick flick clich√© known to man, promoted drug use, made you hate
the characters, and got me wondering why this movie was ever made in
the first place...it was boring, predictable and slow. The acting was
average, but I think the main problem was the script, it was dull and
meaningless. Please do yourself a favour and hire something else.
