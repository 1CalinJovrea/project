The definite blockbuster of this summer

Another sci-fi movie starring Tom Cruise didn't interest me much. The
trailer also didn't give me a clear idea of what this movie was about
which made it even surprisingly good to experience it! The thing about
movies like these is that there's a lot of potential to repeat the same
things over and over and leave the viewer uninterested. However, every
time there was something new so it didn't feel repetitive. There were
also elements of humor that were refreshing. The editing should be
admired.Without giving too much away, I'll say that Tom Cruise (Major Cage) is
an absolute novice in warfare, who is involuntarily picked for an
assault on aliens who have taken over Europe. To combat these aliens,
the joint forces around the world have developed a armor suit laced
with heavy weaponry. He is baffled as to why he was picked when he
knows nothing about warfare. That part wasn't satisfactorily answered.
The first day after combat, he begins to develop symptoms of living the
same day over and over again. Baffled, he tries to explain the
situation to others who disregard his views. In Rita, he finds someone
who can understand his situation.There on, it's a thrilling ride of finding out what's causing these
repetitions and finding a means to put an end to it. The movie is fast
paced so no mulling over. Little details of changes in the scenery, how
Cage modifies his behavior both to convince others and to find an
answer, and how events unfold are put forth excellently. I'm sure
enthusiasts can find plot holes aplenty but I found this movie
thoroughly entertaining. If you're in the mood for watching fast-paced
action sci-fi, then I definitely recommend this movie!
