Extraordinary movie.

What an amazing movie. When I see the cast and the title, I immediately
thought of a romantic clich√©, with full of known plot twists, and et
cetera. Rachel McAdams is known for her romantic movies, but this was
just more and more than that.About Time was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I was
immediately captured, and the cast is so brilliant, I believed every
single line. Thank you for this film, I am still under the influence of
this movie. It is about life, in the most raw way. How life should be
lived, and how we should see the world, as it is.Extraordinary movie. Magnificent.
