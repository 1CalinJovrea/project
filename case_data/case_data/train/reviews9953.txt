A grandiose production and stellar cast doesn't help this overly
ambitious mix come together in a coherent movie. The series of
different stories isn't set up well in the beginning so it feels
confusing for a while. Then when they sort of come together it isn't
clever or convincing. Maybe this story was unfilmable. It just felt
like a mix of bad movies shredded and mixed up together. It tries to
have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or
other via corporate corruption, musical composition, the slave trade,
science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.The white actors acting as Asian and vice versa are distractingly
comical although I understand there is a reason for it.It's easy to see why it wasn't a box office success and didn't receive
any major nominations.Skip it.
