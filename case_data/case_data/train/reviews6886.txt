Very disappointed. Begins good but then downhill and keeps getting worst.

Very disappointed. Begins good but then downhill and keeps getting
worst. At one point you may find yourself wondering if some of the long
musicals are just to fill up time. Nobody can spoil this movie since
the ending makes no sense. Seems like the ending was more about
indoctrinating kids that wrong and right don't exist. I enjoyed the
beginning and how multiple stories are integrated logically. But,
around the middle it seems like all the steam is lost and as if they
just did whatever to finish it by ming the songs longer and they just
loosing all creativity. Seriously, while the beginning had creativity
the end did not. It was as if they lost the script and began ad-libbing
everything. Not only did I not like it but my kids hatted it also. My
wife did not like it and my mother fell asleep.
