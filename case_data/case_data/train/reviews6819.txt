Tired and Predictable

The idea of transferring your consciousness to a new body has massive
potential for exploring future ethical and moral implications and how
it would effect society and individuals. None of this was explored,
instead once the body migration is complete we are taken on a boring
narrow predictable Hollywood journey of a typical dude doing everything
he can to save his child and wife, car chases, shoot outs, hand to hand
fighting. Break for a pathetic scene where he bonds with the child and
shows his sensitive side while the wife watches, resolve past life
relationships and then make the "self less" sacrifice at the end so
everyone is happy despite the young child witnessing multiple acts of
violence and death. Someone should actually write a new script one day
instead of churning out this tired old Hollywood format.
