Hit or Miss

This movie you will either enjoy or hate to be honest. If you want
something that is action-packed and filled with cool sci-fi moments do
not see this movie. Yes the movie is sci-fi but it's more about
romance. It also is a tad slower.However, the cast was fantastic and the script was beautiful. There
were cheesy moments but it was still really sweet and well done.
Basically what I am saying, is if you like romance with a twist go and
see it! If you are expecting something like Gattaca, you will be
disappointed.I really loved the movie and felt it held up to the book. I usually
hate movie versions of books but this was really good! If you like the
book chances are you are going to like the movie. There are tweaks of
course, but I thought they were mainly well done and helped get the
same message across.
