Adorable Family Film

The, I think, is a movie that is fun for the whole family. Youngsters
will like the characters, the older children will enjoy the jokes and
plot, and the adults will likely enjoy the movie as well, being able to
catch on to the more "adult" funny references and a story about a
father-daughter relationship that can be appreciated. The movie is fairly fast paced, but most cartoons are, especially ones
that are just 91 minutes long. If you're planning to take your 3 year
old to appreciate the plot, connect with the characters, and understand
the meaning of family and love... that's not happening... it is a
children's movie but it's not Sesame Street. My husband and I took our 2 1/2 year old because it seemed like a cute
movie to watch. It was. Our son sat through the entire movie and danced
with the music, etc. We enjoyed it as well.Was it EXTRAORDINARY? No. Was it a good, fun family film? Yes. I would recommend it. If you're unsure about paying for a ticket at the
theater, you can always wait for the DVD to come out.
