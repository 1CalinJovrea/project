Style over substance, superficial melodrama

Finally the 2 hours were over and I could leave! This is one of the
worst movies of the year - save yourself the money and buy the book, if
you insist.What a pretentious, over-the-top melodrama... I felt seriously
embarrassed to sit through it. Overall bad performances, possibly
created by the director's insistence to try some new style.Newsflash: It didn't work.The theater-style setup, constant moving of set pieces,
semi-choreography of background characters, constant musical
accompaniment and mixing it all with some realistic sets does all but
incapacitate whatever seriousness was left in the source material.If feels like a puppet theater with airs. Razzie please.
