Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of
a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she
yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do
right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint
through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean
people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to
survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe
zone."Train to Busan" is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go
on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the
virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the
screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to
succumbing to genre clich√©s, such as the one cowardly individual who
will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time.
Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of
carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that
the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get
completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous,
but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances
range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character
Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his
daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be
compassionate.Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this
from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang
Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.Seven out of 10.
