Wait what?!?!?

As a true fan of the first and second movie I thought I could give the
franchise a last chance but it turned out to be as expected... really
bad and weird... The three cannibal brothers aren't seen enough and all
of the motel/sect thing is just out of place. An other thing that is
out of place is the sex scenes and the weird deaths including a man
exploding because he was filled with water, yeah WTF! Overall this
movie is maybe worth a watch for fans that wants to be disappointed but
otherwise this sucked more than the third and just as much as the
fourth, still better than the fifth though... And don't even get me
started with the make up and visual effects... Please people stop
making Wrong turn movies PLEASE!!! Valeri Milev you almost killed me
and I'm sure you will with the 7th movie which will hopefully be the
last one...
