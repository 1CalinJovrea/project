It's on point in all the right places

We need a movie like this from time to time. It's written so well. I
wish I had read the book first. These movies help is to take a step off
the fast wheel and just take a moment to think. I think the movie
demonstrates a certain feeling that we all become quite numb in our
lives. Numb to other people's feelings, numb to our own needs and numb
to our pain and to the needs of others. It doesn't surprise me that
someone would write a dreadful review about this movie. I ask for what
motive? Movies are not for everyone. There are many movies that I don't
like but I don't feel compelled to scrutinise what was bad or wrong
about it. I have grown up with Will Smith and I have always loved his movies. I
think if you love Will Smith you'll just love this movie anyway. Love, Tine Death, three key things that connect us all. It's true. And
this movie has the ability to relate to anyone who is perceptive of
their circumstances, surroundings and open to possibilities and ideas. This movie is a wonderful journey, I never picked my phone up once, I
was intrigued and absorbed with this compelling tale of grief. Yes it
deals with grief yet it doesn't bring you down. A great cast! Simply perfection. The story is more than it seems and if
you connect with it you will make some links and realisations and
messages will reach out to you, mostly about the importance of trust
and human kindness. It's nice to believe in that, after a bad day when
you feel invisible to almost everyone. The composer surprised me, refreshing and really in touch with the
emotional narrative of this journey. Well done all round. Deserved winner of any award.
