Very Disappointed

I'll first of all point out that I am quite the Silent Hill fan before
explaining that this director did not get the point of Silent Hill.The games and indeed some aspects of the last film provoked fear
through the unknown, the fact that the characters were totally lost and
on their own in a place where anything could happen. The creatures were
scary and the less we knew about them, the scarier they were. In the
last film the acting was great and there was plenty of suspense, and a
decent director and art team running the project.This one had some great visuals, the environments were great to look
at. The CGI effects however, were not. Neither was the poor use of the
actors talent, and the over use of extra human characters and monsters.
These combined with a terrible attempt to almost follow the 3rd game
TOO closely whilst remaining loyal to the first film, makes for a bad
experience. It's nice to see that the director here tried to make a
nice little tie in with both the games and the film, but the last film
wandered into it's own little story, which luckily turned out well. he
should have stuck to following the games, or the last film instead of
both. Then he needed to write up some less clich√©' lines for the
actors.
