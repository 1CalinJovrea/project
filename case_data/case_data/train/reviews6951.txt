What is going on!!!

This is seriously one of the worst movies ever made and I feel
compelled to tell all who is just thinking on spending a dime on this
useless movie if you can even call it that - don't do it!. Only good
thing about the movie was Michael Cera who had approx. 2 mins all in
all. (Funny stuff by him), but as a movie it sucked in every category
imaginable; script, acting, special effects....the list is long, too
long for me to even have the energy to continue this review. But I will
say one last thing and that is 'how the hell is it possible to get the
rating of 7.1'? IMDb should really soon create some sort of
ghost-review detection, because no way in hell would this movie get
above 3 avg. If someone had not boosted it with multiple tens. Cant
believe it - create a shitty movie with well known actors and get away
with it by tricking the audience on IMDb. Robbery in broad daylight if
you ask me.
