Better and Better than the First Movie

In 2023, the Purge Night is about to start for the next 12 hours. A
stranger (Frank Grillo) leaves home and drives his car with a
mysterious purpose. Meanwhile, the couple Liz (Kiele Sanchez) and Shane
(Zach Gilford) are provoked by a masked man. They drive in the highway
and their car unexpectedly stops. Soon they find that it was sabotaged
by the group of masked man that are waiting for the beginning of the
Purge. When it begins, they are hunted down by the masked man.
Meanwhile, Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and her daughter Cali (ZoÃ« Soul) find
that Eva's father sold himself to a wealthy family since he is a burden
to Eva and Cali sine he is sick. Out of the blue, an army invades their
building and breaks into their apartment. They are taken to the leader
but the stranger decides to save them and kills the soldiers. Meanwhile
Liz and Shane hide inside the stranger's car and he decides to help
them to survive. However his car is hit by the bullets and he needs
another car for his mission. Eva tells that her friend Tanya (Justina
Machado) lives a few blocks away and he would borrow her car. Soon the
stranger gets involved by the four survivors and helps them during the
dangerous night."The Purge: Anarchy" is better and better than the first movie since it
is an action film in the style of "Warriors", "Escape from New York"
and "Hostel". The premise is still stupid, but there is an ironic
criticism to the America Society together with lots of action. My vote
is seven. Title (Brazil): "Uma Noite de Crime: Anarquia" ("One Night of Crime:
Anarchy")
