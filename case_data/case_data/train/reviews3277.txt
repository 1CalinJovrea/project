What a Shame, we live where Studio's take control

being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited
for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was
pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to
breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots
to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should
love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which
is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they
would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is
all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the
film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another
independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't
use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out
everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's
that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not
see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw
it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one
too, and it doesn't even change a little.Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by
Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.
