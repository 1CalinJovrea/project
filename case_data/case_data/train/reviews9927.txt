Terrible movie - besides cinematography

I just finished watching this movie. I'm too frustrated to review this
completely. In one word: Skip! Don't watch this movie. How is this a
thriller, when, 85% of the movie, the story never moves, and the last
15% of the story, something totally unpredictable happens? A good
thriller builds up the story slowly and makes you keep guessing
throughout. This movie doesn't do anything like that. You will be shown
beautiful places throughout the movie, and in the end, something which
you didn't expect happens, and BAM!
