Beyond Crap.

Easily the Worst Star Trek I have ever seen. Has Zero elements known
for being Trek and simply transplanted Fast & Furious into Outer Space.Story-wise its utter trash. Would Starfleet have the tech to build a
vast city-station of the type seen in this at such an early stage in
Federation history? No.It moves so fast its incomprehensible- the CGI and lens flares make it
look so synthetic I realized how good the miniatures and physical
effects looked in the early movies and ached to see them again.Krall- the bad guy's motives are never really explained and is a
totally forgettable villain- just an excuse for more CGI.The only saving grace are the performances of Simon Pegg and Karl Urban
who really nail their performances as Scotty and Bones.So thanks to JJ and company TWO of the greatest SF franchises lay in
ruins, raped and eviscerated. ST and SW.
