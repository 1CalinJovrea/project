See through the eyes of a killer

This movie is shot extremely well. The whole movie is shot in the
perspective on an intense serial killer that has extreme psychologic
problems. This idea of shooting could of been a complete disaster, but
they handled it masterfully. When watching this film you can feel the
intensity and passion through the killer's eyes and watch as he carries
out his psychotic cravings. Elijah Wood is brilliant in this movie. Although you do not see him
very often, his dialogue is extremely important. He adds emphasis on
the creepiness of the character with his speech patterns. This is a must see for horror/slasher lovers since it gives a whole new
perspective on this genre.
