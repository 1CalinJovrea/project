Unoriginal and Stupid

In New York, the college student Justine (Lorenza Izzo) joins a group
of activists led by Alejandro (Ariel Levy) and he invites her to travel
to Peru to protest against a timber industry that is destroying the
Amazon rain forest. The group uses their cellphones to film the
destruction and send the footages through Internet. Alejandro uses
Justine that is almost killed by one security guard to succeed in his
intent of calling attention of audiences. When the group is returning
to civilization, the plane blows-up and crashes into the forest. Soon
the survivors discover that they are not alone and they are abduct by a
tribe of Indians. But their nightmare becomes worse when they realize
that the Indians are cannibals. "The Green Inferno" is an unoriginal and stupid film of cannibals by
Eli Roth. The story is not well-written and Justine joining the group
of activists is totally unconvincing. The conclusion is awful. There
are at least two better movies about cannibals: "Cannibal Holocaust" is
extremely realistic, disturbing, cruel and sick, and Eli Roth did not
dare to depict such violence; and "Cannibal Ferox" that is also
realistic and cruel. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Canibais" ("Cannibals")
