The emotion of the actors made John Greens New York Times Best Seller,
real. They brought depth to our pages, they brought emotion to our
dripping eyes, and they brought warmth to our hearts. The movie is about a teenage girl who has terminal lung cancer, she was
saved by a experimental treatment when she was younger. Now as she is
older, her parents feel that she is suffering from depression which is,
as Hazel describes it a "side affect of dying." Her parents encourage
her to go to a cancer support group where she meets Agustus Waters,
ex-cancer carrier and minus one leg. Soon Hazel and Gus find themselves
head over heels planning to love each other until oblivion ultimately
catches up with them. A "sick love story"The actors casted for these roles were amazing. Shailene, played Hazel
flawlessly, she was smart, and funny and cold just as Hazel was. Ansel,
was equally amazing, his amazing humor and timing made this movie! The
amazing actors and actresses combined with the entire crew, the way the
movie was filmed is just inviting, and they way text messages and
emails were displayed will start a new movie trend.Some call it a tear jerker, some revolutionary, but me, I call it a
spectacularly made masterpiece. You will laugh and you will cry. And
some parts will send those magical shivers down your spine.I would recommend this movie to... Any reader of the Fault in our Stars
Anyone looking for a fantastic movie A guy who wants a romantic movie
for two, that he may enjoy himself A girl who wants to just cry through
an entire movie Someone who wants to see a spectacularly made
masterpiece"Okay"
