Terrifyingly brilliant. You'll float too.

What persuaded me to watch this movie was the blessing bestowed upon it
by the stories original creator, Stephen King, who claimed: "I wasn't
prepared for how good it really was".He's not wrong."IT" is quite extraordinary. The attention to detail, the subtle but
effective comedic undertone and the exquisite cinematography not only
do the original title proud, they make this re-imagining of the
original classic even better than its predecessor. It's a very scary film but what impressed me was how true the film
sticks to the original's tricks; it isn't filled with loud in-your-face
jump scares, in fact, a lot of what makes this film scary is the slick
cinematography and intricate shadow play. The use of lighting and
creation of atmosphere is what makes this film so tense, which is why
it's perfectly suited for those who like Horror movies but without the
obnoxious gore.Watched the pre-release as a critic - August 28th.
