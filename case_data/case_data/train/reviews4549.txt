I absolutely loved this movie!

I absolutely loved this movie and everyone in the theater was clapping
at the end. I do not believe that I have seen a standing ovation before
in a movie theater that didn't have a live performance. It was humorous
and dramatic and silly and I just loved it! Julia Roberts was devious
and cunning with a wacky edge to her part! Lilly Collins is absolutely
gorgeous just as I imagined Snow White should look. The Prince's demise
was hysterical and the dwarfs were the perfect touch to this version of
Snow White. I liked this version better than the Disney movie! Mirror
Mirror was absolutely entertaining! I WILL BUY THIS ONE WHEN IT COMES
OUT ON DVD or BLU-RAY!
