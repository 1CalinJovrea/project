Sharknado meets Starship Troopers

Clich√©s and predictability abound. Was this deliberate or did everyone
miss the mark by miles? The distance between intentional laughs is
great but not to worry as you will find yourself laughing during chase
scenes and the heard it before soooo many times canned dialogue
stripped from the shelves of the most generic action movies. Think
Moonlighting a la Bruce Willis and Sybil Shepard meets any line spoken
by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Perhaps this will be the
springboard for director Dean Devlin for bigger and better things as
even James Cameron had to start somewhere. Save your money and valuable
time by staying home and watching Babe: Pig in the City. If you do
decide to see this slapstick of a movie I suggest you pass the time by
counting how many times you laugh out loud at the cheesier than a Nacho
Cheese Doritos Locos Taco dialogue. I lost count.
