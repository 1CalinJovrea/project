Arrested development

Being a grumpy old guy, I'm not at all the target audience for this
film, so please bear that in mind when I tell you that I found this a
fairly tedious coming-of-age movie. I admired aspects of it - in
particular the performances of Bel Powley and Alexander Skarsg√•rd - but
I wasn't able to maintain my interest in the story.The biggest obstacle was, I think, that Minnie, the eponymous teenage
girl, was not the only adolescent around. All the adults in her life
were at various stages of arrested development. This is possibly the
point both of the movie and of the novel it is based on: how can a
child grow up when all her role-models are children themselves? It's an
interesting question, but when transmitted as drama the audience finds
itself stuck in high school for the duration.
