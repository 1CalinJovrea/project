"A really boring thriller with a really bad plot"

The movie happens at the year 1997 on Halloween where two teens
remember their past in an eerie way.The plot of this movie was completely senseless leading nowhere. When
we feel something is going to happen nothing happens leaving us
stranded midway thinking what just happened. Don't misunderstand this
movie genre as horror as there is no horror they tried to make it
thrilling but no its not. A big shout out to the boy who played Jonah
he did a wonderful job but the rest a big no. there was a lot of
promises throughout this movie but it all remained as promises and
could not be made into something watchable.NO I would not recommend this movie to anyone.My Rating 0/10
