one hell of a movie

just great, crazy movie. not your usual prison movie. completely
unpredictable. it feels like the writer was just trying to surprise
himself. Vince was just extraordinary. great performance. enjoyed every
minute of it. and the ending is crazy too. it's like the writer used a
predictable story line to surprise the viewer. just crazy man.
