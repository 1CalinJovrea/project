contender of the most horrible movie of 2016

We had been treated on a real horror-esque fest this summer. From
botched up remakes of movies to well bad moms. There are no redeeming
qualities. At least the new Ghostbusters had me laughing a bit now and
again but this movie is nearly as bad as Himalaya, a three + hour movie
i was forced to watch in highschool of how indigenous people herd their
yaks over the mountain paths. I never walked out on a movie, except on
this one.But back to the movie. Really Really bad script, not funny, man hating,
failure to communicate and no sense of humor sums this erghm "movie" up
quite nicely. basically story goes like this; Women make active choices
they later regret ( like finding wealthy men and marrying them, plus
having kids while sitting at home or just fail to produce anything
noteworthy because of the lack of education... because they got
children quite early). Then the say enough is enough.. go girlpower..
and act like deranged immature college frat boys/girls. Then they roll
stupid and immature with each other and smash it into one big pretzel
of fail.So conclusion: actresses, though still easy on the eyes seem to be the
ones with their careers winding down ( some aren't as good of an
actress to begin with). the so called humor is so immature that it is
facepalm retch worthy. The script is even worse and yes, one could
argue that actresses can't shine if the script is terrible.To end there is a disturbing trend in Hollywood where in certain movies
the "hate" for one or more groups, oftentimes men in general, can see
oozing like a slimer that just flew through the theater screen.
Directors some advice: keep your SJW/feminasty social construct
politics and Utopian dreams out of a movie that could have been OK-ish
if you had bothered writing a half decent script.
