Girls version of hangover but worse

This was pretty stupid wasn't as good as the hangover & to me it wasn't
all that good...if you seen one you seen them all...super impractical &
if you seen 1 you seen them all. Can't believe Scarlett J. Starred in
this crap lol There were so many parts that was just super idiotic &
not funny....only a couple of parts that were a little funny...super
cheesy in general...if there is nothing else to watch sure but I would
hate to know I spent money to watch it
