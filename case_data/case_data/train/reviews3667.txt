Surprisingly Good For How Simple It Is

When a videographer answers a Craigslist ad for a one-day job in a
remote mountain town, he finds his client is not at all what he
initially seems.Initially, I was very skeptical that this would be very good. It seems
to have a cast and crew of around ten people, which is not often enough
to make a movie. And then it is found footage, which is by far the
worst trend in horror today. Even more than zombies, which is hard to
believe.There are moments that make no sense, because you might wonder why a
camera would be on. That is a fault most found footage has. But you
sort of have to accept that aspect. And then, it sort of gets better as
it goes. Not because it's brilliant, but because the performances are
rather effective. Scripted dialogue comes out sounding natural and "the
creep" is just weird enough to be believable and disturbing.
