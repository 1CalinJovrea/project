Into the abyss

I wish I could say that this was a great, even good movie but alas
Terrible is the word I would use ! I love fantasy, I like musicals but
this fantasy musical was a non starter and didn't end soon enough. The
singing and songs from the start were mind numbing on the point of
brain washing with they"r nonsensical repetitiveness. So many great
actors, such lovely scenery and backdrops yet what a total loser of a
movie. I think if this had have been a non musical offering or along
the lines of the TV series " Once Upon A Time" I'm sure it would have
worked out much better. I think this was always destined for the stage
rather than the big screen I am disappointed to say.
