7 Noomis are a real viewing pleasure!

Just after watching Unlocked, also starring Noomi Rapace, I hesitated
before watching this one: wouldn't too many Noomis at the same time
"spoil the broth"? But I finally watched it, and enjoyed every moment
of the movie. Glenn Close is deliciously horrific (reminds me of those
Nazi wardens in concentration camps), and Rapace is simply
extraordinary. The bad guys are scary enough, the atmosphere of a
one-child-only society fairly oppressive. A nice one before going back
to school...
