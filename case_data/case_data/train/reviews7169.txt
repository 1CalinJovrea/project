That kind of movie that makes your day

This is my first review on the IMDb website and i have been a member
for more that 9 years now, that's who much i loved this movie. It just
give you that positive thoughts and energy within a lovely comedian
scenario. I loved how they mix between the classic culture with the modern one.
It was very interesting to watch how they remind our generation about
the habits which they are missing from the classic one.De Niro and Anne Hathaway have excellent work chemistry. Director and
camera teams made a great job too... Team work, thank you for this
lovely movie...
