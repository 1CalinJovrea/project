Fake advertising indeed

Someone reviewed before about Tommy Wieseau being in the movie for 10
seconds, I'd say that's an overstatement. He's kind of on screen
clearly for maybe 5 seconds tops. Cheesy cameo he say's a line almost
directly from "The Room".I went to see this movie thinking it might have some terribly bad but
amusing parts. I was wrong, just bad everything. Surprised movies like
this still exist somehow.
