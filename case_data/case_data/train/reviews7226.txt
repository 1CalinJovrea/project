Visual treat

I only saw this film because I am a del Toro fan--Pan's Labyrinth is my
favorite movie. While Crimson Peak does not come anywhere near the
quality of Labyrinth in terms of the script, it still showcases del
Toro's unique skill for beauty and suspense.The sets, costumes and general atmosphere are sumptuous in that
signature del Toro way. The luxurious train on the heroine's robe that
audibly thumps behind her as she sweeps down the staircase? Yes,
please. There is a nod to all the images our minds ever conjured while
reading fairy tales. The rich colors, the music, the textures all help
draw us in to this world and settle us in for the story.The film is not without its flaws. There are a few glaring plot
contrivances that had me groaning. There is a superficial quality to
the scenes involving Thomas Sharpe's clay mining business.I was impressed with Jessica Chastain's talent for conveying two
conflicting emotions at once, all playing out on her face, reminiscent
of Gillian Anderson in Bleak House.
