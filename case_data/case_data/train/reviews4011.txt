Expect the unexpected, and then expect the expected, and then the unexpected again

I saw a pre-screening of Happy Death Day and let me tell you, it was
one of the most fun theater experiences I've had. The movie doesn't
take itself too seriously, which is definitely for the best. If anyone
walks into a movie about a sorority girl living the same day over and
over and being killed over and over and expects it to be some
genre-defying horror perfection, that's on them. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie by any means. Jessica
Rothe as Tree Gelbman and Israel Broussard as Carter Davis are
fantastic as the two leads. They have excellent chemistry and make us
root for them. Rothe's character wasn't the typical horror movie
sorority girl, either. She was cunning and badass. She made us believe
she could actually figure this mess out. If you don't change your mind
on who the killer is at least twice throughout the film, you aren't
paying attention.There are curveballs thrown left and right, which made my theater gasp
and yell numerous times. You think the movie is about to end on at
least two different occasions. The script is smart, there's horror,
there's comedy, there's drama. Happy Death Day takes you in numerous
directions, while also making sure you have fun along the way. This is
definitely one of my all-time favorite campy horror flicks out there.
It even pokes fun at Groundhog Day, which it very clearly took some
inspiration from. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror; again,
it doesn't redefine the genre and there are definitely an abundance of
clich√©s. With that, though, there are still a handful of clever moments
I certainly was not expecting.
