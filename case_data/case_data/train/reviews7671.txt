Ridiculous Nonsensical Yet Beautiful Crap

Despite the title, let me begin anew by stating that I absolutely love
Joe Wright. He makes beautiful films, and this one is not the
exception. However, the script was nonsensical and lacked any sort of
sensitivity or heart (why is Anna even supposed to fall for Vronsky in
this version? And, why should we care? this movie did not give us
reason to do so), (most of) the acting (save Macfadyen, Macdonald,
Williams, and sometimes Taylor- Johnson) was ridiculous and
over-the-top, and the encompassing of the theater - while a brilliant
idea - was completely lacking for an on-screen venture.This was basically a myriad of fashion photo-shoots for Miss Knightley.
Should've just been a cheesy commercial itself.And, I consider this a travesty considering that this review is coming
from a moviegoer who absolutely adores Matthew Macfadyen, Jude Law, and
Kelly Macdonald, who are all great actors. But unfortunately, this
entire movie fell flat for me.-ginger
