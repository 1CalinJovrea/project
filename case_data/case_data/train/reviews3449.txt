led astray by other reviews?

too many holes to be good really, too convenient. watchable in that i
watched the whole movie, but as it progressed i became more and more
puzzled by the abundance of high rated reviews. trying to avoid
spoilers, i applaud the style, the cornerstones of the plot, but
really? it misses for mine, nice idea that just does not quite come
off. perhaps i am de-sensitised also, but not too violent. the fight
scenes could use better construction (not that i can fight, i just mean
my impression) anyway. good on you vince. different, i think a missed
opportunity.
