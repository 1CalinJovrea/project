This is why I love movies

I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week
and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses
the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other
movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it:
this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard
to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this.
And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was
about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious
when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be
honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second
time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters
I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it
reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to
punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I
think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's
definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want
to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my
favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on
many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know
it'll be on mine.
