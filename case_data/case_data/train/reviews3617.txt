The secrecy made everything better! (NO SPOILERS)

First of all, if you want to watch '10 Cloverfield Lane', make sure to
avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this
review without spoilers, even if it's a bit difficult considering the
movie I just witnessed.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an amazing mystery/suspense movie that serves
as a sequel to the 2008 hit 'Cloverfield'. I have to say, it's hard to
tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years
because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I
really really liked it.Me and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read
as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately,
the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the
story, and the fact that it was a sequel to 'Cloverfield' is going to
make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie?
Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty
much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)John Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The
soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.The movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off
from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is
made with a perfect montage, and there's no dialogue for the first 4-5
minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported
to the bunker you saw in the trailers.I will say it again, go watch this film, and don't read anything about
it on the internet. I can't recall the last time a movie kept me
guessing like this one. If you tend to get bored and tired by the usual
clich√©s in movies, buy your ticket to '10 Cloverfield Lane' and enjoy
your time at the movies.Clever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great
performance by the cast, it's hard to complain about this film!9/10
