Whoa...nice story and potential

Excellent addition to the Spiderman lore. Great to see the additional
details of being Peter Parker, and Spiderman. Loved hearing the
smartass Spidey as in the comics.The continuation of the mayhem from Ozcorp looks amazing.Well worth watching.really.Peace :) Oh, not new, now but weird add on at end.What more can I say ...need 10 lines of text... It's Spidey so you
already know, and will nod as story flows along. Would like the film
companies add cameos of all the other heroes that live in NYNY as
Spidey works in city, regardless of contracts and film company
copyrights. We all know Spidey knows all the teams and solo heroes in
area. So to one day seeing the Torch and Spidey talking on a roof, or
DD knowing by his heartbeat as Pete shoots pictures.. be a true
believer!
