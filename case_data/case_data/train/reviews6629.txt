Do not bother at all costs!

Probably the most wasted hour and a bit of my whole life - this film
would work fine if it picked 1 of the story lines.the synopsis is deceiving and I was so disappointed I almost stopped
watching it.Really purely on special effects(Which are mediocre at best) and
intrigue (Namely, 'Surely this film has to get better?'), it has
nothing going for it!I am a massive fan of the genre of Horror dating back from the 1970s
upwards, I'll admit many of the new horrors really lack something these
days and tend to go more for the 'scare' or 'graphic' factors, this
film is 7, maybe 10 (In honesty I stopped counting through boredom)
short films with a sub plot. The acting wasn't even worth getting excited about. I suppose if I'd
gone into this film with more information on what its about I would
have been happier.
