A True Masterpiece

"Loving Vincent" is a film to be seen by all ages, and can be seen many
times. Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman created a masterpiece with "an
orchestra" of very fine 125 artists who produced each frame - an oil
painting - 65,000.00 frames, in all, of the animated Van Gogh' story.
In the history of animation, frames were produced by hand, but never in
a form of oil paintings with such rich texture, mimicking Van Gogh's
strokes. Art teachers can use "Loving Vincent" as a material to teach
modern art, to make students fall in love with art and become artists.
A simply stunning achievement of two directors who combined their best
talents and created a new classic.
