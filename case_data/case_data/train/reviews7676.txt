Hypocritical and useless

Let's get one thing out the way: this is horror for the masses, in the
worst possible meaning of such definition. It's domesticated, neutered,
lowest common denominator, watered down horror at its worst and, as
such, is a bar lowerer for the whole genre.With that said, here's a list of adjectives and definitions that passed
through my mind while I was watching this: unfocused, half-baked,
hypocritical, unrealistic af, lame, predictable, stupid to the point of
being downright offensive, heavy handed, useless. Mostly hypocritical
(for what it tries to say about "human nature") and useless, anyway.The only positives are that is generally well acted (with a tragic
waste of John C. McGinley) while featuring some beautiful shots
(nothing to write home about, though) and it's not shy on gore (for a
mainstream movie). These, along with some humor here and there, are the
only reason why I'm giving it 4/10 instead of 1.The story has been done to death in countless other movies, novels,
short stories, comic books, TV shows and video games (so, for the
geniuses claiming this is a rip-off of danganronpa: yeah, no. That game
is as much as rip off of other, better things, than this is). If you
want some examples of movies that do the same kind of storyline, only
way better than this: "Cube" (1997), "The Experiment" (both the German
original, 2001 and the American remake, 2010), "The Mist" (2007) or any
adaptation of "Lord of the Flies", really.
