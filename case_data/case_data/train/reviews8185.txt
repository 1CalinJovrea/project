Tearfully delightful

I believe what makes this film a delightful experience isn't so much
the story but the brilliant performances by Sally Hawkins and Ethan
Hawke. As the two main characters Maud & Everett these two actors
become the characters they are portraying.Here is a simple story of two socially inept people that find one
another and experience all the joy, anger, heartbreak and peace that
goes with love. The setting is both beautiful and bleak - just like
Maud & Everett!Anyone who is incapable of getting emotionally involved with these two
and their story as it is being portrayed on screen has an emptiness in
their heart.
