Don't waste your time...

The movie poster is nice and inspires much higher expectations... but
the story eventually meanders into a travesty of a climax and finale...
It packs no mystery or intelligent story lines. The viewers are
bombarded with a beaten-track B level movie-making and a story that
could've worked but never did. It's got a childish plot and bad acting
that's not worth the time spent on it. The characters and the
ridiculous looking monsters do not develop and stay as static as the
first time you meet them... they're just there to fill the screen. I
gave the 3 points to the cinematographer and the set manager.
