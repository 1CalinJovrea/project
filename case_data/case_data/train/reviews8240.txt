Finally!!! A solid comedy!!!

I have to admit I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I
laughed during the whole movie and truly didn't notice how did the time
pass by. For me this is the best American comedy I've seen in the past
couple of years. Very well directed, very good cast. The movie is very
casual but at the same time so full of content. I can't come up with
any flaws in it. It was not gooey like you would normally expect.
Jennifer Aniston was just marvelous as always. I also liked Will
Poulter very well. I recommend the film to everyone, not only comedy lovers (I'm surely
not one of those).
