Not a worthy movie for IMDb top 250 list

I really hate giving any movie a bad review but i have to make a
exception for this film. I recently read a news article reporting that
PK has entered IMDb top 250 list. I wish this was a glitch in IMDb's
algorithm or else the quality of IMDb has dropped to a new low. As a
lover for good cinema I am in my strong opinion that this film has no
outstanding acting, direction or story which will allow it to be the
top film (250) of all time. The story of this film is mediocre with
nothing exceptional in it. The worst part of this film is the
direction. Comparing to Rajkumar Hirani's other film, this film is
poorly directed and i blame him alone for this bad review.
