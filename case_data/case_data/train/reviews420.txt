Magnificent Live-Production Captured On Film!

What an innovative film!Contrary to one of the reviews which canned everything about the movie
from the plot to the actors' singing voices to camera angles (by
someone who, to me, is obviously not familiar with the live theater
productions of this musical nor it appears the he has ever been to
any), I find this movie version is a a state-of-the-art capture of one
the world's great musicals for the cinema screens!The live singing is superb, showing the fragility (and flaws) of every
performer ... and that's what a live-performance is all about! This
movie captured a live theater production on screen for all cinema goers
who never had the chance to enjoy a live theater production!Kudos to everyone involved! A must-see for all! And a must-buy for
those who wish to have a copy of this masterpiece for a keepsake!
