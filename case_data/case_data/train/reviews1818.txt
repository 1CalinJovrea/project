Excellent movie. See the 2-D though.

I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero
movies, and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a
great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I
liked the supporting cast, except thought they could have done better
with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman (Kal-El) being born,
and quickly jumps into him being in his 20's and saving people. They
show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would
have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman
movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton
of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good,
but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big
fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like 'The
Hobbit', I didn't think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend
seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10. Good action, fun,
entertaining movie.
