The Nice Guys = A Disjointed Hot Mess

The Nice Guys is one of the worst movies that I have ever watched. It
was a bunch of unconnected nonsense. It was not funny at all. A 13 year old girl is leading the "P.I.s"? Give us a break .. if the
daughter had been 21 then maybe but not 13yrs old. And in the 70s, a
13yr old girl would have been fresh meat at a Hollywood Hills porn
party. The most nonsensical story line was the DOJ chief's daughter made a
"porn" movie and inserted into a promotional film to be played at a car
show? Are you kidding me? The only part of the movie that I like is when Amelia was shot. Yes ..
Something believable happened in that moment.Even with all of the action in the movie, I kept waiting for something
important to happen.
