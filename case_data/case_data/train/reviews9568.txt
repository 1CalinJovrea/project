Dame Judi Reigns Supreme

Her second portrayal of the former queen is just as enjoyable as the
fist time and the bonus is that with this (and Mrs Brown) it's based on
fact. Of course they had to twist it a bit but that was to give it the
humorous spin. Bertie is played brilliantly too! There were so many fun
things that Abdul and Mohammed were experiencing their first days in
England that I can imagine would be a novelty to someone from a hotter
climate. Truly charming story.
