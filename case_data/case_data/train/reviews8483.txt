hope it does well enough to launch a franchise

I haven't read the books (I gather there are 8-12 of them) but I
enjoyed the movie. I was surprised at how well Dylan O'Brien did in the
lead role. I wasn't too impressed with the Maze Runner series as far as
acting goes, though O'Brien did well in a supporting role in Deepwater
Horizon.The dialogue is nothing special and the plot line is formulaic, but
it's well-paced and held my interest. Another reviewer complains that
the fight choreography is exaggerated but maybe that person hasn't
watched the John Wick movies. This is mild, compared to those.Someone who's read the books will have to comment on the strained
mentor relationship between Rapp, the assassin of the title, and the
character played by Michael Keaton. I wasn't sure where the dynamic
there came from, or was headed.
