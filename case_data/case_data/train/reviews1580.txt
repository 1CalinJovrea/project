Paranoid Android

Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done
visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how
close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at
least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes
a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots.
Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big,
beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless
futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It
is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject
that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence
since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that
relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a
dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under
your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced
state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll.The less you know going into a film like this, the better your
experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction
masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every
other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the
soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina
an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's
best written work to-date.
