how not to portray human emotions

The relationships and expressions of emotions feel incredibly forced
and lack all subtlety. Instead of any authenticity of human emotion its
portrayal of cynicism, forgiveness and self-discovery are unbelievably
poor and cloying. Cringe-worthy. I have never written a review on IMDb
before but the 7.3 score this movie has compelled me to write my very
first one. Jesus Christ I wish I could travel back in time and tell
myself not to watch this. It is so, so bad. I suppose it has the
'skeleton' of a good story but the way the characters are portrayed and
the relationships are played out felt staged, shallow and anything but
authentic. Some scenes are just utterly unbearable. Do not subject
yourself to this painful experience. I am sure the actors are capable
in their own ways but whatever talents they possess, they were rendered
insignificant by the sheer terribleness of the story itself. Please
watch something else.
