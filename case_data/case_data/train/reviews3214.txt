I don't get it. Most disappointed I've been in awhile.

I have not been this disappointed in a long time. Had I known I was
coming to watch a movie that was making fun of horror movies, I
wouldn't have wasted my time or money. Original as it was, it lacked three major things I expected: 1. Horror
(which was replaced with comedy) 2. Good Acting (I was sorely
disappointed, the characters didn't seem that into their roles) 3. some
sort of intelligent story (based on hype and previews)I felt bad for none of the characters that died. None of the characters
really developed throughout the movie. The story was just terrible with
too many unanswered questions and the film makers chastised the review
groups prior to releasing the film for asking about a sequel.Some more about the reason that they needed a virgin, jock, whore, fool
and scholar would have been nice to know. Why they were sacrificing to
the gods could have been more clear. Why they were involving all the
other countries would have been nice, but mostly, explain this to me:Which one of the Asian children in the classroom was the whore? the
jock? the fool? I'm assuming at that stage in their lives they were
virgins and scholars...I never found myself startled during the movie, not one jump. I feel
cheated that I went to a horror movie to realize it was a poorly done
comedy. I don't get it. I must be wrong. Everybody else seems to disagree with
me.
