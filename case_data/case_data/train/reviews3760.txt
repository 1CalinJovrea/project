just original and nothing more

A story about mysterious set of events that continue happening to one
man at 2:22 every single day. Michiel Huisman stars is an air traffic
controller from New York losing his job after experiencing a weird
flash of light causing him to blank out at 2:22. The plot tells about
his experiencing more and more weird events at the same time after he
meets a woman, played by Teresa Palmer. This appears being quite a
unique idea for a film story overall it's not easy to understand what
is exactly going on. Is it the movie the stars or about this guy? Is it
something else? The full cast includes Sam Reid, Maeve Dermody, Remy
Hii, and Simone Kessell. To sum up an original idea but the result is
nothing more than a barely decent entertainment.
