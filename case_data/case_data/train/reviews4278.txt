10
Defend the 10 again

I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren't
any movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you were
a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too,
and had already played the character once with horrible results wished
for redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise
above the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into
these days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool?
Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, though
he did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possibly
partly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been done
right in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lips
sowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans would
say he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of
playing a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comic
book genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago.
Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it.
Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it a
ten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't so
special. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved to
the people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful even
with that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star for
that alone.
