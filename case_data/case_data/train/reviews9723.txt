Funny, but missing the heart of an Apatow comedy

Entertaining if forgettable Christmas stoner comedy. Seth Rogen and
Anthony Mackie go out on Christmas Eve for one last hurrah with their
friend Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who they have all gone out together since
the death of Gordon-Levitt's family, one last time before they all
basically become responsible adults. It's a rather morose set- up for a
light and often crass comedy. Judd Apatow was not a part of this film,
and "The Night Before" is missing the heart and emotional resonance
that Apatow typically brings to comedies he produces (yes, I'll make
the case for even the goofy ones like "Anchorman 2" and "Pee-wee's Big
Holiday" having heart). I think that's my main complaint about the
film. The dramatic elements are rather maudlin and do not come off as
all that sincere or genuine. Still, the comedy is pretty darn funny and
that's more than enough to carry this film and make it worth watching.
It also doesn't hurt that the film features a very funny supporting
cast that includes Lizzy Caplan, Jillian Bell, Mindy Kaling, Tracy
Morgan, James Franco, and even Miley Cyrus. Michael Shannon gets a
special shout out for his part as the thoughtful drug dealer Mr. Green.
Overall, this film isn't a comedy classic, but it's funny and will hold
your interest while you watch it, even if you'll c completely forget
about it two hours later.
