Vampire Academy is too good to not get a sequel.

Vampire Academy is finally the YA adaptation we've all been waiting
for. After disappointment after disappointment in the category, Vampire
Academy finally did it all right. Not only is Vampire Academy a
faithful adaptation to the book and should have all fans captivated, it
is also a great flick for non book fans of all ages. Action, humor, and
an incredibly portrayed friendship. Everyone in the theater laughed.
The ladies behind me swooned for a certain Russian lead. People were on
the verge of tears, I'm sure someone let a few slip. It was enjoyable
for all people in the room. What I always praised about Richelle Mead's
series was the focus on friendship as opposed to romance and the
comedy. This movie does all that perfectly (director of Mean Girls,
hello.) while still portraying the dark content from the books (writer
of Heathers, hello.) I will say there were some pacing issues and
sometimes the transitioning to a new scene was off, but that is the
ONLY thing and quite honestly it didn't bother me too much or take away
from me enjoying the film, so it was not that big of an issue. Was this
a perfect adaptation of a great book? No, but does a thing exist? This
was a very faithful adaptation, however, and as a book fan I can
honestly say I couldn't imagine the movie going any other way. So, I'm
here to tell you this adaptation is TOO GOOD to not get a sequel.
