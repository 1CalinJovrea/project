Parenthood and Self-Sacrifice

i always approach a film especially when it is classified as scifi with
liberal suspension of disbelief. because it is only through that that i
was able to appreciate such scifi gems as Stargate and Fifth Element
and many other that were otherwise written off by these so-called
critics.Looper is one of those films that should be appreciated by its message
more than its genre. it uses the science fiction medium, complete with
action stunts and wonders, as an apt and well-sculpted vehicle to a
very beautiful message of self-sacrifice and positive reinforcement
parenthood. the film goes to extra length to make the story plausible
and solid and the actors, including the 'rainmaker' child, did a
marvelous job of pulling it off.i've always believed that the soul of any film, even as i appreciate
great plot twists and great special fx and great acting and direction
(yeah, i said great too many times!), is the message and/or portrait it
intends to get across. Looper made a kill for it.
