OMG! Who writes this garbage?

Are you kidding me??? I mean seriously almost everything out of
Hollywood lately seems to fall prey to the same qualities as this
movie. Completely unbelievable, unrealistic, CGI overload, cheesy, and
a horrible plot that absolutely insult's the intelligence of it's
audience. If you are on drugs I'm sure you will like it because it's
obvious the writers wrote this garbage stoned. This is the first time I
have ever written review for any movie on this site which should tell
you how tired I am of seeing the same junkie pathetic movies of late. I
don't know the gentlemen that reviewed this movie from LA but I can't
believe he gave this 10 stars. Must have been paid handsomely.... I
wouldn't be surprised if this movie was written by the same writer as
the Lone Ranger.......blah
