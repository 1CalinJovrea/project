Confidently treading a well trod path

This is a typical boy's comedy-horror romp. Expect nob gags, cheesy
sound tracks, high-fives, innuendos and tall women in tight tops.I have seen a few of these in my time so I am a little fatigued and
jaded with the genre. But as they go this is a pretty good one. There is a period of build up where the characters are given a bit of
depth. The production, acting and effects are all pretty good. The plot
is OK but pretty much irrelevant.There is no real horror, no real nudity (except a few jiggling zombie
boobs), and no real violence. This is all pretty tame, good natured
fun.It makes me very sad to admit perhaps I have just grown out of this
type of thing (I am outside the target demographic for sure) This could be a pretty solid watch for a younger audience who is new to
the genre.
