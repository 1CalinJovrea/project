Heartwarming film for music lovers

This is a touching story with moments of sadness, joy and humor. As far
as I can tell it is based pretty closely on the true life of Paul
Potts. I liked the realism portrayed in the characters and the
situations; for once Hollywood restrained itself. For classical music
lovers, the music is a treat. Until the end--after an incredible
soundtrack of great pieces written by the masters and performed by true
artists, we are treated to an over- credits song by... Taylor Swift.
WHAT??? NOOOOOO!!! WHY??? Who on earth made the choice to include
that--performer--in this? Nothing worse than having your ears and
senses assaulted with garbage after first being primed by some of the
best music ever written. That's like having a lunch of fine French
cuisine and then being presented with a Twinkie for dessert. Thanks a
lot, whatever idiot included that favorite of teenyboppers everywhere
in this otherwise-fine film.
