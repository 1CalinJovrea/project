Pretty Decent Movie

My mom and I went and saw this movie today, pretty much for a girls day
out and since Snow White has always been her favorite fairy tale we
chose this movie to see. Over all it is definitely a good family movie.
It really was great to see a strong female character that saved the
prince instead of the princess being saved by the prince which is the
tradition. And it was nice and different to see Prince Charming
actually have a personality of sorts and not just...there like that
1937 Disney film had, not that that version was bad of course. There were plenty of funny moments through out the film and the dwarfs
being bandits and not having the usual names were great. Its just a
great twist and a fresh look at the classic story. I don't know why
people are blasting it like they have been...its a kids movie, why are
people looking for deep meaning and character growth? Can I mention
twilight? That movie is horrible yet people praise it.Anyway overall good movie, definitely a see for a weekend afternoon.
