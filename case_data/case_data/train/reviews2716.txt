Almost 3 hours of hell.

What was Martin Scorsese thinking? Is he trying to set a record for the
longest time to bore an audience?It used to mean something when someone said "it's a Martin Scorsese
film". Does this now mean it's long and boring?How can anyone who invested 2 hrs and 41 min not say this was way to
long and could have gotten the message across in a comfortable say.. 1
hour?Such a waste of talent. No big story here, the summary accounts for the
almost 3 gruelling hours of boredom with no real message, although the
one I did get made this even more of a time-waster. How can this be rated so high? Is society that bored and have that much
time to waste on non-entertainment? Save yourself, you've read the summary, you're better off moving onto
another movie.
