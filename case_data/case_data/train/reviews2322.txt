jtindahouse is an idiot

Just a quick review to set reader's straight regarding jtindahouse's
biased review. The guy is obviously a muppet because he states that
England sent convicts to Australia a couple of decades back. Try a
couple of centuries. He also states 1 in 5 Australians have direct
convict blood which is also rubbish, as Australia is now a very
diverse, multicultural country. Unfortunately being from New Zealand
jtindahouse is obviously very anti-Australian as many Kiwis are. New
Zealand basically lives in Australia's shadow so many Kiwis have
little-man syndrome. Please take any comments about Australia or the
country's film from jtindahouse as bulldust.
