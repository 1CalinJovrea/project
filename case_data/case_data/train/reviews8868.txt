This movie makes my day!!

WOW!!! What a delightful surprise!! Everyone in the family LOVED this
movie, and yeah we enjoy this version much more than the original, and
we are white (for the ones who claim that this is the black version of
Annie)!! My 3yr old daughter is obsessed with it and even my husband
who hates musicals really liked this one because there is a much more
realistic vibe to it; the beats are groovy, the singing is impeccable
and it is not accompanied by excessive dancing involving a group of 100
all with the same facial expression :) Yeap, this is not your typical
musical...it is so much better!! Instead of skipping the singing
moments you play them over and over again. And the kid..Annie...OH MY
what a voice! I cannot believe how much emotion she puts into her songs
and she is only 11!
