Hardy delivers a 'concrete' cast throughout the film

The whole movie confines to a car which is driven by a construction
manager. The builder continues driving despite knowing that this ride is about
to destroy his love, his job, his family, his home---everything he has
built in his whole life. This is an absolute stunner---Tom Hardy's one man treat. Hardy delivers
a 'concrete' cast throughout the film.Steven Knight remains stellar at both direction and script. outstanding
story-telling. This sort of movie---so close to real life---should not
be missed.
