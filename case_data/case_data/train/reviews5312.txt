Awesome, just awesome!

I don't understand all the haters. I often wonder why some people even
bother going to movies. They over analyze and criticize every movie. I however love to enjoy movies at face value. I won't lie, to date no
terminator movie after T2 has even come close to making me feel exited
watching it the first time the way T2 did, until now.I thought this latest movie was fantastic, and I was not alone. I saw a
preview screening with about 20% normal people and 80% press last
night. It was obvious throughout the movie that the audience was very
into the movie and at the end it got a standing ovation. What does that
tell you? I could not wait for what came next.It won't surprise me a bit if half those reviewers that stood and
clapped give the movie a bad review because thats what they do, or they
think they are expected to do.Don't listen to reviews or the haters. Go see this movie while you can
on the big screen. If you liked the first 2 movies this movie is very
much more along those lines than the other sequels. Arnold being old fits great! The story is fantastic. The effects
fantastic. Casting fantastic. For the first time in a long time I
actually felt like I saw special effects I have not seen before.This movie deserves your attendance. Go have fun! I may go see it again
this weekend.
