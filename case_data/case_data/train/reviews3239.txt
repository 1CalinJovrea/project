Corden and Roach bring Paul Potts' story to the big screen

Paul Potts' story grabbed the nations imagination as he went from
Carphone Warehouse manager to opera singing sensation via Britain's Got
Talent. And this film shows all of that and so much more of his story.It gets a bit bogged down by trying to be a 'Working Title/Richard
Curtis' film, what with the funny mum, idiot best friend etc, but
actually this is a good film, that probably deserved to do better at
the box office. Perhaps it didn't travel well around the world.James Corden gives a good performance, but I found myself being more
amazed by that of Alexandra Roach, who turns a potentially one note
character into something far more. It's as much her film as it is
Corden's.There are some slower moments in the second half, but all in all I'd
recommend this film for people who think they know Paul's story, and
those that don't.
