Let's Face It.  It's Porn

Let's face it. Somehow this thing got legitimized by using more
expensive film and hi tech movie equipment. I can just see the guys
sitting there drooling because this is somehow a mainstream movie.
"Look, dear. This is an art film like the ones you are always talking
about. I really don't see anything more than a bunch of explicit sex
which I could pick up at any adult movie outlet if I wanted to. Of
course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new
about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters
are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes,
there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious
and "artsy." It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such
as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such
obvious eye candy. Don't bother.
