Ridiculous plot

The film was exciting and even adrenaline rushing at some points, but
it does not take an asset manager, banker, or anyone else working in
the financial world to know that as soon as oil was discovered on that
land the oil companies would have paid very well in order to buy the
land, or perhaps even just lease it in order to siphon the oil. Hell,
even a small time investor would have sunk the 40k into paying off the
back taxes so long as you tripled his return (which could have been
done in less than 3 months considering that the movie states that
they're making 50k a month off of the oil) In the end, the plot of this
film is just a very cheap excuse to promote very real and very serious
issues that many people are facing in this country. I just wish they
had been as hell bent on making the plot as believable as they were in
trying to get their political points across.
