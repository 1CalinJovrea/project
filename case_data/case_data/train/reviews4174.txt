Boring plot, scary editing made

Terrify and scary came from the combination of camera movements, also
screen editing, and silent creepy background music both effects the
degree of terror. I was scared in the beginning, but once when I got used to the rhythm,
I no longer scared and felt boring. It is true that I still afraid to
watch the bloodiness screen, so I mostly covered my eyes or turned my
head to the audience in every suddenly quite moment, because I knew the
next few seconds would have 'something'. Watching horror movie in
theater is interesting, so many screams from audiences, hard to
maintain fear.The story itself is illogical and plain. The evil was released because
bounderish girls touched stuffs without permission.That is why
education is important. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The girls were rude in the beginning,
they opened host family cabinets just after they first entrance, this
behavior already unfavorable. I can't imagine any other normal people
will do such thing. Not to speak of hiding others property, that is
stealing, it is criminal! And who else will keep a creepy picture to
her bed? There were so many alogical plots, and I would not like to
spend time to recall.Anyway, I barely watch horror movies, it was an thrilled experience.
