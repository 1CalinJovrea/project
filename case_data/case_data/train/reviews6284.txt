Oh dear!

I read the excellent original novel in an afternoon, and had quickly
downloaded the others in the trilogy to finish over the weekend having
been mesmerized by the characters. My son, also immensely enjoyed the
books and read them as quickly; and my daughter had heard us
continuously talking about how good the books were. The movie had so
much potential, but sadly left both myself and my children
disappointed. Eva Green is mesmerizing as always, but why oh why
re-write an excellent story into a hotch-potch of ideas that don't work
as well as the original? Was such a drastic re-write necessary? It's
not as if modern film making methods couldn't have coped with the magic
of the book. The beauty of the original story was lost, rushed and
slightly non-sensical in parts. Save your money - read the book
instead.
