Not entirely sure about this one.

This is a difficult movie to review. It had both good acting and bad
acting. Good visual effects and bad visual effects. Interesting story
line and a boring story line. The start played out kind-a-like a 90s B
movie and then it got better, then it got worse, then better, then
worse.Christopher Lloyd appeared all of 10-15 minutes throughout. Tommy
Wiseau said 1 - 2 lines...so giving them first billing is dishonest.
Overall there were some OK scares and I Liked the bizarre imagery at
times. Otherwise the story was a bit disjointed and the editing felt a
bit jerky. It wasn't good enough to like, but not bad enough to hate.
4/10
