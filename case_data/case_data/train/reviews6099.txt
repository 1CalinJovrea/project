One of my favorite movies of all time.

I was coming into the movie with very high expectations and came out
with the movie exceeding my expectations! Jurassic World is now one of
my favorite movies of all time. The action sequences are intense and
plentiful. The special effects are top notch. The music is
wonderful(and not just John William's famous themes; Michael
Giacchino's score is excellent as well.) And while the characters may
not be as developed as in the original Jurassic Park, they are
interesting in their own right. Chris Pratt does a great job as Owen,
the raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard does excellent as Claire,
the head of the park. One of my favorite "characters" though is the
underwater dinosaur Mosasaur. (Every time it jumps out of the pool it's
freaking awesome!) Even though a lot of people have called this movie
predictable, it had a lot of twists and turns that were surprising,
especially the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending sequence is one
of the most epic endings that I can remember in any movie. The ending
will give any true Jurassic Park fan chills.
