Review from a non-book reader

This review is from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the book
but still knows his/her movies.The movie's start is very confusing at first, where Robert Langdon has
some visions but they don't really seem necessary and so it takes quite
some time to establish the plot. It lacks the inclusion of Renaissance
artists' work or a history lesson here or there, they are there, with
the main focus on Dante, however it's still not as much as compared to
the previous 2 movies, which just made them so much more interesting.There a couple of plot twists in the movie but nothing that might throw
you off your seat or make the movie more interesting.Hans Zimmer's background score felt under par compared to the beautiful
scores and themes he has given for The Da Vinci Code and Angels and
Demons and countless other movies.Another thing that I felt lacking was a final turn in the end, like a
final nail in the coffin, like the previous 2 movies had.Overall, I don't know about Dan Brown's novel, but the writing of the
script was not up to the mark.
