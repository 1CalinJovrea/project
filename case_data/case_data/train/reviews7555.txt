Overstuffed and repetitive

It is overstuffed(in order to be very good) and repetitive like other
avenger movies and has a serious identity crisis. Apart from
cinematography and action everything else is pathetic, It is more
suited to children, people with fully evolved minds would find it
absolutely boring and this is the trend now with all the superhero
movies which have everything stuffed in them except a story(forget
about being a decent one),The main problem with captain America is
stuffing every superhero on earth, i think a superhero movie should be
about one super human being who realizes that he has powers and uses
them to do good for the mankind,but here u have a no. of superheroes
(who sometimes fight among themselves) and only a poor solitary villain
which makes the movie that much less interesting due to lack of power
balance between the villain and hero.Any normal guy would have a
perception from the start that "there's no way this villain can save
his ass from these many SUPERheroes".
