What do people expect from a movie to be excellent!? Im an Iranian and
he was joking about our president! it made me laugh so what? this film
is only a comedy a simple but in my opinion magnificent comedy, this is
not one of those expensive Hollywood movies that the turned 200 cars on
fire to make. but as a comedy and nothing more it made me laugh several
times and having a good time is only thing you expect from a good
comedy. I think this ratings are really just not supportive , yeah it
seems many people expected some thing real and fancy the same way but
the whole point of comedy is to laugh so I don't see why not 10 stars !
Sorry if there were some grammatical mistakes!
