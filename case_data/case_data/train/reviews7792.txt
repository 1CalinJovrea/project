In Scotland we call this "pish"

Terrible. Acting was OK but bordered on comical. Not scary at all and
second part was a bit loose.Could have been darker with more urgency but flapped around quite a
bit. The ending was boring as hell and didn't seem to convey anything. Should've got to see Kingsman instead.
