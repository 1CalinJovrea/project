boring and cheap

boo! it's boring and cheaply done. not yet another cheap schr√∂dinger's
cat, quantum entanglement thing. not good scifi here. it's funny in the
beginning but then it drops to not being very entertaining. thin
writing and thin suspense. any elegance is missing from the movie, the
only thing i liked was the roswell-reference in the beginning.big fan of good scifi but this was just nothing i would call scifi. it
has the feel of a mystery TV movie and lacks any cinematic quality.
taste is subjective but for me this is very clear. and it has nothing
to do with being independently produced. if you really want to see a
good indie flick that has a nice touch to it, try "the east". not
really science fiction but it has all the important elements.
