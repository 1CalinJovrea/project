Loved it!

I really loved the way they seamlessly tied this in with the first two
movies. The visuals were outstanding! The old T100 looked exactly as
the original! Arnold's portrayal of this T800 was wonderful. The
interactions between he and Sarah made for a great emotional basis for
their relationship. I loved Michael Biehn's portrayal of Kyle Reese in
the first film and was afraid of being disappointed in Jai Courtney's
reprisal of the role (though I am a fan of him as well) but was
pleasantly surprised by it. I did think it was a bit of a slip up when
they failed to explain how the T1000 was able to time travel back to
1984 since he is not metal encased in living flesh but it was too minor
of a mistake to bother me much. I look forward to the next installment,
especially if this is any indication of the direction they are going.
