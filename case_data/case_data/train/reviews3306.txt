I understand it's not for everyone (and I might have a slightly twisted sense of humour), but to me, this is pure cinematic pleasure

I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already
watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so
many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror'
genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story
transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new,
entirely original  just: Wow!It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was
cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the
'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great,
apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley
Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way)  this
movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest
payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for
film geeks like me. Thank you Joss and Drew! 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/
