Another watchable instalment

17 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jurassic
World. Let's just say I'm a BIG fan of these movies, right from the
minute we saw Sir Richard Attenborough clutching that cane with the
amber head, I was hooked. I don't care that it's fiction and highly
improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land
and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise.
To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two
children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels
and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was
dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the
public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a
sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking
man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions
were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to
get eaten. I watched it in 3D, and I'm selective about the films I
watch in 3D these days, but I have to say I was pretty darn good.
Wouldn't mind watching it again......oh and Chris Prattt.....yum.
