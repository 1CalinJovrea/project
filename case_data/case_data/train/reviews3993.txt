ARRIVAL: The Best Sci-fi Film Since CONTACT

ARRIVAL delivers on so many levels it's impossible to describe without
spoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you
see a film, read, "The Story of Your Life" by Ted Chiang...but I highly
recommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a
warm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully
composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking
film you'll long remember. One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away.
Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a
photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike
character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that
was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I
wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed
it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about
impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for
the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and
it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is
worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.The special effects team delivered, too. Amy Adams performance was stunning. Sci-fi is largely disregarded when
awards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams
work in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscar-worthy
for a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise
Banks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for
Florence Foster Jenkins. It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were
well worth the work. Ten well-deserved stars for ARRIVAL. I wish it a huge success at the
box office so this team will continue to make more films of this
caliber.
