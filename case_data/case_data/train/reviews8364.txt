The wrong star gets topless.

It's hard to describe just how bad 'Focus' is. The wrong star goes
topless throughout the movie. The chemistry between Will Smith and
Margot Robbie is less natural and warm than that between Nancy Pelosi
and Dick Cheney. He, feeling the cold breath of age, pushes the limits
of a May/December romance with Ms. Robbie, in more on screen make out
sessions than a Friday night at the Satellite Drive In back in high
school. I looked for a chap stick product placement but may have missed
it during my nap. The plot is more lifeless than the kind found in a
cemetery. In general, 'Focus' was so boring that it encouraged the
conjugation of obscure Latin verbs, and recalling second cousins. Half
the audience left after Will's fifth wander about his hotel room in
search of a shirt. I stayed until the bitter end, feeling bitter about
the cost in time and money associated with a movie that sails between
tedium and apathy to steal a line from 'Mr. Roberts'. Oh, and, pay
attention to the witty back and forth between the romantic leads, and
if you hear anything remotely witty, do tell.
