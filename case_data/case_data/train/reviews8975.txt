7
Brawl in Cell Block 99

Didn't know what to make of Vince coming into this movie but I'm
calling him Sir Vincent afterwards. His portrayal of reality often is
subject to the subject matter therein, but the subject matter is
portrayed convincingly here and he is seriously in character! I will
probably never see this actor in a comedy again based upon this
performance. Enough said. Onto the movie itself. It's not the best but
it's OK. If it's not OK then I'd say better. OK onto the direction.
Very average but not the best. I'd like see more affirmative action on
the cameras but there is always something and this is it. Production is
spot on. Can't say anything but goodness and for me the best part is
they used realism, not from the actual actors, but from the set. All
and all I gave it a 7. No explanation given for it, just I am psychic.
