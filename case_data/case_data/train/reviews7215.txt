Has its moments but it's no game-changer

'Daddy's Home' is the second collaboration between Will Ferrell and
Mark Wahlberg, the first being 2010's 'The Other Guys'. There's no
doubt the two have chemistry. What there is doubt about is how to
perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The problem is that
for Wahlberg's confident, in-charge character (which he has to play) to
work Ferrell needs to play the straight guy and that isn't when he's at
his best. He does it well there's no doubt about it, but he's at his
best when his character has an edge to him like 'Ron Burgundy' or his
character in 'Step Brothers'. Playing the overly straight guy just
seems almost a waste for the one Ferrell movie we get a year, even
though no one could deny he still does it very well. The difference in quality between this and 'Get Hard' is noticeable.
There, Kevin Hart was unable to find a chemistry with Ferrell and it
just turned into the two competing with each other trying to make the
movie their own. Here that's not the case. Wahlberg seems happy to let
Ferrell take the reins and is comfortable just doing what he does best,
with his laid back, dry sense of humour accompanying Ferrell perfectly. There are consistent laughs throughout, but perhaps not one stand out
scene that will be memorable for years to come. It doesn't push the
envelope as much as other Ferrell movies have in the past either. I
really would love to see him always be given free rein to say and do as
he pleases but also understand why that can't always be the case. If
you're just looking to get your annual fix of a bit of Ferrell hilarity
then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a game-changer,
perhaps wait for the next one.
