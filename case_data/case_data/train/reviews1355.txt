another tissue of lies

Yet again we get a film based on a 'true story' that disguises
unpalatable truths with sugar-coated un-truths. Just what is it with a
filmmaker's arrogance that makes them so willingly distort a true story
beyond all recognition. Admittedly I knew little about Milne, so as is
my habit, I googled some facts about the real-life Milne and
Christopher Robin and a very different picture emerged. The same thing
happened recently with 'Trumbo'--another film that so distorted the
facts (which is admittedly a filmmakers/'artists' licence) that any
real sense of meaning is lost. This film paints Milne as a long
suffering post traumatic stress victim with a shrewish hard-faced wife
and invents a happy ending that is a lie--IT NEVER HAPPENED. Avoid. 2
