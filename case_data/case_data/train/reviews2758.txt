MUST WATCH!! simply masterclass performance!!

I do not really bother writing reviews about Hollywood movies
especially new releases as the income over quality gap has risen vastly
in the last years, with films being all about Bad actors that sell,
movies full of flat meaningless trash lines and a movie made like an
advertisement. This film gave me a glimpse of hope, Jessica Chastain was simply and
with one word, extraordinary, At times while watching i felt an awe, an
envy, as well as being inside the role myself, its like she felt it
more than her real self, Mark Strong was his typical good actor self,
solid and dynamic, as well as John Lithgow was, and all the other
secondary rolesThe twists in this film gave me goosebumps, to the point that i felt a
feeling of relief when the movie finished as the suspense was there
till the very last second, to the point that i did not want the movie
to finishTo conclude this was, if not, one of the best movies of 2016
