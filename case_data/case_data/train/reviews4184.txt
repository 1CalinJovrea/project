Utter piece of trash

Boy, I haven't hated a movie this much in a long time. I actually just
joined IMDb (I have been a long term viewer) in order to vent this out
of my system, and to express my amazement that this terrible, vapid,
clich√© movie won a Golden Globe and is nominated for the Oscar best
movie of the year. What the heck is going on? Are Aliens sucking the
brain matter out of us little by little so that we actually think this
tripe is not only good, but great? A script a high schooler could have written, bad acting, terrible
dialogue, one dimensional characters you don't care about, bad disco
music, overly politically correct casting, mistakes in basic "science",
stupid hap-hap-happy ending where everyone in the world (literally) is
jumping, smiling and hugging each other, I could go on and on. This
movie was so bad we actually kept watching it, like the morbid
curiosity of looking at an auto accident. My favorite line of the movie was when Jeff Daniels said that the Matt
Damon character would be fine with his supplies "as long as nothing
goes wrong". I looked at my husband and said sarcastically "Gee, I
wonder if something is going to go wrong", and wouldn't you know it, in
the very next scene it does. We have sworn off any future Ridley Scott movies, for good. He is
obviously in cahoots with the Aliens sucking out all our brain matter.
