Flawed story

Although i watched it until the end, and actually enjoyed the action
part of the movie, the story is very very flawed.i will only get into the beginning of the movie, so hardly any spoilers
here.The movie starts with a DEA team apparently robbing a drug-lord. At
first the viewer thinks it's a sanctioned operation but in the next
scene it turns out to be a rogue one. OK, so fa so good.... BUT!The team thought of a way to take away 10.000.000 Dollars from the drug
money for themselves. Still, plausible. But then... Arnie blows up the
stash of about 2 billion dollars....The next scene he gets interrogated by his colleagues/ internal affairs
about where the 10 million is.Excuse me... but he blew up all the money... so how could anyone know
there is 10 million missing?!?!?!?!?!?This is what the entire movie is based on... sorry... that just does
not fly! Nice action ... horrible story!
