Funny with Great Message

In Blithe Hollow, the outcast boy Norman Babcock lives with his father
Perry, his mother Sandra and his teenage sister Courtney. Norman is
considered a freak by his schoolmates since he speaks to the dead,
including his grandmother that watches horror movies on television with
him. However nobody believes that Norman has this ability besides his
fat friend Neil. Norman's deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast meets Norman and tells that he
must protect Blithe Hollow from the witch curse. Soon Mr. Prenderghast
dies and his ghost explains to Norman that he should get his book and
perform a ritual in the witch's grave. Norman finds the book that is a
fairytale and then he goes to the seven graves where the men that
condemned the witch are buried. However, Norman is interrupted by the
school bully Alvin and the dead arise and invade the town. Soon Norman
has a dream and finds that the witch is the girl Agatha that was
sentenced to death in 1712 due to her medium ability. Now Norman wants
to convince Agatha that her revenge is turning her equal to those who
killed her. "Paranorman" is a stop-motion animation with a very funny supernatural
story. Norman speaking with his grandma in the beginning and Mitch
telling to Courtney that he has a boyfriend in the end are hilarious.
The story has also a great message against the prejudice and ignorance.
My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Paranorman"
