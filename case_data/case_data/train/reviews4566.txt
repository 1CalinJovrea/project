Abandon hope all ye who watch this.

Searching for Nicolas Flamel's fabled philosopher's stone, a vital
ingredient in the practice of alchemy, young archaeologist Scarlett
(Perdita Weeks) discovers a series of clues that point to the
bone-strewn catacombs that lie deep beneath the streets of Paris.
Assembling a team of plucky urban explorers, she ventures into the dark
network of tunnels where horror awaits.As Above, So Below references classical art and literature and
historical legends in an attempt to add a degree of intelligence to
proceedings, but what director John Erick Dowdle's film ultimately
boils down to is an oft confusing, very dark (as in you can't see what
is happening) and derivative mess of a film (equal parts The Blair
Witch Project, National Treasure, and The Descent) that basically
consists of an hour and a half of repetitive meandering through
confined passageways while assorted inexplicable supernatural
occurrences terrify the characters (but rarely the viewer).Dowdle does admittedly conjure up quite a bit of atmosphere along the
way, making the absolute most of his creepy, claustrophobic location,
whilst the deciphering of long lost clues and the discovery of hidden
treasure adds a modicum of fun, but the action, much of which proves as
difficult to unravel as an Aramaic riddle, soon becomes tiresome, while
the over-used found footage/mockumentary style only serves to annoy.
