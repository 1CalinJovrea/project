Not for book fans

It changes substantially the story, enough to change the soul of some
characters. Nothing on the movie ends up having sense and it's actually
boring.. Some of the green screen work is really bad. Nothing looks
real enough. It departed from the book in the previous movies but it was almost
acceptable.. this is awful.It may not be terrible for some people but i'm sure that fans of the
book are not going to like it. Even those wishing to change the book's
finale.I have to say the acting work is not that bad. They do what they can
with what they have. Tho I'm not a huge fan of Shailene Woodley or Theo
James, they are not bad actors. So they managed to go through the movie
unscathed.. It's too bad they have changed it that much. The
relationship between the characters has so much more to work on in the
third part of the book than in the movie.
