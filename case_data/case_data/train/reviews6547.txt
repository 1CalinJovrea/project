Where's the musical?

Lots of fans could hardly wait for the sequel to come out, and now that
it's here, I went back and watched PP again to see if I missed
something. Nope, all that junk is still there. I was hoping to see a
musical, but a vapid teen/college comedy showed up instead with a
sprinkling of "music" in it. Most of the major roles were occupied by
actors closer to 30 than college age at the time the movie was made.
The music is spotty, at best, and the lip-syncing/dubbing is terrible.
A lot of "fat girls are funny" humor involving Rebel Wilson's character
(can she actually do comedy, or just Funny Fat Girl stuff?) And when
they resort to vomit humor more than once, you know a movie is short on
writing talent. The only bright spot is Anna Kendrick, and her solo
with that coffee mug. I can hardly wait for PP2 to come out - - - at
the $2 video rental box, it's a sequel I can wait for....
