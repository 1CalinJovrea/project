Ben and Civil Disobedience. An interesting take on checking out on society. With a top layer of dealing with hardship and what it means to live the good life

"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it
had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not
lived." Henry David ThoreauI just happen to be reading Henry David Thoreau's book Walden for a
philosophy club. When I saw this trailer I told myself I had to see
this before it left my city. The similarity between the book Walden and
this film are pretty high. With similar topics of arguments against
commercialism and full industrialism. Then throw on top a yearning for
spiritual truth and self-reliance. Still, this isn't just a stick your
middle finger at the system film. It's way more than that.Matt Ross has an interesting meditation on what it means to live
outside society in America. He shows a couple reasons why someone would
do this and show the pros and cons in a very interesting way. The views
evolve as the story moves on. Such is life eh?Viggo Mortensen acting is amazing in this role. With that said, don't
overlook Jack (Frank Langella) acting in the film. For a good portion
of the film, we only see the point of view from the family and mostly
Ben (Viggo Mortensen) at that. But later in the film, you see Jack's
motives too. I can see why he acted the way he did and I may have done
this same if I was in his spot too.Bo (George MacKay) gets a couple good scenes too. It's great to see him
fumble through interactions throughout the film and to discover what he
wants out of adult life. This may or may not conflict with what his dad
wants.I highly recommend this film and can't wait to see what Matt Ross does
in the future. If this film comes to your town do yourself a favour and
see it. Clever films are rare and need to be supported.
