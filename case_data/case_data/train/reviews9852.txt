Don't bother stick with the original cartoon

My Childhood destroyed just re-watch the cartoon, don't bother don't
waste a dollar. Poor acting poor everything. I don't even want to waste
another minute explaining why and how horrible. Just means i'll need to
relive it !!!! A little tip to Disney, you don't need to pick someone
whom is well known i.e. Emma Whatfor.
