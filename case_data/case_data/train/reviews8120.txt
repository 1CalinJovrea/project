Awesome suspense thriller.

Saw this recently on a DVD. The movie is an excellent suspense
thriller. It was full of twists and surprises. The movie has unexpected
turns n hidden clues. It is masterfully directed n exquisitely written
by Oriol Paulo. Superbly acted by everyone that appears in it. It also
contains beautiful cinematography, great pacing n skilled editing. The
plot- a powerful businessman stands accused of murdering his lover. He
was found with her dead body in a locked hotel room. The twist ending
will leave you with ur hand on ur head. The director's debut film, The
Body has been on my radar for a long time. Fans of Jagged edge, Primal
fear, Usual suspects will definitely enjoy this.
