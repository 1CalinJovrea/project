Not even close to a Bourne movie

In a way I think this film disgraces the Bourne series, and here's why:
it simply did not have the feel of a Bourne movie. Between awkwardly
chosen locations, some sci-fi drug twist, and and incredibly
over-simplified and at times dull plot line, this is hardly an action
movie, let alone a Bourne movie. Also, and this part really bothered
me, I feel like Tony and Dan Gilroy did things with some of the Bourne
characters that were not true to Robert Ludlum's vision, even going so
far as to change the initiation program and the amount of information
leaked at the end of Ultimatum. Secondly, the direction was very close up the entire time, and during
many of the chase scenes I found myself unable to watch. The entire
time it is very shaky, and because of the closeness, it's difficult to
get the whole picture of what's going on.Lastly, some of the acting wasn't very good. I've never liked Jeremy
Renner, and this movie didn't change my opinion on him. It's not that
he's a bad actor, it's just that I don't like him as an actor. Edward
Norton, though, was incredibly stiff and robotic the whole time, as
were some of the other government workers. The best performance was
probably from Rachel Weisz, who did well as a woman trying to deal with
shock and guilt. If you happen to like almost all action movie, go ahead and watch this,
but if you're a Bourne fan, I wouldn't bother wasting your and
tarnishing some aspects of the past movies.
