A Well-Acted Cold War Thriller

Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that
features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies
tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of
tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that
when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said
the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks
performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the
film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either
humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar
nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have
been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get
plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.
