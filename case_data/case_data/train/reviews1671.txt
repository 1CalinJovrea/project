For those wanting a 'genuine' mythology Hercules; this is not the movie
for you. For those wanting a dark and realistic take on Hercules; this
is not really the movie for you. For those hoping for popcorn fare, a
little gory for a ten year old but just about right for a 13 or 14 year
old, for those hoping for solid acting performances, well-choreographed
fight scenes, and pretty high production values, then this is your
show. And it's got a strong positive message that even those put off by
the occasional splash of blood, the fleeting glimpse of bare female
bottom, or the single comic use of the 'F' word would agree is
something the American public occasionally needs to hear. Is it sort of
formulaic? Yeah. So what? There are plenty of formulaic movies that
have risen above stereotype into archetype. This isn't one of them, but
it was worth the price of admission and the time spent. I'm glad
Johnson got this movie done, and glad that I watched it.
