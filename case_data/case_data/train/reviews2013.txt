So confused as to what about this movie is so amazing

This is my 1st review because I had to say something about this movie
just to warn others about it since there are so many 10 star reviews. I
sincerely do not understand what it is the academy saw in this movie to
nominate it for 8... EIGHT Oscars! Are they paying them to nominate the
movie?? 1. Bradley Cooper is not convincing as a bipolar patient. When
I look at him all I can think of is his character from The Hangover or
that he was voted Sexiest Man Alive. 2. Jennifer Lawrence is becoming
one of my favorite ladies in Hollywood but she definitely was cast
wrong for this part also. She is mean and unlikable and overacts the
entire time. Just a lot of yelling and stomping around. 3. The entire
movie they just bicker and huff and puff. They aren't cute until the
very end and then the movie just ends. 4. There were so many football
references and talking over one another that my ears started to hurt.
The scenes would drag on with just arguing. 5. The plot was very bland
so you aren't really rooting for anyone or excited about what is going
to happen next. The script must have been a piece of cake to write
because there really isn't anything groundbreaking here. There are
hundreds of mental patient movies.
