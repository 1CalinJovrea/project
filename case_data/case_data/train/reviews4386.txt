Horrible Movie

Do not waste your time or money on this movie. It's extremely slow and
nothing is explained except that the desert takes children sometimes. It meanders around, with no discernible ending. The mother and
stepfather go nowhere in this story. Only thing I can tell was the
mother was a whore and the stepfather was unemotional.You never find out what happened to the daughter other than she got
into a car. 2 hours wasted.I hope this was a straight to video release. I thought with the cast it
would be a little better. I"m not sure who gets paid to review a
script.
