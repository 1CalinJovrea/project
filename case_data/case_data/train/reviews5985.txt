No Mars, No Mutants, No soul

I'm very much anti-remake. If the original worked, leave it alone. In
the case of the 1990 Total Recall we had what was built to be the
biggest movie yet made starring the biggest movie star around. Yep,
that sounds like a viable candidate for remaking.In a future where most of the Earth is decimated, Douglas Quaid (Colin
Farrell) can't shake his adventurous dreams. He heads to Rekall where
vacations come in the form of memory transplants. In the process of
becoming his own secret agent, Quaid discovers that his life is a lie.
Wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale filling in for Sharon Stone but doubling for
Michael Ironside and offering the best performance of the film) leads a
chase to capture the awakened Quaid. Meanwhile freedom fighter Melina
(Jessica Biel) attempts to persuade Quaid into finding his true
identity and leading the cause against oppression.This version of Total Recall does feature some upgrades. Of course
visuals have come a long way. Where the original only had one
computer-animated sequence involving primitive animated X-rays, this
version has all the bells and whistles. There are maglev cars, a myriad
of elevators, and a multitude of future housing developments. The art
direction is noteworthy albeit not entirely original these days. You
can see a frame of the 1990 version and understand immediately what
you're looking at with its consumer-ready technology; do the same with
this movie and it's another film looking back at Blade Runner. Fight
sequences and most of the action come across as deft, if not too
numerous.The omission of the plot to free mars creates a chasm of asinine edits.
The people at peril are never characterized. Since they aren't sassy
mutants, there's trouble in understanding the context of early fan
service. Only two inhabitable territories exist in the world. The
Colony as it's called (Australia) fills in for Mars but since it's the
early setting of the film there isn't anything majestic about reaching
it. The film hops between the Colony and the controlling British
Federation with early going ease that it fails to divide acts.The lack of Arnold Schwarzenegger helps one appreciate Arnold
Schwarzenegger. For someone considered a bad actor, we never actually
won a RazzieÂ—he actually got an honorary Razzie for failing to win the
award, but did get a Golden Globe. Like Sylvester Stallone,
Schwarzenegger's typical role at the time of the 1990 original, exuded
masculinity. However, the difference is in the touches of humor that
always cropped up in the Schwarzenegger films. One can't watch Predator
without shouting to get to the chopper. Transversely Stallone's Rambo
never brings the fun factor. Looking back at Total Recall (1990),
little touches from Arnold make even the most gratuitous of Paul
Verhoeven gore strangely comical. That odd nature interjects the ardor
today's films overlook. This remake is clinical. No mars, no mutants,
no soul.
