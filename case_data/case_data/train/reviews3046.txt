Rust and Bone

Apart from the great story the movie is telling (combining two stories,
male and female and their complications), this has remarkable special
effects. Of course it also had a good budget to play with (for European
standards that is). If they do an US remake, you can bet they'll cut
off some of the edges (and some of the erotic/nude content too).But until then and if you speak french or don't mind reading subtitles,
this movie has to suffice. And it is very well acted. It's about loss,
hope, friendship, love and many more things. It is about life, things
we take for granted (very well shown in several scenes), passion, but
also about broken people and how they try to get back on their feet (no
pun intended). A great drama that I can only recommend
