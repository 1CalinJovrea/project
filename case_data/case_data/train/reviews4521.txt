If you don't expect much, you might like it.

As a film buff, I love seeing films alone on Saturday afternoons or
Friday nights. As as result of my frequent attendance, I have come to
know not to expect much from action blockbuster films. Yes, you get
your usual incomprehensible hand-to-hand fights, buildings exploding
and enemy gunfire as inaccurate as ever, with the inevitably minimal
plot and screenplay. As the ending credits rolled, I stood up thinking
"ehhh". The film definitely had some amazingly entertaining action
sequences and awesome special effects, but you know, you can't really
be THAT amazed with an action film. Not gonna lie, the screenplay in
this film was pretty well written, and it included quite a few
pleasantly surprising laughs. Dwayne Johnson has a big few months ahead
of him with the release of Snitch (which I give a 7/10), the next Fast
and Furious movie, and Pain & Gain. With this film, he did reinforce
his true acting credentials, even though not much notable acting is
observed in such a genre. All in all, if you're expecting something
like Olympus Has Fallen, you might be dissatisfied. If you go in like
me, with no true expectations other than hoping for some entertainment,
you might like what you see.
