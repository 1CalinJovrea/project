An Awful  Sex Movie .

If you are looking for a great comedy movie,this film is certainly not
for you. It is an awful R-rated movie with sex and without comedy. It
will remind you of Jackass because you will see graphic nudity (sexual
intercourse between a man and a woman,a man was forced to suck a
dildo,people reveal their butts and throw fire works by means of their
butts). Honestly,I did not find this movie worth watching at
all,because it lacks 90 % of comedy and it tries to tempt the audience
to see it through cheesy and explicit sex. Take my advice and save your
money and time and see a better movie. Do not believe the hyperbolic
rating!. Neighbors(2014) is an awful sex movie that disguises as a
comedy movie.
