A Wonderful Family Dramedy

I'm not sure who the morons are who couldn't sit thorough this film,
but too bad for your brain damaged mind due to over saturated computer
graphic driven movies. This is a film, and it's a gem. The story is of
a semi-famous sculpture at the twilight of his career. Being honored at
a school he teaches, his estranged sons and (less we forget daughter)
are coming home to attend it.The film starts with an amazing father/daughter moment between Eliza
(Grace Van Patten) and Danny (Adam Sandler). What makes this INCREDIBLY
touching is that Eliza isn't a terrible millenial child. She is a
mature thoughtful doting on her father person. Who is about to attend
college and can't seem to abandon her lost father. She's obviously
strong willed yet incredibly concerned about his life (shouldn't this
be the opposite...nope!). She is so independent..she makes
semi-pornographic films as a student filmmaker and passes it as art, as
father, grandfather and aunt look on, uncertain if to continue to
support the creative gene in the family.Eventually, the dysfunctional piece-mealed family does unite, in the
way only deeply strained inconsistent families do. And the common
thread is a somewhat bitter art father Harold Meyerowitz (Dustin
Hoffman) who can't face his failures in how he raised his children.
Very much in the vein of a Robert Benton type film, it is bittersweet
in its cantankerous unlikable male lead (think Paul Newman in "Nobody's
Fool.") I love this film. Director Noah Baumbach has done something I
didn't realize could still be done in this trash heap of spectacle
movies...he touches human interaction at the core details. Bravo!
