Good performances but a pitiful script

This movie had enough to be good but I did not make it, the only thing
a highlight is the cast and performances, they try to do what they you
can but with that script simply does not give.The script was lousy, too slow, nothing happens in most of the cinema
beyond the closing doors, some voices, windows that open and flies, but
everything is minimized, it does not compare with none of the
predecessors. The family is supposed to come to a house haunted and do
not feel that terrifying atmosphere and in my opinion the true villain
of the movie was the mother played by Jennifer Jason Leigh who is an
excellent actress has seen her in The Hateful Eight, The machinist and
recently in the series Atypicall and his Characterizations always work,
make one hate and catch annoyance. Here she succeeds, is an odious
mother and only thinks of her attachment to the sick son leaving one
side to his other daughters. All fault is She has and enjoy that they
will kill her. At some point they want to give us a understand that he
stopped believing in God and wanted to worship Satan if he that he
saved his son, they do not say it but it's what they want to give us to
understand and not understand why not say it, that would have been
ExcellentFinally Cameron Monaghan is wasted, if he is afraid of makeup and its
crazy expressions (thing already seen in Gotham) but one I would hope
that if in the whole film did not do anything, at least look at the end
and no, it is thrown through a window to finally die because they
simply pull you out of a circle around the house which protected the ''
supposed '' demon or evil spirit. A complete stupidityThe secondary characters have hardly any relevance, I thought that the
Thomas Mann's character would be more important since at the beginning
sale pretty but then no more does not reappear.I liked to mention the previous films and even the book. Beautiful
throne with that look of Gothic charm, I do not know but this woman It
fascinates me, unfortunately in this film could not look like but like
I said sorry that it was not the fault of any of the actors but of the
script.The truth was I expected much more, I had not been able to see it in
movies because not hard nor 1 week and I guess I already know the
reason for that. I stay With the Remake of 2005 there are innumerable
films about this event of real life (about 15 CAN BELIEVE?) and the
first I could not finish it, supremely boring or my mood with any of
the others, none have good reviews then really they do not encourage me
