What's the hype over this movie? I don't get it.

Frozen...was a disappointment. :( and this is coming from a huge Disney
geek. The reasons? 1. fails to explain how Elsa got those unique powers
in the first place. 2. the parents death was a joke. so easy, and just
put there as a necessary transition for future plot sake. 3. despite
the fresh theme and sheer potential with snow and ice elements, there
wasn't enough visual satisfaction. 4. it seemed like the movie worked
with limited funding. the background scenes were so minimal! they could
have done so much more with snow, the interior of the castle, the
kingdom, the clothes, the mountain, etc 5. would have been better to
see how Kristoff grew up with the trollsDisney movies are usually very complex, with deep character development
and messages. also visually sensational. Frozen fails to meet par.Shows how hard it is to produce a classic, especially when its Disney
trying to outdo Disney.
