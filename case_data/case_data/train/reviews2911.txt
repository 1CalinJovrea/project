Fun for everyone

Can you say thoroughly entertaining? I went by myself because the
little people in my world were unavailable, and the big people are too
cool for animation. I sat there cracking up with the kids behind me.Let's face it; Adam sander has had a few bombs lately. He redeemed
himself quite nicely with this one. I generally dislike movies with a
hit you over the head message of peace, love, and brotherhood, but this
I liked. Hotel reminds us not to judge before getting to know someone.
It also showcases a single dad nicely.I liked that the father had his flaws and was unashamedly protective of
his kid...even going so far as being underhanded to keep her safe. It
gives a balanced view of parents who sometimes try so hard and still
manage to muddle up their lives and that of their kids'.There is nothing terribly scary for even young viewers.
