Simply awful

This is the second installment of a hit-man movie. I guess we all hoped
for something better this time, despite the trailers obviously showed
the casting agency worked even worse this time.Once again we got fed with a simple, boring, pointless action movie.
This might have been good enough for 3 points out of ten. Considering
the franchise and all the story and character development that was done
over the years, its a complete disappointment.Makes you wonder why they buy the rights to the franchise and make a
movie. It should at least please the fan base, instead its a worthless
piece of trash to anyone.But to be less of a fan-boy, even in its prime scenes its hardly
mediocre. the storyline is pure bull and the actors can't be considered
acting. All bad, Uwe Boll bad, maybe even worse.
