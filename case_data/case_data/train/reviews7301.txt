awful

Never seen a film like this, so ugly that I can't quantify how I'm
disgusted. Plot written by a teenager, screenplay doesn't exist
(dialogues with no sense in all the movie), a jumble of scenes put
together. The whole movie consists of various special effects connected
haphazard. Only the editing (audio and video) and the creation of the
effects are professionals.
