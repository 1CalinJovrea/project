More like a Spider-man SPOOF.

Don't expect a superhero movie. This is more like a long comedic sketch
parodying Spider-man.There are so many wrongs in this movie I 've lost count., but most
importantly the vision is wrong. I would prefer Raimi/McGuire's vision
by far.Among other things this reboot is missing the transformation from
regular Peter Parker to Spiderman. The most interesting thing to the
franchise to watch. And of course his relation with his uncle (who
doesn't get a single mention in this film) and how his tragic fate was
quintessential to his maturity.They are still trying to show you the transition from a goofy kiddy
Spiderman to something more adult but they are failing miserably,
because even in the end the character hasn't mature at all.And it's that "goofy" version of Spiderman that ruins this movie, as a
superhero movie. There aren't any real sentiments at all. Just teenage
humor and pranks. And the final revelation and connection between
Spiderman and the main villain is too ludicrous to swallow.For its $175 mil. budget this movie is far from impressive too. Not a
big spectacle. All that money went for the CGI Spidey jumping back and
forth, but the scenes aren't that impressive and there's a lot to be
desired.Overall: This movie is already a success in Box office multiplying the
earnings more than 4 times its budget, so the producers must be happy.
BUT it's more like a spoof of Spiderman and not a proper superhero
movie. For the true origins of Spiderman, his transformation, his
relation with his uncle and the impact of his tragic fate on Peter, you
must look elsewhere...
