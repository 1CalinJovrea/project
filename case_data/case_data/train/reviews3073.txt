Straight Outta the Compost Heap

Ask five narcissistic, self centered, selfish, juvenile, thugs to 

create a movie about themselves and this is just the garbage that will 

come out. Most is obviously not accurate but embellished by the 

creators to make themselves look like heroes. And they are far from 

heroes. Sure, they were angry, but now that they all are millionaires, 

the whole thing seems very self-serving. It makes me wonder what kind 

of person would be proud of such a dismal portrayal of their life. I 

think NWA now stands for Not Worth Attending. Graphic nudity, sex, 

drugs, violence...what great role models these gentlemen are for the 

new generation. And the fact that extra security has to be assigned to 

the theaters showing this garbage speaks volumes for the type of people 

this crap attracts.
