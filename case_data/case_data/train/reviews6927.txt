I cant even

I'm sad to say I was dragged into this flaming shitpile of a movie by a
few of my friends. Needless to say i would've preferred to have me eyes gouged out with a
soldering iron than watch this movie again. Micheal bay couldn't resist
to steal a perfectly good story (King Arthur) and put it into this film
to make a few more billions. This 'movie' felt more like an ADVERT than an actual MOVIE. There was
absolutely no character development and i hated every single second of
this film..and Anthony Hopkins? What the hell, such a brilliant actor,
such a star on the film reel decided to act in this piece of faecal dog
matter for what exactly? This movie was so bad i swear i could see him
giving up on acting in a couple of scenes. Anyone who says this was a
good movie is either: A) A child or B) A childThe main filming focus around Transformers The last Knight has to be
the CGI and slow-motion. Its impressive yes but in no way rescues the
sinking story line and plot of this crappy film. Rather cut off your toes than watch this film
