Scariest movie ever

Scariest movie i have ever seen. if you find conjuring funny, that's
fine but this movie is in completely different league. It will surely
make you scream. Go for the movie, There are many jump scare in the
movie specially in the second half and you will never turn off the
light after watching it. Second half is too damn awesome. Movie is
completely different from the trailer. The story is good. but i am
telling you, this movie is scariest one. The second half is full of
jump scare. you are gonna surely jump out of your seat. Finally the
horror genre is at track. Wish to see more movies like this. This movie
is a perfect treat for horror movies lover like me.
