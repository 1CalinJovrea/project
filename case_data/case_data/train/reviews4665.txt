What the f**k have I just watched

Worst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and I was still waiting for
something to happen. I would of had a more productive time watching
grass grow. Don't waste your time watching this film. I don't see the
point in the film or what it was trying to achieve. It went through a
boys life that had no real significant moments in it. The most
outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15. It was basically a
film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody. He was a
pessimist with no real goals in life he didn't go through any dramatic
transformations or offer anything to the world he didn't achieve much-
it was a pointless film. It was like the film was made to actually be
as bad, boring and ordinary as possible- not one part of the film was
embellished or interesting. To sum it up, an awful film.
