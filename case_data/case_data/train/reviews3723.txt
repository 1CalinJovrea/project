Life, Death and Love

While I have to admit I'm not exactly the greatest Jorge R. Gutierrez
fan (In fact, I strongly disliked his series "El Tigre: The Adventures
of Manny Rivera") I found "The Book of Life" to be a pretty enjoyable
flick, with very good animation (The art style of Jorge R. Gutierrez
looks surprisingly good in the CGI format, with stylish designs and
impressively detailed sceneries.) likable characters and a fun story
which balances very well the comedy, romance and adventure.The musical aspect was quite good too. Against what I was expecting,
the use of modern songs was moderate, and each one of the musical
moments this movie has serves in some way or another for the plot and
character development, with more than effective results. This aspect,
combined with all the other positive qualities this movie has serve to
make it a very good animated film for the whole family.There is too much to like about "The Book of Life". For me, it was
definitely a pleasant surprise, and while I'm not entirely sure to
consider this the best animated film of the year 2014, it is definitely
a strong contender for that category, along with "The Lego Movie" and
"How to Train your Dragon 2". Definitely worth- watching.9/10
