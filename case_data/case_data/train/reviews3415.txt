If you are watching this movie you're sitting in that cell

Zahler is a new style in film industry. This is the second movie of him
in the same style. Here is what counts: 1. Excellently thought out plot
2. Short powerful dialogues 3. Meticulous examination of characters,
and therefore stunning performances 4. Aestheticization of violence
(radically differently from that of Tarantino's)These points are unique and uncompromisable in the movie. One can
easily imagine that flaw in the performances has not been negotiable in
the eyes of Zahler. Vince Vaughn gives a solid performance - a strong
emotional character, who only expresses his emotions when he is alone,
otherwise he keeps straightforward and mixes little jokes in his treat
for easing his own inner feelings. Jennifer Carpenter goes as realistic
as it gets. The rest of the characters are well-developed too. The only
negative criticism I have is that two-three little episodes in the
fight scenes were unrealistic. E. g. when he fights with the Chinese
guy while others are watching. The fights themselves had very little
dry elements, reminding Van-Damme style. The most of the fights were
well prepared too, especially breaking parts. If you like strong character movies just go and watch it. And I don't
bother to warn you for the violence, you will get over it anyways,
cause it's a good movie.
