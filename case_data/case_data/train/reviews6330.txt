Contender for worst movie of 2014

One-dimensional story: check. One-dimensional characters: check.
Terrible dialogue: check. Bad acting: check. Uninspired action scenes:
check.I checked IMDb before watching this. People talking about how this is
going to be a new cult classic or the revival of Keanu. WTF are you
people on crack or something. It was terrible from start to finish! This movie is all about the action and even that feels completely
generic and uninspired. The dialogue is just plain painful to watch. I
actually felt shame for the people 'acting' on screen. The story...... what story? It's virtually non-existent. Every random
person you find on the street can write something better than this.The only thing going for this movie is Keanu looks cool. Even when his
acting sucks.
