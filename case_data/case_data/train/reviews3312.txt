great, fun, down to earth movie.

a lot of these reviews are saying this movie is bad or disappointing,
but honestly its the first movie in a long time that i could relate to.
another aspect i love is the dialogue, it doesn't take itself too
seriously and has real life comedy, instead of trying to be a huge
blockbuster. many think thats a bad thing, but why would you want to
see another Hollywood dramatized cheesy romantic comedy?! its clearly
underrated, jason segal and chris pratt fans should love this movie
thoroughly. the only thing that i wasn't a huge fan of was the British
accents, seems forced at first but the movie is so long that by the end
it all comes together and warms your soul. if you've ever had to move
away because of some girl, you should see this, very relatable comedy,
that's all.
