Go watch Disney's BRAVE

So, the last stronghold of men has been pillaged. The original 300 was
about strong, brave, reckless men who would die for glory. This sequel
is about a girl who outwits the whole Persian empire and defeats men in
their own game. Eva Green's character was so unnaturally forced into
300's universe just to have that "strong female main character" that it
was obscene. No Leonidas, no Spartans, a childish Xerxes whose only
role in the film was to be an idiot so that Eva Green character's
"wittiness" could come to light, and a terrible main character (forgot
his name already). I won't even go into the storyline because the real
story here is that the spirit of the original 300 has been utterly
destroyed. This movie is so politically correct it's stupid, I guess
this is what gets money nowadays. I just really hope this movie does
badly so that the people who made it give a second thought before
killing a franchise next time.Only part worth mentioning: Eva Green's topless scene.
