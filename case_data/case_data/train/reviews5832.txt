Like the Tommy Gun bullets this misses the mark most of the time.

Looks good but that's about it. It's long and often dull. It suffers
from the written and directed by syndrome. The director is hesitant to
cut any of the brilliant writing. The movie stars the writer directer
so perhaps he didn't notice the stiff, emotionless performance of the
leading man. It would have been longer but we were spared seeing some events by
droning voice over. The surprises were telegraphed so there are no
surprises. The photo of the assumed dead character hangs on the wall
complete with a newspaper time stamp. How convenient for the writer.
The long, too late scene with her could have been omitted as it didn't
matter if she was in hiding or dead.There are slow cars going fast. Plenty of shots fired. At one point
you're not sure who is shooting at whom and eventually they don't seem
to care which side they chose. Don't get attached to any of the strong
female characters as they don't make it to the long over due fade out.The movie looks good on the big screen. If you see it on a home
platform you might doze off, making for a better movie experience.
