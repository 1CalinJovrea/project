This thing breaks all the rules

The film opens letting us know the creature feeds once every 23 years
for 23 days and it isn't 23 years after the first one so this takes
place as a sequel to the first one and not the second one. The
chronology is as messed up as something George Lucas would do and not
nearly as entertaining.The characters act as we already know them and we don't. Gina Phillips
comes back for what amounts as nothing more than a cameo to set up a
for a fourth film. The story didn't have any real surprises and the
dialogue lacked zip. Addison Brandon (Gabrielle Haugh) one of the
protagonists set up as "the final girl" was on the pathetic side,
moping around, oh woe is me and my crazy grandmother (Meg Foster.)
so-so sequel. Should have been better.
