Why?

What were you people thinking? Why, must of been money, did Philbrick
actually allow such a bastardization of his novel. I can't believe he
bought into this and Ron Howard has destroyed one of the best tales
written. Philbrick has a new book out, but I can't buy it. He sold out,
he has no credibility. I was so disappointed by this film, just a
complete groan and moan. It isn't Moby Dick, It's a whole different
story, and better story.I can't imagine Philbrick would be so easy /
cheap, and approve this. must be a mortgage thing. It's a gratuitous
relationship and insult to Melville and Thomas Nickerson. Anyone who
has read this book has embraced it's tale of fear, hope, desperation
and salvation. Love the book, have no respect for Philbrick and Howard.
