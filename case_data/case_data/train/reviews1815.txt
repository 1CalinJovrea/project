Honestly, Home Alone was more entertaining

Too Hollywood, to think someone could pull all that off and not be
called Kevin in a comedy movie was a bit much, and to end it with the
feeling that there was no resolution out of the whole movie was also a
letdown, *did he get away with it??* unless there's a sequel to it,
which I doubt it.
