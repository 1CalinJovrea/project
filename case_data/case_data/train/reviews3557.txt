Very Funny and a Perfect Match,

The Campaign is a hilarious movie with a very clever storyline and a
very talented and comedic cast that do a terrific job.When I first
heard that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis did a movie together,I had
to see it,but then I heard it was disappointing so I delayed seeing.I
decided to rent it,and I didn't see what the problem was,I though the
movie was hilarious,there was a few misses but very few,and similar to
Step Brothers and the Hangover,it has so much lines that are very
quotable,also the two actors worked really well together.I really
enjoyed Dylan McDermott,Sarah Baker,Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow,the
casting for each character was all very well suited.If your a fan of
both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifanakis comedies you will definitely
love the Campaign.Long running congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) finally gets some
competition from Marty Huggins (Zach Galifanakis),a man who may take
over his career.They start a serious campaign against each other.
