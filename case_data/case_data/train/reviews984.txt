Worst movie of the franchise

This latest installment in the series is the worst of them all.
Basically this is a movie that is just unnecessary. The story is pretty
bad, boring and lame. Also the pace is very slow, making for a
unpleasant viewing experience. Chucky behaves downright idiotic and
gone are the moments of humor. The kills are not very original and CGI
is obvious. We even see Chucky running and walking, all thanks to the
help of some bad CGI. The plot is full of holes. Chucky has his sights
set on a little girl, but at some point in the movie she just
disappears. He has her hidden somewhere we are left to wonder, but hey
there she is at the end all of a sudden, but in a totally different
location. Chucky takes over her body, but a scene after the credits
shows him, in his doll body, trying to kill Andy. So I guess he didn't
take over her body.....I'm confused. I wish I didn't watch this movie,
one and a half hours of my life I can't get back. Avoid this and watch
one of the older movies.
