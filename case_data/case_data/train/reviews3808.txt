Delivers the goods - for kids and adults alike.

The first major family flick of the holidays, this
Avengers-for-children boasts the most epic line-up of characters you're
likely to see this Summer: Santa (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh
Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Jack Frost (Chris Pine) and the
dream-making Sandman going up against fear himself, Pitch Black (Jude
Law). It's a neat concept to begin with, but Dreamworks amps up the fun
by contorting our preconceptions of these icons  especially the Easter
Bunny, here played as an ocker warrior  and delivering the goods in
humour, emotion and action. It goes a moralistic touch too far on
occasion, and the story is certainly predictable, but the overwhelming
sense of giddy excitement running through the movie's veins outweighs
any plot contrivances or missteps that occur. A sweet start to the
festive season for kids of all ages  including those in adulthood.
