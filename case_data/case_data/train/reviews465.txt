Decent depiction of a not well known episode in Queen Victoria's life

Went to see this title, as I was quite aware of a bit about the title,
although many folks may not even be aware of the history of the British
Empire and the reign of Empress Victoria. The makers have taken quite a
few liberties, but overall the movie has been well made. Judi Dench does a fantastic job of Queen Victoria and the entire UK
court intrigue is well constructed and shown. Ali Fazal has also done a
very creditable job playing the subservient agent of the empire. The attitudes of both the British and their subjects has been correctly
typed. Nice location shoots, the interactions between Abdul and the
Queen did feel right.If you are fan of historical depictions, recommended.
