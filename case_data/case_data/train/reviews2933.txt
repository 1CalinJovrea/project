Painfully Bad Film Musical

I love musicals, but I must have missed the stand in the theater where
they were handing our the kool-aid for this one. Based on the hype, I had high expectations. I went in thinking "La La
Land" would be like "An American in Paris" or "The Bandwagon," but once
it started I realized it was more like "One From the Heart," or
"Everyone Says I Love You," although both of those dismal failures had
better music. In this film, Ryan Gosling plays a supercilious piano-playing bore who
endlessly pontificates about "jazz." Emma Stone plays his vapid love
interest, a star-struck barista who thinks she should be a movie star
because she has a home filled with movie posters and her aunt once
showed her "Casablanca." Once these two ciphers meet, the audience is
subjected the kind of dreary conversation one flees from in real life.The musical score is deeply uninteresting. Emma and Ryan's hilltop
dance is supposed to be reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Cyd
Charisse/Ginger Rogers, but comes closer to Teri Garr and Raul Julia in
the aforementioned Coppola disaster. By the way, the film completely fails to capture L.A. in any way.Kudos to Emma and Ryan for trying to sing and dance, unfortunately
proving that it takes MORE talent than they or most other Hollywood
celebrities have to perform in a musical. However, I think that Damien
Chazelle should be prevented from ever making another film musical. If you insist on subjecting yourself to an excruciatingly bad musical,
try "The Apple," which is a lot more fun and has better music. To check
out good-to-great musicals, see the movies that "inspired" La La
Land--the RKO Fred & Ginger movies and the MGM musicals from the 30's
through 50"s. Even the recent straight-to-video "Lucky Stiff" leaves
"La La Land" in the dust.
