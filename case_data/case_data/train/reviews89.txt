Competes with puddles for depth

Oh, French cinema. You never fail to disappoint. We've got all the hallmarks here... melancholy, odd non sequitur
vignettes that may or may not mean something, monologues, ennui, a kind
of self-satisfied joy at presenting the base and the unpleasant... oh,
and one massive, overt metaphor for coming of age that I imagine the
director thought was terribly clever. It's not a bad film, there's just
not sufficient substance to warrant the in-depth discussions and
analysis it's receiving. It's the travails of a young person - female,
of course, because for some reason people want to think women are dark
and mysterious - as she finds her adult identity, but with cannibalism.
All the other, usual stuff, too, just, y'know... plus cannibalism. I'm
all for hyperbole as a way to make a point, but hyperbole is all it is,
not an added layer of meaning. I don't really understand making the
central story of your film a metaphor for something which is also
happening in it literally. I suppose that's my biggest point of
criticism and why, ultimately, the whole thing feels a bit pointless. Frankly, the only lingering effect of the film for me is that I want to
know whether the dogs we see at the vet school were special effects
wizardry or if I was just forced to watch a real dog being dissected.
