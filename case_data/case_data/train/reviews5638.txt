A gem hidden in the forests of the Pacific Northwest

I watched this in Sundance earlier in the year, and was captivated by
the storytelling, acting and cinematography.The story follows Ben (Viggo Mortensen), a father of six, living deep
in the forests of the pacific northwest, far from modern life. All six
children, from seventeen year old Bodevan to seven year old Nai are
fluent in philosophy, history and quantum theory (!), and can hunt and
fend for themselves in the wilderness. At least that is until the
suicide of their mother forces the family to clash with modern society,
and then Ben realizes that he has in fact not prepared his children at
all for what lies outside their forest. Bodevan, for example, accepted
in a swarm of the top colleges and adept enough to kill a deer
single-handedly, cannot bring himself to talk to a girl without
immediately proposing to her.The family's ideals further come under stress when his late wife's
father (Frank Langella) who hates the life Ben has created for his
family comes into the picture, and forbids Ben from attending his
wife's funeral, threatening him with arrest. In what could have easily
turned into a one-dimensional harsh/rich character, Frank Langella also
projects empathy and deep grief over his daughter's death. When Ben and
his children visit his sister's much more conventional family, and her
smart phone-obsessed children, Ben criticizes their upbringing, only to
have his sister bring his own parenting skills into question. Director
Matt Ross skillfully presents both sides here without picking
favorites.Acting-wise the film is captivating, with Mortensen fitting the
renaissance profile of Ben like a glove. He projects all the arrogance
and hardheadedness of Ben together with his warmth, adoration for his
children, and respect for his wife's wishes with grace and subtlety in
one of the most seemingly effortless performances I have seen. He is
also surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, from the children to
his in-laws and sister.In summary, Captain Fantastic is a rare case where family dynamics,
with their controversies and dilemmas are not oversimplified to a
preaching doctrine in the finale; the film allows the viewer the space
to find their own balance on what it means to raise a child.
