Worst of the series

I really hope this doesn't destroy a really great series because it
sucked that badly.They could've of done a lot better but instead the decided to make it
some weird tale about incest and a blonde who has sex with any man that
is going around. It's all sex sex sex. Normally I'm a fan of some sexy
scenes in a horror movie but this goes more than a little too far.That is not what the Wrong Turn series is about. It is about road trips
that end in a blood bath. That is what made the series successful but
here they are going out on a limb and trying a new idea and it really
sucks badly.I guess they are trying to do the twilight saga or something like that,
and ancient tale that goes back centuries. Please don't do that, just
stick to the theme we all know and love.The 7th installment of the series is supposed to be in production right
now. I really do hope it is not a follow on from this piece of trash.
There is nothing worse than a series being canceled because they were
scratching so hard for new ideas they churned out stories that were
pointless and too difficult to follow.
