Laziest zombie movie i have ever watched.

***this review may contain spoilers*** It is undeniable that this movie
has its fair share of thrills, stunning CGI scenes and unique yet
realistically gory zombies.However, there is nothing more to that. It jumps from scene to scene
without enough plot to give the audience a sufficient sense of
appreciation as to why the characters are doing what they do. I could
hardly believe it when the movie ended, 2 hours wasted on what could
have been time playing "left 4 dead 2" and still leaving me with the
same feeling - the 'that was thrilling but a complete waste of time'
feeling. I'm going to keep this a short and simple, almost lazy review. Because
that is exactly how I feel about this movie.
