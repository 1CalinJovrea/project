Outstanding, The Office meets The Flying Conchords

I laughed and laughed and laughed.This is not a Vampire Movie, this is a mockumentary about some
flatmates who happen to be vampires, just, y'know, incidentally.It is laugh-out-loud (LOL, young people) funny for extended periods.
There is a lot of under-stated humour, but it has the feel of Peter
Jackson's Bad Taste, made on weekends over an extended period - "what
can we do in this scene to make it even funnier?"Being from NZ, I feel unsure whether I am on the the inside of an
in-joke (the police officers, for example) but plenty of people seemed
to get the Conchords, so who knows, really. If you "get" The Office and you "get" The Conchords, you'll love it.For true.Bro.
