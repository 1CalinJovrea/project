I'll keep it short

Where to begin? OK, by stating the simple facts. The history here is distorted beyond all measure. 21st century
sensibilities, seen through the lens of sterilized political
correctness, make this film practically unwatchable from beginning to
the (oh will it ever come?) end. Every white character is a one
dimensional pastiche of evil while, conversely, it's only black people
who possess anything approaching morality and basic human decency. It
wears out and wears thin very rapidly indeed.Steve McQueen - a director whose previous work I admired - got this
film all wrong. He needed to do many things to put this film on the
right track from the get go. But, most of all, he needed to work with a
script which had its roots in reality, not in this distorted, oddly
perverse and, frankly, unworthy representation of antebellum America.
It's a shame and a sham yet it could have been a great story. Truly
awful, but I gave it 2 stars - the extra one because, thank heavens,
Oprah is not in it.
