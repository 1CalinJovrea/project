Typical teen movie

The DUFF is a typical teen movie! If you are looking for a funny and
easy movie to watch it with your friends, The DUFF will be a good
choice! It is about an "ugly" girl Bianca (of course she is not really
ugly) who finds out that she is a DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). So
the easiest person to talk with, if someone needs information about her
more beautiful friends. Her neighbor, the handsome and popular Wesley,
helps her to become as pretty as her friends. SPOILER Like in every
teen movie the boy sees the real beauty of the girl and they fall in
love with each other. In between there are some romantic, funny and
also serious scenes.All in all I really liked the movie, because we need sometimes a
romantic movie to show that everyone is beautiful in their own way.
