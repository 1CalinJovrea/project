I found it wonderful w/ tons of humor

The movie gets a ten form me. Considering I love these kind of films. I
know a lot of folks feel this movie might not be geared towards
children under 9. I'm far from a prune, but I would not take a five
year old but.............. then again, I've watch children and they are
much smarter than we give them credit for. so point? Judge for
yourself. There were kids in the theater that appear to be about
five-ish or seven- ish and they knew when to laugh and really enjoyed
themselves. So again if it just you you will love it. If you have kids
under nine It would have to be on you to decide. but I hardly think
this movie will turn your kid in to a thug, or the devil spawns. It a
good movie.
