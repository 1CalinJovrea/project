Really cheap attempt to make people laugh

I decided to watch this movie because of Jason Statham and I saw the
ratings were pretty good too.As I began to watch it, it was clear that its suppose to be a spy movie
parody. The beginning was actually not bad so my expectations were that
it should be at list somewhat entertaining, but the next 95% of the
movie proved me wrong...The plot is extremely generic and without any creative expression at
all. Most of the scenes are boring at best and really cringy and
obnoxious, the jokes are either sexual or plain cursing and insults but
not in a funny way at all. Only a couple of scenes gave me a degree of
entertainment (when Rick Ford brags about himself and when the security
guy Anthony gets shot, maybe something else) all of the rest was making
it difficult to watch... The characters were boring as well. The action
is not top notch but its alright, but it doesn't even come close to
making up for the rest. The production itself is good but it would be a
crime if it wasn't with a 65 million budget.In conclusion: There was potential to this movie but they flushed it in
the sewer where the level of the movie is as well... I recommend NOT TO
WATCH this movie and not to waste time on it...
