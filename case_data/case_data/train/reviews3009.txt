This is one of the worst movies of 2012

This movie is utterly awful unless you are ready for a bad comedy.
There are tons of flows. Albania doesn't border Turkey. Istanbul is a
magnificent city. In the movie it is portrayed as a third world country
slam hole. Police in Istanbul have new cars. The girl doesn't have a
driver license in the US where everyone drives an automatic. Yet in the
movie she hops in a stick stick shift cab and shows some amazing
skills...So lame... Shots are fired in a hotel, grenades are detonated
in a middle of a cosmopolitan city ...and there's no Police... The main
character is taken on a ride for a few minutes and yet he appears to be
almost next to the hotel. Albanians converse in English?!
