Astonishing.

This is my first ever review.Bone Tomahawk was, in my opinion, enthralling.All I wish to say is this: It is a western. A great, detailed and
well-written western. Kurt Russel makes an appearance one cannot help
but love. It's horror "tag" comes from the brutality in the depiction;
which in my opinion is further from scary than horrific.I cannot recall the last time I enjoyed a movie so much. Without
further talk of character and plot, I am confident that you will enjoy
this movie regardless of your taste.Have a great experience; lord knows I did.
