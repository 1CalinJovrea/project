What a wast of time (Spoiler Alert)

(Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert)
(Spoiler Alert) (Spoiler Alert) just so its clear Where to start this
movie was the biggest load of ~~~~ I've seen in a very long time
especially for Jackson and Russell.It was way too long it took elements from kill bill and inglorious the
story line was pants the backing music was rubbish the hole thing was
not worth any ones time making the story was boring guy arrest girl
girl is sent to be hung girls brother and friends try to rescue loads
of people die girl gets hung. Way too much blood in places way over the
top with the hole death and shooting does have a bit of comedy but not
a lot.The best thing about the movies is the trailer.
