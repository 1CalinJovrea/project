Best movie ever, spoiler warning

Best movie I have seen all year, the story-line is written perfectly
and immediately grabs your attention. It's scary to think what things
will be done in the future, but this movie all though fiction shows a
real problem soon to come in reality. The acting was awesome didn't
need many characters for the story-line so everything from start to
finish was air tight.. Sucks that he never really gets out in the end I
was on his side, for those of you who are wondering how I know he never
god out I'll tell you. remember at a certain part in the movie they
show you that the coffee making girlfriend is actually a prisoner in
another cell, and at the end of the movie the news reports said he was
a lone survivor, well how can he have met her in the same diner if she
was a prisoner as well and he was the lone survivor. He never got
out(:<
