Scouting for an audience

Horror films in recent years tend to be in the found footage vein, and
Zombie films have been in decline since filmmakers could knock them out
on low budgets with large amounts of CGI hordes of the undead for the
straight to disc market.Scouts Guide is a modestly budgeted comedy horror with lashings of gore
with plenty of raucous laugh aloud.The film does open up with a truly cringe worthy two minutes of inept
nonsense with a janitor doing his job, but quickly changes its pace
with the introduction of D.O.D. Christopher Landon (son of Highway to
Heaven actor/director Michael London) has the guts to run with the
laughs and some decent splatter for the next 90s minutes. The cast of unknowns are capable and do have the charm and skill to
carry the film over its 90 minutes running time. The film does not lag
or waste any time introducing parental relationships and defining the
social structure of high school culture it exists within its own
universe of undead, scouts, strippers, boobs and pussies of all sorts.
It's well edited, the script is tight,the photography is bright and
clean and is definitely worth a viewing.I just hope the producers don't plan a long series of low budget
pointless sequels and just let the film find its own appreciative
audience over the coming years.
