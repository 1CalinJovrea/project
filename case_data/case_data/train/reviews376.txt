Simply Not Funny

Much has been said about the talented lead performers, and they have
done decent work in previous endeavors. However, not much can be done
with a weak script and with overextended dialogue that doesn't
substitute for quality."Trainwreck" deserves its title for it crashes
early on and never recovers.We are subjected to the required introduction to explain the
protagonist's wishes to remain unattached. It's most likely the first
misstep for now there's not much to discover in the development of the
film. We know and see a disturbed and socially inept person who is
unable to bond with a person of the opposite sex. What we also get is a
very unattractive person because her language, attitude, and behavior
are really not much to entice any guys beyond the overnight date.Yes, we can look at it as statement for a woman's right to choose how
to live her love life, but why make the character so unlikable and
vulgar. We have our share of challenging and difficult girls on screen
before, but there were compensating qualities, and the script gave us
intelligent and funny lines. Apatow continues on his crusade to
trivialize and gives himself an easy way to please the crowds and not
demand much from performers and the audience. Overall, it's an experience that will tempt you to walk out if you are
in the mood to expect at least a decent film.
