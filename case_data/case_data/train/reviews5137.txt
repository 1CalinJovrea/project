A Fathers Must See!

As a parent you'll find it hard to look at your child without admiring
that silly behavior or constant charm. Our children are - after all - a
driving purpose & Marc Webbs "Gifted" has no limit to those little
reminders of why. Starring Christopher Evans as "Frank Adler", this
family oriented drama will have you smiling for hours at the wacky
comments and sheer intellect "Mary Adler" (McKenna Grace) portrays in
her character is a child prodigy - something I'm sure we all see in our
sons & daughters, regardless of where they stand. The plot-line here
was surprisingly soft and presented host of lessons that highlighted
the importance of a trusting relationship with your child; not to
mention dealing with those who might try and stand between it. It's a
title every father must see and every mother should feel encouraged by.
Where there's love, there's life!
