Formulaic and historically inaccurate

A reasonably competent movies from a technical point of view, but in
other respects very misleading.What I liked was Ben's restrained performance as the CIA field
operative, and fun to see John Goodman in a straight role, but
everything else was a bit lacking. Iran is an extraordinary, culturally
rich and diverse country, but it is portrayed as populated entirely by
thugs and fundamentalists, with the rest of the population invisible or
cowering victims. I'm not being an apologist for a state with poor
human rights and a dictatorial government - but it is not what is
portrayed in this movie.The basic fact that for a short period several American consulate
workers were in hiding and were flown out under fake identities is
true, but a lot is missed out. They first hid in the British consulate,
but were moved to Canada House on British advice (as best as I can
glean from various Internet sources), and the whole operation was a
joint venture between at least three countries. What we get is a
'Yankwash.'The film-makers have said that people forget that "this is a movie",
and deliberate latitude and creativity is necessary for entertainment
purposes to make it watchable and engaging. Okay, so if that is the
case then what is left is formulaic: bad guys do something bad -
maverick individual comes up with a daring plan - plan almost fails at
the last minute - car chase - everyone alright now!I'm sorry, but I just don't buy the excuses. This is a lazy way of
film- making. The more accurate story could have been well told - with
acceptable dramatic liberties such as condensing number of characters,
timescales and even adding the (actually never happened) car-chasing-a-
jumbo-jet-bit as they finally flee - without having to rewrite history
t a degree that becomes offensive.So, averagely enjoyable if it was fiction and a polished production
from a acting and technical point of view, but a desperately inaccurate
pastiche of what really happened - a great shame as the real story
would have been just as good, if not better for being real.
