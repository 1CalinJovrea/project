Face/Off meets Limitless

Damian(Ben Kingsley) a self made billionaire discovers he is dying, and
does have much longer to live, discovers a secret facility that can
transfer his soul into a younger body(Ryan Reynolds), when the transfer
is a success, Damian really begins to enjoy his new life in his new
body, but soon realizes that his new life will have a price to pay.I'm surprised that I liked this, I went expecting this to be bad, but I
was amazed on how intriguing it kept me. It shows on we deal with dying
and immortality, and things we must learn to face in life. Ben Kingsley
was good, and Ryan Reynolds really surprised me. Matthew Goode was
incredible. It does have some good action scenes, and great sci-fi
element. Everybody gives a good performance here, and it does what
sci-fi should do, kept you intrigue.
