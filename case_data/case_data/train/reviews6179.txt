Astonishing Special Effects

I must say, the critics of this film seem overly harsh. If nothing
else, the film is worth seeing for the special effects. I thought Mila
Kunis was better in Black Swan, but she wasn't bad in the lead role.
The plot was very strange, but that is what the Wachowski's do best. A
lot of small rolls and cameos from big stars. And I wish Doona Bae had
a larger role, as she stole the show in Cloud Atlas.I can see, why this
movie cost 175 million dollars. The sets were brilliant and very
imaginative. The 3d was also cool. If you are looking for something
which isn't your boiler plate science fiction, give this film a day in
court.
