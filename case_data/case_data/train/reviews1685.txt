Tale of Two Cities

Sweet little love story of an Irish lass who comes to America circa
1950. She leaves her home in Enniscorthy (Co. Wexford) and comes to
seek fame and fortune - and maybe a 'fella' - in Brooklyn. Subsequent
events draw her back to Enniscorthy, and then back to Brooklyn. In
between we come to know Eilis (pronounced Ailish) Lacey (Saoirse Ronan)
quite well because it is her picture, and she is in nearly every scene.
She changes from a homesick immigrant to a self-assured woman in the
course of the picture, and Ronan's characterization is terrific.Along the way she meets Tony Fiorello, played by Emory Cohen in a role
apparently underplayed so as not to upstage the main character. He
comes from a big Italian family but is not a stereotypical Italian; he
is barely audible and very subdued. Perhaps the best and most humorous
scenes take place at dinnertime in Mrs. Kehoe's boarding house for
Irish immigrant girls. Played by Julie Walters, she rides herd on her
catty boarders and uses religious metaphors to put them in their place."Brooklyn" is a movie for grown-ups, an independent film in a sea of
Hollywood schlock. It is a likable movie with a lot of heart and solid
acting down to the smallest role. It is not a sprawling saga but a nice
little movie, and I have only sketched a few instances. Many reviewers
summarize the whole picture, but the overall tenor of the picture gives
the moviegoer a rooting interest and a sense of the resiliency of the
human spirit, as well as an illustration of the innate decency and
goodness of Eilis Lacey.P.S. Those hoping to see scenes of Brooklyn neighborhoods will be
disappointed; the picture was filmed in Canada and Ireland.
