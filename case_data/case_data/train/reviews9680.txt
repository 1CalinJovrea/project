What a crock of ...

I think we're supposed to get a point about the importance of human
feelings. So we get a stupidly enforced scenario, where you see no
correlation between act and react. If somebody is to be evil and kick
somebody to death or disfigure somebody, I'd like some grasp as to why.Hell, maybe it's based on some personal loss. Or it's some peculiar
fable over the current European refugee crisis or something. Admirable,
in such case. Don't get me wrong. I'm fine with fables, it has its own
beautiful tradition and storytelling raison d'Ãªtre. But you need to at
least believe in the scenario for the duration. If you fail at that,
your point is lost to people. There's no discernible reason as to why
it's so life-or-death important, that people of this civilization has
to be paired, otherwise they get killed because they're "loners." Or
why pairs has to share interests, otherwise they have to split up and
then they get killed. It's a completely bizarre construct, you can only
imagine came up during a talentless script session. "This is how we
make something, that'll stand out. 'Cause we're artists, we are, we
are!"Sometimes a crappy film is worth the time just for the laugh. Not here,
you just feel sad for people acting in it. No actor should be subjected
to such a naked emperor. If it didn't have another chap's name on it,
you'd think it was a Lars Trier pile of poo. This is the kind of stuff
Monty Python justly mocked. Not even unsolicited graphic sex scenes can
save this junk. I smell razzies so much it hurts. I smell an A list
actor quickly going B or worse.
