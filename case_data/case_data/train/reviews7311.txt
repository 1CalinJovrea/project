Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is FANTASTIC

Amazing movie, they've done it again! The cast was amazing (though
Johnny Depp as Grindewald takes time to get used to),visual effects
stunning and the movie is everything you can except it to be. The movie
has so many great moments, it's happy and funny yet serious enough and
has AMAZING humour, I laughed a lot while watching it and so did
everyone else :) LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE and can't wait to see
more!!! I also love the fact that they didn't try to continue the
Potter series but instead made a ''stand alone'' movie franchise which
has so many connections to the Harry Potter books/movies, it really
made me feel like they're not trying to ''milk us'' but just want to
provide us more amazing movies from the world we all love so much :)
