Don't actually spend money on this.  Please.

I realize that not all movies can have fast-paced action sequences, or
a perfectly linear/understandable plot, or what you would consider to
be "normal" characters and/or character interaction.But this particular movie manages single-handedly to avoid all of the
above.And add in some heavily awkward/nonsensical scenes where an Asian
police officer does Karaoke, while the entire bar sits in complete and
utter silence (literally no movement in the room as this person sings,
and these scenes draw onwards for at least 5 to 10 minutes. In the
middle of the movie).I...can't describe how bad this movie is. It's not "art", it's not even
particularly striking or disturbing like a David Lynch movie.It's just nonsense for the sake of nonsense, featuring Ryan Gosling
uttering all of five syllables and NOT CHANGING HIS EXPRESSION for the
entire film.Spoiler alert: the final scene, insane and nonsensical as it may be, is
cut off by (you guessed it) yet another scene of a cop singing at a
karaoke bar.At that point the entire movie theater I was at got on its feet and
left.Laughing.
