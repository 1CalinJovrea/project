De Niro?

There was a time when you seen Robert De Niro and it was a must watch.
What happened to that. Robert De Niro has done nothing but crap in the
last ten years. Here again we De Niro playing a wise guy, tough guy in
this totally unbelievable why the hell am I watching this, movie. I
would like to say Michele Pfeiffer and Tommy Lee Jones helped in this
but the only thing they helped do is tank this movie. Tommy Lee Jones
another actor who rest on his morals. Hasn't had a good movie since Men
In Black. Just do your self a favor and don't even start. Go outside
and sit in the rain. You will enjoy yourself much more.
