The less you know, the more this movie will catch you unawares

While Brimstone would register to most, as a Western (and for the most
part it is), the horror elements cannot be denied. The gruesome kills
and vicious shark-like nature of this movies protagonist, played
terrifyingly well, by Guy Pearce, will keep you glued to your screen,
even with the long run time of 2hrs plus. Dakota Fanning is at the top of her game here, in a role that requires
her to show, not tell. She and Guy Pearce are the main reasons why
Brimstone is as good as it is, while young actress, Emilia Jones, also
delivers. It's a slow burn, so for those with a lack of patience, this movie
might seem tedious, but for myself , the performances, the unexpected
brutality and the strength and tenaciousness of our heroine Liz, makes
Brimstone a must see. If you enjoyed, Bone Tomahawk, you'll find a lot to like about
Brimstone.
