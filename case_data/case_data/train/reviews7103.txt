The non-spoiler trailers represents this wonderful movie perfectly

Did any of the 100+ 'one star' 'worst film ever' reviewers see the
trailer for 'Under the Skin'? If they had, they would have known
exactly what they were in for. I'm just guessing that the prospect of
seeing Scarlett Johansson naked had many of them them throw caution
into the wind. And then they felt cheated. Serves them right.The trailer perfectly captures the mood of this film, without giving
anything away. Distancing, cold, slow, with a continuous sense of doom,
terrifying, but also heartbreaking. Some scenes (on the beach, the last
passenger, the two guys) will stay with me forever.An amazing performance by Scarlett Johansson, who was given very little
dialogue and had to act non-verbally for most of the running time.
Superb soundtrack, editing, and cinematography. It takes some effort to
keep up and fill in the blanks (an easy film this is not), but the
rewards are ample. But please, see the trailer first.
