Lower budget of "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "Fast and Furious"

7 October 3017: A Good rip off flick. When I was in college in the late
80's, one of my college professors told the class that every film or
t.v show has been done once or twice. How true that is. The writer took
ideas from films, "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "Fast and Furious" films.
Scott Eastwood and his famous dad, Clint look like identical clones.
Scott should change his first name to Clint and have Scott as his
middle name. Overdrive is a fairly okay movie. It held my interest. I
have seen worse flicks.This film is Not ready for a theatrical release, which is why it is
best seen from Red Box DVD rental or on cable television. The actors
and actresses are fairly okay, but the cast of "Fast & Furious" films
are much better and the story lines in the Fast films are better.
Overdrive is okay for a lower budget flick. Pretty Latina, Ana De Armas
is hot and sexy, just as she was in her film "Knock-Knock", but she has
a long ways to go to match up with talented actresses like Charlize
Theron or beautiful Spanish actress Penelope Cruz or beautiful Israeli
actresses Gal Gadot and Moran Atias. Penelope, Gal, Moran and Charlize
are the full package in looks, body and talent.Stunts in this flick was so-so average. The driving around the cliff is
a total rip off of the Fast & Furious films. Scott Eastwood has the
cool looks and charm, but so far no macho lead actor can make those
fast driving scenes look better than Vin Diesel. If you are bored with
nothing better to do, sit down and watch this low budget version.
