Liked the CGI and sets, but didn't like the story

What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again,
in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created
(visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to
the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had
the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets
the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film.
Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I
would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good
story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind
Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and
expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding
and time are left for the associated story.I just wish that, when someone comes up with future plans for making a
legitimate SF film (sans comic book scenarios), they contract a real
science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of
SF writers out there that can, I believe, turn out much better scripts
than currently making their way to the big screen.Bottom line: the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some
of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when
Bladerunner was produced. As an avid, and long time fan of true science
fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the
story, it could have been a lot, lot better.
