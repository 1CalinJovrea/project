Fun Horror Film

One of the better horror flicks released this Halloween season. Had a
very unique story line and was filmed in such a way with its cut scenes
that at times you might get lost in it and think it to be a real
documentary. The cast did a great job of acting and as a group of
friends in the movie had plenty of moments of comic relief getting the
viewer attached to them as the story progressed and built up to the
climax. What really made this movie great in my opinion is that the
haunts they visited are all real locations out in the middle of no
where(aside from the last one). The ending is fun and leaves the viewer
with there own opinions of what just took place. I'm sure plenty will
disagree, but for a movie that really had no publicity around where I
live, I think if marketed right would have been a big hit as it had a
similar feel to the first paranormal activity. I think now a days it is
really tough to make a great horror film as so many people are
desensitized, but this one really drags you in. I will be adding The
Houses October Built to my collection of horror films.
