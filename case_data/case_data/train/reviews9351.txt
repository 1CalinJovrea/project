Does Brad Betray his country in World War II?

(Spoilers). What does a man do when he finds out he's accidentally
married to a Nazi spy? They don't want you to know that's what the
movie is about. Hmmmm! Why not? ALLIED is an expensive but startlingly
boring World War II drama, but money alone can't bring a film to light.Good thing this lost $45 million of the $80 million production cost. It
might teach them something.
