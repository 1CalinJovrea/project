Beautiful

What a lovely movie. A truly horrid time, war, finds something so real
and alive, love and passion. Michelle Williams is a true untapped
resource for a strong performance. I wish she did more films. She is
stunning in the most real and beautiful way. She draws you in and makes
you feel every emotion tenfold. A true powerhouse of talent. Kristin
Scott Thomas plays the perfect stone old maid but with an underlying
warm heart. In a time of war everyone had to brick their hearts away or
be dragged under by the war machine. She portrays that beautifully. She
plays the part from top to bottom with the zest of a Disney villain.
BUT, don't judge too quickly. Matthias....ahhh Matthias. Can't get me
enough of him. Yet another hidden gem of Hollywood.
