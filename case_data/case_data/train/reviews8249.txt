Eye candy

Here we go again...Arrival is another clich√©-ridden, over-sentimental pseudo-science-
fiction story with that ad-nauseam message that the world, humanity
needs to works as one or else.Arrival joins ranks with pseudo-science-fiction bombs such as
Interstellar and Prometheus which are films that substitute true
adventure, discovery with this idiotic humanist, intimist, sentimental,
psychological-whatever drivel. And curiously, one of the main
characters behaves in the same mindless way as a character in
Prometheus and removes her protective gear so that the aliens could see
her better....It seems stupidity is contagious.For god's sake, aliens are contacting humanity for the first time and
all the directors and script writers have to show is this sugary syrup
of a story? And the twist (yes, of course, there is a twist) is mind-
boggling stupid. Writers had a nice concept, but did not know how to
develop it nor how to close the story in an intelligent way. Arrival is another dumb story packaged with an interesting photography.It is 100% eye candy and nothing else.
