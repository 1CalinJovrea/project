Pretty entertaining thriller

The Body executes its ideas very well and has some solid acting. I like
these kind of movies, because you feel like you are trying to be a
detective as well and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.
This is the case with The Body, a movie that will have you gripping
your seat trying to find the answers for the entire duration of the
movie. And you probably won't, until it is revealed. And when it is,
well I won't lie it really has that been there, done that feeling. No
spoilers but it seems it borrowed a lot from Usual Suspects, but the
things that actually unfold seem a bit unrealistic. I didn't buy the
ending, which is the weaker part of the movie you could say. But still,
solid entertainment coming from a Spanish production.
