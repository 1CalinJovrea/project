Purile, camp, adolescent. An insult to the genre.

Truly awful rendition of a Marvel superhero. Turgid, adolescent and
inane, routine CGI effects and a plot you could write on the back of a
postage stamp. The so-called comedy lines are expelled as if from a
failing gattling gun, interspersed with fantasy fillers including
masturbation, soft toys and sex in Christmas sweaters. If this is
you're thing - I suppose, go for it. Everyone else stay well clear. Had this been counter-balanced in any way by a genuine malevolence from
our "hero" there may have been some redemption, but the violence is all
just meaningless, cartoonish and blah.Incredible that the back story involves Deadpool's attempt to "win back
the girl" when he, and everything else in this waste of money movie is
so overwhelmingly camp. Right up to the end credits when our hero, as a
cartoon, jerks off a unicorn's horn to produce an ejaculate made of
rainbows and fairy-dust. Truly, this is the very stuff this risible
movie is made from.
