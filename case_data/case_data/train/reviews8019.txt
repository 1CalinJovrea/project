How we long for an actual horror story, and how rare one comes along.
Early on you know you are going for a ride.. a painstaking one. There
is just a subtle sense that everything is going to build up right,
disturbingly, later, and you cannot just see it. There's too much
hidden you cannot point them out. How could you? It takes its sweet,
sweet time before you feel virtually threatened in the once-comfortable
safety of your own home.You are always one step behind. You just do not want to figure it out.
Try not let the anticipation turn into a frustration, to not tilt your
head to see a foot away into shadows behind the door, not to literally
feel the pain, inflicted with an inconceivable harm so mental you are
not sure if you want to escape or fight. Try to keep calm.
