Excellent

I downloaded this movie as soon as it went online. Living in France and
having heard everything about it since the Sony hack, I just had to
watch it. If North Korea is really behind the hack, and they probably
are, I understand why they did it. Their Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un,
gets made fun of by one amazing American journalist who just gets his
way with people. I admit that the storyline is fairly straightforward,
that we're expecting the "twist" here and there, in other words, it's
not a masterpiece. But do we really care? I think this movie is sending
a message, that even in the worst country of the world, on the brink of
a potential war, we don't care about taboo. We need to talk about the
issues of this country.This movie cracked me up so many times, and knowing that there is so
much drama behind it, I couldn't do anything else but to rate it 10/10.
Sony, if not the two brilliant actors, deserve that.
