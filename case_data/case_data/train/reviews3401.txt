A Beautiful Tough Drama

This movie will probably not win best movie of the year, but if it does
it is with good reason. The way this movie shows sexuality, parenthood,
drug abuse, and so much more is just brilliant. This movie is in 3
parts, him as a young child (6-7) then as a teenager (14-16) then as a
grown man (21-26). It actually mostly shows him as a child or teenager
but focuses very much on his personal transformation.Let me start by saying this movie is really terrifying in the good way,
and it at least to me feel much more real than the many other movies i
watch. Without even being able to really feeling a connection to the
story, like I am white, straight, not really from a poor/tough
neighbour-hood but I still feel I can relate to him. I haven't seen
anything with Barry Jenkins before but we are clearly gonna hear a lot
about him, after this movie.The movie has some amazing performances like Mahershala Ali, (my
favorite role) and incredible acting by Naomi Harris, and I don't know
the name of the people playing the main character, but I feel all the
actors playing him (the main character) were really good. The movie is
beautifully shot, and it is just an brilliant story. I personally cant
remember the last time I thought so much about a movie after watching
it. I feel the movie handles all it subjects very well, and do it in the
most beautiful way imaginable. I have no shame in saying this is very
likely the best movie of 2016. I am gonna finish by saying this movie
is great and I haven't personally met someone who did not at least say
it is a really good movie. 10/10
