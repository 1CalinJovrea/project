Wrong  Turn  6: Last  Resort  is  a  pathetic  horror  film

Nobody would have imagined the fact that the original Wrong Turn would
initiate a prolific horror franchise. My favorite film from this saga
so far is Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, because it displayed narrative
innovation, good doses of black humor and big quantities of gore. After
that one, we have had films which go from the decent (Wrong Turn 4:
Bloody Beginnings) to the bad (Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead, Wrong Turn
5: Bloodlines), but I think Wrong Turn 6: Last Resort is definitely the
worst film in this franchise so far. The screenplay from this movie
quickly derails, and it fragments the story into boring and poorly
connected slopes, which are focused on such hollow and hateful
characters that they didn't inspire any empathy or interest. And the
villains are as insipid as the victims, besides of the fact that the
gore is scarce and not very realistic. And finally, my opinion about
Wrong Turn 6: Last Resort decayed even more due to a horrible scene
with a deer, which I would like to think it was a special effect, even
though I doubt it (as I said in other occasion, shooting in East Europe
far from from North American laws promotes this kind of abuse). In
conclusion, Wrong Turn 6: Last Resort is a pathetic horror film, and I
recommend you not to waste your time and your money in this piece of
junk.
