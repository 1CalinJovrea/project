Silly, Boring and waste of time

The movie is really awful to watch. It looks like US govt funded this
movie and they wanted this movie to be released. No one in their sane
mind would have funded this movie let alone release it. Really awful
plot, silly script and too predictable. Russia is the bad guy and USA
is the good guy. Russia tries very hard to make the US economy crash.
But then the hero finds it out and outperforms the people thus by
compromising their plan.I mean what an awful boring stupid plot, and how many times these guys
would create the same sh*t over and over again? I rated this movie 1
because I don't want to see movies similar to this. It would have been
better if they released a movie which shows nothing but static for
straight two hours. Please stop producing such awful movies!
