Makes Plan 9 from outer space look like Citizen Kane!

I gave this 1, as it won't allow you to review with zero! All the best
bits were in the trailer. I don't mind a film that lets your mind have
a break, but it is unforgivable to not be fun! Cast was impressive, I
can only assume the makers either sold their soul or called in an awful
lot of favours to get everyone on board.Any film with Ms Farris is going to be crass toilet humour, and this
film did have two of those three elements. It just missed of the
humour! I appreciate sense of humour differs between across the
Atlantic (how else can you explain How I met your mother or Seinfeld
getting past the pilot episodes), but come on. This film created a new
level of awful.It's a total car crash of a movie. Usually in this style of movie at
least one of the skits works, sadly not in this film.For the Americans out there Possibly suggest this for Thanksgiving,
because it is a massive turkey!
