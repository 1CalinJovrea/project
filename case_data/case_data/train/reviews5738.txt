A sequel just for the sake of a sequel

This is a very unpolished sequel that seems to have gotten made,
because they wanted a sequel and more money for the studio (probably
more about the money). I liked this less than the previous first
installment and I am not even a fan of the first one. It has more
action and special effects, but that doesn't make a superhero movie any
better. It just wasn't interesting nor did it have anything for me to
attach myself to. After few minutes in, I just wanted for the final
action set pieces to come in (which is actually cleverly done) and be
done with. I know humor isn't suppose to be the part that stands out in
a superhero movie, but my goodness, the humor in this is just forced
and awful. Some of the characters seem more annoying than beneficial to
this movie as a whole and just seemed to be there, because they were in
the previous movie in this franchise. This movie brings nothing new to
the superhero genre, they had the mentality of "if it works previously,
why fix it?" direction. It's like one of those video games that does
well with the first installment, but does the same thing with the
gameplay and everything for the next installment with a different story
with just another different villain that is generic as it gets.5.9/10
