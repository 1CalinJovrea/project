Beautiful visuals & CGI bring legend to life

I wasn't sure what to expect with Tarzan. I thought it might be cheesy
or the special effects would look ridiculous, but surprisingly a
majority of the time, it looked really good! Do you have to suspend
disbelief sometimes? Absolutely. But it's a story about a man who
controls jungle animals and swings from vines, so its going to look
unbelievable at points. However, I found a good chunk (about 85% IMO)
relied on realistic scenery, makeup and special effects. I mean...
they're not going to use real gorillas or lions with the actors, but
the CGI ones looked really good and will have you mesmerized by the
detail. Personally found the movie very enjoyable, action packed and
beautiful to watch. The director and actors did a phenomenal job. I
found myself glued to the screen for a majority of the film.
