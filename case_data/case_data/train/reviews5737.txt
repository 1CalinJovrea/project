Very good end of work time pass movie

As i'm not a very big fan of Sandler movies,,Was very hesitant to watch
this movie.But turns out a really refreshing movie..Couldn't take my
eyes of Michelle tho she was awesomely cute in this movie.. Storyline
and concepts good..Making also above average.For all sections not just
for the Nerds!! Video game lovers gonna love this movie .. Sandler as
usual But Monaghan steals the show along with peter dinklage..But the
president character was too saucy.Comic timing is really very well
composed.The graphics were a little shabby as far as ny opinion...But
certainly a good time pass movie to watch with ur kids or
parents..Cheers Enjoy with a Dew and a Pop corn!!!
