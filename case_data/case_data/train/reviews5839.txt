Much like the show it's based on, this is STUPID!

A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV
show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged
pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like
the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain
cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne
Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It
is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The
film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a
parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on
a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who
are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those
of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that
a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have
been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about
the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer
than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film.
