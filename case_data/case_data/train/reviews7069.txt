3
2+ hours of people yelling at each other

This film was excruciating. By the end of the film, I was so exhausted
after having watched a staggeringly annoying family (and almost
everyone associated with said family) argue, scream, yell, whine, cry,
complain and fight for TWO HOURS that I was on the verge of suicide. I
popped in a DVD copy of "Requiem For a Dream" just to cheer myself up.By now, you've read the summary and the other reviews, so I won't
rehash it, but, to summarize, guy (Rudd) and woman (Mann) are
apparently only able to remain hopelessly and exclusively linked to one
another in matrimony by the boat anchors which resulted from their
unfortunate (for the audience) procreation. The family meanders its way
through what passes as its daily existence by struggling with finances,
impotence, various addictions and afflictions, including sugar,
smoking, internet, rage, mooching/unloving parents, unwise spending
choices, poor business decisions, selfishness and low self-esteem.That's pretty much it. Really. That is what you will spend 2+ hours
watching and little more.Any film which can render Paul Rudd, Albert Brooks and Jason Siegel so
completely and utterly unfunny is something which should be avoided. If
Judd Apatow wrote this as a means of expressing his mid-life woes, I
cannot possibly imagine how he manages to get up in the morning, much
less muster up the energy or motivation to create. You have been warned.
