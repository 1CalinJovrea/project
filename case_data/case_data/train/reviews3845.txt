So bad it will make your eyes bleed.

Thinking of going to see Wrath of the Titans? In 3d? Save yourself some
pocket money and do the following instead: lie on the ground and pour a
mixture of soil and skittles slowly into your eyes whilst mumbling the
names of Greek Gods. This will have the same entertainment value as the
film, and a considerably better plot.Having seen the remake of the original, I went into Wrath of the Titans
with my expectation level pretty low. Five minutes in, I quickly
lowered it further. Ten minutes in... I buried my expectation level
under my seat and stomped it into the ground - hard. But however low I
set the bar, the film went lower. It's unimaginably dire.There's simply nothing redeemable about the film at all. Even the
impressive effects are ruined by awful direction that renders them no
more engaging than watching a ten year old playing video games through
a kaleidoscope.Everyone involved in making Wrath of the Titans should be thoroughly
ashamed of themselves; and to be fair Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes
clearly are as they show it on screen. They both look embarrassed to be
a part of it. I'm embarrassed that I bore witness to it. Please don't
be a statistic and join us. There's nothing to see here - move along,
move along.
