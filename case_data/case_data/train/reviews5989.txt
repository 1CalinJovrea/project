A Very Emotional Movie

I can't believe some of the low ratings on here for this movie. I was
expecting to see at least an "8" rating. This movie is very Emotional
and a tear jerker. I guess the viewers who gave this movie a low rating
is because they can't connect with the true emotional state of the
characters. I won't go in depth about this movie as other reviewers had
already done so, but this is a MUST SEE movie if you are a
compassionate person who can connect with one's loss and how painfully
it is to accept life's tragedies but is also able to treasure the
"beauty" and the times you spent together before the tragedy.
