Disturbing but illuminating

This true life experiment held in Stanford in the 70s is quite a
disturbing movie. A psychology professor gets students to pretend to be
guards and prisoners for a couple of weeks but things get out of
control with sadistic abuse on the guards part. It's not a pleasant
watch but it makes one think about the whole system of incarceration
and the effect on human nature. It's relevant because of the current
abuses in prisons both domestic and in the Middle East.Is it human nature to abuse when in power? Why did normal people become
abusers when given the opportunity? It's a different look at guards and
prisoners - because these were normal people not criminals or enemy
combatants.The acting is good. Billy Crudup is the Stanford professor who seems to
allow things to go too far. He is portrayed as rather cruel and pig
headed.Watch it but be warned it's pretty unpleasant.
