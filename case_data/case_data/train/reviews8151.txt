Faith adaptation of Doris Lessing's novella

I'm not surprised that mostly male critics panned this movie. Some of
them were kind enough to call it well made trash. One reviewer said it
had nothing in common with Doris Lessing's story and that reviewer
clearly had not read the story in a very long time.The movie exactly captures the feel of the novella. The beachy, cozy
environment, the exclusiveness of these two families, the deep
friendship between the women ...it's all in the novella. The sex is in
the novella too, just not graphic, but it's clearly there.This movie is a mood piece just like the novella. A glimpse into a very
specific group of people. A bit of a "what if" in my opinion.The novella has an equally ambivalent ending. I think it's a bit more
downbeat than the movie, but still worth a read. She is one of the
great feminist writers of the twentieth century. And it's a highly
readable story. It's just all so cozy and seductive.
