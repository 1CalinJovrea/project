Silly as Hell, but quite entertaining

Absolutely ludicrous Liam Neeson thriller (which is a genre now), but,
frankly, it's just a lot of fun. I found myself smiling and giggling at
the silliness of it all, but damned if I wasn't enjoying myself the
whole time. Neeson plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly
after his flight commences that, if a load of money isn't deposited
into an untraceable bank account, a passenger will be killed every 20
minutes. The film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess - or,
alternatively, you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like Hell they
don't pull out the old
Liam-Neeson-has-multiple-personalities-and-is-doing-it-himself twist.
The film is hilariously convoluted with plenty of plot holes. When the
villain is revealed, they say "You'd never believe how easy it all
was!" They are correct. I would never believe it. I still quite enjoyed
watching it.
