The hounds of love: you should never trust a man with a moustache

This is set in 1987 - Perth, Australia. Rated Cert. 18 for sustained
sexual threat.Based on a true story of the Moorehouse Murders. The themes dealt with
are abduction, sex, torture, brutal domination, distress, rape and
murder. There are standout performances from Emma Booth (the wife, who is both
an abductor and a victim), Stephen Curry (the O.C.D. husband, who is
both a dominant figure in his household but also submissive to the men
he owes money to) and particularly Ashleigh Cummings (who is the
abducted teenage character).This is not a film that you watch to particularly enjoy or be
entertained by, but it's gripping and accurately shows how these things
could happen!
