A great story ruined!?!? OR did we (or just me) expect too much???

I had to drive over 70miles one way to watch this movie and was it
worth it? Hard to say if one watched "the iceman tapes" from HBO. To me
personally it was disappointing, but I probably expected way too much.
So lower your expectations and you will have a nice evening in the
cinema. Shannon is great, superb, I guess nobody could have played him better,
but the editing, the storytelling is very abrupt and a bit too edgy.
Its not a good fellas, its not even close to it, don't expect even a
mob flick. Its an OK movie that had so much more potential. YET it is
still worth watching since you don't see movies like that nowadays very
often. The potential of the story would have been an 11, this movie is a 7
with an extra point for Shannons performance. And in relevance I should
mention that I would give broken city a 3.5, gangster squad a 4.5, so I
guess people who watch this movie with not so high expectations will
love it! PS. No "the iceman" did NOT got his nick because he was so cold, like
another reviewer wrote, but because he froze a body for two years. The
officials gave him then that name. All this is well known through the
"iceman tapes".
