The Hateful Eight, is trite, stale and banal

The Hateful Eight is awful. It is another long and angry film
portraying white people as evil racists. Samuel L. Jackson plays the
character of the noble Negro and in the end he vanquishes the evil
white people.The first half of the film is entirely devoted to character
development. It is extremely slow, dull and tedious. Major Marquis
Warren, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is the noble Negro character. Some
viewers may sympathize with Major Warren because he is a former slave
and heroic Union Calvary officer during the Civil War. Major Warren
gleefully brags about all the white people that he killed during the
war. The other characters play the role of the evil white person, as
evidenced by their constant use of the N-word toward Major Warren. The
repeated use of the N-word in this film is a failed literary device.
Rather than manifest that the white characters are evil racists, the
constant use of the N-word becomes a dreadful assault upon one's
sensibilities.In the second half of the film, the plot lumbers along. Major Warren
holds the evil white characters at gun point and threatens them with
imminent death. He torments an old Confederate General, played by Bruce
Dern, who is looking for his lost son. Major Warren boastfully recounts
(and the film explicitly shows) how he captured the General's lost son,
stripped him naked, marched him through the snow for hours and then
forced his captive to perform fellatio upon his "big black dick,"
before shooting him to death.Quentin Tarantino has lost the golden touch. Some of his earlier films
were worth watching, but The Hateful Eight, is trite, stale and banal.
