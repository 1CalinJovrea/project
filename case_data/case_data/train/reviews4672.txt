A brilliant, funny, touching weird film

In some ways, it's rather conventional; a young woman trying to figure
herself out. And in some other ways, it's outrageously crass and
disgusting. But somehow, I didn't mind the crass, disgusting parts that
much because I found most of them to be outrageously funny; and I'm
pretty sure that's how the were intended. There's not as much female
nudity as you might think (or hope for; the actress is very cute) and
no really explicit sex. It's just hilariously lewd and over the top. By
the end she's learned some important things, and it has the kind of
happy ending that maybe it shouldn't but that I usually fall for.It doesn't seem to be getting great reviews here (yet) and I have no
idea why. I was worried that I was laughing so much at certain scenes
that other audience members might be a little annoyed. I guess there's
no accounting for taste. My GF, who's generally a kind of highbrow film
buff, loved it too.
