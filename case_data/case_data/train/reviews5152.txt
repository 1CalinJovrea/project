A truly disturbing masterpiece

Oh the sweet anger of the morons who stumbled into this looking for
another vacuous blockbuster. Finally some revenge for all the promising
sci-fi films lately we've been duped into hoping would be something
interesting.This film is difficult to describe. It is dark, atmospheric,
unsettling, terrifying but utterly captivating. It's tone reminded me
of 2001, although it's even more sparse than that. But that is as good
a reference point as any to get a sense of this film, and it's that
good. Scarlet Johansson is wonderful. The score is perfect and it's
stunningly shot.A truly unique film.
