Painful to Watch, But Still a Couple of Laughs

One thing you can always count on in a Sandler Production is that there
will be a host of familiar faces, and Grown Ups 2 is no exception. This
film does one thing right, lots of cameos, and consistent editing.To be clear, there is no plot to speak of. There is no character
development that endears any one character to you for anything but the
most base reasons. This is an immoral film, that makes no attempts to
conceal that. This is however also some of the most painful cinema to
watch as it blurs the lines between washed up comedians who have run
out of material, and the washed up middle-aged men they portray.It's painfully obvious that the material is either blatantly lifted
from other projects, or just piles of the least successful humour being
inexplicably rehashed again on screen. The genuine laughs in this film
are in very short supply, so if you brave the rest of the film's
nonsense, there are a couple of gems in there to lift your spirits, and
the occaissonal cameo to make it interesting.
