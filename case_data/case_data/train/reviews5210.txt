totally predicted and targeted to the wrong crowd

I don't know where to begin with this. I love action flicks, dramas,
suspense and anything that involves heists, drug stuff or any of that
kind of gist as a movie fan I just love, so this was right up my ally
all the way. More so the main actor I've grown to like, so I thought
this was a slam dunk, shockingly so not true...Honestly I though the plot while fairly straight forward was
telegraphed a mile away and only the mentally challenged doused with a
a six pack, a dose of meth-amphetamines and a broken weegie board could
get confused about. At about a 1/3 of the way into it you start to ask
yourself is anybody not double crossing this guy and is this not
blatantly clear?Far as some redeeming qualities At some points it makes a stab at being
something noteworthy but more or less it's you following the ball along
an easily laid out path which unfortunately makes it rather boring.Final thoughts... I'm blown away, here is a movie which ranks decent
far as every type of movie I should aught to like, so I should have
liked it in almost every sense... In the end I guess me being a father
with young kids of my own or what I don't know but I'm calling BS on
this whole damn gig... I really hope someone with some brains reads
this and hears it. We "guys" who dig on action flicks do so because it
takes us away from reality, not into it. Those of us who may know a
glimpse of that life with families and kids wouldn't even dare take a
step back into that world let alone for some POS brother in law who dug
his own grave. End of game...Bad and telegraphed story, less than memorable performances by all
actors even the main character, and a lukewarm story which left me
rooting for the snobby ship captain because I'd simply seen him in
something else and remember liking either him or his character but not
enough to remember what it was aught to tell you all you need to
know...
