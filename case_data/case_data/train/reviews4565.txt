What is wrong with everyone hating on this amazing comedy?

WOW is all I have to say. I read most of the (negative) reviews and
everyone hating on Will and Amy but I'm unclear what everyone expects -
from Will and Amy?! THIS film was their type of comedy - stupid
enjoyable fun, and they finally pulled it off to perfection! I want to
be clear, although a fan, I'm not a huge fan of either, but they nailed
their roles and the comedy in this film that they redeemed themselves
and I am now a huge fan of both! Nothing Amy has done in the past has
ever made me laugh until now. This is finally the comedy from Will that
I've been waiting for from his earlier days.A bunch of us went to see this and we were in stitches and crying in
laughter - and no, we were not drunk or high! This is the funniest
comedy I've seen this year and for that matter in a long time. It was very well written and directed and actually had an entertaining
(and for a change) different type of story. All the actors were on
point!Props to everyone involved! I really wish I could find out from all you
'supposedly' Will fans what more you all expected?It's the perfect comedy and if anyone thinks this is a fake review,
check out my over 300 reviews and hundreds of ratings!A perfect 10/10 from me and I hope there is a part 2 very soon!
