At this rate I'll have to see all of Ritchie's films

Remembering the TV show, just barely, I remember I liked Illya a little
better than Napoleon. That hasn't changed in this far better version.
This movie is a joy and I either smiled or laughed through the whole
thing. There is no way they're not making a sequel.Guy Ritchie's direction is assured and far more clever and entertaining
than his current rivals. And his eye for casting, assuming it was his
doing, is impeccable. I particularly appreciated Alicia Vikander who
was dreamy enough in Ex Machina. Here she does a little dance in one
scene that went indelibly into my do not erase memory.Cavill and Hammer make an unexpectedly good team. And though I was a
little partial to Hammer's performance, Cavill has a flair for comedy
that I haven't known about. Oddly enough, Hugh Grant who appears
briefly, is a proved asset but seems a little out of place.All in all though this is a fun movie and not to be missed.
