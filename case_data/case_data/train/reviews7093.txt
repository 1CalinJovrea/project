Really?

I honestly don't understand how this has such a great rating. I had
high hopes for this movie and though I didn't expect the movie to be
everything I'd hoped for, I was still really disappointed with what I
saw. The fx were just horrible. Not throughout the whole movie but
enough that it became a problem. Now the acting, what can I say? The
cast was brilliant but they must have not been too excited to do this
movie as their acting skills were just terrible. The only one that did
a decent job was Rachel Weisz. Maybe the reason behind some of the bad
fx was because i didn't see it in 3D, though i sincerely doubt it.
Watch it and get your own opinion on it though.
