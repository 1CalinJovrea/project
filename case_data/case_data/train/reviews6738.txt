A really bad film.

This ridiculous film was unmistakingly one of the worst films i've seen
in 30 years! Kate Winslett needs to return to acting school, she just
isn't very convincing. Here are these two souls who end up in the
snowy, blizzard mountains due to a plane crash and never once did i
hear either of them say "I'm cold". They prance thru the snow so easily
and of course as time goes on they began to give each other goo goo gah
gah looks like teenage heart throbs. It appears it's extremely cold yet
they can hardly wait to jump in the sack. I could hardly wait for this
Clunker to be finished. PLease do not waste your time on this
film....it's absolutely horrible!
