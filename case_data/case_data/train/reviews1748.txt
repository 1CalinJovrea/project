Messes with your mind.

This is a pretty intriguing thriller where a young married couple's
lives are interfered by an awkward high school acquaintance of the
husband's, who leaves gifts to the doorstop multiple times. After he is
shunned by the couple, he gradually taunts the husband and unleashes a
secret about him that threatens their marriage.The plot is pretty fast-paced from start to finish, as the film grabs
your attention almost immediately - from the appearance of awkward
Gordo (Joel Edgerton) to the mind games he plays with Simon (Jason
Bateman), with Simon's wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) caught in the middle
of it all.The acting, though, was a little off as I thought some of the emotions
were campy and the American accents by the Australian actors were
forced. The acting also didn't flow very well and the chemistry between
the character leads were pretty artificial and the character
development was weak.Overall, though, it's not too bad of a thriller. It does get your mind
think and does surprise you in several instances.Grade B-
