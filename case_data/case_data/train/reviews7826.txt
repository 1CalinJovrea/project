just horrible.

first review, and usually don't offer up my opinion like this, but this
movie was a combination of lame screen-writing, a boring story, and
constant bashing of my hometown.the movie's length was interminable, but not as bad as the single woman
sitting in 2 rows in front of me, incessantly laughing by herself at
every non-funny joke.the ending was cute, but by 2 hours i was hoping the romance would end
poorly.I'm looking forward to my next review of a movie i actually....enjoyed.if anyone was interested in moving to Ann arbor, seeing this movie
would ablate any consideration. please...this movie misrepresents
everything about the city...couldn't find a better place to settle,
raise a family and live in a vibrant urban area than Ann arbor..
