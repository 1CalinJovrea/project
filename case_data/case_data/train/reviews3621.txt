This was crap!

The only reason I use my time to write this review is to save others
the hours in their lives of watching it. Every black out is a prayer
for the end. If I were not a true film watcher with the single vow
never to fall asleep in a film I would have been out like a light from
the first words. It's long with no meaning or plot with not storyline
or even a good script. It does not show any true nature of rebellion as
this would have been considered but shows It as the norm of those days
which is not true. Any proper film watcher knows that if timeout likes
a film and give it a good review then it probably deserves to be thrown
away and buried. Here is your challenge, try and stay awake and
interested throughout the whole film!
