Propaganda for making kids insolent

If I could give 0 I would. In this era where USA need more people
willing to go to wars, they need first to make kids insolent, ignorant
and that have only 1 thought - that its OK to hark people... This
propaganda cartoon is showing kids that its OK to do wrong things, that
school and education is bad, teachers and good kids that learn are
caricatured with sinister laughs, so they look bad. At beginning after
they created havoc and chaos in school, they even say "good has triumph
the evil..." putting kids head that being evil and insolent is good...
Total disaster.
