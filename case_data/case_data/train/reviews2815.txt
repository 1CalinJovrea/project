That Awkward Moment: Admitting I Actually Watched This Film

Well, that was a waste of time, and I won't spend any more time than
necessary writing a review of this poorly written, poorly produced, and
poorly acted movie. My first question is: What ever happened to clever
humor? Every so-called joke is sex-based. People cannot even have a
conversation unless it is based on something sexual (Oh, sorry, there
is also some bathroom humor to break the monotony). These are
12-year-olds in thirty-year-old bodies. For some reason that defies all
explanation, girls are attracted to these losers...but, then again,
likes often attract likes. What's worse is that, towards the end, the
director has the audacity to expect us to suddenly take this nonsense
seriously. But, by this time, the only thing the viewers are taking
seriously is a suicide attempt. I watched this so you don't have to.
Don't waste your time on this one. Work on your compost pile. It will
be far more enjoyable.
