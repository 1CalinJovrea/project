Starts well, finishes poorly

Disappointing movie towards the end. Starts off well, everything makes
sense, everything is clever, logical and interesting. After a certain
point in the movie everything becomes ridiculous, unrealistic and not
enjoyable to watch. The idea behind the movie was good, execution was
not. The characters were also a little bit boring in my opinion. The
situation the main character found herself in had an array of
extraordinary things to do and take advantage of but didn't. Not a lot
out of the ordinary happened, main character worrying throughout and
not taking advantage/playing around with the situation she was in. If
you're a fan of logical "what ifs" like myself I would not recommend
it.
