Boring

The movie examines Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) efforts to pass
the 13th Amendment in the last few months of his life. It is a detailed
account of his strategy and the negotiations of the members of his
cabinet, especially his Secretary of State, William Seward (David
Strathairn). The story deals with the minute details involved in making slavery
illegal; conversations between pompous politicians are endless and dry
and I found it boring. I would have preferred a biography of Lincoln's
life; the nonstop speechifying was tedious in the extreme. None of the
dialogue sounded spontaneous; each line sounded well-rehearsed with the
result that it looks like a filmed play.Day-Lewis certainly looks the part, but his Lincoln isn't very
interesting or charismatic. His soft, high voice is particularly
unengaging. I expected his voice to sound like Gregory Peck as Atticus
Finch. For me, the movie was too long and a crashing bore.
