In a word, Lousy.

Usually love Pixar, Toy Story for example, was easy and fun to follow
up on the big screen but Inside Out is a jumble of fast talking
characters, sudden bursts of sound that'll wake you up when you feel
yourself drifting off.This movie is hard to follow, has a very sophisticated theme and so
anyone under 10 probably won't sit through this one.For example there are about a 1/2 a dozen different characters that
represent "feelings" ( anger, sadness, fear etc ) all talking at the
same time in some instances. Then there are the complicated
explanations of long term/short term memory, REM sleep cycles, I mean,
If I were a 5 year old, I wouldn't know what was going on after about
10 mins, I'd be lost.Not to mention that there are long stretches of fast action accompanied
by loud rather jarring music and shrill voices etc.It's a mess of a movie & definitely not for the very young because they
won't understand it, believe me.
