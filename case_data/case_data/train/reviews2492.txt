Somewhat disappointed

I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so
I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass
in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an
amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with
injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I
found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to
the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one
character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When
all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics
purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters
here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin
stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the
portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous,
and inappropriately "human", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always
more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies,
whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue
with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort
seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters,
and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba)
to distract from the general lack of substance.All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but
would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the
voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in
biker leathers and latex.
