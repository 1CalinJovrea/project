Contains spoiler! What the hXXX is this?!?!

I wasn't sure whether to watch "Annabelle" or "The Maze Runner" and the
only reason I chose this one was because it got higher rating than the
other. Didn't expect much of it and assumed it would be a little
childish just by looking at the poster, ie, my expectations were not
high to begin with. But seriously, how can such a crappy movie like
this get a rating above 7 ?? The beginning of the film went okey (not
good, just okey). The first 20~30 minutes, I watched expecting to see
what would come next. But then gradually, my impression of the movie
was; "Seriously?" "What the heck!!" "They've got to be kidding!" "Is it
just going to get worse?" "Can it get anymore tedious and stupid?" "Oh,
gosh it's just ridiculous!" "What kind of moron made this??" (by two
thirds of the movie, I started looking around to see if I could find
the exit just to walk out)The story was so~~ poorly plotted that nothing really made sense.
Except for the first 20~30 minutes, it just got worse and worse.I wonder whether this movie was made just to reuse or recycle the left-
over props of the movie "Alien" and some other crappy movies(not that
Alien was bad) because there was absolutely nothing new or original
about the grievers or whatever stupid looking monsters they were. The
person whoever made this movie must have an intellectual quotient below
two digits! Total waste of time and money.
