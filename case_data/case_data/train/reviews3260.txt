An Acting Clinic ... and a Great Film

Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine put on an acting clinic.Bridges at 66 has enough swagger, 'tude and testosterone to be an
action figure.Pine, always reliable as a A-lister, takes his craft to a whole new
level. He is as far from Captain Kirk as the earth is from the moon.
Superb work. And unforgettable.The script is to die for. Intelligent to a degree that makes you wonder
aloud how the constant stream of B and C movies out of Hollywood ever
get funded. Solid from the first line of dialog to the last.West Texas is the unbilled co-star. You feel like you are there.One of the best releases of the year.
