Great little Revenge horror flick.

This film starts of quite well and gets you involved in the story from
the beginning. It was made by the Soska twin sisters and it tells the
story of a medical student trying to work her way to becoming a great
surgeon. But as she finds out there are people who like to take
advantage of you when you are trying to make ends meet. It stars
Katharine Isabelle (GINGER SNAPS) and she plays the role of medical
student Mary Mason very well. The Soska twins have a little role each
in the film also. I did like the story and how it moves along and some
of the scenes are quite cringe worthy. The plot has a revenge element
to it and you understand why Mary ends up doing what she does. This
would have to be one of the Soska's better movies to date in my
opinion. A great little horror flick. I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10.
