all rather boring

almost fell asleep in this film. cardboard characters, little or no
plot except the obvious. 3d effects unimpressive and cannot understand
why others rate it so highly.no excitement at all. the only person who
may have been of interest was Doug the postman. why not build the film
around him - he'd tried and failed 3 times before so how did he fail,
what's his continuing motivation other than the obvious and where does
a postman get the money to climb? that's how i would have approached
the story. also Rob the leader says near the beginning that his
decision is final and if they have to turn back it is his decision. but
as soon as Doug starts whining he allows him to continue when
conditions (the weather and Doug's) are so clearly against a successful
summit bid. also the women in the film are an unnecessary distraction
and have no real bearing on the story. at the end i couldn't have cared
less who lived or died - just wanted to get home for a cup of tea.
