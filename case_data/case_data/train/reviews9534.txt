A refreshing take

I found The Spectacular now to be a very refreshing movie to watch.
We've all seen the coming of age high school romance blahblahblah thing
before, but the film takes you where you didn't expect it to go, and
that is one of the qualities that makes it a great experience.Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are fantastic, particularly Woodley.
I don't know how you can't be a fan of Teller, he is his usual self in
this one and adds even more depth to himself. Woodley's as real as it
gets in her performance. I didn't notice it until my second viewing in
terms of how natural she was, but she was terrific.Those two are already great to cast as leads, but it's always fun when
the casting for anything is just all around fantastic. Tamper your
expectations a bit because it's all about the leads in this one, but
Coach Taylor, Bubbles, and Saul Goodman are great in the limited time
they are on screen. I mean, Kyle Chandler, Andre Royo, and Bob
Odenkirk.The emotional impact of this film really hit me towards the end, and
certain factors are very predominant in the movie that you definitely
do not expect. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say take away a lot
of the laughs you were expecting, and brace yourself for the feels and
a very serious tone. This may damper some who came for this because
it's from the dudes who did 500 Days of Summer, but It's still very
good and the movie is actually funny in the spots it wants to be.Overall, I think this is absolutely a film you want to see. Where the
story goes widens the appeal of this movie by far in my opinion, so if
you were just not going to see it or judged it by the trailers, don't.
Give it a shot.
