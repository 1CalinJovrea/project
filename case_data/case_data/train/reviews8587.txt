Mediocrity

I was a fan of Wahlberg and Ferrell's last outing The Other Guys and
thought that this movie could also be decent. The plot is something we
have seen hundreds of times before, but it could still deliver on some
laughs. Sadly, I was wrong as this turned out to be another mediocre
comedy for Ferrell and another comedic bomb for Wahlberg.Good: Every once in a while there is a joke that works. Hannibal Buress
who delivers some dry lines works and is my personal highlight.
Wahlberg and Ferrell do work hard and it comes across that they really
get along with each other.Bad: The humor just doesn't work for the whole movie. It is all typical
confrontational humor that results in very little laughs. It just all
reeks of mediocrity making the movie a dull experience. Linda
Cardellini is just there to react to the constant fighting and nothing
else. It just doesn't stand out in any way.Overall, there are better Wahlberg and Ferrell comedies out there. A
talented cast reduced to lackluster gags and little in the way of any
laughs or memorable scenes. Something that you will forget within four
hours after you watch it.
