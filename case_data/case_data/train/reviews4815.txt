An instant classic

A movie which oozes Britishness from every frame, The Imitation Game is
an instant classic. Wartime Britain is depicted vividly, if a little
caricatured, with an autumnal palette and a jaunty air.A true story, sympathetically told, with good performances all round
and a stand-out Turing from the indefatigable Mr Cumberbatch. The young
Turing is also extremely well realised by Alex Lawther.Meandering through Alan Turing's life since school until shortly before
his death, the script demands your attention and regularly makes you
smile.Highly recommended.
