I just finished watching world's eighth and ninth wonders!

The most damage to the movie is done by the totally unbelievable events
and things appear in the storyline. It should be the eighth wonder in
the world for a person whose leg is so damaged to walk hundreds of
miles in freezing snow and finally reach a human settlement. Funnily,
they find all the necessary medicine, moonboots, surgical equipment and
all that in the plane or wasted snow land! And food never seemed to be
a problem to survive weeks while they start fires in a flicker in that
freezing icy land ! Haha How Kate kills a snow tiger with a flare gun
like an Olympian best shot is next to the ninth wonder! How childish if
the director thought we believe all that crap? Only silver line is the music of Ramin Djawadi that is so soothing and
beautiful. The cadence between the piano and cellos so amazingly
captures the fluttering melancholy of lonely and isolated souls
struggling to survive. And the cinematography is equally beautiful
catching few of the best snow land shots I've ever seen in a movie.
Editing is smart and credible.Totally wasted talents from Kate and Idris, both excellent actors who
struggle to give the best but fail miserably due to a weak storyline
and a screenplay.
