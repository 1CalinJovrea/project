Unimpressed

I liked the idea of this movie but it failed to keep me interested. The
relationship is unrealistic and there is zero chemistry between Jake
and Lainey. Actually, there's a lack of chemistry between any of the
characters (exception being the banter between Jake's co-worker and his
wife after the end and before rolling credits). There were a couple of
things that actually annoyed me. For example, Lainey's complete
ignorance about masturbation, orgasm and female anatomy in general
(even though she was pre-med undergrad and was eventually admitted to
med school). Even if that were plausible, it's doubtful that some
serial cheating (borderline misogynistic) narcissist would be the one
to show her how to climax. Finally, it's odd that he tags along with
her into the fitting room of a lingerie boutique for conversation. I
have male friends and that just doesn't happen. I don't want to pick
this apart but I can't spare the obvious for the sake a being
entertained by a rom-com for 120 mins.
