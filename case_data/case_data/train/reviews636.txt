Lackluster

I went into the movie with high expectations after having read the book
in high school. I absolutely loved the book and always imagined it to
be a certain way. While some aspects of the film met my expectations in
terms of visual delivery and execution of the novel, a lot of it did
not. There were many scenes that I would have loved to see but were not
included. As a film on its own, I found some of the acting to be lacking in
emotions and conviction. I did enjoy Meryl Streep and the Giver, but
the rest were very average. Some parts of the film felt slightly
rushed, missing out on the true essence and meaning it could have
conveyed. I did not feel as indulged in the film as I was in the book.
Perhaps this was because I loved the book very much, but I feel it was
also because the film lacked passion and depth. The overall message and
meaning behind the story was not adequately conveyed as important
scenes were not emphasized on and were rushed. Jonas's character
development happened too quickly and we could not create a connection
with any of the characters in the film. Overall, I found the film to be average. Those that have read the book
will find it to be below expectations whereas others may enjoy it for
the concept and meaning it attempts to convey.
