Supernatural tale of the necessity of evil with great action

Dracula Untold is a story about the necessity of evil.An ex-soldier Dracula was renowned for his brutality in warfare,
something he justified due to the terror he inflicted in his enemies
resulted in their surrender rather than death. This difficult choice,
that a man must become evil and inhuman to ultimately defeat an even
greater evil is the focus of the story.An even more subversive idea is the worship of evil by men due to the
power it holds. Something which ensures it will never die.These ideas breath new life into the Dracula tale and vampire myth in
general.
