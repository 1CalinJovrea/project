Not worthy of all the praise

This is highly overrated. This is nowhere near as good as critics say
it is. 1 star for the little girl.The X-MEN series has always been filled with continuity errors. The
first 3 movies were pretty consistent. Then there were prequels telling
stories that contradict the old trilogy. Hey! Remember Mystique? She is
said to be of the same age with Charles Xavier in the prequels, whereas
in the old trilogy, well...Also, the franchise has never been consistent in style. Most of the
previous X-MEN movies are PG-13, quite typical for Marvel movies. This
time it is R. However, there is not much difference, only more blood
but not by much.The story does not make sense here and there. For example, had they
shot the enemy instead of keeping him alive and attempting to dump him
in the middle of nowhere, they could have avoided a lot of trouble
later on. The Wolverine died saving a bunch of little mutant shitheads
nobody cares about, who later on stood over his tomb, exchanging weird
glances and as Laura quoted from an old movie, they seemed to be
thinking, "What the F..K is she babbling about?" Clearly they haven't
seen the old movie. Not to mention that the whole "Save Laura"
Operation was based on a nurse who read lots of comic books. Who wrote
the books?The movie educates us: 1. Never let the enemy off easily. 2. Never
trust the comic books.
