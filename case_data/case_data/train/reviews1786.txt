Another royal love story or social statement?

On the surface, this movie is exactly what the title says, you have an
unhappily married queen who has an affair under the king's nose with
someone in the King's court. However, the interesting aspect of this
story is the context. It is the second half of the 18th century,
liberal ideals of people like Rousseau and Voltaire spread across
Europe, and threatens to break down the old Feudalistic regime.The movie is not a documentary on the ruling of Christian the VII, and
should not be regarded as such. After seeing it, I went to read about
Christian the VII, and found that many details of the era and his
regime were omitted in favor of not making a long tiresome movie.
Instead the movie focuses on the relationships between the king, the
queen and the physician and to their attempt to change the face of
Denmark.These three characters are played beautifully. Mikkel Boe FÃ¸lsgaard as King Christian is just superb and fun to watch,
as a mad king he is always there even when not the focus of the camera.Mads Mikkelsen as the physician acts for the most part as a calm yet
stern person, however, when he does display emotions it has greater
impact, and in my view portraits inner-struggle more effectively. Alicia Vikander as the queen plays her two role quite well, whether it
is the passion and stress that go with having a secret affair, or the
audacity and charm that goes with fulfilling her royal duties.Finally, in my view, the movie is another bell ring to remind us that
even Denmark, 300 years ago was a country consumed by religion and
fear, and that there are always those who believe in such a way of
life.
