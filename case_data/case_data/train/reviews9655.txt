Reasonably entertaining

While this film isn't very popular among critics I found it to be
reasonably entertaining but completely forgettable. In fact, I have
watched it a few months ago and I barely remember the plot now.
Overall, I found it a solid film for the crowds. Solid entertainment
for the masses. It doesn't reach the heights of the first film (which
weren't that high) but it doesn't fall as low as MIB 2, which sucked,
big time. This one is more solid and well executed.So what can I say about it? Well, I liked that the villain always said:
"Let's agree to disagree." Which is the most memorable thing in the
film.
