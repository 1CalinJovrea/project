Enjoyable Family Movie

This Annie remake was great! I have two small girls who love both
renditions of Annie. For me, I actually enjoy this remake a little more
because Ms. Hannigan's verses and character is more kid viewer
appropriate. My girls are 5 & 6 so I cringe when Carol Burnett says,
"Oochie Coochie," in one of her songs. The original will always be a
classic. Punjab and Rooster are irreplaceable. But even without them
this remake was awesome. The entire Theatre clapped at this performance
and I left out with a very proud feeling. The cast was great, but
Jamiee Foxx really put a smile on my face. I'm proud of his career and
so glad he's able to represent African- American men in a positive
light, especially during this time. Bravo!!!! Bravo to you all!!!
