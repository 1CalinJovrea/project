Better than I Expected

When a sniper shoots randomly five victims, Detective Emerson (David
Oyelowo) finds evidence to incriminate the former paranoid marine James
Barr (Joseph Sikora). It is an easy case for the prosecutor Rodin
(Richard Jenkins), but Barr refuses to sign the confession and he calls
Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). When he is transported to prison in a bus,
the other prisoners beat him and Barr goes to the hospital in coma. The pacifist attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), who is the daughter
of the prosecutor, decides to defend him but Jack Reacher is a former
marine investigator that left the army and has become an unknown
drifter. Out of the blue, Jack appears in the city and Helen invites
him to work for her investigating the case. Soon he finds that the Barr
is innocent and there is a conspiracy behind the murders where the
apparent culprit is the scapegoat."Jack Reacher" is an action movie better than I expected. The plot is
intriguing but as usual the ego of Tom Cruise spoils the movie. There
are unbearable scenes but maybe the worst scenes are Jack Reader going
unarmed to face the gang of killers in the stone quarry and when he
drops his weapon to fight against Charlie while Helen is prisoner of
the bad guys. Then he easily executes The Zec in a lack of consistency
in his behavior. Last but not the least: Why not Gerard Butler in the
lead role? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Jack Reacher: O Ãšltimo Tiro" ("Jack Reacher: The Last
Shot")
