Awful

Absolutely, truly dreadful "re-imagining" of this film. The original
came close to the Steven King book - this is truly trash and I can
hardly believe that Julianne Moore consented to be in it.There was none of the original feeling of Sue's sympathy nor the
feeling that Tommy really liked Carrie. And where was the evil Billy?
Every single character was eminently forgettable.I suppose money is money, though.People, please don't waste your time with this. It is the worst King
adaptation I have ever seen. There is loads of material from the best
horror writer the word has ever seen - and we are offered this dross.
Watch the original: it's not perfect but it's miles ahead of this
rubbish.
