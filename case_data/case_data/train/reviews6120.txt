Umm... How did THAT happen?

Among the worst directed big budget features in recent years, Les
Miserables suffers from so many problems it's hard to choose where to
begin.I suppose the most annoying item is the hand-held camera shoved up the
actors' noses. This unfortunate choice simultaneously throws every
performance into melodramatic overdrive while also insuring the
audience a nauseatingly claustrophobic roller coaster ride inches from
the casts' lens-distorted features.Next up would have to be the uneven performances within the musical
numbers. This is not a critique of the actors or their singing, but of
the director's choice to not guide them toward performances scaled for
the shots. There's a difference between belting out a musical show-tune
to the back row or coming in on a close up to capture the moment which
requires a quieter more internal thought. And if you're going to play
those moments very wide or very close, hone the performance to suit the
choice. Too often the performance is out of sync with the shot.Next, focus. In today's world of monitors, DITs and playback, there is
no excuse for so much of this film to be out of focus. I don't care if
your depth of field is two millimeters. Go back and get it right or
pump some more light on the subject and find a depth of field and lens
your AC is comfortable with.Then there are creative choices like playing Lovely Ladies strictly for
the ugliness of the nineteenth century gutter it's set in and Master of
the House with so little energy that not even SB Cohen can elevate it.I am not sure what film all those ten star reviews on this IMDb page
are for. I can only hope that they were written by people who loved the
musical and lived in hope that the film would live up to its legacy,
but haven't seen it yet.As for me, I have seen it and am bitterly disappointed.
