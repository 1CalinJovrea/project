The Empire Strikes Back of animated movies

~NO SPOILERS~How to Train your Dragon 2 is a shining example of what both family
movies and animated films are capable of. This is not the same story
rehashed over again. From the characters, to the drama, to the action,
to the comedy, this film does what any sequel should do by stepping up
its predecessor in every way possible, and respects its audience enough
not to shy away from its darker and more dramatic content, but still
remain viewable and entertaining for all audiences. We are talking
about a PG rated Dreamworks film after all. From the moment the music began playing during the beginning to when
the end credits began roiling, I was completely immersed in this
phenomenal movie that is more than worthy to stand along side the likes
of any great live-action fantasy film or the past decade. Possibly one
the the best animated movies I have ever seen, this is the Empire
Strikes Back of animated films. 9/10 (Very possibly will increase to 10/10 upon my second viewing.)
