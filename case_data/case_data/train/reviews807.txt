Awful movie

Awfully horrible movie. It starts with unreal characters. Panama's part
is nothing but a handful of clich√©s. Specially Diego Luna's character.
He plays the usual Latino crazy gangsta but he ain't pulling it off
this time. Also the triangle between Whalberg, Beskinsale and Foster is
beyond credibility. Not a 5 year old could buy it. I didn't know the
director but I read he's from Iceland. Maybe he should think about
leaving Hollywood and going back to Iceland's lingering movie scene.
The producer has got his quota of failure. Getting helicopters, big
boats and an uncommon location doesn't gives you an action flick. A 100
minutes video clip with dreadful performances and lousy photography.
Avoid it.
