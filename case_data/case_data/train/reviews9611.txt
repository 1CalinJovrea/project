The not so fantastic 4

Imagine the worst superhero movie you've ever seen. Then forget it
because this is by far the worst. When I heard they were doing a remake
I thought " this could definitely work". You see the old movies from 05
and 07 was in my opinion somewhat dull and half decent. But all the
flaws from there suddenly seemed to pale when I saw the remake.30 minutes in I found myself staring at a bird outside the window, and
that was more interesting than the actual movie. Then 15 minutes or
something later something finally happened. Our heroes teleports to
this alternate dimension and they got there powers and etc etc. The
INCREDIBLY SLOW pace is a major problem with this movie.Then there's the casting. I've seen some things that these actors have
don previously, before this. Kate Mara in House of Cards for example.
And however good they were there it was zero chemistry here. Then of
course there is Hollywood back at it again with the political
correctness. I don't consider myself a huge comic-book fan, but every
one who has ever heard of Fantastic 4 knows that Johnny and Sue Storm
are brother and sister and therefore the flame is not black.There is nothing wrong with a director who wants to do his own
interpitation of a comic-book series, but changing something as
fundamental as this is never a good idea. Compared to this, the old
movies seem good.
