Piercing Silence

The experience is extraordinary from different reasons. Martin Scorsese
with a legendary career behind him breaks new ground with the fierce
and renewed passion. A film made for the love of film not for box
office expectations. A work of love from beginning to end. Then, Andrew
Garfield. What a year for this young spectacular actor. The kindness in
his eyes made the journey so personal for me. I must say that I've been
very lucky because I've been lead by my mentor (another Martin by the
way)into the world of Scorsese. I found Scorsese's films brilliant yes,
but too dark, too violent and hopeless and my mentor said, "No, don't
stay in the periphery, go in. You'll see Martin Scorsese's films are
religious experiences" Well I got in, I saw, I felt, I understood and
as a consequence I wept for most of Silence. Thank you Marty and Martin
from the bottom of my heart.
