Misunderstood and actually brilliant!

Let me lay my cards out there straightaway. I'm a 31 year old bloke,
married with two kids, who loves films and music. I'm also an officer
in the military. And I love this film. I Ioved the first film, and this one builds on it. But you have to
appreciate that the film is based around college. For anyone that's
actually been to college they should have experienced
parties/people/incidents replicated in this film. I don't really
understand why people show so much disdain for the 'childish' humour!That aside...Hats off to Elizabeth Banks for her directorial debut, you'd never know
there was any change from the first film. And her inserts with John
Michael Higgins are excellent, if you take them at face value for
exactly what they are intended to be; humour! And pretty sexist,
misogynistic humour!Anna Kendrick is, as always, stunning (yes, the wife knows!) and simply
brilliant. Shows just how much of an actress she is having improvised
almost half her lines and proves once again that she can actually sing
(albeit that the singing is not on set and pre-recorded).The rest of the cast is brilliant and it's nice to see a little more of
Esther Dean actually singing/rapping rather than her usual producing. Hailee Steinfeld has stepped in seamlessly. I don't think we saw enough
of Rebel Wilson though, reckon there'll be a few deleted scenes that
didn't make it. Good to see a lot of humour applied to the Ashley/Jessica situation
(unless you know the film you won't get this). The final song was actually very good. Maybe not as unexpected as the
first film but brilliant with an original start and an excellent
surprise at the end that I think added a very personal and moving
touch. It will be a shame if the franchise is over!
