One of the best movies this year

At first I didn't want to see this movie because of some political
remarks made by Jamie Foxx and Samuel Jackson, two of my previously
favorite actors, but Quintin Tarentino is a great director, so I broke
down and saw it. Glad I did. This was absolutely one of the best movies
of the year. Although Jamie Foxx has top billing, this film would not
have been anywhere as good without Christoph Waltz. He stole every
scene he was in. Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery. Leo was
great too. Lots of blood, something expected in most of Quintins
movies, but a great story. Also expect to hear the N word about 2000
times. Cristoph Waltz should get the Oscar for his performance. Should
get nominated for best picture. This is absolutely a must see.
