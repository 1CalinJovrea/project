Deep, surprising and well done

Suite Française sounds like an overused plot that one can predict from
a mile away but it's not. The story's not another version of Romeo and
Juliet's impossible love. It's subtle, sweet, and smart because it
makes you think - just a little bit don't worry - about morals, values,
and ideologies our own and that of the ones we love. The film is about
a blooming love story but a complicated one. Lucile & Bruno's longing and desire for each other doesn't get
frustrating or outrageously déjà vu, it only adds another flavor, to
the many, in the film. It contrasts well with Celine's (Margot Robbie)
lack of restraint on her urges. It begs the question on ideologies and
desire, when do they impede each other? No one is just one dimensional
in this film, you see the good, the bad, and questionable in every one.
Ambivalence is the key word in this film, conflicting emotions and
ideologies is in the center of this story.The storytelling is just amazing, layered with subtlety and beauty, it
carries you through every step of the way like musical notes played on
the piano. The ensemble cast is great, all of the characters have some
kind of layers to them, each of them memorable in their own way,
without ever making the film crowded or hard to follow. Kristin Scott
Thomas embodies the devotion her character has, Michelle Williams fits
the role perfectly she has this quite strength that Lucile needs, and
Matthias Schoenaerts really is the prince in the big bad wolf suit or
vice versa.Suite Française is a captivating and poignant story that has an equally
emotive roots, the film surprised me. @wornoutspines
