Dark and Scary

2014 has been a pretty week year for horror movies..until clown! This
movie has it all! Great effects, acting, story, makeup, unintentional
humor, and most of all, its scary! Most horror movies people act pretty
stupid, in clown they act believable. The thought of unable to take off
a costume is scary. Its unclear if he can go to the bathroom, but we
hear his stomach grumbling quite a bit.Its hilarious when Stormware's character says "Oh sh--!" b/c the clown
is waking up from being drugged too quickly. The death of the pet dog
is a great effect as well as scary. The effects of the Father turning
into a clown are great. All the actors did a great job.I'm not sure why this didn't get a wide release at the theaters. Maybe
because its very dark. But if your into scary, dark horror movies then
sit back and enjoy. A movie like this has been long overdue.
